The Prague Stock Exchange falls into a negative position against the closing of the business.
After the steep fall in the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange was able to correct the losses.
Transactions with the shares of <0xC4><0x8C>EZ reached almost half of the normal day-to-day business.
At the beginning of Tuesday’s business, the Prague Stock Exchange began to collapse on Monday, when it dropped by another six percentage points.
This time there was a reason for the burglary on Wall Street.
In the Czech Republic, too, the reaction of the market to the outcome of the vote of the American House of Representatives, which had refused to support a stabilisation plan for the financial sector there.
Fall of shares in Asia
A dramatic case experienced on Tuesday the stocks on the stock exchanges in Asia, although the indices were able to offset some of the losses over the course of the day.
The index of the Hang Seng Stock Exchange in Hong Kong lost nearly four percentage points during the business day, but was later able to recover some of the losses, thus reducing the decline to about 2.5 percent.
The index Hang Seng China Enterprises, which observes the movement of Chinese shares on the Hong Kong stock exchange, fell by 3.8 percent, in Shanghai the markets were closed.
Stocks on the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than five percent, but then reduced losses to 4.3 percent.
The Taiwan Stock Exchange fell by 3.6 percent according to its index.
“The timing for the rescue operation in the U.S. is uncertain and will affect the financial markets worldwide,” said Hong Kong’s chief monetary authority Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong, although it belongs to China, determines its monetary policy itself, i.e. independent of the Chinese central bank.
Interest rates in Hong Kong are at the same level as those in the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, American lawmakers should return to the negotiating table as soon as possible and adopt the draft to support the financial system.
Otherwise, other countries would also be affected by the burglary.
A Bloodbath of American Stocks
The U.S. House of Representatives on Monday rejected the plan to support the financial system, for which up to $700 billion (nearly 12 trillion K<0xC4><0x8D>) should be spent.
The lawmakers ignored President George Bush’s call to support the plan.
Bush’s view is that the plan would regulate the root causes of the financial crisis and thus help stabilize the entire economy.
The American stocks experienced a bloodbath on Monday, and the main stock indices recorded the largest collapse in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones Index fell by almost seven percent, a similar collapse it had last recorded in 1987.
The index had already fallen before the vote, but there were hardly any signs that the draft in the House of Representatives would not pass, the index experienced a free fall.
U.S. government to pump $700 billion into banks
The top representatives of the U.S. Congress and the government of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form of an agreement on financial aid to the U.S. financial system.
This will be agreed at the beginning of next week.
American lawmakers made a breakthrough in talks about the adoption of a rescue plan in the form of a financial aid to the American financial system in the amount of $700 billion (about 12 trillion kroner).
However, this does not mean a victory yet.
Congressmen have to negotiate some details of the agreement before they are allowed to publish the final version of the law and vote on it.
The plan to support the financial system will be negotiated in the U.S. Congress on Monday.
On Sunday, the Chairman of the Committee on Banking and Financial Services, Barney Frank, told Reuters.
According to the Senate, different figures could probably be voted on the plan at the earliest on Wednesday.
According to economists, a communication that the plan is being adopted should be the first significant psychological factor for a revival of financial markets.
After that, however, there is a "frustration" due to the complicated mechanisms that could also help the markets in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made significant progress.
We have clarified our different views on what a package to stabilize the market should look like,” said Democrat Nancy Pelosi.
According to her words, there could be a final vote on Sunday.
Representatives of the legislators met with US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson on Sunday night to give the government fund its final form.
It provides for the purchase of unsaleable mortgage assets by financial companies, which plunge financial firms into heavy losses and jeopardise the stability of the entire system.
“We are on the verge of a definitive agreement on a plan that will work and that must be effective in the market.
You have to continue with the health plan, but I think we're on target," Paulson said.
A signal for Asian business
The global financial crisis is also clearly reflected in the stock markets that are falling sharply.
According to Nevada Democratic Senator Harry Reid, legislators are trying to reach a final agreement before Sunday in Congress.
This is to reassure investors of transactions in Asian financial markets, which are in the first time zone where a congressional decision could affect business on Monday.
However, it is not yet clear when both chambers of the American Congress will vote on the law, nor is there any clarity as to whether the negotiations at the last minute could not yet fail to solve a problem.
The legislators hope that it will be passed in the next few days.
But the law will see some changes.
The total amount intended to assist the system shall be divided into two parts.
The initial $350 billion is expected to be made available as soon as possible, as President George Bush called for.
Congress can, however, block the distribution of the remaining money if it has the impression that the program does not perform its function, at another $100 billion and later the final $350 billion.
Bush Positively Appreciates Progress in Negotiations
The president has a veto right in this decision, but Congress can override his veto.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the program has remained, based on obtaining finance for the purchase of bad mortgage securities, the value of which has fallen, because hundreds of thousands of Americans are no longer able to repay their mortgages.
"We worked everything out.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the law on Sunday, then the Senate on Monday," Republican Senator Judd Gregg said.
The American President Bush was also pleased with the progress.
His spokesman Tony Fratto said Bush was satisfied with Saturday’s progress and “appreciates the two-sided effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy.”
Limitation of golden parachutes
The chairman of the banking committee of Senate Christopher Dodd, the chief negotiator, said the legislators had agreed on a responsibility for the money program, protecting taxpayers from losses, closing benefits, and a schedule for funding the plan.
The new law is also intended to limit the so-called golden parachutes for directors of companies involved in the programme and to set up a committee to oversee the fund.
This is to be headed by the Ministry of Finance.
“We have worked very hard on this and made great progress towards an agreement that works and is important for the market and for all Americans,” Paulson said.
The plan also expects help for homeowners who have problems repaying their mortgage.
The government should negotiate new installments at mortgages it buys, with the goal of lowering the monthly cost to debtors and allowing them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological assistance
The proposed plan is a good idea according to the chief economist of Patria Finance David Marek, but implementation will be very difficult.
“And that’s because you don’t know by what mechanism and at what price the problematic assets are bought up.
This will be crucial to how the financial sector and the government divide the losses among themselves,” Marek told the iHNed.cz server this week.
Whether the plan will be adopted now or early next week is not decisive in Marek’s view.
"It is much more important that Congress members agree to support the plan and that they adopt it as soon as possible.
The psychological significance of the agreement on adoption is the most important thing at this moment,” Marek said.
Duel on knife cutting edge: MP3 player against mobile phones.
We will advise you on your choice
While almost any mobile phone can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can still make phone calls.
So, of course, it looks like it’s better to just buy a phone.
However, there are plenty of reasons why you should play an independent player.
The choice depends entirely on the type of use and the claims of the future owner.
It’s hard to buy a great expensive record player at home to listen to Maxim Turbulenc’s latest album.
Once such musical novelties do not appear on LPs, and from a qualitative point of view there is no objective reason for this either.
However, if you have LPs with art rock, jazz or blues on the shelf, you’re probably dreaming of at least one.
This is also the case with music while traveling, i.e. with compressed music, expressed in a simplified way - music in MP3 format.
Here, too, there are price and quality categories.
For one, it may not be acceptable to spend eight thousand crowns on a player, but a Pink-Floyd fan will probably hardly be able to buy headphones for twenty crowns from the market.
Two extremes, between which there is enough space for everyone.
The selection is wide-ranging.
The battery life is also crucial.
Some good music players can play much more than just music, but what mobile phones can do, they don’t even make sense.
No modern device is as universal as the phone.
In addition to the primary functions, the phone and the Sims, it can play music and videos, record both, it sometimes has a better, sometimes a worse camera, and maybe even navigate.
And if you still include the smartphones and communicators, you have almost a small computer in your pocket.
It's a little miracle, because no fridge can grill and no TV can photograph.
But the universality of mobile phones also brings disadvantages.
However, the more features you use on your phone, the more often you will have to reload it.
And playing music is one of the biggest energy eaters.
Few mobile phones can play music for longer than ten or twelve hours, usually it is much less.
In this respect, music players (especially the simplest ones) are significantly more powerful.
That’s why you should expect cheap phones to not be able to play music for more than a few hours.
If you’re still on the phone from time to time, you’d rather buy a charger for the office – this also applies to more expensive devices.
With MP3 players, you won’t have this problem, even the less good ones will last at least 9 hours of uninterrupted operation at once charging.
There is another problem when you want to play the music on your phone.
Unfortunately, only a small part of the devices have a USB port, and not every mobile phone can be connected directly to a PC without special software.
Of course, you can transfer the music directly to a storage medium, but only a few card readers are finished without reduction with the tiny memory cards that are used in mobile phones.
For players, you do not need any special software except for exceptions (iPod).
You only need to feed the device via USB port with music from your PC.
Most phones and players create a music library themselves, ordered by the name of the performer, the title of the album, the genre or, for example, the rating by users.
Some devices only represent the tree structure of the address directory, similar to Windows Explorer, some can do both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
Players are easier to use, mobile phones can be more
When choosing a specific device, you should inquire in particular about the life of the battery, the storage capacity, the quality and the type of sound and of course also the ease of use.
If your music is a backdrop for you and you only listen to it every day for a short time, for example in the tram, then any cell phone that plays MP3 files is enough.
What almost every cell phone can do.
You also don’t have to specifically control which music formats a mobile phone or a player can process.
MP3 create all of them, and most of the music you get will be in that format right now.
The format is one of the most common, and most devices can also play music in WMA format.
Less common is AAC (a format that Apple and its iPods use).
Better mobile phones also allow the purchase of music online.
You only need to access the corresponding pages of a provider (or another provider) via mobile Internet, and you can already purchase a song or album.
This service can be a compelling argument on its own as to why you should buy a music phone.
Unfortunately, the offer of the providers is poor and usually only limited to fast radio hits.
Prices are also not the lowest.
In general, however, it is assumed that this kind of selling of music (whether via GSM, Internet or wireless Internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
The cell phone carries most of them.
If you want to listen to something, grab the phone in the jacket pocket while the player is at home forgotten.
However, it depends on whether you are wearing headphones or at least one wireless hands-free device.
If not, you can rely on the built-in speaker that has almost any phone, but only the fewest MP3 players.
The biggest advantage of the music handsets is likely to be in the price for many.
The cheapest ones usually cost less than three thousand crowns.
For three and four thousand crowns you already get a very decent walkman.
The biggest handicap for most people will be that there are no normal headphones.
The best and most technically sophisticated phones with a 3.5mm opening for normal headphones cost up to fifteen thousand crowns.
The advantage of the players in turn lies in the easy operation.
The simplest - and not necessarily cheapest (see selection) - player can really serve anyone.
A minimum of functions, similarity in operation to the previously normal cassette recorder or, for example, the turntable is obvious.
There is no threat of collision in the form of an erroneously employed mobile internet and a subsequently horrendous bill for data transmissions.
Which device should you reach for?
Also the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for interchangeable storage media (type M2, microSD, etc.).
Even if you buy a corresponding card, two thousand crowns are enough.
But be careful.
Basic models usually only support cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB.
Only the most expensive can read 8GB memory cards.
If you already have a mobile phone and want to buy an inexpensive MP3 player, then grab Cowon, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB), you do not have to put more than 1100 crowns on the table.
Be one of the more demanding listeners, prefer specialized phones - Walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some of Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have stand-alone control buttons for MP3, and the ease of use thus reaches the one of a single MP3 player.
Sony Ericsson, whose Walkman series phones have the same user interface as the individually sold MP3 players.
The same services in the same price category of up to four thousand crowns, but with a higher storage capacity (up to 16 GB) and a long battery life (usually 15 hours, maximum up to 35 hours) afford you MP3 players from the above manufacturers.
The first virtual provider is already coming to the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe
The mobile phone market in the Czech Republic is quite mature, the Czech providers offer virtually all services, as they are also offered by their partners in Western Europe.
Nevertheless, something is missing here - a virtual provider that forces the classic at lower prices.
Maybe it won’t wait long.
That the Czech mobile service providers are among the most expensive in Europe at all, we have already reported on Mobil.cz many times.
By the way, this was also confirmed by the telecommunications authority <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>, which noted that the price of an SMS is higher here than in the rest of the European Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission in the regulation of roaming charges, there is likely to be a paradox - for some customers of Czech mobile providers, text messages from abroad will be cheaper than at home.
Why are prices so high in the Czech Republic compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is a lack of competition that really makes a battle announcement.
Perhaps it sounds paradoxical, in the Czech Republic there are three mobile networks and a penetration of far more than 100%.
On the other hand, mobile operators like to complain that there is an extreme amount of competition in the Czech market.
The Chairman of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Authority (<0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>) Pavel Dvo<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xA1>k, who had often stated in the past that there was no room for another provider in the Czech Republic.
It is likely that a classic provider with its own network will no longer have a lot of chances (by the way, it would probably hardly find any frequencies).
However, there is still a possibility - a virtual provider.
Especially the entry of virtual providers into the mobile phone market resulted in a significant price reduction, which the classic mobile phone providers then had to react to.
Prior to the entry into the market of companies such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile, there were similar votes in the UK as in the Czech Republic.
However, it has been shown that there is room for such providers and that they can really be successful.
By the way, you don’t have to look for examples for long.
In February we reported on the launch of the virtual provider Mobilking in Poland.
In just half a year, this provider succeeded in attracting more than 100 thousand customers and thus rising to the fifth largest provider in the country.
Mobilking is the financial group Penta, which owns U:fon in the Czech Republic, among others.
The advantage of virtual providers is that you can focus on a much more concrete target group.
In order to work effectively, virtual providers need far fewer customers than a classic provider.
You do not need a relatively high cost for the construction, operation and maintenance of a mobile network.
In the world, the virtual providers usually profile themselves as low-cost companies – they offer cheap phone calls and SMS, which is often accompanied by a less extensive service offering.
For example, Tesco Mobile in the UK offers SMS at least half cheaper than its competitors.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can also be a pretty good move to put on a non-clichic target group.
This provider is specifically aimed at men.
"Real guys choose Mobilking - the provider they like and can trust," said David Seibert, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, the operating company of this virtual provider.
It is difficult to say whether a similar concept could be found in the Czech Republic as well as in Poland.
Vodafone Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD>’s press spokesperson also doubts this: “The Czech market is relatively small for a market segment on which most virtual providers are based.
In addition, it is relatively saturated from the point of view of the service offering."
In the Czech Republic, the mobile phone providers think
However, it is almost certain that if a virtual mobile phone provider conquers the Czech Republic, this will not be mobileking.
"We are talking about an expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic the negotiations do not look particularly hopeful.
Mobilking will be more likely to enter the market in other countries of our region,” says Jana Studni<0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1>, a press spokesperson for the Penta financial group.
Indirectly, it confirmed that the current mobile operators in the Czech Republic are not particularly inclined to this idea.
On the contrary, they try to do everything to ensure that no potential competitor arises.
For some time now, your interest in launching a virtual mobile service provider has been shown by the GTS Novela group, which wants to take another step towards becoming a real competitor of Telef<0xC3><0xB3>nica O2 in the area of corporate customers.
"We have a great interest in offering our customers not only landline, but also mobile telecommunications services.
And the sooner, the better.
We have repeatedly negotiated this possibility with all Czech mobile service providers.
With some of them, we were already able to achieve negotiation progress,” said Pavel Kaidl, the group’s spokesman.
Maybe better times are coming.
Non-official information indicates that the first virtual provider may be expected by the end of the year.
But so far this is surrounded by an insurmountable wall of silence.
"At this moment, we do not assume that there is room for a full-fledged virtual provider in the Czech Republic.
The Czech market has great specifics compared to other markets.
So far, no subject has addressed us with a complex and serious project in this area", says in his statement for Mobil.cz Vlastimil Sr<0xC5><0xA1>e<0xC5><0x88> from the press department of Telef<0xC3><0xB3>nica O2.
The specifics of the Czech market also point to other providers.
T-Mobile press secretary Martina Kemrov<0xC3><0xA1> adds, in rare agreement with O2’s statement: “We have not yet found a viable and mutually beneficial project to build on.”
And she adds, "T-Mobile's network will hardly see a virtual provider until the end of the year.
At this moment we would have to have a concrete offer in order to be able to think in such a short term."
Vodafone focuses its attention rather on meeting the requirements of its own 3G license.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> says: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual providers, especially in the area of sharing costs and infrastructure.
This is exactly what we see as the best from the customer’s point of view.
Vodafone’s main strategy in this area is to find a partner to build a shared network for a fast mobile Internet.”
The responsible authorities - with the providers hand in hand
The approach of mobile providers is easy to understand, another provider called more competition, this would lead to lower prices and thus also to a decrease in profits.
Why, then, should such a competitor be made easier to enter the market?
The fact that the providers can pull on a string when it comes to something also proves the long way back and forth about the creation of U:fon.
Probably the strongest pressure in the direction of <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> was at the time when U:fon came onto the market, from the company T-Mobile.
This also proves the publicly available information from the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> websites.
Now U:fon is an argument as to why you should not allow a virtual provider.
Martina Kemrov<0xC3><0xA1> commented: "The competitive environment of the mobile phone market has recently also been strengthened by the market entry of a fourth mobile phone provider.
Taking into account the nature of the mobile phone market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that a new player would place high demands on the market itself and, above all, its services."
However, given this approach of mobile operators, the absolute disinterest of the Czech regulatory authorities is surprising.
This is not just the attitude of the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>, which, unfortunately, in the Czech Republic - unlike the UK and other highly developed countries - does not have the competence to intervene in economic competition.
It is exclusively owned by the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (<0xC3><0x9A>OHS).
This, however, related to this whole problem his very typical attitude.
"The market entry of a virtual mobile operator would then be possible after a contract has been concluded between a mobile operator and a virtual operator on the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
So far no such contract has been concluded, because the offer of potential prospects was probably not sufficiently interesting for the classic providers," said Kristi<0xC3><0xA1>n Chalupa of the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS External Relations Department in his response to our request.
Such a formulation would not be surprising by representatives of the providers.
This is more than a matter of concern from an authority representing consumer interests and, among other things, ensuring that no one abuses their position on the market.
In particular, when Kristi<0xC3><0xA1>n Chalupa adds: “Regardless of where virtual providers work normally, it can be observed that their market entry has contributed to a price reduction in mobile phone services.”
However, the pressure on the correct functioning of the market and a price reduction are probably not among the interests of <0xC3><0x9A>OHS.
In this case, the almost touching harmony of the three mobile providers, which results from their reactions, is really shocking.
The question of whether this is really just a coincidence is obvious.
Just as the price of petrol at the gas stations is certainly just coincidence and the result of a fierce competition.
"The Authority has not discovered any signs in this matter that indicate an act directed against competition, and therefore has no reason to intervene in the matter in any way.
None of the providers has a dominant market position, so they also do not have the corresponding increased responsibility for their actions on the market.
The necessary tools for opening up the mobile phone market for virtual providers are likely to be missing from the regulatory authority for telecommunications,” Chalupa said in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many points of contention.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets, developed by the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>, according to which telecommunications is a single market from the point of view of economic competition.
In such a market, of course, none of the Czech mobile providers has a dominant position.
However, some legal experts offer a different view - for the market entry of a virtual provider, the consent of the network operator is always necessary.
And the mobile service provider has - logically - the monopoly for its network.
This means that it necessarily assumes a dominant position in a particular segment.
Even if one does not agree with this argument, it should at least be a warning to the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS that three mobile providers are acting remarkably similarly.
Complaints by a number of interested parties (including the mentioned company GTS Novela) prove that they encounter very similar obstacles when negotiating with all providers.
The removal of responsibility to the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> is then a fairly common trick in telecommunications services, with which the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS distances itself from the whole matter.
This has already been observed in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, the recently adopted amendment to the Telecommunications Act did not achieve the extension of <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>'s competences to the field of economic competition in telecommunications, although a number of experts had promised to improve the situation.
The representatives of the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS need to know all too well, but they probably have other interests.
It's okay when no one's looking
First of all, the functioning of any pseudo-virtual provider, of which there are several in the Czech mobile networks.
It is companies that issue their own price lists for mobile telecommunications services, but they are only partially public.
These are usually companies that operate in the area of multi-level marketing.
Own mobile phone services offer, for example, Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and others.
The price lists of these companies are usually only available to selected companies.
The joke of the matter is that the company acts towards the operator as a classic corporate customer, who orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important customer, he will then receive special price offers (and other offers).
The problem is that the terms and conditions of all Czech mobile service providers prohibit similar resale.
"If there are cases that you describe, then it may be a breach of the contractual terms with which we will then deal, which can lead to the termination of cooperation with the relevant company," answered Martina Kemrov<0xC3><0xA1> on our question about this problem.
However, it is quite unlikely that such a thing does not speak to the operators of the mobile phone providers.
Especially in the case of the three mentioned companies, it can be thousands of customers.
However, no operator opposes such a procedure.
As a result of the activities of these companies, they do not receive negligible profits, but at the same time, unlike the actual virtual providers, they are not affected by the actual official marketing.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> draws attention to possible problems: "The law allows such types of speculation, despite the fact that the services of these companies are only used by a very small percentage of customers.
They also have to accept that the SIM card on their phone is not running on their name, so they can’t fully dispose of it like the normal customers of the mobile phone providers.”
But that alone would have to be at least strange.
There is also another question for the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS.
If mobile providers close their eyes before such a procedure, why are they locking themselves against a virtual provider?
It is to be added that the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS has quite strong competences for the detection of such activities, and if it does not want to, it does not have to satisfy itself with the explanation of the providers, they do not know anything about it and their terms and conditions would prohibit this.
When the Czech Republic is no longer the most expensive
As has already been emphasised several times in the text, the market entry of virtual providers resulted in a significant price drop in the various services.
In virtually all countries where virtual providers have emerged, the traditional providers have tried to prevent their emergence more or less.
The arguments they used were practically identical - too small or too saturated a market, problems in the quality of services, etc.
In the highly developed countries, however, the regulatory bodies intervened at these moments, which were not trying to safeguard the interests of mobile operators, but those of their customers.
Be it through formal measures or non-formal pressure, they achieved that the first virtual operator was created, and that followed.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory bodies are throwing themselves at the whole case like a hot potato.
Based on our experience, we cannot get rid of the impression that ambiguity in the competences in these cases is more than favorable.
But let us not throw the flint into the grain.
If the background information is correct and a virtual provider soon emerges, the Czech mobile phone market may soon set in motion again.
If a provider allows the creation of a virtual mobile service provider, the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS will not remain inactive when it comes to rejecting (to discriminate against) other interested parties.
And the Czechs will finally not be more expensive to make phone calls than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Find the best
Listen to the four versions of the new Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek presented the new recordings of the national anthem Where is my homeland on the occasion of the day of Czech statehood in an hour of celebration.
The hymn was re-recorded by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> B<0xC4><0x9B>lohl<0xC3><0xA1>vek.
There are four versions available - with male or female solo vocals, in chorus and in an instrumental version.
The song version was taken by Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Kn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD>nkov<0xC3><0xA1> and Adam Plachetka.
The editors of the hymn versions are Otakar Jeremi<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> and Jaroslav Kr<0xC4><0x8D>ek.
On the server iHNed.cz you can listen to all four versions immediately.
For B<0xC4><0x9B>lohl<0xC3><0xA1>vek, the Czech national anthem is one of the most beautiful hymns.
Previously, he had told Czech radio that he had chosen singers for the solo variants with young, representative voices that are distinctive and popular.
"From the beginning, I tried with both and then with the choir to adhere to a clear diction, so that you can understand the text well, so that a harmony can be established," said the conductor.
The Czech National Anthem celebrates its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Kde domov m<0xC5><0xAF>j first appeared on the stage of the St<0xC3><0xA4>ndetheater in the original Czech piece Fidlova<0xC4><0x8D>ka by Josef Kajet<0xC3><0xA1>n Tyl in 1834, the music was from Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek <0xC5><0xA0>kroup.
It became popular, and people spontaneously adopted it.
The first verse of the song became an organic part of the national anthem after the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918.
It remained one of the seven state symbols even after the creation of the independent Czech Republic.
What does the "new" anthem sound like?
Prague’s transport companies are also transporting on a chip for the first time on Wednesday
Wednesday, October 1, 2008, will enter the history of Prague’s transport operations as a date when the first passengers to enter a subway, tram or bus will be carrying an electronic coupon in their pocket instead of a paper ticket.
These can currently buy about one hundred thousand people who own the chip card Opencard.
Passengers can buy a 30-day, 90-day or annual coupon (valid from 1 January 2009) and have it played on their chip card at the same time, in the information centres and branches of the transport companies at the metro stations Muzeum, M<0xC5><0xAF>stek, N<0xC3><0xA1>dra<0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD> Hole<0xC5><0xA1>ovice, And<0xC4><0x9B>l, Roztyly, Let<0xC5><0xA1>ovice.
The coupons have also been available since yesterday via the Internet on the pages of the transport companies www.dpp.cz.
The service was used until the afternoon hours by over four hundred customers.
Those who use internet sales can really forget about the outlet window in the subway stations, where they had to wait regularly for their paper tickets in long queues.
You buy the coupon over the Internet, it is played on the open card in one of the thirteen branches of the city library.
"There is also a desk with trained staff at these locations, which advises interested parties on the purchase of the internet and also plays the coupon on the map," said Martin Opatrn<0xC3><0xBD>, spokesman for the project.
In addition to the libraries, you can also play the electronic coupons at self-service vending machines on the open card, which are attached in some metro vestibüls.
What do such machines look like?
They are red, reminiscent of ticket devaluators, passengers may have noticed them already in the metro stations Roztyly, Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovick<0xC3><0xA1>, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavsk<0xC3><0xA1>.
“There are currently five of them in the city, but by the end of the year it should be eighty,” Opatrn<0xC3><0xBD> adds.
The coupon controls an automatic instead of the driver
The operation of the machines that will work from tomorrow is simple.
All you have to do is insert the chip card, and the previously purchased coupon will play itself.
The electronic coupons will apply from tomorrow not only in the capital but also in the surrounding area.
So in the suburban trains and on the bus lines with numbers 300 to 499, with which mainly the inhabitants from municipalities of the Central Bohemia region get to the capital.
“On trains that are part of Prague’s integrated transport, train attendants have reading devices with which they can check the validity of the coupons by time and zone,” explains Filip Dr<0xC3><0xA1>pal of the Ropid organisation. This organization compiles the timetables for Prague’s transport companies.
The suburban buses have card readers at the ticket office at the driver's desk.
When boarding, the chip card must not only be presented to the driver, but the open card must be placed at a marked location on the side of the ticket.
This allows the driver to check the validity of the coupons played.
“If a passenger wants to check the validity of the coupons played, nothing is easier than asking the driver for this information,” Dr<0xC3><0xA1>pal said.
A passenger who does not drive suburban buses and no longer knows when the validity of the coupon ends can again go to the self-service vending machines, where the coupons are played on the map.
Here, the information about the validity of its documents is displayed on the display of the device.
The Sudeten demanded a U.S. referendum
In 1945, the Sudeten Germans had asked for the incorporation of the Bohemian Forest into the United States.
This is evident from a letter that is stored in the collections of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, at least we want to live under the auspices of the United States of America.
With such a wish, in 1945, some groups of Sudeten Germans turned to the US president.
This can be seen, among other things, from a letter that has been preserved in a private archive and which is now kept in the collections of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
In the letter, the Germans of Krumau asked the American president not to allow the return of the "Sudetengau" - which was taken on the basis of the Munich agreement by Hitler - to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation correctly and really want to be sure of the words that the American units do not enter as oppressors and enemies of German territory, but as liberators," the letter reads, which is signed with the words "people whose fate lies at the heart of the Sudetes".
Since the connection to Czechoslovakia makes the Sudeten Germans suspect, knowing the Czech national character, that they would expect brutality, ruthlessness, misunderstanding, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the American President to take over the protection of the Bohemian Forest for now and forever.
"We cannot believe that without regard to the view of a quarter of a million inhabitants of this area, you are addressing a foreign state that is trying to suppress and eliminate minorities and has contributed nothing at all to the victory of the Allies," the letter reads.
The reason why the authors cannot sign is supposedly the fear of revenge from the “Czech oppressors”.
If the President of the United States had doubts about the attitude of the Bohemian Forest Germans, it would be sufficient if he initiated a referendum in the Bohemian Forestgau on whether the inhabitants wanted to become part of the United States or live under the patronage of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may sound somewhat na<0xC3><0xAF>ve in today’s knowledge of post-war history, it does, in the opinion of some contemporary witnesses, draw a good picture of the expectations of the Sudeten Germans at the time.
Even though the Bohemian Germans had to at least suspect that they would negotiate on their deportation from the Republic, few of them admitted such a possibility at all.
Some were waiting for the United States and Britain to negotiate some sort of autonomy for the Sudetes.
Others thought they could simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
It also confirms the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, who comes from Budweis.
During the war he was employed as a German Budweiser in the Navy on the Baltic Sea.
When he came to British captivity at the end of the war and was taken to a prisoner-of-war camp in Holstein, dozens of other Bohemian Germans came to him to teach them Czech.
"They believed that if they came home, the Czech would come to suit them," Chalupa said.
In his opinion, none of the German prisoners of war who had lived in Czechoslovakia before the war expected him to be expelled from the Republic on the basis of Bene<0xC5><0xA1> decrees.
Don't you think - pay!
An emotional campaign aimed at drivers
Most expensive action on road safety in Czech history.
This is also how the emotionally charged media campaign, which the Ministry of Transport wants to launch on Wednesday, could be characterized.
The authority of Minister Ale<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0x98>eb<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek promises to remove drivers from dangerous behaviour behind the steering wheel.
The 150 million kroner campaign will run on television, radio, cinema, the Internet, but also on flyers.
It is designed to keep drivers from driving too fast and alcohol at the wheel.
And they also remind you to get dressed before the start of the journey.
The campaign is mainly aimed at young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and, last but not least, professional drivers.
And what is shown in the spots?
Especially stories of people who appeal to emotions.
This is also evidenced by the "bloody" slogan of the entire campaign:
Don't you think - pay!
The words "don't think" are in capital letters on a license plate.
And in a blood slick, the word “pay” is then written.
This is meant to mean that one can pay for a moment of inattention with one’s own life.
The spots will "shock" viewers until 2010.
The ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where you can see quite normal images with drastic footage of accident victims.
It is expected that the number of accidents and the number of traffic fatalities will fall on the Czech roads.
The spots were compiled by the agency Euro RSCG.
Sugar bread and whip for drivers
"For the drivers, the motto is sugar bread and whip.
Sugar bread means that if you drive red, for example, you will save time.
The whip is then the threat of a penalty or accident.
The driver must be reminded of the risk," said the traffic psychologist of the hospital Na Homolce Martin Ko<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xA1>n.
And that is why information campaigns in the press and especially negative advertising are necessary, says the psychologist.
In his opinion, even less effective are boards that alert drivers to a danger.
“If you set up a static board that warns of a danger, it will probably soon merge with the environment, and the drivers will no longer perceive it,” Ko<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xA1>n says.
Olmert would return almost all occupied territories in exchange for peace
The Chairman of the Provisional Israeli Government, Ehud Olmert, has called for the return of virtually all territories occupied in 1967, including Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, if peace could be reached in exchange for this.
He emphasized this in an interview that was printed by the daily Jediot Achronot on Monday.
"We need to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means it will be necessary to return almost all (occupied) territories, if not all," Olmert told the newspaper.
“We keep a certain percentage of these territories, but we will have to give the Palestinians a similarly high percentage (Israeli territory) because there will be no peace without it,” he added.
He conceded that a possible return would also include East Jerusalem.
"The one who wants security in Jerusalem and especially doesn't want tractors or bulldozers to roll over his legs, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up part of Jerusalem," Olmert noted in reference to two attacks in the city in July, in which several people were killed and dozens of people were injured.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find a "special solution for the Templar and sacred and historic places" located on the territory of the old town.
“Anyone who wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
That won’t work,” he continued.
Detachment from the Golan Heights
Olmert spoke out for a withdrawal of Israel from the Golan Heights, which he believes is an indispensable condition for concluding a peace treaty with Syria.
However, this would also require some effort on the part of Damascus.
"My proposal is not to make peace with Syria solely on the basis of a withdrawal from the Golan Heights," Olmert said.
"The Syrians know all too well what they have to do to get back the Golan Heights.
They will have to renounce their present relationship with Iran; they will have to renounce their relationship with the (Shiite) Hezbollah movement; they will have to renounce the constant support they give to the terrorism of the (Shiite) Hamas movement, the Al-Khaida terrorist network and the Jihad (Holy War) in Iraq," the Prime Minister said in a statement.
Questions about the accident: Are stewards on the bus illegal?
The law does not know them, in a long-distance bus it is not allowed to roam
In connection with the tragic accident of a bus company Student Agency near the Italian Padua, the question arises whether stewards and travelers can run back and forth on the bus during the trip.
"If we want to strictly and formally comply with the law, the activity of a steward is contrary to the law on road traffic," said the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka.
The accident, which killed a twenty-two-year-old stewardess last week, was likely caused by the driver of the truck crossing the road.
At that moment, the young woman was sitting next to the driver, in the least safe place in the car, although she had two more places available.
However, a bus can also have an accident at the moment or brake sharply, in which the steward carries out coffee or newspapers.
It also plays a role if the bus is equipped with standing places after the vehicle letter.
If this is not provided on the bus, passengers must sit.
Student Agency’s long-distance coaches do not have standing positions; as confirmed by the company’s director, Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, to Aktu<0xC3><0xA1>ln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz.
"We discussed this with the Ministry, and this did not agree with the movement of travellers at first.
Later, this was taken back, and we reached a consensus that travelers can go to the toilet during the ride if they have their seat," he said.
The law does not know a steward.
"There is no clear legal interpretation for the role of a steward - no legislation describes this role.
However, there is also no legal provision that prohibits the carrier from providing services.
The law on road transport only knows the term vehicle attendant, but its rights and obligations do not define it,” Hanzelka said.
The director of the Department of Road Vehicles of the Ministry of Transport Josef Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD>, on the other hand, believes that the law covers this issue afterwards.
"It depends on whether the bus also has standing places in the product approval.
That’s all,” he said.
Buses are divided into city buses where there are standing places and the maximum speed is limited, public transport buses with standing places and a higher allowed speed, and long-distance buses without standing places with the highest permitted speed and seats equipped with seat belts.
As in the plane, the expert says
The BESIP traffic safety expert Jaroslav Ho<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>n sees no fundamental problem in the movement of stewards on board a bus.
"In a liquid mode of travel, not many hazards are at risk, the situation is comparable to the service on board an aircraft.
Here, too, it is not certain when turbulence will come, and the stewardess may bump his head."
"But if a bus is sharp, then of course the laws of physics apply.
Just like in the city bus or in a tram.
The safety of the stewards must be clarified by internal regulations", he says, and also believes that this problem is not completely solved from the point of view of the law.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura is ready to cancel services
Student Agency is the only bus company offering services from Stewards.
The company employs about two hundred people in this function.
Even after the accident, the director does not consider her profession to be risky.
“But as soon as I get the impression that the steward’s profession is risky, I’ll delete it.
Coffee and newspapers can be provided to passengers upon boarding.
That would also reduce costs,” he said.
As an interest in safety, the director of Asiana Alexej Litvin is responsible for the lack of stewards in his buses, but his company operates only a fraction of lines compared to the Student Agency.
“We don’t have stewardesses, but we’ve been fighting from the beginning.
Sooner or later, this ends with some fatal accident," he had said to T<0xC3><0xBD>den.cz a year ago.
It was an incredible tragedy.
In the accident of a bus to Naples, a young stewardess from the Pilsen region, who had worked for the society for two years, was injured.
The Slovenian truck was probably bent off the sidewalk without blinking and had blocked the bus.
The driver of the bus tried to avoid through a sharp maneuver, but collided with the right front part of the truck.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura denied that the two seats had been sold for the stewards.
"These places cannot be reserved for long-distance connections, they are blocked."
Company wants to sue truck drivers.
With compensation for the young woman’s family, the agency will not wait for the court ruling, but a financial compensation is also expected from the guilty party.
A change of law?
Not in sight
A more precise regulation of the movement of stewards on board a bus could bring a legal regulation, on which a thirty-member team of experts from the Ministry of Transport has been working for over a year.
"But this has not yet reached a concrete conclusion.
Buses are also not necessarily on the agenda, rather the points system, the maximum speed on the highway and the use of mobile phones when driving," says expert Ho<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>n.
"The Ministry of Transport does not regard the operation of the stewards as something that could significantly jeopardise the safety of travellers," Hanzelka said, with the control of the safety of the buses being in the competence of the police and the health and safety authorities.
Düsseldorf’s hopes rest on Frankfurt
There is no shortage of words in the letter of the WestLB Board of Directors to the employees of the House.
By merging units of the Düsseldorf-based financial institution with the Frankfurt-based Deka-Bank, "the central capital market house of the Sparkassen-Finanzgruppe" could be created, according to the letter that became known on Monday.
WestLB incorporated a "competence block" with sustainable profitability into such a business.
And at all, such a link could be the decisive impetus for further bundling in the Landesbanken sector.
This is how it reads when a board wants to demonstrate its ability to act in a difficult time.
The WestLB is still under tremendous pressure.
Not only on the part of the European Commission, but also through the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority, which the North Rhine-Westphalian state government has just recently clarified, is pushing the time to find a future solution.
However, there has been talk of a connection between the Deka bank, which Sparkassen customers know about because of their investment funds, and the WestLB, however, has been talking for some time - also on the Frankfurt side.
Deka bank chief Franz Waas, at the presentation of the half-yearly figures at the end of August, said he did not see any sense in a merger of the house on Mainzer Landstra<0xC3><0x9F>e with a state bank, such as the Helaba or the WestLB.
However, the Board of Directors of the Deka, each half of which is supported by the Landesbanken and the Sparkassenverbanden, has commissioned the Management Board to hold discussions with WestLB about joint business activities.
This could be about the capital market business or parts of it.
Of course, the talks have just begun, so it is said at the financial center.
Deka-Bank, which, with its 3,000 employees, is one of the most important employers at Frankfurt financial centre, is not the first time when it comes to consolidation in the Sparkassen sector.
In 2003 it seemed for a moment that the Deka bank could merge with the Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and the Helaba.
There was nothing from this triad.
Hardly had the plans become public, the Hessian state government spoke out against Helaba’s involvement in it.
The other two houses did not belong to each other.
The Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz went instead to the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart.
However, there have always been thoughts about a connection between the Deka bank and state banks.
Recently, however, Günther Merl, Chairman of the Helaba Executive Board, had spoken out against plan games about joining up with his house.
Regardless, however, it seems to mature the realization that a collapse of the various houses of the public-law sector is a necessity.
Now that the state election in Bavaria is over, the first thing BayernLB could do is move closer to the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg.
For the Helaba, this is not necessarily a good news.
Should the pressure for further mergers increase, the partners gradually go out for it.
In the south, she would only be a junior partner, although she has endured the financial crisis far better than the houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
In turn, a merger with the West LB has been proposed by the Sparkassen- und Giroverband Hessen-Thüringen, which participates in the Helaba with 85 percent, at the beginning of the year.
At least stay in the North LB.
But such geostrategic considerations are only one side.
On the other hand, it is about the question of how the different business models of the individual houses match each other.
In June, Merl stated that the decisive question with which business model to ensure the future viability of the Landesbanken had not yet been answered by the German Sparkassen- und Giroverband.
In the end, there could also be a disintegration of the West LB, which, however, is not self-evidently desired.
In the letter of the board of directors there, it is said that a "total solution" for the house will definitely be sought.
How this can be brought under a hat with the joining of individual units with the Deka bank will still be shown.
The second meadow weekend is known as the "Italian Weekend"
For Elena it is the first time, for Luca already the third or fourth time.
But this time Elena is there as his girlfriend, and so everything is different, he says.
Behind them, at the five-liter beer barrel of the Kaiser brand, stands a massively built bearded bearer and proves to the approximately 200 Oktoberfest travelers what deep tones can produce its throat.
Elena gives Luca a hug first, then a kiss.
From Bologna they came to Verona.
From here, the bus parking next to Puorta Nuova train station, four buses, "destinazione Monaco, festa della birra", will start arriving at 6.30 a.m.
Three buses are mainly reserved for Italians, and only Brazilians travel on a bus.
In a corner of the parking lot, the South Americans are already singing next to their flag, they have already celebrated at night.
And so loud, says Marco Guarda, this is not for Italians.
Marco, who wears a long coat with fur imitation lining and glasses with wide silver temples, belongs to the buses.
For five years they have been going to the Oktoberfest, three tours are this year alone.
At night, during the day on the meadow, back at 10.30 p.m.
Staying overnight would only mean unnecessary expenses, says Marco.
75 euros is the cost of the trip, the welcome drink with Kaiser-Bier, brewed in accordance with the Bavarian purity commandment, the health insurance and the German-speaking tour guide - Marco has attended a language course in Frankfurt - included.
And already the buses roll into the night, on the Autostrada direction "Brennero".
There is no beer, not yet.
It quickly becomes quiet on the bus, the travelers sleep.
Well, they'll still need their powers.
It is held in Brixen and in Holzkirchen, where a number of other buses with Italian license plates take a break on the motorway 8 just before Munich.
When Marcos Group finally arrives at the parking lot near Theresienwiese at half past seven o’clock in the morning, there are already 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco holds a final address, explains the attack plan.
First, put the yellow cap on.
On the left is "Octoberfest", in Fraktur, next to the internet address of Marcos Reisebüro: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Second, "When the doors open to the beer tent, it's called running!", Marco calls in the morning.
"Run!" Run and occupy the seats in the back of the tent.
"Not in front, otherwise we will block, and not all yellow caps on the same benches, spread in the room!"
The measure, roars Marco, costing 8,25 euros.
And don't forget about tipping.
"The security people show that we behave well!
As soon as you leave the seats, they're gone!"
Thirdly, "Find point half past eleven again today!" Understand?
And now we're going to the meadow.
Along the way, a yellow cap binds as waymarks to the trees, signs and even to the election poster of a large Bavarian People's Party.
You want to be prepared for the retreat.
It is the second meadow weekend, known as the "Italian Weekend".
There are no exact figures; the talk is of 50,000 who make their way across the Alps and fall into the beer tents, ten percent of all visitors are said to have travelled extra from Italy this weekend.
The Munich police are reinforced by seven police officers from South Tyrol, Italian volunteers supporting the Bavarian Red Cross, which holds a national statistics, in which the Italians occupy first place in front of the British (about 60 missions) and Austrians (about 80) with about 200 medical supplies.
Especially popular with Italians is the Hofbr<0xC3><0xA4>uzelt.
Sleepless Nights for Creditors of Hypo Real Estate
The German banking system is relatively stable, Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück stressed only last week.
How good that the politician used the word "relative" and also implied that the German banking sector was not spared from the crisis.
Because it has now arrived on the weekend.
The Munich real estate financier Hypo Real Estate (HRE), listed in the Dax, receives a billion-dollar loan from a consortium of German banks to shield itself from the turbulence in the markets.
A person familiar with the situation told Reuters on Monday that the loan assistance amounted to up to 35 billion euros.
The Hypo Real Estate only needs to pay interest on the part it also takes.
The money comes from both private and public banks.
There are losses to the daughter Defpa.
The state financier had refinanced itself extremely short-term, according to a newspaper report for long-term projects for which he has been lending money – which is now no longer possible due to market mistrust.
In the first half of 2008, the bank’s cash reserve had shrunk by 95 percent to EUR 2.37 million, and the equity ratio had also declined slightly from 1.6 to 1.45 percent.
Current income and net income from financial transactions fell to zero compared to the same period last year, while income from attributions to receivables and certain securities, as well as the dissolution of provisions in the credit business, fell by more than 70 percent to EUR 5 million.
Only thanks to higher revenues from reimbursements of subordinated transfer costs from the restructuring of the former Defpa Group, as well as from the reimbursement of interest according to the tax regulations and from the business provision for group companies, had the income minus still moderated by around 16 percent.
The former state financier, after his privatisation in 1990, had first speculated with commercial real estate loans, which had then been decommissioned at Aareal Bank.
Due to the lack of traditional state funding, Defpa had become increasingly involved in infrastructure projects and the financing of community projects of private investors and the state (Private Public Partnership, PPP) and internationally diversified.
On the value of the daughter, the Hypo Real Estate must now make amortizations that will have a "substantial material effect" on the profit and loss account of the group, it is quite undetermined.
The fact is that the dividend has been cancelled.
In 2007, it was cut by two-thirds.
The Hypo Real Estate has been a major state and infrastructure financier since the Deppa acquisition.
It is more dependent than other institutions on refinancing on the interbank market because it has no client deposits.
With the collapse of the American investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, lending among the banks has again largely faded as the banks horrified their liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate needs short-term funding for refinancing for part of the Deppa credit portfolio every year – around 50 billion euros.
According to the announcement of the Hypo Real Estate, the group’s financing needs are covered by the loan for a foreseeable period of time and the company is shielded “from the influence of the currently largely inoperable international money markets”.
It can be heard from other sources that, thanks to the funds, the refinancing was secured until the end of 2009.
HRE Chairman Georg Funke said that the Hypo Real Estate Group will no longer have to take advantage of the money markets in the foreseeable future.
The Bundesbank and the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) assume that the market capability of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now secured.
This is to be hoped for by shareholders and creditors of the bank.
But given the dynamics and uncertainties of the crisis, there is probably no certainty.
It is even not unthinkable that the financing does not have to be used in full.
But the opposite is also not to be taken out.
After the late Sunday evening the hearing after the bank was still before the insolvency, even the at least provisional rescue is unable to calm the minds.
The share price falls by 75 percent to 3.30 euros.
On the other hand, the bond prices are quite good.
If the primary debt barely shows up moving, the prices of subordinated bonds are more significant.
Especially affected are the bonds of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo and understandably the maturities beyond 2009.
If Hypo-Real-Estate bonds appear to be a speculative investment alternative in the past, their value must be considered dependent on the stability of the international financial system after the marked exacerbation of the banking crisis and the institution itself, which had only brought the crisis into the house with the adoption of the Defpa.
As long as the central banks, governments and less-favoured commercial banks are still ready to support the system, as long as a timely repayment of pensions can be assumed.
Or it happens what hardly anyone dares to hope for at the moment - that the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months.
However, given the reports that overlap with the partial nationalisation, the probability of safety has now become only a legitimate hope.
This is especially likely to give long-term believers some sleepless nights with the decision to separate themselves from their commitments.
Short-term investors can, after all, use a final dash to form a loss presentation for future tax payments on future gains in exchange rates in later years.
Sylvana and the Secrets of the Bento Box
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, is supposed to introduce herself on the first day of school at Tachibana High School, the girls start to giggle: the German is totally "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from Mangas - in the new exchange log she tells about Japan.
"The first day of school in Japan.
I was excited.
Even before school, I had bumblebees.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and drive 40 minutes by train to Tachibana High School.
I had to find the way alone, luckily I didn’t run away.
The start of classes at the Tachibana does not seem as strict as at our home in Lower Saxony.
The students enter from eight o’clock until twenty before nine a short round of meetings begins with the teacher, the ‘home room’.
But before class began, I was about to introduce myself.
I am not the type of person who likes to talk to people, even in front of a class of 40 students.
Because I didn’t have a school uniform yet, I put on an old coat of my host mother, plus blouse, blue knee socks and black leather shoes.
So in this elevator I stood in front of the desk and tried to pronounce everything correctly: 'Sayonara Wo she Sylvana...' - my name is Sylvana, come from Germany and have a week's birthday.
At that moment I was very happy that I had already started learning the language about two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class have all been tricked, whipped and waved and constantly I heard the word "kawaii".
I knew that from my manga.
It belongs to the vital vocabulary of Japanese girls and means 'cute, sweet'.
Then I quickly moved to my place.
The girl next to me grinned quite broadly, she found it an honor that the exchange student should sit next to her.
The rest of the hour was pretty quiet, but when the gong sounded, I was really upset.
All of them talked to each other and giggled and asked me holes in my stomach - it's really hard to understand Japanese English.
During the break, all the bentos took off.
My host mother had also made me such a lunchbox - this is something different from the fateful German break bread.
I had rice with herbs, small sausages, salad of cucumbers and algae, fruit and some meat in the tofu coat.
Most of the time I don’t have a pale glow, which is exactly what I eat here in Japan.
Things look strange and taste completely new.
It’s clear that everything is really delicious.
Well, except for the salty inlaid plums maybe, brrrr!
The Bentos are not just lunch at Japanese schools.
It sometimes happens that a girl gives a boy a self-made bento, which she then makes especially artistically - hoping to get to know the boy more closely at the break snack.
I read about it in my manga comics.
I wonder if I can watch this too.
‘Why Japan?’ my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
I always said:
“Because it fascinates me.”
After all, I have been reading mangas for years.
And so that I can better understand the comics and the culture in it, I also started learning a little Japanese at some point.
It was clear to me that I had to travel here at some point.
I also have a passion for tradition, customs and customs.
And they place great value on it.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends - on the other hand, it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I haven’t felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I’ve ever seen.”
Rats also have feelings.
A rat or a sheep flees in danger, does that mean that it also feels fear?
Neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux is convinced that many animals also have feelings.
Only how can we check if they feel the same way when they behave like us?
For several years, contributions from famous scientists have been published in the Internet magazine Edge.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series selected answers to the question "What do you think is true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have sensations and other states of consciousness, without me or anyone else being able to prove this so far where we cannot even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case, at least we can hope because all human brains have the same basic configuration.
However, as soon as we turn to other species and crop up questions of feeling or, more generally, of consciousness, we enter impassable terrain because the hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, it does the same thing as many other animals: it stands dead, flees, or attacks.
Humans behave similarly, which some scientists suggest is a comparable subjective experience.
But I don't believe in that.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to transfer our subjective experience to that of animals.
On the one hand, the circuits associated almost always with human consciousness include the lateral prefrontal cortex (due to its involvement in short-term memory and in the execution/control functions).
This broad region is much more developed in humans than in the rest of the primates and seems to be lacking entirely in other creatures.
At least for those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, including the knowledge of who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, there is reason to assume that man is even different from the other primates.
Another dramatic characteristic is probably in the linguistic nature of man: Since such a large part of his experience is associated with language, it is often said that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
But even if consciousness did not depend on language, it would certainly affect it, so animal consciousness, as it may be, is probably very different from most of our states of consciousness.
Therefore, it is difficult to determine what consciousness may look like in other animals.
If, as something internal and subjective, it cannot be measured nor, because of the special hardware, analyzed on the basis of our own experience, then his research presents us with great problems.
Most of my remarks relate to the content of conscious experience, but there is another aspect of consciousness that should be scientifically more easily accessible.
One could examine the consciousness processes of animals without regard to their contents, and this is exactly what happens in studies on the short-term memory of primates, especially with the example of visualization.
But with this approach, which Christof Koch and Francis Crick followed, one focuses more on the neural correlates of consciousness than on the causal mechanisms: both may or may not be identical.
Interestingly, this approach also emphasizes the importance of the prefrontal cortex for the state of visualization.
What is the result of the sensations?
I lead them back to the fact that an emotional system like that of fear is activated in a brain conscious of its own activity.
So what we call “fear” is the mental state in which we are when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its consequences, such as physical reactions) proves memory.
In this way, sensations are closely linked to the regions of the cortex that distinguish primates and, in particular, humans.
Linked to linguistic nature, fine gradations of feeling arise because we can differentiate and categorize states with the help of words and grammar in order to attribute them to others besides ourselves.
On the other hand, Antonio Damasio suggests that sensations from more primitive activities in the body-feeling regions of the cortex and the brain stem are similar to Jaak Pankseep, which, however, focuses more on the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed much in the course of human evolution, it could well be involved in cross-generational sensations.
Theoretically, I cannot contradict it, but I think it is unproven.
Pankseep argues what appears to be fear in rats and humans, probably also feels like this in both cases: But how can one check whether rats and humans feel the same when they behave similarly?
A sheep flees at risk if she also feels fear?
In my eyes, mere similarity cannot yet prove equality of experience.
Although the neural comparison continues to help: rats and humans have similar brainstems, but not even a brain.
But is the brain stem responsible for sensations?
And even if you could prove it to people, how would you prove it to rats?
I believe that rats and other mammals, maybe even sheep (who knows?), have sensations.
But I don't know how to prove it.
And because their sensations are probably fundamentally different from ours (since human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I prefer to explore the emotional behavior rather than the emotional sensations of rats.
In any case, advances on the neural level win here, provided that the same is measured in rats and humans.
As I do not explore language and consciousness in rats, nor do I know if they exist.
You may think this is short-sighted, but I prefer to go ahead rather than constantly running against a wall.
I am a practical emotionalist.
Uefa President Platini: Deadline for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Wasjunik said preparations would soon be put under the direct responsibility of President and Prime Minister.
"The government sees the decision of the Uefa in Bordeaux as a testament to Ukraine's confidence and its ability to host the European Championship together with Poland," Wasjunik said.
“This is not an amnesty to our country.
The work has just begun and there is still a lot to do in both countries."
In the schedule for the construction or conversion of the stadiums, roads, hotels and airports, the two hosts are behind.
Perhaps even the number of EM stadiums will be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We now have to work at maximum speed,” said Ukrainian Federation President Grigory Surkis.
"Uefa will keep an eye on us constantly."
An even more radical step was taken in Poland.
The leadership of the Polish association PZPN has been suspended after numerous scandals by the National Olympic Committee and replaced by the independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The Commission met at the request of Sport Minister Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
“There is a serious risk that the PZPN will not be able to act according to the rules,” Drzewiecki told the Polish news agency PAP.
"We have assured Uefa President Michel Platini in a letter that preparation for the 2012 European Championships will not suffer from this."
Several first-team players had been sentenced to a forced descent last season alone for manipulation, after all, even the league start had to be postponed in the short term.
Disturbed Dennis Quaid Strikes Back
She wanted to promote a new film, spoke in an interview about privates – and now has trouble with the ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan outed her estranged Dennis Quaid as a adultery.
It foams - and strikes back.
Late Rose War with ex-husband Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors are now having an unsightly battle with each other – in public.
Meg Ryan, in an interview with InStyle last week, said for the first time about the reasons for the failure of marriage: “Dennis was unfaithful to me for a long time, and that was very painful.”
The extent of the fraud she learned only after the divorce.
The reason for the soul triptease was Ryan's press work for her new film "The Women" - tells the story of a adultery.
Dennis Quaid’s reaction to his outing as an unfaithful husband was clear: “It’s outrageous,” said the 54-year-old of the New York Daily News, “that for the time being, Meg rekindled and re-enclosed the story of our relationship.”
It is also “deplorable” that the 16-year-old son, Jack, is once again “publicly reminded of the pain and upheavals that a divorce means for every child.”
While Ryan has been living alone since the divorce, Quaid is married again and recently became the father of twins.
And so his admissions close with the pageant: "My life goes on anyway.
I’m happy that I have a wonderful family that is doing well.”
Lower prices for airline tickets and hotels
In the first half of 2008, flights and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
According to a recent study, flights in Germany were up to 50 percent cheaper.
Flights and overnight stays in hotels have once again become cheaper – this is the result of a study by the travel and financial services provider American Express.
The company analysed its booking data from the first half of 2008 and, after a rise in prices in the first quarter, found a significant drop in the second quarter.
After prices on the hotel market have increased for years, overnight stays have already been reduced in many places.
From January to March, prices in 41 out of 48 European cities surveyed rose by an average of 6.9 percent compared to 2007.
From April to June, however, prices were already 3.6 percent lower than in the previous year.
The trend was most evident in Paris and Rome, where travelers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than a year ago.
As a result, American Express sees the weak dollar rate that has led to a “decreasing travel appetite of American tourists.”
Financial places such as Frankfurt or London are also more affected by the decline in hotel prices than industrial locations such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices keep the record in Europe with an increase of 26.3 percent.
The trend in air fares in the first quarter also showed an upward trend:
Because of kerosene consumption, travellers in the economy class had to pay an average of 7.1 percent more than in 2007, fuel-intensive long-haul flights were even up to 29.2 percent more expensive.
From April to June, prices for economy class airline tickets fell by an average of 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, but in business and first-class, price changes were much lower.
In Germany, prices fell even more than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices had risen by 11.9 percent, and in the second quarter they fell by 23.6 percent.
On German domestic flights, prices have even halved, according to the study.
The reason for the price drop is, on the one hand, the slowing economic growth, the company explains.
Demand broke in many segments of the air travel market.
On the other hand, the Open Skies Agreement, which liberalizes air traffic between the United States and Europe, increases competition pressure.
Signs of the strained situation were the cancellation of unprofitable routes with Airlines, as well as the high number of airlines that had registered for bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 - only in Europe were 24 airlines.
HSV beats Gladbach 1:0
With a goal and simple methods, the Hamburg SV becomes the leader of the table.
At Borussia, Luhukay is still unable to find a functioning elf.
From Kristoffer Klein expand break-up landing for national player Marko Marin.
The Gladbacher came into play late and failed with a lift to the Latte.
His message was precisely formulated, she convincingly crossed his lips.
He simply knew he was right.
"We need the second gate," said Hermann Rieger in the cabin corridor of the Hamburg Arena.
Much was not going on in the catacombs, the half-time break was over and most were back in their seats.
Rieger was a physiotherapist of the HSV for almost three decades, and he enjoys a higher reputation than some of the lost actors.
And so his request was heard in the responsible place.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol nodded and raised his thumb in agreement.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg’s head coach Martin Jol.
Its command will have sounded similar: here with gate two!
The implementation did not go away.
"It wasn't all nice to watch today," Marcell Jansen later admitted.
Even Bastian Reinhardt would have liked it more "relaxed".
The 1-0 (1:0) gave the Hamburgers thanks to Mladen Petric's header (11th); and the fact that very weak Gladbachers could not hurt the weak Hamburgers.
“It was a dirty victory,” Martin Jol summarized.
The Hamburger SV will be 121 years old this Monday.
On Saturday afternoon, the spectators celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena and the flash table on the video wall, which showed their club as class primus.
It will be a birthday without a real party.
"We know how to classify this," said Marcell Jansen.
He suspects that the tabular intermediate stands more for the unpredictability of the league than for the dominance of its HSV.
The team with its late mandatory accesses - the Brazilians Neves and Silva, the goalkeeper Petric and the Jansen who was recruited by FC Bayern - is slowly finding themselves, but she is not yet able to shine.
“We need more flair and more dribbling,” Jol said.
After the vote defeat
On Wall Street, there is fear.
First news of the failure of the rescue package caused the Dow Jones to temporarily break down by 700 points.
This was the biggest loss of points within a day in its history.
Later, the Dow caught something again.
Around 8:30 p.m., the world’s most important stock market barometer recorded a good five percent minus 10,579 counters.
The Nasdaq technology exchange was down by more than seven percent to 1548 points.
The biggest loser at the time was the Dow American Express, which lost just under 14 percent and the Bank of America with a loss of around 12 percent.
No title could be won.
The Goldman Sachs bank’s shares fell by almost 10 percent.
Just a few days ago, major investor Warren Buffett took part in the company.
Within the framework of the rescue plan, the funds for the purchase of so-called lazy mortgage papers are to be provided.
However, the sum should not be paid out at a single stroke, but step by step.
In return, the state should receive stock option notes from financial companies that could be redeemed in the event of corresponding price developments in order to reduce the burden on the Treasury.
Stock prices in Europe and USA in the USA
The billions of aid to banks in Europe and the US do not address investors’ doubts.
The share price of the German large bank Hypo Real Estate crashes and rips the Dax downwards.
The U.S. index Dow Jones loses despite the state’s planned bailout of the financial market.
Spectacular price losses by Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank have taken the German Stock Index (Dax) down.
Despite the rescue operation of the German government and private banks, the Munich real estate financier’s share temporarily lost three-quarters of its value, which Commerzbank gave up by more than 20 percent.
The Dax clearly slipped under the psychologically important 6000-point mark and recorded with a down of 3.7 percent at 5,839 points.
The stock markets went to their knees all over the world.
In New York, Wall Street opened with significant losses.
Investors feared that the US government’s $700 billion bailout package could not be sufficient to relaunch the financial markets.
The Dow lost 334 points or 3.3 percent in the first trading hour to 10,809.25 points.
The U.S. House of Representatives wanted to vote on the rescue plan, the vote in the Senate could follow on October 1.
The other European exchanges also knew only one direction: in London, the FTSE index initially declined by 3.2 percent, while the CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.9 percent.
In Asia, the Japanese lead index Nikkei fell by 1.26 percent to 11,743.61 meters after initial gains.

The trade and tourism group also announced that the shares will not be sold to Thomas Cook.
Dark Matter Influences Flight of Space Probes
For years, a mysterious phenomenon in research has provided cluelessness: Dark matter influences the speed of space probes during so-called swing-by maneuvers.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity might not be entirely correct.
Nearly 18 years ago, the spacecraft "Ulysses" flew through space.
Due to the soon-to-frozen fuel lines, you are now at risk of cold death.
For years, scientists have been causing a mysterious phenomenon of confusion – the swing-by anomaly.
The Swing-by is a flight maneuver of space probes, in which they gain additional momentum in the gravitational field of a celestial body, such as Earth.
As a result, the probes can save a lot of fuel.
The Cassini-Huygens European-American research probe used this physical trick as well as the Ulysses solar probe.
However, what has surprised the researchers for years: the missiles do not behave 100 percent the way one would expect under the age-appropriate law of gravity.
Rather, there are irregularities in speed.
The probes are unexpectedly faster or slower.
So far, the physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
They baptized him swing-by anomaly.
Some experts fear that perhaps even Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity, which describes the attraction of matter through a curvature of space, might not be quite correct.
American physicist Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study from Princeton still firmly believes that Einstein was not mistaken, and tries to explain the swing-by anomaly using the so-called dark matter that astronomers in the universe have identified.
"Responsible for the anomaly could be dark matter, which could also be very close to Earth," he writes.
Space scientists have only known about the existence of dark matter for about ten years.
It is obviously an attractive force whose effect on other celestial bodies can be observed.
On the other hand, it itself is completely invisible, that is, it transmits and reflects no electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
According to the calculations of the scientists, dark matter makes up about one-fifth of the total mass of the universe.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
After ten days in the hands of their kidnappers, the tourists who have been abducted in Egypt are said to be free again, as the Italian foreign minister confirmed.
The kidnappers from Sudan had demanded several million euros of ransom money.
In a shooting before the release, six hostages were killed.
In the south of Egypt, five Germans were kidnapped.
The ransom negotiations are already underway.
Again and again, Germans get on the target of kidnappers.
WORLD ONLINE describes the most important cases.
European tourists abducted in the Sahara are apparently free.
This was reported by Egyptian state television, Arab TV channel Al-Arabija and Italian media.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release, according to reports from Italian television channel Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and the other hostages have been released.
We are just checking their health," Frattini said.
The five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian woman as well as their eight Egyptian companions are well-off and safe, Egyptian state television reported.
The 19 participants of a desert expedition are already on their way to Cairo.
The background of a shooting before the release of the hostages remains unclear: According to an Egyptian security official, the hijackers were ready to end the kidnapping before the Sudanese army surprisingly killed six of the hijackers.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed to a ransom," the officer said.
It was “just about receiving the hostages” when suddenly “this surprise” came.
On Sunday, Sudanese soldiers shot six of the hijackers in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt and arrested two of them.
The hostages had demanded a ransom of six million euros from Germany; the money was to be handed over by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The daily "El Masri El Jom" reported, citing a German mediator, the release of the hostages delayed because the kidnappers feared for their safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers want to release the female hostages after paying the ransom.
The men should be detained until the kidnappers have a safe escape route.
The German embassy in Cairo declined to comment on the report.
Abuse of stepfather "leads to suicide"
The years of abuse by her stepfather has led to a woman killing herself, a court has been reported.
Michael Trerise, 57, from Stithians, Cornwall, received a six-year prison sentence after admitting eight cases of sexual abuse.
The Truro criminal court learned that he regularly tied his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle when she was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote in a confession: "I feel responsible for her death."
The court found out that Ms. Randle killed herself at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
When she lived in Coventry as a child, Trerise had tied her up and tied her eyes before performing sexual acts while her mother was away to work in a restaurant.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s and he moved back to Cornwall.
His step-daughter went to Plymouth.
However, the court learned that Ms. Randle, who worked for the National Trust for a large part of her time voluntarily, was being persecuted by abuse that had been inflicted on her twice a week.
Prosecutor Ramsay Quaife reported to the court that friends had said that Ms. Randle, who had been a keen surfer and cyclist, had been "emotionally dead" since 2006 and had "given up her life"
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her Plymouth apartment.
It is believed that she killed herself by suffocating herself with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a letter of confession that ended in this way: "I used to tie her up and connect her eyes."
“I didn’t sexually assault her.
I feel responsible for her death.”
Judge Christopher Elwen said to Trerise: “They are an extremely strange fetishist and for her victim it must have been terrifying, especially since she was only seven.
This unpleasant story ends with the suicide of the victim.
Worse still is the fact that it is very unlikely that the matter would have ended in court if it had not done so."
He added: "I take note of the impact, as described by Stephanie's father and mother, on her daughter over the years.
She would otherwise have clearly been a promising, successful and happy young woman.”
Officials responsible for lost data will be charged
The BBC has learned that the cabinet official, who had lost strictly confidential documents in a train in June, will be charged in accordance with the "Public Security Act".
The man was deposed by the Ministry of Defence when he lost two highly confidential documents in a train to Waterloo.
The documents were handed over to the BBC before they were handed to the police.
It is the weakest charge within the law and there is no indication of criminal intent.
BBC Defense Correspondent Frank Gardner said the action was a surprise for many in Whitehall.
He said, "They thought that would be dealt with internally at the Department of Defense and Cabinet."
The employee whose name cannot be named shall be charged in accordance with paragraph 8.1 of the Act, the clause dealing with the safe storage of information.
The Royal Prosecutor’s Office recommended that the Metropolitan Police should accuse the officer of the highly sensitive nature of his work in the Joint Intelligence Committee.
The documents he published included classified assessments of Al-Quaida and the capabilities of Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was taken by his house to a secret place.
Housing companies see B&B costs in the eye
British housing companies could face more than <0xC2><0xA3>80 million in costs after the rescue of Bradford and Bingley Bank.
The government provided <0xC2><0xA3>14 billion to protect Bradford & Bingley's 2.6 million customers' deposits.
The interest on this loan is paid by all companies that receive money from investors, including the 59 construction companies.
The Director General of the Association of Housing Companies (BSA), Adrian Coles, said it was "unacceptable" that the companies and their members would have to pay.
The 14 billion loan will ultimately be repaid if Bradford & Bingley's loans are repaid.
But the interest accrued in the meantime is credited annually to those 700 financial companies that accept deposits.
The financial services compensation programme confirmed to the BBC that the 59 housing companies were included in this figure.
It is bitter that those institutions that have behaved prudently ... are now called upon to take on some of the costs of those institutions that were far less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It said that every company would have to pay in proportion to the deposits it would hold, and that the companies would have to pay together about 18% of the cost.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that interest on the loan will amount to <0xC2><0xA3>450 million in 2009.
This means that companies will have to raise <0xC2><0xA3>81 million for the first year’s interest.
Adrian Coles, the director general of the Association of Housing Companies, told the BBC that he believes this is unfair.
It is bitter that those institutions that have behaved prudently during the real estate upswing are now called upon to bear some of the costs of those institutions that were far less prudent.
According to the BSA, no company has failed since the existence of the records in 1945.
"We will be watching all aspects of this matter over the next few weeks to see what alternatives are available to protect housing companies and their members from potentially significant costs."
Interest rates due in 2009 cover the seven months from the end of September this year to the end of March.
In 2010, interest will be due for a full year and that could be almost twice as much.
Since construction companies are mutual organizations without shareholders, their members will have to pay for the costs either through higher fees or lower interest rates on savings accounts.
Milk becomes five pence per litre more expensive
People in Jersey face having to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy has announced that it will raise its milk’s wholesale price by another five pence per litre by Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after a two-pence increase in February, and comes after investigations of a consulting firm have been conducted.
Retailers should decide for themselves whether they want to pass the price increase on to their customers.
Before the price increase in February, the wholesale price of Jersey milk last changed in 2002.
Former Prime Minister of Bangladesh is denied bail
A court in Bangladesh has rejected a bail application from former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, which means she could be arrested if she returns to the country.
Her defenders said the court refused bail regarding the charge of blackmailing 50 million Taka ($729,700) from a businessman while she was prime minister.
The case is one of several floating charges of corruption against them.
Sheikh Hasina’s long-standing political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released early this month for bail.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return to Bangladesh in the next few weeks, but her party, the Awami Alliance, demanded that the military-backed transitional government first grant her full freedom.
The correspondents say that although her detention was granted to go abroad for medical treatment, it is not clear, within the framework of her release, whether she will be able to continue to remain free when she returns to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers state that she will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the decision of the Supreme Court.
"The upper court has rejected Sheikh Hasina's bail requests because it says she doesn't have to be granted bail because she is already on detention abroad to be treated abroad," her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq said.
We will file a lawsuit against the Supreme Court."
Their lawyers claim that they need bail to return to the country from abroad to prepare for the December elections.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return home after October 17, an Awami Alliance party chairman said on Sunday.
She was detained last year after the army-backed transitional government took power, but had been released from prison in June to go abroad for medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia deny all charges against themselves.
Concerns about the anti-polio initiative in Afghanistan
In the latest anti-polio initiative in Afghanistan, nearly 200,000 children have not been vaccinated due to the violence associated with the Taliban, the United Nations said.
The United Nations carried out a vaccination program in six provinces last week.
However, they were unable to reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for safety reasons.
According to a spokesman for the UN, this was the case despite the Taliban’s promise not to attack or hinder the thousands of people who carry out the vaccinations.
BskyB loses lawsuit in ITV case
BskyB has lost its lawsuit against the Competition Commission’s decision to reduce its share of competing broadcaster ITV.
The Competition Appeals Court has ordered BskyB to reduce its participation in ITV from 17.9% to below 7.5%.
Previously, the Commission had claimed that BskyB’s share distorts competition and allows it to have an unfair influence on the ITV channel.
BskyB acquired its share in 2006 by successfully preventing NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, from purchasing ITV.
In April 2007, the Competition Authority reported that BskyB’s purchase of the share of ITV raises doubts about the independence of ITV, which prompted the Competition Commission to launch an investigation.
Virgin Boss Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and the communications office Ofcom have voted against the purchase.
BskyB argued that the pressure to reduce its share of ITV was an unreasonable and exaggerated measure, especially because BskyB had announced that he would give up his voting rights.
New Investigation in the U.S. Attorney's Office
The U.S. Attorney General has commissioned a special investigator to deal with the dismissal of the nine U.S. Attorneys General in 2006.
The occasion was a report by the Inspector General of the Ministry of Justice criticizing the actions of the administrative staff.
The report criticized White House officials, legislators, and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was driven by fears that the lawyers had been dismissed for political reasons.
The special investigator Nora Dannehy is now to clarify whether the officials interrogated during the investigation have lied to the investigators in order to obstruct the judiciary.
Serious allegations including criminal proceedings have not been fully investigated or clarified, Inspector General Glenn Fine said in his report.
The appointment of a special investigator with the authority to force witnesses to testify was one of his main recommendations.
The conflict began when the Department of Justice removed nine U.S. prosecutors from their offices in December 2006.
At that time, the ministry argued that prosecutors would be dismissed due to poor work performance.
However, it was later found that the dismissed prosecutors had not been judged worse than many of their colleagues, which led many observers to regard the dismissals as politically motivated.
Some of these prosecutors were involved in the prosecution of high-ranking Republican congressmen, while others refused to investigate the allegations of election fraud by Democrats.
U.S. prosecutors are tasked with investigating and pursuing court cases for the government.
They can be dismissed at any time, but may not be dismissed for political reasons.
The then head of the Department of Justice Attorney General Alberto Gonzales has been under fire for the dismissals and has finally resigned his office.
A number of Justice Department officials have also resigned.
In particular, the report of the Inspector General has critically addressed Gonzales’ role in carrying out the “main responsibility” for dismissals, “giving up” his leadership role and showing himself “extraordinarily disinterested” in the process.
Other officials, including former chief adviser to President Bush Karl Rove, have been criticized for the lack of cooperation with investigators.
Meat Loaf's epic song to be honored
The rock star Meat Loaf will be honored during the music award ceremony "Q Award" for his epic anthem "Bat Out Of Hell".
The singer, who will accept his special golden award in London next week, said he was honored to be recognized.
The song, which lasted nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title track to Meat Loaf's 1977 hit album.
"Coldplay" leads the nominations for this year's award after it has been selected in four categories.
The editor-in-chief of the magazine "Q Magazine" Paul Rees said there were some songs that go beyond such matters as time and genre and "Bat Out Of Hell" is certainly one of them.
The song, written by Jim Steinman, required a powerful voice delivered by Meat Loaf.
It starts with an instrumental part that lasts almost two minutes.
The song was released in the UK as a single in 1979 and reached number 15 in the charts.
However, Meat Loaf’s “Bat Out Of Hell” has spent about nine years in the charts and sold more than 40 million times worldwide.
Meat Loaf, whose real name is Marvin Lee Aday, has suffered from serious health problems in recent years, one of which was an operation in 2003 due to irregular heartbeat after it collapsed on stage.
In 2007, he had to cancel concerts due to acute throat inflammation.
He later learned that he had a cyst on his vocal cord.
Obscure street in town, often forgotten and possibly soon for sale
New York City has thousands of main roads, avenues, side roads and other bypass roads, some of which are famous and some are just convenient.
Nevertheless, even for experienced taxi drivers and long-time locals, it’s hard to tell where Extra Place is, simply because most have never heard of it.
This tiny street is located in the East Village and runs from First Street to the north between Bowery and Second Avenue, without reaching Second Street.
It is 30 feet wide and 120 feet long and looks more like a dusty alley than an actively used thoroughfare.
There are also no road signs.
It is practically impossible to find them on a standard street map.
This road still has its admirers.
For example, Avalon Bay, a construction company that recently built luxurious buildings on First Street.
It wants to replant Extra Place to create a clean passage to the shops and boutiques that are expected in the new buildings.
Among the other admirers is the long-standing neighborhood, which says it is fascinated by the short alley, simply because it is one of the remains of the past of the block of houses.
However, the city administration department, which is responsible for the protection and construction of residential buildings and is responsible for the road, has no interest in maintaining them.
During a meeting of the municipal council’s land use committee this month, representatives of the city administration and Avalon Bay have drafted a proposal for the purchase of the road by the construction company.
Nevertheless, the committee prefers the road to remain in the city's hands, and has asked for a new plan to be submitted next month, according to Susan Stetzer, the district manager in the municipal council 3.
“Only very little space has remained in the possession of the city and we want Extra Place to continue to belong to the city,” she said.
“There could be offers on how to repair and operate the road, which could be done by Avalon, but we also want public access to be guaranteed.”
Avalon Bay has announced a few months ago that it will re-plant the small street and set up seats that are intended, among other things, for a café that the company wants to rent space to.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the road was made public for the first time during the meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, a spokesperson for Avalon Bay, said the company wanted to use the road, but it didn’t necessarily want to own it.
“The main concern of Avalon Bay is to renovate this dilapidated alley and make it a public meeting place,” she said, adding that the city itself had proposed the sale.
Seth Donlin, spokesman for the Department of Building Protection, said it was actually the city’s desire to sell the street, stressing that the department’s job was to develop the real estate rather than manage it.
Compared to its colorful neighborhood The Bowery, Extra Place has retained some of its historical impression.
Some believe that the road got its name in 1802 when a large farm belonging to Philip Minthorne was divided between his numerous children and a narrow strip of land was not claimed by anyone.
The back door of the music club CBGB, the punk rock monument, which was closed in 2006, opened to the Extra Place and the street is probably best known as a backdrop for the photo on the cover of Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia".
The patch was great, said Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones, who had taken the photo in November 1976.
The road was full of scrap, rags and parts of barrels, posters, leaves and ropes.
Some residents, including the bloggers who write about the gentrification of the East Village, have rejected the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that this public property, as modest as it is, should continue to remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rarity – a virtually unchanged splinter of the city that should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs the blog called "Jeremiah's Disappearing New York" (subtitled "The Book of Complaints: A Bitter Nostalgic Look at the Extinct City"), has published part of the conversation of the city's history about Extra Place, which had appeared in the 1952 magazine "The New Yorker".
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote at the time: "Extra Place is a small narrow dead end that remains dark even during the day and is characterized by rusted metal doors of warehouses, closed windows and by rain gutters flying past weekly newspapers".
With a few exceptions, the road looked just like it was recently in an evening.
A rat ran through the back of the road, not far from the door that used to lead to the CBGB, where today there is a more expensive clothing store.
Graffiti was seen on the walls and an empty beer bottle lay on the floor not far from a fresh bunch of out-of-the-box newspapers.
Some passers-by said they had rarely thought about Extra Place, but suggested that the road could be polished up a bit.
Fields, added that in his opinion, some people underestimate the appeal of the road in its current state.
The best years of my life, he said, were in the places that were dark, damp and disgusting.
Debate on bilingual education: Education in an English-speaking environment
In this issue of the Education Watch, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the positions of candidates for bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, senior research associate in Kaliphonic Studies and senior director in the Department of Educational Sciences at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is a co-author of the book "Not as good as you think: Why the middle class needs a school selection".
Addressing Hispanic voters is a complicated task.
Barack Obama’s proposals on education are a typical example of this.
Obama’s election campaign mentions that “the probability of successful completion of school with African-American and Hispanic students is lower than with white students” — which is true.
To close this gap, Obama’s education plan specifically recommends a bilingual transition phase in education for those who first learn English.
Still, the question to Obama is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which focuses on teaching in languages other than English, contradicts his interest in reducing the gap in school performance.
Take as an example "Sixth Street Prep", a primary school in eastern Los Angeles.
The majority of students are Hispanic and come from low-income families.
More than a third of the students, many of whom have only recently been in the country, learn English.
Nevertheless, in 2008, an astonishing 100 percent of fourth-grade students passed the state exam in math at a good level.
Also surprisingly, 93 percent of the children from the fourth year of school were rated good in the English exam.
This amazing success was achieved by other methods than those favored by Obama.
Sixth Street School puts its emphasis on review and practice, on constant control of knowledge and an attitude that tolerates no exceptions.
Furthermore, the school practices the approach by which education takes place in an English-speaking environment, which is exactly the point that Obama should take into account, says head of the school, Linda Mikels.
This approach places emphasis on the almost exclusive use of the English language in specialist teaching.
Ms. Mikels, who rejects the idea of bilingual education, told me that the school had a remarkable success with a student who had just come from Mexico. 12 months later, one would enter the classroom and no longer be able to recognize him.
"It works," she remarked, "it works for us."
Would Obama take a school like the "Sixth Street Prep" as a model for other schools with a large proportion of Latin American and other English learning students?
The school’s achievements would make the answer to this question easy, but the educational positions within its own party (the national educational associations have long supported the idea of bilingual education) and its own consistent support of bilingual education make predictions about Obama’s response uncertain.
While agreeing to the point that immigrants should learn English, he recently trivialized the issue by noting that people should stop worrying about the legislation targeting “English only.”
Instead, he said, “You should make sure your child can speak Spanish.”
If Obama actually wants to close the performance gap, he should carefully consider educational models that work rather than despise and trivialize them.
Oil prices fall as a result of renewed fears about the economy
The price of oil fell sharply on Monday due to fears that even the US bailout plan for the financial markets might not be enough to revive the economy.
Crude oil futures on the New York Stock Exchange fell 7 percent to $99.80 per barrel in the morning session.
Since last Monday, the price has fallen by more than $20.
Over the past two weeks, the goods markets have been shaken by financial turbulence on Wall Street and strong hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After prices peaked at $145.29 per barrel in July, they dropped to almost $90 per barrel this month, then again, as a result of the huge uncertainty in financial markets.
On Monday, investors showed concern again, although congressional representatives had announced that they had agreed on a rescue plan on the weekend, which should be the largest in history.
This news was overshadowed by new concerns that the financial crisis was still far from over.
In the last chapter of the growing crisis, according to a government announcement on Monday, Citigroup is expected to buy the banking business of Wachovia Corporation.
Meanwhile, Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalized the European financial group Fortis.
According to analysts at Barclays Capital, despite the tense negotiations that took place over the weekend and led to a rescue plan, it appears that the mood in the markets has not been able to revive.
As the economic situation continues to deteriorate, it is expected that demand for goods, including oil, will continue to decline.
Analysts at Deutsche Bank wrote in a statement to investors that forecasts for global capital markets, interest rates and exchange rates had become extremely uncertain.
We believe they continue to write that the goods markets will also be affected.
“From the perspective of commodity markets, we are most concerned about whether the US virus is spreading worldwide, especially to China.”
The Bank’s analysts have adjusted their expectations for oil consumption downwards due to weak economic growth for the coming year, and their forecasts for the oil and gas price for 2009 decreased by 20%.
Team record set by series in the second quarter
Interior defender Shaun Ellis thought he’d seen everything after he’d been in the Jets jersey more often than anyone else in the last eight and a half years.
Then on Sunday he saw the second quarter, in which the jets turned a scoreless game into a triumphant move.
"I've never seen anything like this before," Ellis said.
After a sloppy game between the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals, which matched the bad weather, the second quarter began.
However, when quarterback Brett Favre’s pass arrived at Lavernues Coles for a 12-yard touchdown, it marked the perfect start to an afternoon when their evolving collaboration made a giant leap forward.
Favre found Coles in this quarter for two more touchdowns, which one time slipped out as an outside defender and the other time 10 seconds before the end of the half-time.
“I didn’t make much effort,” says Coles about the passes that went to Coles.
“He’s a super player.
Our vote was right, no matter what people think.”
While Favre and Cole's catch played, the defense quarterback Kurt Warner took apart.
Darrelle Revis took off an unlucky throw and turned it into a 32-yard touchdown.
Libero Erik Smith came to another pass and caught him off.
Linebacker David Bowens then caused a loss of Warner.
The last ball loss, forced at Bowens, was probably the craziest.
The Cardinals had captured the ball with another 10 seconds left in the game when the Jets took the ball back and Jay Feely turned a 20 yard shot to 34 to 0 lead.
These were the most points the jets had ever scored in a quarter.
When asked to describe the madness, Erik Mangini, the Jets coach, replied, "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
Responding to both, as the Jets conceded 21 points in the third quarter without scoring a single, Mangini said, "Believe me, I enjoyed the second quarter more than the third.
A lot of points were scored in a short time."
Rested Gebrselassie beats his world record
Haile Gebrselassie from Ethiopia has once again shown why some consider him the best long-distance runner of all time, having broken his own record at the Berlin Marathon on Sunday and becoming the first person to make the 42.2 kilometres in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With the victory on the flat course in 2:03:59, Gebrselassie improved his previous result of 2:04:26 by 27 seconds, which he had achieved in Berlin last year.
Gebrselassie, 35, has thus set his 26th world record in his versatile career, in which he has achieved at least one world championship title or set a world record on every track from one kilometre to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie dropped out of the Olympic marathon in Beijing, fearing that air pollution might exacerbate his asthma problems.
Instead, he signed up for the competition in Berlin.
In almost ideal conditions - at sun and 9 degrees at the start and 13 degrees at the finish - Gebrselassie has won with an average speed of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
Since railway runners such as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat from Kenya switched on long-distance routes, the record time for marathon has fallen by more than 2 minutes in the last 10 years, since Ronaldo da Costa from Brazil won in 1998 in Berlin with the result 2:06:05.
After his victory on Sunday, Gebrselassie told the press that he had had cramps in his calf two weeks ago and was therefore unable to train for a week.
Apparently, after a break, he was refreshed and returned unroasted.
"I'm so happy," he told reporters.
“Everything went perfectly.
I resumed training a week ago and had some concerns today, but in the end everything was great."
He has been criticized for overarching his races, avoiding many of the world’s best marathon stars in general, relying too much on the race leaders as if it were a track race, and setting world records on the competition.
But this criticism hardly harms the size of Gebrselassies as long-distance runners.
Accompanied by four Kenyans on Sunday, Gebrselassie had reached the centre of the track at 1:02:04.
Two elite runners from Kenya, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi have continued to challenge Gebrselassie after the pacemakers had slowed down.
A little more than three miles before the finish, Gebrselassie made his last move to separate himself from Kwambai, who came second in 2:05:36 and thus improved his best time by almost 5 minutes.
Kamathi was third in 2:07:48.
In women, Irina Mikitenko, originally from Kazakhstan and now German, has completed a remarkable year by showing the seventh fastest result of all time at 2:19:19.
The world record of 2:15:25 holds Paul Radcliff from the UK.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko surprisingly won the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She missed the games in Beijing due to problems described as a back injury, but she recovered to win in Berlin and improve her best time in her third marathon by five minutes.
She has cleverly planned her run by letting out a quartet of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners but overtaking after 30 kilometers.
Askale Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia was second in 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop from Kenya arrived third in 2:25:01.
The pride and hardships in the life of the black population, in a city of a very special kind
Hidden between the outgrowths of theme parks around Orlando, a few miles from the glittering, loud and gigantic bustle, lies a quiet city where the pride and complications of African-American culture come to light.
Eatonville, the first completely black town in the country and the hometown of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as easy to describe as Hurston did in 1935: "the city with 5 lakes, three croquet courts, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, more than enough guava, 2 schools and no prison."
Today it is a pilgrimage site.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville to commemorate the most famous author of the Harlem Renaissance.
And yet, the city she describes – and which made her a tourist destination by including her in the Florida guide, which was produced by the Federal Writers Project during the Depression – is in many ways a place of a very special kind.
Eatonville is so independent, dignified, and private as in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural black communities in Florida often refused to share their true thoughts with the white man who "knows so little about us that he doesn't know what he's missing."
Even today, in a year when a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, calls for an open conversation about racial relations, many here are still tired of being watched by outsiders.
“We are very concerned about how our story is told,” says Hortense Jones, 59, from birth to a resident of the city and a parishioner of the oldest church in the city.
It has to be right."
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and struggle.
It is both a historical example of the black movement and a community of almost 2,400 inhabitants, where the poverty rate is twice as high as the national average.
It is, on the one hand, a stronghold of literature and, on the other hand, an example of the - sometimes condemned, sometimes praised - black culture of the rural South, which has its roots in American slavery.
It is not surprising that residents here are both proud and on the hat.
And rightly so, the concerns about Eatonville's image actually began with Zora, as everyone here calls Hurston.
She introduced her hometown to the world in books that came from the heart and were written in oral art, such as "Mules and Men" (1953) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1973)
Five paragraphs in the Florida guide changed the city, which is very close to Route 77, a road that leads through the often-forgotten center of Florida, to the scenes of black history and human drama.
Freckled like Oskar in both real life and literature, Hurston led readers to the shop of Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then turned to more private affairs.
"Aside the road to the left," she wrote, "is the brown-white painted modern school, with its well-kept gardens and playgrounds that Howard Miller always cares about, although he can hardly read and write."
She also mentioned the new husband of widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "sold drinks of any kind and what-even-always fits into hourly rooms."
In just a few hundred words, Hurston linked Eatonville to self-government, but also to illiteracy, second marriage, and sex.
This was certainly not a guide.
In fact, this was not a portrait that was appreciated by everyone.
"Zora described things as they were," said 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of the Johnson girls who immortalized Hurston, citing the men who sang songs about her beauty that were full of sexual allusions.
She added, “Some people don’t like this.”
One still remembers Hurtson as a lively eccentric who returned regularly after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Augustus Franklin, 77, remembered that when Hurston came into town, she usually did so without warning, in a noisy Chevrolet, smoking and wearing pants, in a city that even today imagines something of her venerable style of clothing.
According to Mr. Franklin, most of the inhabitants were fascinated, while many despised them.
"People were always happy to see Zora," Mr Franklin said.
But "she never stayed too long," he added while swinging in his chair, on a rear facing terrace overlooking Lake Sabelia, in which Hurston was probably baptized.
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were out of print.
Along with most of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten them.
Although she was once a famous author, a contemporary long-sister Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an anonymous grave in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she lived.
In Eatonville there was no great commemoration, no public readings in the grand style.
“I don’t think they understood their contribution in the world or their legacy in the least,” said Valerie Boyd, author of “Wrapped in Rainbows,” a 2003 biography about Hurston.
The turn came in the 80s.
Orange County authorities wanted to lay a five-lane highway through the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the slow two-lane main street of the community.
Orlando’s suburbs had already pushed Highway 4 through the western outskirts of the city.
The proposal was made when Eatonville was still recovering from a difficult phase in its history.
Forced integration, among other things, had put an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the fight against racial mixing brought hatred into the community.
“At this time, a bunch of white boys often came and they threw oranges and stuff at the people sitting away,” Mr. Franklin said.
“There was even a woman who was killed.
They threw a watermelon out of the car.”
In 1955, in a letter to the Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the Supreme Court’s demand to enforce integration by calling its decision against the school council in Brown’s case “insulting rather than respecting my race.”
Residents today say that although the repeal of racial segregation was positive in some respects, it weakened the group cohesion in Eatonville and the self-confidence of its youth.
“Black children were used to being embraced — I remember — one embraced his teacher in the morning and one embraced his teacher in the evening,” said N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and managing director of the non-profit group to protect the Eatonville community.
This could be maintained for so long, she added, until teachers and students no longer came from the same place.
"You didn't hug his white teacher because he was a white teacher - I mean there's a cultural divide there," Nathiri said.
However, civil rights have contributed to the creation of space for other Zora Neale Hurstons - black writers, actors, and artists who disregarded prejudice, as they did, with positive self-confidence and statements such as, "How can anyone deny the joy of my society!
I don't understand."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker set out on her way to Hurston’s nameless grave and began to fight for the resurgence of her fame.
Five years later, a highly acclaimed Hurston biography by Robert E. Hemenway was to be found in the bookshelves, and once again made them part of the American literary canon.
The long-distance road project came at a time when Eatonville’s most famous daughter was once again in the public eye.
And this time Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a savior.
The community began planning a Hurston Festival in 1988 to show what the district could destroy with the construction of the highway.
Thousands of fans came to the opening event two years later, and every January many return for the celebration.
A few years later, the district turned away from its road construction plans.
"The plans of a five-lane long-distance road revived the city, accelerated it at top speed, aroused real citizen pride," said Nathiri.
Mrs. Boyd put it a little easier: "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory against the long-distance road project has contributed to a change in the self-image of the city.
There were more and more train trips, such as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who has been going to church here since 1993, and locals began to re-evaluate the past.
Eatonville was incorporated into the national historical register in 1998.
A new one-story library (named after Hurston) opened in 2006 on the newly paved and beautified Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville is still a special feature in Florida: only 6 miles from downtown Orlando, it can sometimes feel like a back alley in the summer rain, as small as it was when it was founded by only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(It is 90% black today.)
Outsiders looking for the history of Eatonville and its importance are often still treated with caution.
For most interviews, prior approval is necessary and certain things - such as the mural of Eatonville's oldest church, painted by a white man and depicting black men in fieldwork - may not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Mrs. Jones, a courageous, self-confident teacher with a fondness for dark red, still fear that their shielded community will be misunderstood.
And yet, at the same time as the Hurston Festival grew larger, an increased degree of domestic pride was also born.
Especially young people tend to see Eatonville as Hurston saw their entire race: beautiful, with all its problems, neither worse nor better and just as proud, creative and diligent, silly and intertwined as any other racial and ethnic group in America.
It is the sincere love of this city that can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin’s nephew, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who intends to return to Eatonville after college to work in the city administration or in the police force who, according to him, might need some help.
And even the younger ones, such as Alondra and Alexia Kenon, eleven-year-old twins from Winter Park, have learned to correctly describe Eatonville.
“Most people who only go through here will think, ‘Oh, this city is nothing compared to all the others,’” Alondra Kenon said on a Sunday after the church.
"But if you actually stop and look at its history for a moment, it's a very beautiful city."
Here in New York, we speak fluently of finance.
At first glance, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from the newspaper stands and the huge television screens in Times Square, they would not even notice that they are in the middle of a debacle.
They would never believe that over their heads, in the shoebox-like offices with the glass facades, bankers and hedge fund managers who have the monopoly in New York City, daily have the worst horror work day since the stock market crash of 1929.
Suppliers still push the metal tea carts along sidewalks with loud clappers and carry trays loaded with muffins for breakfast sessions.
Latinos still slurp between apartments, as human packers laden with around 50 ironed t-shirts hung on a yoke-like rod lying on their shoulders.
Office workers are still waiting for their breakfast stalls on the sidewalks and it is still impossible to get a yellow taxi on a weekday between 4 pm and 7 pm.
It didn’t feel like a crisis at all until Thursday afternoon I decided to open a new savings account due to all of the world’s downturn.
Although I had decided to put my mandatory time on the quiet late afternoon at my JP Morgan Chase regular branch, there were already about 20 people in line.
Not at the cash desks to withdraw or deposit money, but at the customer service desk where regular customers order checkbooks, ask tourists about the way to Macy's department store and where new customers open accounts.
Most of them before me, so I later learned from Starr, my “personal bank employee with license,” stood for the same reason as me snake.
However, unlike me, they had already lifted their savings from smaller banks, in places from where they commuted, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Staten Island.
They had raised money from so-called Thrifts (a little like a building savings bank), cooperative banks and those local savings banks that only have branches in one state, and say they treat their customers like family.
Last year, 15 of these banks went silent and quietly bankrupt.
In the last few days, Washington Mutual, a bank with assets of $327 billion, went into bankruptcy administration over and as last Friday New Yorker drove home over the weekend, was Wachovia, another bank that owns savings of $440 billion, in search of a saving buyer.
Fearing another collapse, the office and shop workers who stood in front of me brought their cash to a bank that is considered a safe haven, a bank that is responsible for most bailouts on Wall Street.
Quite normal New Yorkers have acquired a flowing financial literacy in the last few weeks.
A woman who telephoned in my Chinese tribal supermarket took so much familiarity with Lehman Brothers, the bankrupt bank and its emaciated-looking CEO, Dick Fuld, as if she were slandering a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, who is around the 50-year-old uniformed concierge of my apartment block, has gotten away from our usual entertainment topics about Brad and Angelina and my food delivery.
“I now have all my savings in money market funds,” she told me after my visit to the bank.
"I've changed, I'm not going to take a risko anymore."
Muslim graves damaged during right-hand slide in Austria
Heinz-Christian Strache, a left-wing judge of the Austrian right-wing Freedom Party of Austria, and Filip Dewinter, member of the Belgian right-wing Pertei Vlaams Belang, will take part in a demonstration in Antwerp on Thursday, 17 January 2008, to represent the organisation "Cities against Islamization".
They carry signs in the style of traffic signs on which a mosque is depicted, crossed with a red line.
The police accuse right-wing extremists of being buried in a Muslim cemetery in Austria, on the same weekend in which extremely right-wing parties make significant gains in the country’s parliamentary elections.
On the night of Friday to this morning, more than 90 graves were severely damaged at the cemetery in Traun near Linz in an action, according to police, organized.
The perpetrators sprayed Jewish symbols like the David Stern on some of the graves, but criminal officials consider this an attempt to disguise the motive of extremists driven by hatred of Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident is in any way related to the elections.
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said they were “deeply shaken” by the news of the grave-bombing that took place as the religious month of Muslim Ramadan is coming to an end.
At the same time, there is a round of conscience research in Austria after the country slipped to the right in yesterday’s parliamentary election.
The FP<0xC3><0x96> and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, the two far-right parties who received almost 30% of the votes, advocated a strict anti-immigrant law in their election campaign and some of their electoral slogans were criticized as xenophobic by opponents.
Heinz-Christian Strache, chairman of the FP<0xC3><0x96>, who won 18% of the vote, advocated a ban on headscarves and burkas and even expressed his dislike of food that is generally associated with Islam.
At his last rally in Vienna, he spoke of a "European Brotherhood" to prevent the growth of Islam.
Both parties want to ban the construction of mosques and minarets with the argument that these are political symbols of the continuous Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Surveys and analyses carried out immediately after the election, stating that the extreme rights are the most politically powerful bloc in the country, suggest that this new development is based on young voters who are worried about their future in the European Union.
International travel ban for Gary Glitter
Gary Glitter, the glam rock star convicted of child sexual abuse, has been banned from travelling to France and Spain.
Judges imposed a six-month lock on Glitter after informing the authorities controlling him that he wanted to travel to Spain via France.
The Kent police were granted a foreign travel ban last Thursday after they presented evidence of Glitter’s criminal convictions for child sexual abuse to the judges.
Glitter, real name Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at the Ashford District Court in Kent, but was represented by the law firm Corker Binning.
On Thursday, 25 September, the Kent police at the Ashford District Court requested permission to prevent travel abroad from Mr. Paul Glad to France and Spain until 25 March.
Paul Gadd was not personally present."
As required by the sex offender registry, Glitter, 64, had informed authorities that he wanted to travel abroad.
He must notify the authorities if he wishes to travel abroad for more than three days.
He must also notify the police 7 days before his planned departure.
Failure to notify the authorities could result in a five-year prison sentence.
Police in Kent said they would not discuss individual cases or glitters of possible whereabouts in the country.
A spokeswoman for Kent's police unit said, "The Kent police will do everything necessary to protect children in this country and abroad."
"We believe it is easier to control someone who is in the UK because we have a comprehensive system to effectively prevent any potential risks."
"It is the primary concern of the Kent police to protect Kent's residents and we are working closely together to monitor the behavior of registered sex offenders in the country to minimize any risk that could exist for the population.
Glitter returned to the UK last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abuse on 2 girls aged 10 and 11.
When he was released, Glitter flew to Bangkok, where he was scheduled to take a flight to London.
But he said he was not feeling well and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not let him through passport control and he flew to Hong Kong after some time.
The Chinese authorities also refused him entry and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and border officials insisted that he return to Britain.
Finally, he arrived at Terminal 3 in Heathrow on 22 August and stayed there while his lawyer David Corker went to the Uxbridge Court in West London, as Scotland Yard had successfully asked for permission to register as a sex offender.
Glitter had previously been detained in the United Kingdom for 4 months in 1999 for possession of images of child abuse.
According to the Interior Ministry, Interior Minister Jacqui Smith was reassured and satisfied that glitter was prevented from travelling to France and Spain.
<0x60>I receive the master behind the stage to retain his character,' Günter Brauer, photographer.
No heels, no ruffles, no costumes for the performance.
The nature of the great flamenco dancers who dispense with concentration and dedicate themselves to interpretation in order to get a relaxed look as a woman or as a man.
On the one hand, artists
On the other hand, personality
I look into private life, into those moments that are foreign to the audience, I know when I can find typical gestures for the personality, the depth of a stolen look or the expressive strength of the hands that are concerned because they will not enter the stage.
In his project <0x60>Flamenco-people', the German photographer Günter Bauer presents varied theatricality of some stage productions with singers, dancers and guitarists, from which he was still little known to the artists.
With this proposal, the photographer creates a special iconography of flamenco representation at different levels.
The exhibition, which is part of the Flamenco Photography Month’s program, “reflects the international importance of Flamenco, which is increasing day by day,” explains the artist, making it clear that Flamenco-people can be any human being, but when you look at the photos, the viewer notices that there are no typical pictures of artists on stage.
Quite normal people on the portraits are artists who are able to convey passion, sadness, joy on stage and thus move the audience.
In order to capture the personality of these artists, you do not have to take photos on stage.
Her personality and character are in her heart.
What interested me was to create a personal atmosphere that would allow me to capture the characters of the greatest flamenco masters with the camera.
Bauer, inspired by the Festival ‘Cante de las Minas’, set out on a long journey in 1997 to photograph singers, guitarists or dancers with a digital camera.
Thanks to the image sorting function of the camera and the existing material, images were created, reminiscent of classical photography.
The use of various stylistic means destroys the classical basis of the image, giving the image the modernity and the idea of how the farmer understands flamenco: ‘music with traditional roots that change and surprise every day’.
These are not only the dance, the singing or the instrumental play itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, who seduces the audience with his art.
The search for the essential, for a certain something that becomes visible in the form of hearing, being, is and was the fixed goal of this work, which will be presented in the gallery of El Fot<0xC3><0xB3>mata in the near future.
Famous figures in Flamenco include Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo and others are among the close selection of nearly seventy artists photographed.
The project became an anthology of flamenco and will soon appear as a book, with all the portraits from the exhibition.
Bauer's passion for the portraits led him to revisit this idea two years ago and to realize it as 'portraits of the veterans of sports' ('SportARTproject').
Although the concepts of the project <0x60>Flamenco-people' are different, the photographer likes to <0x60>it's very much to photograph people, get to know them and put me in their state of life, whether for a short moment or a longer time.
I think that in the field of photography, the portrait is the most difficult genre.
You meet or meet people, personalities you sometimes don’t know at all, or they leave you alone for a few minutes to take a photo.
Apart from these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to realize my ideas.”
The collection of the portraits of Flamenco of today entitled 'Flamenco-people' is exhibited in the gallery of El Fot<0xC3><0xB3>mata, which is located in the street called la calle de la Mata and runs parallel to the street la Alameda de Hércules. The exhibition can be visited until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa admits that the Roma he is currently writing is “a madman.”
He does not yet know where the plot of the novel takes place and what it is about, but Mario Vargas Llosa persistently tries to advance the project he is currently working on, a novel with the protagonist Roger Casemant, a nationalist from Ireland who lived in the Congo for twenty years and moved to the Amazon region.
Yesterday, during his presence at the Festival Hay Festival Segovia, the preferred Nobel laureate admitted that the project he’s dealing with is “a fickleness” and “everything points to the fact that he doesn’t have to write the novel.”
‘If I had thought, I would not have done it, but I will do it and hope to end the novel at some point,’ he concluded his participation in the festival, where the ideas, thoughts and words were exchanged. Within the four days he has seen hundreds of writers, historians, journalists and thousands of people who were in Segovia.
The author of <0x60>La ciudad y los perros' was one of the most outstanding personalities at the third festival and made predictions.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival’s Premium and voted for most of the attendees, is compared to the old edition of ‘Our mutual friend’ and can be seen at the Juan Bravo Theatre.
He was introduced by Félix Romeo, and found that he had an audience before him, which was a reflection of his vocation, which was a reflection of his vocation, which was not enough time for the Peruvian, who had a wonderful memory and a great sense of humor, to be able to go through it all again: how his vocation to literature came about, which came from <0x60>extraordinary adventure', from <0x60>s delight in reading', and from <0x60>his desire to experience' to experience,'.
The Hispanic novelist admitted that there is ‘no way’ of measuring and knowing whether books change life, ‘but I refuse to believe that literature is pure entertainment, a fleeting experience,’ Vargas Llosa stressed, who claims that it ‘makes sense’ and ‘does not leave the writer’s responsibilities apart.’
At the festival in Pozoblanco, the weather did not play along: bullfight parties were partially cancelled.
After the announced bullfighters found that the ground of the square was in poor condition, the bullfighting festival, with which the festival was to be concluded in Pozoblanco, was moved to yesterday morning.
Thus, with the consent of Ferm<0xC3><0xAD>n Boh<0xC3><0xB3>rquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez, the organizer decided to postpone the bullfighting festival.
Thus, the festival was subjected to unstable weather, which is why two out of three celebrations could not take place.
On Saturday it rained, which is why the second planned bullfighting festival could not be celebrated.
The group of matadors consisted of José Luis Moreno, Curro D<0xC3><0xAD>as and Juan Bautista, who gradually entered the bullring arena.
There was only a celebration on Friday.
The winner was Daniel Luque, who cut three ears and triumphed after which he had left the passage with pleasure and aesthetics.
That same evening, Alejandro Talavante met two horns and an ear of the bull, which he had succeeded more by galloping than by his bullfighting art.
And even worse was El Juli, who went through the Arena de Los Llanos without difficulty, but also without fame.
After he had fought so badly, a large part of the audience responded during his second fight with Buh-Rufen.
In <0xC3><0x81>lava, two people wanted to escape the control of their car, which was loaded with two thousand kilos of hashish.
Tomorrow: five minutes before ten.
Traffic controls in Ertzaintza, in the urban area of Armi<0xC3><0xB1>on (<0xC3><0x81>lava).
Two police officers asked the drivers of the car to stop, and they took the escape.
It looked as if they would not have to stop with the load of more than two thousand kilos of hashish.
Police tracked her down and arrested one of the drivers, the man who is 28 years old, known as A. A. J., as the Interior Ministry of the Basque State reported.
The arrested person was accused of drug trafficking and falsification of official documents.
The incident occurred when the traffic police of the <0xC3><0x81>lava region had already completed traffic control on the N-1 and passed through the urban area of Armi<0xC3><0xB1>on.
They decided to stop a car to carry out the route control. The driver did not follow the instructions, suddenly increased the speed and tried to escape the control.
The police began the chase until the car stopped after a few kilometers on the edge of the strip, and at that moment the drivers got out of the car to escape to a wooded area via a country road.
In the car, an Iveco Daily, the drug dealers transported 2,178 kilos of hashish, which was confiscated by the police.
The front part of the car was loaded with hashish bundles, which were later routed to other police stations for accurate laboratory analysis and weighing the bundles.
In addition, the officials found that the license plate was <0x60>doubled', so that it did not match the license plate specified in the car papers, which is why there was additionally a arrest for falsifying official documents.
The police of the city of Ertzaintza continue the investigation to carry out the arrest of the second suspect, who, as already mentioned, was able to flee, but also to determine the origin of the confiscated drugs.
The arrested 28-year-old A. A. J. was taken to a police station for interrogation. He will be presented to the judge in the next hours.
Actress Heather Locklear was arrested for driving under the effect of an unknown drug.
Actress Heather Locklear, known for the role of Amanda in the Melrose Place series, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara, California, for driving under the effect of an unknown drug.
A witness observed how she was trying in a rather strange way to get out of her parking lot in Montecito, California traffic police spokesman told People magazine.
The witness explained in detail that Locklear pushed through the accelerator after 4:30 p.m. and made a lot of noise trying to move her car backwards or forwards out of the parking lot, and as she drove backwards, she grabbed her sunglasses a few times.
A little later, the witness, who at first probably had not recognized the actress, saw Locklear stopping on a nearby street and exiting the car.
The witness was the person who notified the emergency service because she had ‘fear of Locklear’s life.’
When the police arrived, they found the actress sitting in her car, which stood across the street, blocking traffic.
“She seemed to be unoriented,” so they took the police to a special drug and alcohol center to take a test.
According to a police spokesman, the actress showed herself cooperative, excessive drinking was excluded from the first moment. <0x60>The first observations of the officials resulted, we believe, that Locklear was under the influence of an unknown drug,' said the spokesman.
Locklear was arrested under suspicion of driving under the influence of an undetermined substance that could not be determined and taken to a local detention centre around 7 p.m.
Two months ago, Locklaer was released from the Arizona clinic after treatment, where she was treated for anxiety and depression.
Llamazares insists that the Andalusian Association of the United Left be responsible for the Silva case.
Gaspar Llamazares, the VL’s chief coordinator and United Left MP, has today assured that the regional association for education will be the one to make the decision in the case of the former Seville City Council for Youth and Sport, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after being accused of doing business with family members.
“In such cases, I am a great federalist, and the Andalusian organization will be the one who has to take responsibility for it,” Llamazares pointed out, “what course of action the party must take towards the city council of Seville.”
Nevertheless, the Chairman of the VL defended the need for ‘transparency’ in the possible investigations of the rule violations that Silva might have begun: ‘The VL always insisted that such cases receive maximum transparency’.
With regard to this issue, he stressed that education has “a strict ethical code for all public offices.”
<0x60>Sangre de mayo': Hero Book of Garci
Inspired by <0x60>Episodios Nacionales' by Benito Pérez Gald<0xC3><0xB3>s, José Luis Carci in <0x60>Sangre de mayo' represents the revised version of the famous uprising of the Spaniards against the French. This is an admirable film in filmography, with approximately 15 million euros of investment in filmmaking.
In this way, the Cineast has tried to portray ‘a multitude of personalities and social analysis’, which he has always admired in the works of the famous novelist, Carci explained today at the presentation of the film with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarr<0xC3><0xAD>a at the beginning of a long list of the actors.
<0x60>Sangre de mayo' with a film length of more than two and a half hours, will be presented in cinemas this Friday and later shown on Telemadrid as a four-hour miniseries.
José Luis Garci, a big fan of Gald<0xC3><0xB3>s's literature, assures that thanks to this film his <0x60>Child's Dream' came true. This is thanks to Esperanza Aguirre, who commissioned him three years ago from the autonomous community of Madrid to make a commemorative film for the second century celebration in Madrid. Especially because the story was based on <0x60>Episodis'.
The total contribution of 15 million made by the autonomous community of Madrid for filming, Garci offers, as he added, the ‘one-off opportunity’ with the help of decorations and corresponding clothing, the image of ‘confused Spain, who chose the false leader for the struggle, because the people had been set aside by the struggle for independence and under the rule of Ferdinand VII.’
However, the Cineast regrets that it was not possible to count on funding as at <0x60>Alatriste' or <0x60>Los fantasmas de Goya' (twice as high as at <0x60>Sangre de mayo'), so some scenes from the screenplay with Horacio Valc<0xC3><0xA1>rcel, with whom Garci worked almost his entire career, could not be filmed.
For this reason, Garci, who was also film director in <0x60>Volver a empezar', has been involved in his usual way of working: he set himself on stage with the actors, with whom one has to try first before one starts to shoot and for those who had not done casting, he appeared <0x60>humiliating' and creating respect in the cinema industry, <0x60>knowing' the cinema, <0x60>being a part of the film's profession.
Many actors he meets in Sangre de mayo have to repeat in front of his camera, as in the case of Miguel Rell<0xC3><0xA1>n, Carlos Larra<0xC3><0xB1>aga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garci, Oscar candidate in four nominations (one of which he won one), is of the opinion and assured that none of the three candidates representing Spain this year before the Academy of Hollywood is a young generation of Spanish filmography. Neither <0x60>Sangre de mayo', nor <0x60>Siete mesas de billar francés' nor finally the selected film <0x60>Losol gire's.
Garci does not expect any awards for this film.
“In the beginning you think you’re working for posterity, later you realize it’s only for success, and now you’re satisfied if you’ve produced another film,” Garci explains after more than 30 years of work.
Isabel Bay<0xC3><0xB3>n calls back the memory of the dancer from Seville T<0xC3><0xB3>rtola Valencia
A flamenco dancer from Seville adores a dancer who also comes from Seville.
Carmen T<0xC3><0xB3>rtola Valencia: her father was Catalan (Floren<0xC3><0xA7> T<0xC3><0xB3>rtola Ferrer) and her mother Andalucia (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), she was born in the Triana district and when she was three years old, her family moved to London.
She was a dancer and expert in oriental dances.
She had an exciting life, she was one of the first fighters for the emancipation of the woman, such as Isadora Ducan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist, a vegetarian, and advocated for the abolition of the corset, which limited the free female movement.
The life of this woman, who left her mark on the dance and aesthetic revolution in Europe in the time between the wars, fascinated Isabel Bay<0xC3><0xB3>n.
“I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she suggested this role to me, which seemed impossible to me.”
“We’re not trying to tell about her life without preserving her esprit,” said the flamenco dancer.
Your dance basics helped me a lot in Flamenco.
<0x60>The dance of the butterfly' appeared to me, for example, as Guajira, or <0x60>the dance of the serpent' as Tango.
Her dancing was sensual and I have been told that my dancing is also in this aesthetic area," she claims.
The production expects two extraordinary collaborations: with Miguel Poveda, who will once again sing for Isabel at one of her performances, as he did in <0x60>La puerta abierta'; and with flamenco master Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to work with one of her ex-students.
Matilde plays T<0xC3><0xB3>rtola, a very mature personality.
I’m happy because she agreed to participate in my work, and I feel very honored.”
The production is also expected with musical composition and the guitarists Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s Torres and Paco Arriaga, with the vocals of Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Mor<0xC3><0xB3>n; with the percussion of El P<0xC3><0xA1>jaro, as well as the viola of Rafa el Viola and the collaboration with the actor Juanfra J<0xC3><0xBA>arez, he <0xCC><0x81>re in love with the role of the artist <0xCC><0x81>s accompaniment, he <0xCC><0x81> divas, he <0xCC><0x81>
This work also tells in a certain way about the life of this woman, who became known in places as far away as India, the United States or Russia, and also throughout Europe, although she usually lived in London.
“I wanted to recall them, because I think they are one of the women who have an enormous influence on a particular era and whose works no one knows anymore and therefore they appreciate even less,” Bay<0xC3><0xB3>n claims.
The performance will take place today at 20:30 at the Lope de Vega Theatre.
The publication of the book <0x60>Diario de un poeta recién casado' also includes the Triennium
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of <0x60>Diario de un poeta recién casado' at Saint Stephen's Church (New York), in a place where Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Jiménez married in 1916, offers a corresponding atmosphere to carry out planned activities on behalf of the Andalusian Council for Culture to celebrate the <0x60>Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n' (2006-2008).
Thus <0x60>the Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n' will be completed with the new edition of this work, with the international congress that takes place in New York, with the restoration of the house museum of Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Jiménez-Zenobia and with the walking exhibition <0x60>Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Jiménez: <0x60>Aquel chopo de luz' will be presented in the course of New York City, which was opened in May and after which was opened in May.
The Andalusian Council for Culture has also received eight hundred copies of <0x60>Diario de un poeta recién casado', published by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Pacobo Pérez-Enciso. The aim is to make the person and work of the Andalusian world poet more famous.
The U.S. Can Think Bad Without Paul Newman
Sometimes God creates perfect personalities.
Paul Newman was one of them.”
This sentence comes from the actress Sally Field, who worked with him in ‘Sensation Reporter’, and from the then-dominant notion of American cinema, which was abandoned, from all over America to Newman, who came up with his enthralling notion and followed it.
Look what it cost him to give him the Oscar.
When he retired in 2007.
And he knew he was very sick.
Nevertheless, it was a big blow for everyone.
“What one sometimes feels is much more than an expression, and now I’ve lost a great friend,” said Robert Redford, crying, “my life and my country were the greatest drolls of his life.”
No one was afraid to ridicule or exaggerate.
As the ‘father’ of cinema and fatherland, he died in a sad moment, in which fear of terrorists prevails and of market collapse, in which the depressed self-esteem of Americans is in the hopeless search for reasons to regain dignity.
If in this hard time without virtue few people remain to be admired, you don’t necessarily have to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all, he almost embodied a Platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official enemy of Richard Nixon and suffered as various losses as well as gains: from the foundation dedicated to the fight against drugs and in honor of his son from the first marriage, who died of overdose, was founded up to his own brand of home-made and organic products.
All of this is a gift for the country in which it took a lot of effort to assert itself against a deadly food culture.
A broad wave of surprise strikes high above Hollywood without regard to nationalities and nationality.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, confirmed that not only one person has died, but the entire era.
The Englishman Sam Mendes, film director and Oscar laureate, said that working with Newman was no more or no less than the top of his career.
Russell Crowe, the evil boy who came from Australia, dared to call Newman his greatest inspiration.
“We left the greatest of us all,” confirmed George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who dared to live today as Paul Newman lived: getting high demands on fairness, leading a responsible private life, far away from the cameras.
This is not always easy or not even possible in today’s media jungle.
But there's someone trying, and Paul Newman was an example of that.
He divorced once and was then married to Joanne Woodward for fifty years, whom he was loyal to, although there were certainly many opportunities not to be.
‘Why should I eat a hamburger on the street when I have fillet at home?’ he joked often himself.
In heaven, he will be proud that on earth his daughters have the same opinion as his fans, which is not necessarily common in America.
“Of all the great roles he played, none of them were as proud as those of the faithful spouse, the loving father, the attentive grandfather, and those of the philanthropist,” they say.
The streets in Madrid are inadequate for the Olympic Games.
Yes, the dream of many of us is to host some Olympic disciplines in Madrid, after the failure for 2012, it may well be 2016.
But I ask myself, ‘Are we prepared for this?’
Yes, we follow the example of the old streets, I say that it is not true!
It was called the perfect street, and in my judgment, it was the worst street with everything around it and everything there was.
Of course, this is a lot of nonsense, if you would pay attention to the evaluation and I could check it out, that would clearly not have happened.
But, let’s go through everything from the beginning.
The nonsense starts with the ticket pick-up that allows you to go first.
It doesn’t seem bad to me either, but if they let you go, then they should also give you everything (including chip to avoid traffic jams).
Well, not yet.
Here they only let you get the ticket (the first nonsense that consists of going there only for that reason) and (after an endless queue) there is the surprise! The T-shirt was only in the size <0x60>S' (a second nonsense because I need the size XL)
Where do we live?
Or is it the case that after the crisis it was decided to buy only small, much cheaper shirts made of less fabric?
Well, things like these are a little bit small compared to the days on the road.
Apart from the fact that you have to go very early to get the chip, there is already a queue of at least 15 minutes and, besides, you have to leave the backpack.
Waiting has taken more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible in the case of a road where 11,000 people are expected.
Finally, as was to be expected, the road started and we had not let our backpacks lie in front of it, even if it had once succeeded, but getting them back would already be more difficult.
In addition, during these 40 minutes of waiting for rain, it was tempting to organize a popular uprising and to raid the house.
I think tomorrow will certainly have some 500 people pneumonia and some like me will not even appear in the classification in time because of this chip I got, I can already think that the output was misstamped.
Of course, if you were to ask me for a perfect road, this road would never come to mind.
So I think we will dream of a city that is well prepared for the Olympic Games for a long time.
Microsoft looking for a (virtual) receptionist
At the Emerging Technology Conference, hosted by MIT, Microsoft has presented the progress of the new image recognition system and human interaction, a being of artificial intelligence without much intelligence, but capable of doing some primitive tasks, such as ordering a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, it’s a route planner to move around on the company’s campus).
Thanks to a camera and a form and facial recognition system, this <0x60>receptionist' can recognize how many people are in the room, who they are and even remember how they were dressed, it can listen and understand the keywords of their conversation.
It can also classify those present in the groups after the talks.
In the presentation video, the receptionist notices a third person, but she understands that this person is not part of the group that leads with her conversation, and that no company employee is either.
She asks if the person wants to visit someone here and replies that she will be listening soon.
Everything without the blue screenshot
Impressive
This is certainly the future.
Now the company has better things to focus on, for example, on the next version of their Windows operating system.
This week we talked very superficially about Microsoft’s strategy change.
Windows 7 will be faster and will not have as many embedded programs.
Steve Ballmer noted that if the computers were equipped with the most necessary, instead of filling them with the commercial garbage, they would work five times faster.
Everything is just a finding, considering that Microsoft added some feature and extras in Windows versions.
The change of direction is worthwhile
Microsoft is right, the operating system is gradually losing importance, just like the software.
When Google Chrome appeared on the web, it was part of the theory that it was Google’s first step in competing with Windows.
Many people have pointed out that the browser is not an operating system.
The operating system, as an indispensable part, will always be necessary for hardware and software to work at the same time.
The operating system performs the function that can be compared to the function of his wife or husband when it comes to communicating something to his mother-in-law.
That's right.
The system will never disappear, but one must think of its death, not as an absolute, but as relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week is the confirmation of this idea.
People pay less attention to the operating system each time, more to the web browser.
The computer is only launched to run the Firefox, Explorer or Chrome and every day we spend more time surfing than in the ‘windows’ area.
What does half of the existing applications work for?
Less is more
And Windows 7 needs to be more compact, much more compact than Vista.
Lighter, not so exaggerated, less complicated.
Microsoft’s interest is more to integrate its online services, which can eventually become the alternative to Google.
In reality, they need that, without a doubt, and I'll give you a little example.
I took the photo of this place in Redmond, in one of the recreation rooms for Microsoft employees at the beginning of the month.
A sign is attached to the soft drink vending machine: <0x60>Your search. Our future'. It expresses a request to use its own tool for online search.
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of employees at Microsoft used Google for research on the web.
By the way, last week it was also confirmed that the new version of Windows Mobile 7 has been delayed.
It will not appear at the beginning, but at the end of 2009, rather even in 2010.
Microsoft is looking for a way to bring Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 to the market at the same time.
Every day, the phone turns into a computer.
The Android and the iPhon are already on the market, but the other delay will cost money.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso mentioned it in Costa Azul, Leonardo di Caprio had this brand in 'Blood Diamond' by Edward Zwick, just like Al Pacino in 'The Godfather' by Francis Ford Coppola, and at the same time it belongs to the clothing of a well-built priest.
As we begin to list the countless stars performances, we can go back to the image of a very powerful man, with a pointed beard, who had raised heavyweights in a hiking circus.
Basically, this is a typical male t-shirt made of cotton, sleeveless and waisted.
The English-speaking people call it ‘tank’, but Lle Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles outperforms all other brands.
First, because of its great name, although it is called <0x60>Marcel' in the narrow circle. The legend tells that the origin of the name is associated with sport and came from boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of singer Edith Piaf.
<0x60>La Marcel' excels all because of its excellent cotton, because of its distinctive unisex cut and is characterized by a small Belgian flag (not very recognizable) that these t-shirts have as detail on the neckline.
And beware, the Belgian company is not just focused on the production of <0x60>tanks'.
You also have college sweatshirts, boxer retro, cardigans and cashmere, cotton pants, T-shirts with stripes, babies, mini shorts
Modelled and comfortable underwear.
Although, it is very bad to use them as undergarments.
They are very charming.
“I want to be a young mother; I don’t worry about the candidate.”
Her big appearance with her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
M<0xC3><0xB3>nica Cruz is delicate, but full of joy.
Currently, Gruz’s siblings take their new activity in fashion very seriously.
For M<0xC3><0xB3>nica, this means much more than for some pretty and rich girls who keep their reputation.
She was in Paris at the promotion of Mango, moved to her residence and also made the presentation of the most important awards in fashion that the Spanish fashion house sponsors.
Merciful and shy, winner on the short tracks.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I have come to present the new collection for this autumn/winter season, which my sister Penélope and I have designed for Mango, and I have also attended the presentation of the second edition of <0x60>Mango Fashion Awards' and participated in the dinner for Valentino's honor.
A very intensive working time, which is exciting at the same time.
You work for the Spanish house, what is the basis of your new collection for the fourth season for Mango?
My sister, both I and I are fascinated by the cinema of the 50s and 60s; there we find many ideas.
I like to go through a city and watch women dress like they are, how they combine their garments, I do that often.
Dancer, actress and fashion designer, you're a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I think yes, but finally, everything comes together in one and these areas have a lot of similarities.
Since I was a kid, I was excited about the clothes; I always wanted to go to my grandmother’s to wander around in my aunt’s wardrobes and see her clothes.
That was great, almost better than going to a theme park.
Even later, as a dancer, I always tried to pay attention to the clothes.
You know, we dancers like to have our own style in classes and rehearsals to look in the mirror and feel good about it.
As an actress, when you get the costume, you put yourself in the real acting role.
After all, everything is connected, it is so, a lot of respect for the costume designer and their professionalism.
You’ve recently turned 30, haven’t you fallen into a crisis?
Oh, what?
I feel better than I ever felt when I was 30 years old.
I find that the woman matures, has experience and can enjoy life with fewer mistakes.
I am not afraid of my biological clock.
I’ve done the things I’ve wanted to do since I was little and that has given me a lot of inner joy.
So, you're thinking of becoming a mother, aren't you?
I have known for a long time that I am going to be a mother, because that requires my body, and moreover I want to be a young mother; I do not want to miss that.
As far as the candidate is concerned, I'm not worried.
I will bring great happiness to my child and raise it with a lot of love.
As far as film art is concerned, you keep in mind the works you participated in and the last year was filmed.
That’s exactly what it is and I want it to be presented to the public.
I, as a woman who comes from the theatre, am very impatient and restless and want everything at once, which of course cannot be immediate.
I very much wish that <0x60>La <0xC3><0xBA>ltima hora' and <0x60>En busca de la tumba de Cristo' be performed for the first time.
Let's see how they like you
A couple of days ago, you were on the run with Naomi Campbell, right?
It's okay, don't say that.
It's not like I went on the runway to model.
Naomi Campbell, whom I have known for some time, simply called me and invited me to London to participate in a parade for the charity event of her organization ‘Women for a Better World’ and the clothes we show. I know that two garments from our Mango collection have been auctioned to raise money for Naomi’s NGO.
People don’t know Naomi’s heart.
I, as the one she knows, would tell you that they're not right.
Nevertheless, I will support this good thing in which it is involved.
She asked me to take part in the parade for this generous cause, but when she comes and asks me to make a stand, I will too.
To support the women in the Third World, which is also necessary.
The drivers, who can be withdrawn because of the alcohol level, will have to install the ‘Alcolock’.
The authority orders that the driver, who had three official penalties for alcohol levels, installs this system in his car, which prohibits him from starting the car in the drunk state. If he is alcoholized, then the car does not jump.
The initiative was announced last month in June and is now part of the General Prosecutor's report, according to their data, a pilot project, which will last a year.
The purpose is to resocialize the driver, which is why he gets a course for re-education of traffic behavior.
In addition to the Attorney General’s Office, experience has shown, the Ministry of Transport and the Foundation of the Technical Institute for Automobile Safety will also participate.
According to statistics, between 30-75% of drivers who were shown more than once due to driving under the influence of alcohol were back in control.
The ‘alcolock’ would prevent this because it is a system connected to the car, it measures the alcohol content in the exhaled air and prevents car start when the driver has taken the alcohol test; or when an alcohol concentration is detected that is higher than allowed.
It costs more than 1 000 euros, the costs are borne by the person who imposes the sanction.
In this context, a study conducted in the U.S. in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with these devices prevented up to 65% of the rule violations as early as the first year after its introduction.
In Spain, 115 lives are expected to be saved each year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to take action on this behavior before it becomes a criminal offence.
And in order to facilitate its implementation, a legislative reform can be implemented in the ordinary way, and yet a reform of the Basic Law is required, which is necessary for the prosecution process.
The device is still available in the Spanish markets, in no store, although it has already been installed in some commercial vehicles and public transport vehicles.
Tomorrow, the House of Representatives will vote for the initiative of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party, which proposes to install this system in school buses, which has already been done in France.
In Mexico and without ‘peep-toes’
With British punctuality, at 5:40 p.m., at the time provided by the program, next to the presidential hangar of Benito Ju<0xC3><0xA1>rez de México DF airport, the aircraft of the Spanish Air Force landed, travelling with the Prince and Princess of Asturias.
The sun went down, but their rays still forced to use the hand as a parasol to see the royal couple getting out of the plane.
Directly on the Gangway: the Spanish Ambassador and other authorities
A few hours before, I had asked a taxi driver on the road if he knew that the Prince and Princess of Asturias visited the city to formalize the official trip.
- Ah, very good, so, there can be no people at the airport at this time.
No, she's the Spaniard, but she lived here for a couple of years.
- Oh, so, very good.
But the Mexican press knows exactly who the Prince and Princess of Asturias are and knows the importance of the trip.
There are many who wait in the hangar of the airport and on the red carpet, also military protection of 27 soldiers of the Navy, who give honorary ointment.
The prince appears smiling, dressed in navy blue, and she, the princess, with long wind-worn hair, without ordinary peep-toes, may have been told that a thunderstorm is expected in DF.
Before entering the hall, they smile and are prepared for the photographers, in which the official sequence awaits.
At the door of the hotel where they are housed, one of the four largest in the city, a Mexican television reporter is waiting for them, who likes to joke.

Probably there was no more suitable place in the world than Paris to present a premium fashion and there was probably no significantly outstanding fashion designer and bonvivans than Valentino.
Mango presents the second edition of the fashion competition 'el B<0xC3><0xB3>ton-Mango Fashion Adwards' for the promotion and international increase of young fashion talents.
This is awarded with a cash prize of EUR 300 000.
Ayer Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, saw her drawings yesterday in the shop window of the Mango branch on Boulevard Haussmann number 54 in Paris and almost cried because of the emotional excitement.
By the way, this is the second largest business of the company in Europe and was recently opened. It offers a sales area of 1,335 m2.
The largest store is in London.
So many events have taken place that are related to wanting to thank fashion designer Valentino for his jury chairmanship at the competition. Everything ended with a luxury dinner at Opera National de Paris.
In the surroundings of many famous people, the board table organized by Mango seemed spectacular.
Nati, with the heavy heart that was broken by pain because his brother recently died, teared himself apart. He put on the suit from the fashion house and took on some jewelry from ELAH, who were stunning. He held on to the arm of his son Luis, who is almost two meters tall and accompanied Valentino at the dinner, to his honor.
Andik, the owner and master of the house Mango, welcomed the guests and was such a cavalier, so he ended up with the Baron von Rothschild without jackets, because jackets they borrowed from the ladies.
M<0xC3><0xB3>nica Cruz, has rushed to the store and had a pants and a shirt that she modeled herself, and for dinner she wore a long, black sexy dress. During a night walk through the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us a hall for ballet rehearsals, so she got in agitated, remembered the old times, grabbed a pole and grabbed a pole.
Inés Sastre, did not join the walk through the premises of the palace, but before that she had shown us the photos of her son on the phone.
The next morning we were able to look forward to the presence of Oliver Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez, a personality who always evokes a stormy enthusiasm, and to Jon Travolta, who, upon his arrival (with his own bed sheets and towels) at the Hotel Internacional in Paris, asked in advance to have a room without smells.
The stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh la la, that's life.
1001 Advice against Stress
There is not 1000, but a way to forget chaotic everyday life.
And although there are few, they are all collected in a book that says how to relax. The book comes to the bookstores on September 30.
The alarm clock is a punishment when it rings at 7 in the morning, but even worse appears the idea of getting back into the hectic rhythm that current life demands.
The office is called the tension and the computers that lead to back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there are not one and not two methods to combat the daily exhaustion and the problems of shutting off from the world of work.
However, the number increases, no more and no less than 1001.
In addition to yoga poses, the classic massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott presents in the book the entire list of possibilities adapted to the taste and time of each individual.
The work against stress is called <0x60>1001 ways to relax' and thus the rest that the book conveys comes to the bookstores of Pearson Alhambra and DK.
Anyone who thinks that it is impossible to achieve peace in areas such as the workplace with the help of personal contacts, then this handbook refutes such faith.
In addition, the methods are offered how to stay in touch with nature or the 100% natural recipes that lead to relaxation.
If the adrenaline in your veins no longer rises to restore balance to the body and the stress has become a problem, then the moment has come to sit down on the sofa, shut down the brain and focus on reading.
Talking in Sleep
Some children talk at night.
I mean not those who wake up and tell us something about what happened the day before, but the children who talk during sleep.
If it happens to you for the first time, at best you will be frightened, but in reality this has no meaning.
This is a positive sleep disorder called speaking in sleep.
It is quite common, especially among children and adolescents.
Surely, more than one of you was told that you spoke at night.
This phenomenon can occur occasionally (once in life, for example, during high fever), or regularly (every day, once a week, once a month), the next day the child can remember nothing.
There is no single reason that causes this phenomenon.
Often, relationships with other phenomena are sought in sleep, such as nightmares, panic fear at night, enuresis noctura (bedwetting at night), talking in sleep, but there is no reason for that.
As we mentioned earlier, it can be due to very high fiber, stress situations or overexertion.
In any case, this is a little researched phenomenon.
The frequency with which it occurs is very variable.
It may be that one speaks quietly in individual words, whispers, or it may be quite the opposite (screaming, crying, long discussions).
In cases where the expression is very intense, it is recommended to observe the child and consult with a specialist to check if there is a problem that causes anxiety and thus arises.
We have said that it is a positive disorder, so it is not treated, be it, it is associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, with sleep apnea or with stress).
What you can do is perform a series of simple preventive measures:
Try not to excite the child before sleeping.
So, choose quiet game for the child and avoid stressful TV shows that are terrible and a little too wild.
For the nervous children who are recommended to relax, relaxation methods can be used to help them get some inner peace.
This helps the child to sleep calmly.
When talking in sleep occurs once, try to keep the calm.
Remember that it is harmless to the child and the next day it will not remember anything that happened.
Useful advice
Don't wake it up.
This is useless, because the child is unconscious, so you will tear it out of sleep.
Although the child speaks, it sleeps, so it rests.
Remember, if it turns out to be scary after a couple of appearances, it is recommended to consult or find out what reason the child is afraid of.
When they understand what it says (which is not so common), the child does not pressurize to conduct a interrogation and get more information out.
Thus, you will not be able to achieve anything with it, because when the child sleeps, it is unconscious and cannot think about it.
Moreover, you will hear what it says, but you will not know what it dreams and why it says so be careful with the interpretation of the information and the conclusions you draw from it.
Perhaps, it does not tell the child that you hear it at night and know its secrets.
Not even as a joke.
This causes a lot of fear.
So, don’t worry, it’s nothing bad, that’s a moment that only takes a few minutes.
Illh<0xC3><0xA4>usern ... finally
After a long thirst course, Illh<0xC3><0xA4>usern is finally back on track.
Without much effort, the yellow-blacks gained numerous chances of scoring and managed to implement one of them, thus winning the game.
The pace of this encounter, in which the attackers struggled to show their skills, was not very high.
After a first attack by the guest captain Kauffmann, whose long distance shot was almost at an angle, ill houses were to easily dominate the game, and in turn Fonderflick managed to challenge Denmark’s defence with a long distance shot, then brain with a high pass, and Romain with a shot with the tip of his foot.
The opposing team blocked in the middle of the field, leaving only the lively Riahi at the top of the storm.
The start of the second half was to be decisive with two goals won by Riahi and Temporale, and immediately afterwards with the first goal for the Illh<0xC3><0xA4>user through Marais, which was just right to take a ball again, which had been repelled in a first attempt by Diebold.
But the ill-fated goalkeeper should not be able to enjoy his luck for long and be sent to the bench about twelve minutes later, which meant that his teammates had to continue to play outnumbered.
Denmark, however, did not take advantage of this and did not face any major problems to an ill-fated elf, who retreated only a little to “compress” their defenses, except in the very last seconds of the game, in which the ball passed very close to the latte after a big mess.
Sarkozy meets angry fisherman
Before flying to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make another detour to Brittany.
Given the determined attitude of the fishermen, who blocked access to several Breton and Norman ports on Monday, the French President decided to meet Tuesday morning in the port of Guilvinec in Finist<0xC3><0xA8>re to meet with their representatives.
The latter promised to receive him ‘with a constructive spirit,’ hoping that he would come up with ‘concrete proposals.’
The President’s visit will take place at the same time as a general meeting of the crisis committee, which was founded by the Breton fishermen to implement measures in the face of the extreme increase in the price of diesel, which has reached a record value of an average of over EUR 1.14 per litre.
According to the spokesman of the Elysée Palace David Martinon, “the President will discuss with them possible solutions to help their businesses become competitive again, and to secure the working conditions and the payment of seafarers.”
Sarkozy is expected of the fishermen with determination.
On Tuesday morning, they led the Morbihan and Calvados protest marches, which caused traffic jams of almost ten kilometers in length.
The port of Quiberon was also blocked, but the connections to Belle-<0xC3><0xAE>le did not break down.
The Quiberon peninsula was demarcated with a barrier.
Already on Monday, the sailors expressed their determination by burning tires and pallets from the early morning in front of the fuel depots of the ports of Brest and Lorient, while demonstrations were held in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement expanded to other ports on the Atlantic coast and the English Channel, such as Sables d'Olonnes, in Vendée, where the fish cutters did not drive out, or Le Havre, where some twenty boats blocked the maneuvers of the merchant ships.
In the evening, the fishermen of Turballe and Croisic in Loire-Atlantique dissolved the blockade of the significant total refinery in Donges.
Those from Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait for the course of the meeting in the ministry on Wednesday before deciding on possible measures.
In fact, the crisis committee in Guilvinec must decide on the reactions to the movement and on its participation in the discussion planned at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by the leaders of the national fisheries committee who did not support their movement.
“The strike will continue,” said Liliane Cariou, president of Lorient’s Fisheries Committee.
The professional fishermen who do not pay taxes on diesel currently cost the litre about 50 cents, but they think that the profitability limit of a boat can only be reached with diesel for less than 30 cents per litre.
Paul Newman the Wonderful
The memorable actor from 'Butch Cassidy and the Kid' died at the age of 83 from the effects of cancer at his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and also Sam Mendes said goodbye to cinema legend and dedicated actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer keeps its delivery forecasts for 2008
The Brazilian aircraft manufacturer expects 215 aircraft delivered this year, despite the impending recession, to be a threat to the global economy.
Embraer, the world’s fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer, holds its 2008 delivery forecasts with 215 aircraft delivered, confirmed its president, Fredrico Fleury Curado.
In the first half of the year, the aircraft manufacturer delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer expects a lot from the Chinese market, especially for its aircraft of the order of 30 to 120 seats.
Embraer has delivered 41 machines to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would consider handing over more than 15% of its assets
According to the Financial Times’ Sunday issue, the insurer American International Group, which has been financially supported by the US Monetary Authority, is considering issuing more than 15% of its assets in order to pay back the $85 billion it has been allocated.
AIG is willing to drive the sale of much of its business, beyond its life insurance at the international level and its retirement provision in the United States.
According to the FT, the AIG Board of Directors met on Sunday evening to review possible sales.
No confirmation could be obtained from the AIG.
One of the assets that AIG could potentially separate from is its aircraft leasing subsidiary International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in reinsurer Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its real estate assets and investments in private equity.
With regard to these sales, no final decision was made, the FT continues.
AIG must promptly make the sales in order to repay the loans over 85 billion, which it has granted the Federal Reserve, also at the risk that the American authorities will receive 80% of their capital and the current shareholders will be lost to the same extent.
Analysis Historical Paris meeting Historical morning meeting
The New York Stock Exchange reported on Monday, after the House of Representatives rejected Paulson’s plan to rescue the banks, a historic fall in prices: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, an unprecedented loss of nearly 800 points, and Wednesday 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) dropped by 777.68 points to 10.365.45 points.
As far as the points are concerned, the strongest case in its history (684.81 points) was previously recorded on 17 September 2001, the day of the trade decline following the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
According to the final shooting figures, the index Nasdag, mainly technical, fell by 199.61 points to 1,983.73, and the widespread index Standard&Poors 500 by 8.81% (106.85 points) to 1,106.55 points.
After the unexpected rejection of the plan to rescue the banks by the Chamber of Deputies, which should once again allow some stability in the markets, Wall Street collapsed, which had already been struck at the beginning of the quarter.
With 228 votes against and 205 abstentions, the deputies refused the financial secretary Henry Paulson the funds he had asked for.
Almost two out of three Republicans rejected his plan.
“There is a bad picture circulating here that makes Congress incapable of adopting a plan,” said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
“This shows how much the market counted on this plan,” she added, fearing that a project adopted in several days would be “too late.”
“If the project is indeed doomed to failure (...), it will quickly be the task of the Fed (the American Central Bank) and other central banks to get the crisis under control, which would limit credit conditions even more,” warned Brian Bethune, chief economic officer at Global Insight.
And Ms. Piegza stressed, emphasizing even more the feeling of extreme urgency, “that every day that passes brings with it the ruin of a financial enterprise in the United States.”
After the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual on Friday, the US authorities planned to purchase Wachovia’s banking business through its rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis suddenly accelerated, leading to emergency measures in favour of banks in the UK, Benelux countries, Iceland and Germany, a sign that markets are facing “not just an American but a global crisis,” the FTN Financial analyst added.
The market for basic goods has grown strongly.
Revenues from the Treasury within ten years decreased Friday evening from 3.632% to 3.827%, and revenue within 30 years last night from 4.161% to 4.357%.
Obama, winner after points in first TV duel
On Friday’s first debate of the two candidates for the White House, another one followed to find out who emerged as the winner, John McCain or Barack Obama.
As expected, the QGs announced their own victory for the election of both Republicans and Democrats in this television duel, which was to be followed by one-third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen estimates that John McCain's performance, although quite handsome, was not "brilliant" enough to allow him to stop his decline in polls five weeks before the presidential elections.
The Gallup Institute, which released an opinion poll on Saturday, according to Obama with five points ahead (49% to 44% for McCain), is of the opinion that the Democrat is clearly making the better figure.
Among the undecided voters, i.e. those that matter now, Obama emerged from the polls with 39% as the winner, while, according to a CBS poll, 25% of them see McCain as the winner.
Obama should be able to confirm his lead on Thursday with the good performance expected by his competitor Joseph Biden at the first and only public debate with his rival Sarah Palin
“It would be a mistake to underestimate them.
She has good instincts, but warned Bill Clinton this weekend.
Seventy-year-old McCain did not cease to put his indisputable experience in the field of foreign policy to the fore, while clearly underlining his opponent’s ‘nativity’ on these issues, which formed the centrepiece of this first television duel.
“Senator Obama doesn’t seem to understand that...’, he stressed several times.
“I don’t think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge needed to become president,” he said.
An attack point that has been preached in the Republican polling stations since yesterday.
Obama himself stressed that he represents the future.
He expressed himself briefly and accurately without being removed from the version.
He emphasized his ability to make good decisions and to renew the image the world has of the United States.
“McCain still didn’t understand, Obama, on the other hand,” this weekend, a Democratic advertising campaigner, in which Republicans were accused of not having grasped the full extent of the crisis that is laden on the “American off the street.”
“During the 90 minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot of things to say about me, but nothing about you,” Obama denounced 20,000 people who gathered in flowing rain at an election event in North Carolina yesterday.
He didn’t even mention the words ‘middle class’ or ‘workers’.’ The financial crisis gives Obama, which Americans consider most appropriate to save the economy even on the edge of the abyss, a clear advantage.
“The coming week could be a decisive turning point,” said Charles Schumer, the influential Democratic senator.
Democratic Representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama’s “good economic instincts” to those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic candidate, the current crisis is “the final judgment of an eight-year bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain.”
After stressing once again that he would probably even manage to lower taxes for 95% of Americans despite the fluctuations on Wall Street, the Senator of Illinois pointed out that the creation of a possible energy independence of the country and the promotion of renewable energy, along with the introduction of a health insurance system, were his top priority.
McCain, on the other hand, wanted to build a plant of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
The two candidates thoughtfully challenge the questions that arise on the plan to save the financial market over $700 billion ($470 billion), which was passed by Congress last night and is extremely unpopular with the people.
Did you notice that there was an election in Minsk?
Young people and opposition activists demonstrated Sunday evening on the main square of the Belarusian capital, in order to reject the results of the parliamentary elections already in advance.
A few hundred white Russians gathered on Sunday evening since the closing of the polling stations on the market square of Minsk to protest the fraudulent nature of the parliamentary elections.
Although no result had yet been announced, many youths had come to demonstrate against the power of Alexander Lukachenko: ‘The dictator should resign’.
Some admit that they didn’t even choose: ‘What is the point if they do what they want with my voice,’ says one youth.
They do not believe that the regime, which has shown itself in the best light to foreign observers to resume negotiations with the European Union, is ready to take a democratic turn.
The sanctions, including the non-providing of visas for 40 leading Belarusian personalities and the raising of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections were deemed clean by the observers.
According to the opposition, they were not.
“We were excluded from the electoral commissions and our observers were not allowed to participate in the counting,” said Yuri Potemkin, Union Press Secretary for Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous group of twelve parties.
This is a cosmetic change, emphasizes Alexander Milinkiewitsch, former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-Europe movement, because it is important who counts the votes, and with us this is the executive.
When members of the opposition move into parliament, then because they were appointed, and not elected.
But their entry into parliament can mean broadcasting time on television, meetings in the regions, and legislative proposals.”
The opposition is therefore guilty of interfering in the political game, because 'dialogue with the European Union must be opened.
Because if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, gets into a crisis and we do not reform, we run the risk of becoming a protectorate of Russia.
We want to be independent.”
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has pursued the electoral process, does not recognise the election as valid.
It stresses that the voter turnout figures seem too high, and that the expansion of voting in advance (26% of voters in Minsk) has paved the way for any kind of manipulation.
“Have you noticed that an election has taken place?” asks the leader of the social democrats Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
There was no one in the polls.
And there will be a maximum of five members of the opposition in Parliament, namely those who most closely correspond to the ideas of the government."
The silence of the night descends again over the Oktoberplatz square.
On television, President Lukachenko and the members of the Central Electoral Commission congratulate themselves on their success.
Interview - From the blood that became safe again
Hema-Quebec celebrated the 10th anniversary of its founding yesterday, and its president, Dr. Francine Décary, had every reason to rejoice, because Hema-Quebec has become one of the safest and most efficient blood banks in the world.
And above all, she regained public confidence, which had been severely shaken by the scandal of contaminated blood in the 1980s and 1990s.
As you know, the national blood reserves administered by the Canadian Red Cross blood donation service were contaminated with the HI virus and the hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In February 1994, in the face of this drama and public dissatisfaction, the Government of Canada launched a public investigation led by Judge Horace Krever aimed at bringing light to the circumstances that had led to such a tragedy and drafting guidelines to prevent another disaster of this kind.
While Judge Krever was still hesitant to submit his report, several provinces set up a committee at the time, whose goal was to develop a new system for the management of blood cans in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee fulfilled this task.
According to the reports of Gélineau and Krever, two blood banks were established in Canada: Hema-Quebec, which is responsible for Quebec, and the Canadian blood company to supply the other provinces and the two territories.
<0x60>1998, when Hema-Quebec took up her work, barely 38% of people had confidence in the blood preservation system in Quebec, Dr. Décary recalls.
The situation was disheartening.
Through the enormous efforts to improve the safety of blood cans and through work in this field over the following years, we have regained public confidence,” she says, before proudly stressing that by the beginning of 2008, nearly 94% of the population of Quebec had confidence in Hema-Quebec.
Dr. Décary, however, keeps in mind that “trust is something extremely fragile.”
Since its founding on 28 September 1998, Hema-Quebec has acted in accordance with the principle of caution.
At this time, we witnessed the occurrence of numerous cases of the human form of bovine insanity in Europe, a new type of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, this woman, who has been in charge since its founding in 1998.
“And we didn’t have the slightest idea whether this disease could be transmitted through the blood.
So we came up with one of the main guidelines of the Krever and Gélineau reports, which states that exclusion measures are applied if one does not know this and if a disease progresses only slowly, as is obviously the case with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is expressed by a degeneration of the brain, which inevitably leads to death.
So in April 1999 no blood was taken from persons who had been in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980.
Well, a few years ago it was proven without any doubt that this disease is transmitted via the blood.
Thus, this event has shown us that the principle of caution we applied has quite a meaning.
In 1999, a much more accurate technique for the detection of HIV appeared on the market: the nucleic acid tests (NST) that allow to detect the presence of the virus itself directly in the blood of the donor, and not that of the antibodies against the virus, as was the case with the tests used so far.
The NST made it possible to shorten the incubation period, which takes place between the time the person was infected and when the first viruses can be detected by our techniques in the blood, the specialist explains.
This time could be reduced to a duration of less than a week.
Thus, the risk that certain donors might be infected without knowing it, and one could not recognize this, was significantly reduced.
These improvements made it possible to significantly reduce the risk of transmitting AIDS via a blood transfusion.
Today, one in 12 million people are at risk of getting HIV-infected blood.
In other words, it means that you would have to distribute 12 million blood cans before someone was infected with HIV.
Since Hema-Quebec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood cans each year, it would take more than 24 years for a case to occur where HIV was transmitted via a blood can.
I believe that today you can feel comfortable when you get a blood transfusion or prescribe it to restore health,” says Hema-Quebec’s director.
“Our challenge for the next ten years is to maintain the safety of our products.
You never know which pathogens can enter the system.
Only last year the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted via the blood by insects.
We have to monitor continuously," Dr. Décary continues, before she stresses that Hema-Quebec must also provide adequate care in addition to a safe supply.
“The need is increasing because the population is ageing.
Because cancer control treatments are more aggressive, patients often need new red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also affects the blood donation network, which on average includes only 3% of Quebec’s people eligible for blood donation.
Any healthy person who is 18 years of age or older and meets the eligibility criteria can donate blood every 56 days, i.e. six times a year.
On average, 14% of people who make their blood available are not accepted because, for example, they have become ill with AIDS or malaria, and those who have traveled to a country where malaria has spread are excluded from blood donation for one year.
“With these 3%, we manage to get an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
Lack of supplies is very rare.
But you have to renew the members of this donor network as they get older and can no longer donate blood.
It’s hard to convince people to donate blood, but above all, to keep them and make them become regular donors.
Life is so hectic these days that you rarely find the time to spend an hour giving blood,” Francine Décary laments.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Hema-Quebec delivers not only blood canned but also human tissues, including bone grafts, heart valves, eyeballs and skin, which are used almost exclusively in severe burns.
These tissues are examined, processed and frozen before being temporarily stored at Hema-Quebec, which also manages Quebec’s only public cord blood bank.
In the umbilical cord, which was once considered biomedical waste, there is rich blood in stem cells that can help treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
A few weeks ago, we celebrated the storage of our thousands of umbilical cord blood samples, and we plan to lose more than a thousand each year.
“We should probably start making it available for transplants early next year,” explains Dr. Décary, who describes this program of umbilical cord blood loss as very popular.
“Many mothers are convinced they don’t have access to it,” because Hema-Quebec lacks the means to offer this complex and costly program in all Quebec hospitals.
Soccer - Impact in the semi-finals
Montreal’s Impact has qualified yesterday, thanks to a 3 to 1 win (4 to 3 with all goals) against the Seattle Sounders at the second and decide to play the quarter-finals series at Saputo Stadium, where the overall goal ratio counted, for the semi-final round of the USL’s first league playoffs.
Midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal in the 90th minute of the game.
After a first half without a goal both for one side and for the other, midfielders David Testo and Rocco Plancentino landed the other goals for the Montreal formation.
Roger Levesque was the only one who stood in the way of Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
Recall that at the first game of the pre-and-replay series on Friday Impact the Starfire Complex in Tukwila in a suburb of Seattle had brought in a 2 to 1 defeat.
In the semi-finals, Impact will compete with the Whitecaps from Vancouver.
On Saturday evening, Thunder was able to compensate for a 3 to 1 deficit in Minnesota by a 4 to 3 win, but the Whitecaps moved into the semi-finals with a total goal ratio of 5 to 4.
Impact will probably have to face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the game series are set today.
In short - Siegestor by Kovalev
The Canadian team’s No. 1 trio is ready to tackle the season.
Yesterday evening, the unit formed by Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrej Kostitsyn advanced the attack on the Panthers from Florida with a storm fire, resulting in a 3 to 2 victory.
Kostitsyn, the star of the encounter, shot a goal, Plekanec delivered two templates and Kovalev turned a pass into this victory game, the fourth of the tricolors in six preparatory games.
Kovalev scored the victory by shooting the only goal of the entire shooting.
“I’m not ready yet,” the Russian said.
I need another game to make me feel good.”
“He got too attached to it in the first half,” noted Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he liked the end of the game.
He received stormy applause."
Charest relies on the North
The Prime Minister does not rule out the opening of elections until the end of the year.
As soon as the General Assembly of the Liberal Party ended, Jean Charest went to Jean-Talon in Quebec yesterday, where the new Minister of Health Yves Bolduc (left) tries to be elected in today's partial election.
<0x60>Move the course of our last great frontier to the north': this is the long-term goal that Jean Charest presented yesterday by visual means at the General Assembly of the Liberal Party of Quebec in Levis, following entirely the guidelines.
During his lecture, a kind of picture mill was projected behind him.
On three huge screens, spectacular images of hydropower plants, mines, viewed from Quebec in <0x60>Google Maps', maps, etc.
Great funds as during the election period.
The prime minister refused to rule out that he would hold the elections this autumn, even though he said his schedule was very full.
The ‘Plan North’ is the fourth element of a ‘Vision’ that the Prime Minister allegedly has for Quebec, namely that of a ‘new economic space’ that provides for an agreement with France on labour, an agreement between Canada and Europe, and agreements with Ontario.
Although it has been frequently mentioned in the Prime Minister’s speeches recently, the opening of the North – the northern area at the 49th parallel – has never been the subject of a presentation.
The prime minister, however, was limited to explaining why the North was “a jewel with enormous potential,” but did not mention a date, investment sums, or exact priorities for the upcoming projects.
At most, some prospects for what could be worked on: especially on water energy, on the forest, but especially on the mining sector, favoured by the growth of emerging markets and the renewal of public infrastructures.
According to Mr. Charest's account, the north has nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium and even diamonds.
This 'area twice as large as France' is near us, is in Quebec.
It is not only near us, it is within us,' he stressed, as to show clearly that he is seeking to realize a national founding dream.
Quebec has grown greatly due to its connection with the north, he stressed: the road to gold in Abitibi, Quebec’s technology, the James Bay.
"It belongs to us, it's our future," he added after taking a theatrical break to look at the huge map behind him.
The north, 70% of the Quebec area, includes part of Labrador, which Quebec has always called for, the prime minister told the press.
“This is a traditional attitude that all governments followed.
There is a border line where there has been no agreement for a very long time, when the opportunity arises I will take this stance again on behalf of the government," he said.
“With climate change, we need to rethink our vision of the North,” he said, talking about the Northwest Passage, which will be accessible all year round due to the ice melt.
Against this new geopolitical background, the Prime Minister believes that it is precisely a duty to occupy this area.
And the inhabitants of the land, the natives and the Inuit?
The prime minister said the Quebec government would be very careful with them and that they would benefit from this project, especially the boys.
Two former ministers of various parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former Peculiar Member of Ungava) have already started consultations with some thirty communities.
A committee of ministers led by Beno<0xC3><0xAE>t Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (transport and mineral resources) occupies an important place, has taken up the work.
The prime minister does not rule out a large assembly, not necessarily a summit, but an opportunity where ‘a common vision will be created’.
The development of the North will also be in line with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be 'discussed, regulated and environmentally friendly', he promised.
Jean Charest described this “vision” as a continuation of those of the liberal prime ministers who were in office before him.
“Like the liberals who were in office before us, we have turned the challenges into new growth and development opportunities.
This was, by the way, one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which opened on Friday with a large cocktail party to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the takeover of the party leadership by Jean Lesage.
One of the adopted resolutions envisages renaming the Beauharnois power plant in Adélard-Godbout-Staudamm.
“From Godbout, who created Hydro-Quebec, through Lesage, who achieved the silent revolution and nationalization of water electricity, to Bourassa, who made the James Bay, our party always knew how to determine the future,” said Jean Charest.
In front of the press, he referred to another, this time conservative, project, namely the program 'Roads to the North' by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
Regarding the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydropower dam project, Mr Charest stressed that its commissioning was planned for 2012.
“This remains among us, but I intend to be there,” he confided to his party members, which was what caused those applause storms.
The Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008, and certainly also in 2009, has in fact not yet ruled out the possibility of holding an election this fall, which is possible from the law.
However, he stresses that his calendar is full, mainly because of a mission of the Joint Council in China and a summit between Quebec and New York.
The weekend’s General Assembly provided the Liberal Party chief with a platform of nationalist plans, especially of ‘the Constitution-related goals’, which were readily adopted: the PLQ particularly calls for the recognition of the ‘specificity of Quebec’ in the Constitution.
She also wants Quebec to appoint members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council, and that they have a veto over the decisions made in Quebec.
On the part of the opposition, the guidelines of the Plan North were taken up with skepticism.
The head of the Québécois party, Pauline Marois, has reiterated the policy on the development of the North-du-Quebec, which the Landry government introduced in 2001.
According to her, when she came to power in 2003, the liberal government has refrained from applying them.
If she had done so, ‘we would have gone a lot further today,’ Ms. Marois judged alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon (where the election takes place today) Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise Mercure.
The ADQ has expressed its support for the adoption of a North Plan by the government.
“But what we want is that this will not only be a big idea,” party leader Sébastien Proulx told Mario Dumont, who is returning from vacation today.
Letters - An Enraged Country
Mr. Vic Toews, ex-'Justice' minister (which irony) in Harper's cabinet, was the one who allowed himself last summer to say about Louise Arbour that she was a 'shame' for Canada.
This woman, who has waged an unending fight for justice and deserves all our admiration to cover up so badly, says just as much about the people around the prime minister as about Stephen Parker himself.
We are dealing here with a government which, as the only one from all the countries concerned, has not brought home its compatriot imprisoned in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
A government that doesn’t even take into account Omar Khadr was still a teenager when the things that were being accused of him happened.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, breaks its word and allows a child soldier to vegetate under inhuman conditions.
The only one who indulges in a judicial parody to assess the guilt of the accused.
Let us recall that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Lawyers’ Association in particular are pleading to bring Omar Khadr home so that he can get a fair trial in Canada.
This very government also closes its eyes to torture: it is of little interest to them that after so many years of suffering, a young adult will certainly be mentally broken forever.
We are not yet aware of this, but we are currently experiencing an insidious circumcision of our rights, our freedom and our ‘democracy’, this word that Harper constantly carries as a flag before him, and which sounds so nothing from his mouth.
So the time has come when there is no morality anymore: one may arbitrarily abuse, torture and imprison a Canadian citizen, according to the well-thought-out of a head of government who is only supported by the minority to this day (may he belong to the minority after 14 October...).
Many voters believe in finding their salvation at a party that preaches virtue, law, and order, but they do not see that this government has renounced what constituted the reputation and dignity of our country.
The shame, Mr Toews, lies in this detachment, and nowhere else.
Free Opinion - The Orwellian Speech by Barrick Gold
In its September 17 issue, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, Vice General Director of the Canadian Barrick Gold Mine.
This confirms, and in doing so pursues an Orwellian logic that the world’s largest gold-winning company was seeking a defamation lawsuit over six million against three authors and a small, mediocre publishing house, with the aim of opening a ‘public transparent debate’.
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, then they do not judge the truth, especially not in the case of defamation lawsuits, but the law.
As expected, this fundamental difference was completely concealed by Mr Garver.
For Barrick Gold, the best way to have a public debate is to ruin everyone who dares to represent one of their opposite opinions.
No matter how the process goes, the authors and editors of the book Noir Canada will have to spend considerable sums to prepare their defenses and fight with very unequal weapons against an army of lawyers paid out of the nearly inexhaustible pockets of the gold mine.
The tactics of these unequal struggles, by the way, are often to ruin the defenders in order to force a consensual arrangement that makes the opposite mouth-to-mouth and also deters anyone who dares to deal with the issue again.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, she would have had to present her view of things to public opinion.
In contrast, what is common in many of the countries where Barrick Gold works is in Canada debates are usually carried out through the exchange of ideas and not by button strokes.
So it would have sufficed if the gold mine had disclosed its books and files and opened up a real debate, through which newspapers, media, publications and the financing of independent audit teams could have brought light to this question.
But Barrick Gold does not seem to have any confidence in public opinion, wiping aside the petitions and letters supporting the authors of Noir Canada with a hand movement.
Could Mr Garver perhaps explain how he can at the same time ask for a 'public' debate and yet disregard the opinions of this particular public?
Apparently, in the world of the Vice President, this word includes only the generously paid lawyers, and not the community of all Canadians; a quite narrow view of the term.
In a democracy, even slanderers have the right to speak.
What Barrick Gold doesn’t understand — or doesn’t want to understand — is that the public, who supports Noir Canada’s authors and publishers, is doing so primarily because it rejects the brutal stance of the gold mine.
This public is willing to listen to and judge Barrick, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, and not in a framework that many perceive as a gag complaint (in the course of the ‘public debate’, Barrick Gold has just raised a demand for the authors of Noir Canada, in which she asks them not to use this term anymore...).
Apart from Mr. Garver’s surreal speech, Barrick Gold’s lawsuit is a direct attack on freedom of academic research and truth-finding, which are fundamental to any democratic society.
It totally denies the right to cite credible sources and to discuss facts and interpretations that form the basis of intellectual work.
If in a country like Canada it is impossible to explore and discuss topics that the rich companies of this world do not like, who else can do that?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, she could lead it by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
She has a right to reply.
The university environment we belong to has long been able to handle debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold’s disproportionate lawsuit clearly shows that, unlike what she claims, she has no desire for a transparent debate.
This is a loss for the university world, as well as for public debate, and it’s time for governments to take action to limit this kind of unjustified lawsuit.
Rescue for Wall Street - Democrats and Republicans understand each other
The Bush administration and senior congressmen, Republicans and Democrats alike, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the most comprehensive economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new $700 billion plan to stop the financial crisis that has shaken Wall Street for months still needs to be adopted by the two chambers of Congress.
The main content is: better control of MEPs over the practical application of the plan, new mechanisms to secure the repayment of the public funds used, new arrangements to reduce the number of houses pledged due to payment defaults, and the right to monitor the salaries paid to the senior employees of the supported companies.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, the president of the Chamber of Deputies Nancy Pelosi, and the Republican representative present at the negotiations, Senator Judd Gregg, announced yesterday, a few minutes after midnight, the good news, after a two-day negotiation marathon.
“We have made great progress towards an agreement that will be effective in the market,” said the Bush administration’s representative, Henry Paulson.
“Everything happened to protect the real economy and the American people from the price crisis on Wall Street,” she said.
“This is the fundamental point: if we don’t do this, the trauma, the chaos and the turmoil in Americans’ daily lives will be enormous,” Republican Judd Gregg said.
The negotiations had accelerated over the last two hours, fearing the effect that would have had a further failure on the mood of investors.
The deadline agreed was the opening of the market this morning.
The two American presidential candidates, who took part in the negotiations only late, were more likely to show themselves as supporters of the agreement, but without failing to express their discontent at the fact that they had to be met in this extreme way.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama insisted on the addition of certain arrangements for agreement, especially those designed to allow owners to keep their homes, and those relating to the salaries of senior employees of state-saved businesses.
“If you ask taxpayers to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of certain people, that’s nothing to be congratulated on.
But these measures are necessary," he explained on the American television channels.
When asked on another station if he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent John McCain replied, “I would like to know the details first, but I hope so.
The guiding principles that I have read [show] that this is one thing that we will all have to digest, and with which we will be able to move forward.
The option of doing nothing is simply not acceptable,” he said.
The $700 billion plan is aimed at making money from taxpayers
It comes 14 months after a crisis, triggered by the bursting of a real estate bubble, which first led to the collapse of the high-risk mortgage loans (subprime) before it expanded to further forms of more widely used bonds (PCAA), and finally culminated in a freeze of financial power and the ruin of banks and financial institutions.
It was a group of Republican MPs who failed the first attempt to reach an agreement last week.
Since the Democrats have accepted that certain “toxic” assets of societies should only be secured in distress by the government and not bought, the dead end is believed to be avoided.
To round off the perspectives for everyone in Congress, one has also added an order stating that if the government should make losses with this program within five years, it could then raise new taxes in order to recover its invested capital.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first sum of 250 billion, to which an additional 100 billion can be added if the president sees it as necessary.
The payment of another 350 billion must be approved by Congress in a new vote.
In return for his help, Washington gains shares in the supported companies that bring him dividends in the event of profits, and which it can resell once the storm has passed.
The Federal Government will have the opportunity to stop the attachment proceedings relating to the apartments linked to the real estate loans affected by this plan, and also to set deadlines for the repayment and redemptions paid to the senior employees of the companies concerned.
The developers of the plan would like the Chamber of Deputies to vote on him today, and then the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all their efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will get green light.
In fact, there were further votes against this plan yesterday, both by the Republicans and the Democrats.
“Clearly Washington doesn’t understand us,” Republican Scott Garett, a member of the Chamber’s Financial Commission, told voters.
“Yes, we have a big financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not those who are in the process of asking the taxpayers to cash in."
Democratic MP Brad Sherman, head of a group in Congress called the “Caucus of the Skeptics,” presents things differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
“Four hundred excellent economics professors, including three Nobel laureates, have written to tell us: We ask Congress not to be pressured, and carefully consider which way to go,” he said.
At the same time, we in Europe were once again given the proof that this is a global crisis.
At an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalisation of the banking group Fortis for €11.2 billion ($16.3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it would refrain from buying up its competitor, who is in great difficulty since losing 2 billion euros (US$2.9 billion) in the crisis due to the high-risk real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of the 20 largest European banks and the 10 largest insurers.
"This is not a lost money," Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said yesterday.
To compensate, we receive a right to vote and influence in the bank.
This is exactly what the savers and households appreciate, now that uncertain times are coming.”
During this time, on the other side of the English Channel, the British government was in the process of nationalizing another bank in distress from the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over all current loans from Bank Bradford and Bringley, of which over 41 billion (75.5 billion US dollars) from real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it would buy up the branches and customer accounts of the British bank.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank to nationalize the UK government since the start of the financial crisis.
Paul Newman (19252008) - Death of a committed icon
His beauty with the azure eyes was for a long time his trump, no one would say his weakness.
Did the American actor free himself from the narcissistic mirror with the charming smile?
Yes and no.
His sensitivity, his sensitivity and an obvious talent have probably also kept him away from a position of power that brings to the world the truly terrible monsters.
But what a great endurance runner!
Paul Newman, who died on Friday at the age of 83 from lung cancer at his Connecticut ranch, remains one of the last icons of American cinema of his golden years.
He was less monumental than Brando, whom he resembled and for whom he was a kind of rival on the screen for a long time, more careful in his acting, certainly also fragile, but equally an apostle of freedom and the blast of dramaturgical conventions.
Mixed blood often results in wonderful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925 as the son of a German Jew and a Hungarian-born mother.
From its European roots, one of the glorious faces of the American dream should emerge.
Without excessive ego, extreme quality feature.
For in him was reflected an entire country that was in love with the self-made man, in the fighter who was injured in the Pacific War in battle, who studied acting in Yale in the early 1950s and then visited the Actor's Studio in New York before he had success in theater, television and soon in cinema.
This man who fought for civil rights was also the driver who was second in the Mans 24 Hours race in 1979, and also a sex symbol, although he has been living in a show-off relationship with actress Joanne Woodward since 1958.
With him, the unknown facets of this mysterious, restrained, committed and hypersensitive star, whose mystery will never be solved.
A decent man, in the purest sense of the word.
The death of Paul Newman put the cinema lovers in Taumel this weekend, while on the dark screen of memories all his big roles were played.
More than half a century of American film art is constantly changing.
There, the charming cowboy from "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" (1969) is again remembered, and the young man who rejects his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in The Cat on the hot sheet metal roof, which was filmed in 1958 by Tennessee Williams.
It evokes a much shorter past memory (1990), which is reminiscent of his sensitive Mr. Bridge, who, at his old age, is disturbed by a wedding that did not fulfill all her promises.
There were so many Paul Newmans throughout history.
This criminal, stormy, violent and unforgettable boxer Rocky Graziano from Somebody Up There Likes Me (A Hand Full of Dirt) by Robert Wise, a role intended for James Dean, was re-recorded after his death and the Newman made proper public in 1956.
This sympathetic ganove in the outstanding The Sting (The Clou), which won the Oscar for Best Film in 1973.
As a fierce and vengeful billiard player in the wonderful The Hustler by Robert Rossen (1961),
This face through the ages, that was him.
Still he.
In his résumé, epochs unite.
The youth knows him above all from the cult film Slap Shot by George Roy Hill (1977), as Reggie Dunlop, the little orthodox coach of an ice hockey team.
His fans found him again in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of the Coen Brothers.
With a final role in 2003 as the godfather of the Irish Mafia in Road to Perdition by Sam Mendes, the circle closed.
Unlike several movie legends who retired early enough from the film world, Newman was supposed to stay in the saddle for a long time, revealing Hollywood, his fortune, his pomp and his concessions.
French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier saw him, not without humor, as a living challenge to underplaying when he judged his overly expressive performances.
The metier was not always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman, to whom the reels flew for a long time just like that.
However, he rarely played Sunnyboys as an outsider: neurotics, alcoholics, fiddlers or desperate, with whose perfect portrayal he reflected his slip and his rebellion.
As a director, Newman revealed unknown sides of his true sensitive sensitivity.
His Rachel, Rachel from 1968 (after the novel of Canadian Margaret Laurence) starring his wife Joanne Woodward, drew a subtle female portrait full of melancholy.
He, who lost his son Scott through an overdose, dedicated his 1984 film Harry and Son, a work full of sensitivity and sadness.
In the flood of honors that erupted over Newman yesterday, his close friend and former arms mate Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) explained extremely: ‘His presence has improved my life and this country.’
Generosity and joie de vivre were essential characteristics of the deceased actor.
Apart from his legendary career, a great defender of civil rights, environmental protection and independent cinema, an opponent of Hollywood’s drift, is now also going there.
We have often seen him stand with his foot in bowls full of vinaigrette, in sauces, pastries or other foods, and thought this was pretty tasteless, although we found it funny at first.
The profits from his sales nevertheless flowed into his foundation for children in need.
Instead of resting on his myth, Newman committed himself to the shot.
He left his five daughters a letter with these sentences: ‘Always and to the very end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was an honor to be here.”
And for us it was an honor to be able to follow the life of such an intelligent and generous American actor.
An exemplary citizen, in the narrowest and in the broadest sense.
What was produced in the invoice factory of Zuschlag &amp; Co.?
On 8 October, negotiations begin in the criminal trial against J<0xC3><0xA1>no’s contract and his accomplices.
In particular, the defendant is accused of involvement in organised crime, grossly negligent damage and business fraud, and other criminal acts - including document falsification.
According to the Public Prosecutor’s Office, the funds from the tenders were used for their own purposes, while the services provided were often provided with fake invoices.
Government funds and grants from the self-government - a total of HUF 65 million - are to be flown partly in the treasury of the Fiatal Baloldal organization, partly in the private treasury of individual individuals.
As the investigating authorities announced, fictitious invoices were presented when the tender funds were received, and the associations should not have complied with their obligations.
According to the indictment, most of the invoices were faked.
The invoice blocks were bought at the market of J<0xC3><0xB3>zsefv<0xC3><0xA1>ros, the round seals were made in Kiskunhalas.
The decision on which companies the invoices are to be issued was made on that round trip north of Lake Balaton, on which Istv<0xC3><0xA1>n Lados was sent by J<0xC3><0xA1>nos.
In the course of this "exploration tour" Lados should find pensions and restaurants.
He demanded bills on consumptions to be able to issue bills later on based on these templates for the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, as well as the self-government of Budapest.
These accounts are said to have been manipulated by the majority of Istv<0xC3><0xA1>n Lados and his accomplice, Andr<0xC3><0xA1>s <0xC5><0x90>ri, the latter of whom, according to our information, was responsible for the constitution of the corresponding reports.
One of the destinations of Lados' "exploration tour" was a beer room.
As two invoices issued by the grant and Co in 2003, the catering company is said to have hosted the ninety-member group of the association Biztos Pont Egyesület.
But now the head of the company says that such a large group would not have fit into the restaurant at once.
Another bill, issued in the summer of 2002 to the Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért Foundation, later known as Együtt a Harmadik <0xC3><0x89>vezredért, also had serious form and content errors.
In a pension in Badacsonytomaj, which has only three rooms and cannot accommodate more than ten people at the same time, 130 guests are said to have stayed, according to the bill.
The imagination of the accounting falsifiers apparently had no limits either when it came to Pigal Kft., a catering company whose accounting records of customers Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért and Hopp<0xC3><0xA1> do not even appear at all, according to the prosecution.
As Managing Director Gy<0xC5><0x91>z<0xC5><0x91> Farkas told hvg.hu, he was immediately aware that these were fake documents when documents were submitted to him by the prosecutor’s office during a survey.
"Our company name and tax number were misplaced on the stamp".
Apart from form defects, the fact that the company is said to have housed one hundred people after having a total of eleven rooms, which are impossible to accommodate so many people, was also wrong.
Food had also been mentioned on the bill, the restaurant was no longer in operation for a long time.
The accounting falsifiers have also failed to verify that the Budapest travel agency they are targeting only offers travel abroad, and so they have indicated Hungarian travel on the cash invoice, which also contradicted the company’s accounting practice.
As was known in the course of the investigation, they also mentioned VAT on the invoices, although travel agency services related to a country outside the EU are VAT-free.
The amount of VAT was wrong on four invoices issued by the Hotel Révfülöp Kft. to the Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért Foundation, as the operation instead of 25 only 15 percent VAT is charged, moreover, only machine invoices are issued by the employees, but the forged documents were handwritten.
Another mistake that had been made by the "invoice armies" was that they had stated "goods transport" as a service provided in one case, although this is not offered by the firm specialized in investment consulting, the prosecutor's office said.
Further errors in form - false invoice format, false stamp - were due to the fact that the invoices issued to Együtt a Harmadik <0xC3><0x89>vezredért Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tv<0xC3><0xA1>ny, as well as to XXI. Sz<0xC3><0xA1>zadi Kultur<0xC3><0xA1>lis Egyesület and Biztos Pont could be exposed as fakes.
Likewise in the case of Ravenna Bt. and the sports camp Kunfehért<0xC3><0xB3>, whose managing directors insisted that they never issued the invoices.
Another "mistake" has been made by the falsifiers at the HIB Kft. from Ny<0xC3><0xAD>regyh<0xC3><0xA1>za: This company was at the time (2001) precisely in disintegration, when the group of the Fiatal V<0xC3><0xA1>rosért Egyesület was supposed to have eaten there - the mass administrator therefore stated that the invoices were not self-issued.
Consciously falsified
The other group of accountants are people who were well aware that they would have to make fictitious bills.
At the request of the Fiatal Baloldal - Ifj<0xC3><0xBA> Szocialist<0xC3><0xA1>k, the Stiftung Esély Budapestért Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tv<0xC3><0xA1>ny has issued invoices for the Stiftung Együtt a Harmadik <0xC3><0x89>vezredért, at an amount of approximately HUF 4 million.
According to the indictment, the managing director of Collab Kft. was persuaded by one of the defendants, Ludovic Györfi, to issue the fictitious invoices.
The Biogate Kft., which is currently also in liquidation, is also intended to have worked with contract and co.: In 2003, the GmbH is said to have supplied the Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tv<0xC3><0xA1>ny Foundation, as well as the Atlasz Egyesület and Vörösfeny<0xC5><0x91> Egyesület associations with fake invoices in the total value of HUF 5 million, which have related to undelivered services.
However, there was just as little payment traffic, as the invoices were cancelled immediately after their issuance, but what the interested parties forgot to mention in their documents.
The third group of accounting officers includes persons who are directly associated with the defendants.
One of them is Iv<0xC3><0xA1>n Kubatov, the postman of the Ukrainian managing director of Delta Tri<0xC3><0xB3> Kft., a Budapest-based fuel and vehicle trading company that is not found there.
This company is expected to have issued several invoices for the sale of IT components in the total value of HUF between October and December 2005 of approximately 18 million.
According to the investigating authority, the cash investment Kft. from Kiskunhalas, which has been in liquidation since 14 September 2005, is said to have acted as buyer of these invoices.
The Managing Director of this company was a Romanian to whom the company documents were also to be delivered by Iv<0xC3><0xA1>n Kubatov, between 2002 and 2005.
According to our information, Kubatov during the investigation, issued invoices on behalf of the GmbH. to the associations Atlasz and Hopp<0xC3><0xA1>, as well as to Együtt a Harmadik <0xC3><0x89>vezredért Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tv<0xC3><0xA1>ny and cashed their equivalents themselves.
The companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt. are said to have been founded by Romanian masons on Iv<0xC3><0xA1>n Kubatov's express wish.
In reality, however, none of these companies were active, which according to the defendant was due to lack of orders.
Nevertheless, he was able to benefit from the companies: at the request of his accomplice, lawyer Zsolt Szente, who was responsible for preparing the company's founding documents, he issued invoices on behalf of the companies to the associations associated with the contract, such as Atlasz and Y-Gener<0xC3><0xA1>ci<0xC3><0xB3>.
In total, Kubatov is expected to have issued 15 invoices totalling HUF 14.2 million on behalf of the companies Cash Investment, Delta Tri<0xC3><0xB3>, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade to the organizations.
The prosecutor’s office expects that Kubatov could have collected 10% of the invoice amount and VAT each.
Kubatov is said to have even abused the company Szi-Beri Bt. for the issuance of fictitious invoices - in this case the invoices were enclosed with the applications of Biztos Pont.
Y-Gener<0xC3><0xA1>ci<0xC3><0xB3> and Szövetség a Modern Magyarorsz<0xC3><0xA1>gért submitted their applications to the non-profit organisation of the Socialist Party, T<0xC3><0xA1>ncsics Mih<0xC3><0xA1>ly Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tv<0xC3><0xA1>ny ("TMA") in January 2006.
Both received 500,000 forints each, but benefited from these amounts estranged.
To cover this up, they submitted five fictional invoices to the TMA of the Works Team Kft.
By the way, these invoices were secured during the search of the office of <0xC3><0x81>rp<0xC3><0xA1>d Kemecsei in the Ministry of Education.
During the negotiations, some defendants are now expected to confess to the procedure for falsifying the accounts, as they were already filed before the public prosecutor's office.
A sensation could be if the chief defendant J<0xC3><0xA1>nos decides to grant a comprehensive confession.
His previous statements were less detailed, and although he had already promised several times to comprehensively report on everything, his confession is still pending.
The question remains, therefore, whether this is in his interest, whether the Socialists have concluded a pact with him with regard to the reparation of the bulk of the damage caused by HUF 50 million, and whether the subsidy is ready in return to assume responsibility.
It is quite possible, however, that the supplement now plays the "offensive" after his requests for relief of detention and house arrest had come to deaf ears.
While other criminals, who have done far greater damage with economic crimes and have not compensated them, are on the loose, or at least under house arrest, this possibility is denied.
The Psychology of Overbidity – or Why We Are Ready to Pay More
In the case of auctions, buyers tend to spend more and thus overestimate the error bid.
Neurologists and economic researchers at the University of New York have now succeeded in discovering the neurological-economic foundations of this well-known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to a study published in the “Science” magazine, people don’t want to be beaten in a competition, such as an auction on eBay, and are therefore willing to pay even overpriced prices.
The researchers have tried to explore the neurological scheme of this "game" with experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers was supposed to play the lottery while the other took part in a playful action - in both cases, the active brain regions of the subjects were examined by means of functional magnetic resonance (fMRI).
In both games, the participants were able to win money, but an increased activity of the striatum, a complex below the cerebral cortex, was measured in the case of losers of the auction, in which the overbiding of the opponent plays an essential role.
In addition to many other functions, this brain region is responsible for the "self-reward" of the nervous system.
The researchers therefore thought that the price increase could be explained by avoiding an overreaction of the striatum.
In order to substantiate their thesis, the economists in the research group have additionally carried out investigations to track the money.
In this case, three groups should compete against a partner under different conditions.
The control group was informed of the true value of the product, after which they made their bets.
Another group was also promised $15 reward in case they emerge as winners from the game.
The third group received $15 before the auction, which was also lost in case of a lost game.
So the difference between the two groups was that the emphasis on one was on winning, while the other was on losing.
However, as evidence of the hypothesis expressed by neurologists, the members of the "against losing" group were ready for higher stakes than those in the control or "winning" group.
"These results cannot be derived from any previous economic theory.
These have so far only justified the behaviour observed at auctions with the joy of winning, or risk avoidance.
The contradiction between these two theories was resolved thanks to the imaging neurological procedures, so we now have a third explanation ready," said Andrew Schotter, professor of economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When to see a doctor?
Around half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary this chronic liver disease is listed among the leading causes of death.
The number of infected in this country is estimated to be one hundred thousand, but only seven thousand are treated, which is because patients often do not know that they are infected.
Hepatitis is the collective term for infectious liver diseases caused by various viruses.
Symptoms are often similar – inflammation of the liver and jaundice are common, but the pathogens and diseases differ from each other.
Depending on the pathogen, the hepatitis viruses spread in two different ways: in the case of hepatitis A and E through the digestive tract (for example, through contaminated food or water), in the case of hepatitis B, C and D, the viruses can be transmitted through blood and other body fluids (such as sperm, secretion of vagina or saliva).
Travellers are advised to vaccinate against viruses A and B anyway, there is no vaccine against virus C.
The symptoms of hepatitis A show up about two to three weeks after consuming the contaminated food and are generally accompanied by discomfort, weakness, abdominal pain and nausea.
After that, the jaundice appears on the skin and in the eyes, the chair becomes bright, the urine dark, and the recovery can last up to two or three weeks.
Worldwide, about 1 million people die each year from hepatitis B-induced, far more serious diseases such as liver cancer and cirrhosis.
The main reason for this is that, according to estimates, only one in ten people infected is in drug treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have serious consequences: untreated, it can lead to liver cirrhosis and liver cancer.
Most infected people do not even know about their disease, as the pathogen insidiously destroys the liver cells - in many cases, the first symptoms show up after 20-30 years.
Therefore, timely prevention, such as regular check-ups, is essential.
There are three groups in which this disease is more common: those who had undergone a blood transfusion before 1991, drug addicts, and tattooists.
Currently, the number of chronic hepatitis C patients worldwide is estimated at 200 million.
Since the disease is already detectable during a routine laboratory examination, it is advisable to visit the GP at the first signs of unknown origin.
Recognised in time, the disease is curable, the virus can be eradicated, which eliminates the risk of infection and prevents the development of cancer.
September 30th is the World Day of Hepatitis, first held in 2004 by patient representatives worldwide.
The aim of the action is to strengthen awareness of this chronic inflammation of the liver caused by viruses, their emergence and the importance of early detection.
Do believers have less pain?
As recent research shows, religious beliefs act like a kind of “pain” that is said to have already facilitated the death of Catholic martyrs.
Scientists at Oxford University conducted an interesting experiment: It was investigated to what extent faith in God affects the pain perception of man, reported the British magazine "Telegraph".
In the course of the rather bizarre investigation, 12 believers and atheists each received electric shocks while studying a painting of the Mother of God.
As the results showed, the faithful were able to turn off most of the pain.
Using a brain scan technology, it could even be proven that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain that is responsible for pain regulation.
The study was the first in a research project in which, in addition to scientists, philosophers and theologians from various departments of the university participate.
During the experiment, a sparkling device was attached to the left hand to deliver the electric shocks.
The participants were asked to focus heavily on two paintings: on the one hand, a picture of the Mother of God, painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century, and on the other hand, Leonardo da Vinci's "Dame with the Hermelin".
The researchers hoped that the Virgin Mary’s sight would evoke a kind of religious trance among the faithful, while selecting da Vinci’s image, because it was hardly different from the other painting and was felt to be reassuring.
The subjects each spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, and during that time received a total of 20 electric shocks in four stages, while they were to watch either the religious or the other painting.
The Catholics reported that at the sight of the Mother of God they had felt "in safety" as if they were "cared for" and they had felt "rest and peace".
While looking at the religious painting, they reported more than 12% less pain than if they had Leonardo’s work in mind.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in the experiment, said that one could also evoke similar effects with other, strongly acting images among the atheists, that one would just have to find the corresponding photo.
"We would have to find an image that triggers very positive sensations, such as a mother or a father," the psychologist said.
Anglican Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research.
“Practicing the faith should change our personality, and in many cases it does,” Wright said.
After these outstanding results, only the question remains of what effect a Madonna image of Leonardo or another comparable painter would have on the pain regulation of the faithful.
Would the high-quality Virgin Mary achieve even better results?
You are what you say about yourself
On the occasion of her tenth birthday, Google can rightly claim that she can be found in people’s pockets as well as above their heads in the sky: she knows where people have spent their vacations, to which specialists they go, and what moves them.
And that’s still not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, one of Google’s CEOs.
Towards skeptics plagued by Orwellian horror visions, he points out: these would overlook just the essentials of Web 2.0.
In an interview with the Financial Times, Schmidt recently said Google’s main goal was to collect even more personal data about its users and thus get closer to the company’s original goal of “ordering all the information in the world.”
Schmidt said that after ten years of work, Google is still only at the beginning of information gathering.
Asked about the status quo in five years, Schmidt said he wished Google would be able to answer questions like "What should I do tomorrow?" or "What job really suits me?", but software programs are not yet able to do so, as they don't know enough about the users.
Not all Internet users are aware that in the course of their Internet searches the search terms will be registered, as well as the IP addresses from which they were searched and the pages visited.
For example, the “Personalized Search” introduced two years ago allows the visitor to save his own search history and later to use it, so that the hits can be generated much more precisely later, and the same logic is based on the so-called “recommendations” with which the system recommends customized products and services based on previous preferences.
However, users wonder what happens in the event of a data abuse - "If you look at what I'm doing" - some people are concerned about the Google data monopoly.
In most cases, however, it is more likely to be the potential power represented by the company, which has an appalling effect on fear, and less the sense of guilt or fear of punishment, the pursuit of freedom or the incitement to power, which is opposed by many Internet users.
However, it is a proven fact that the search terms are not only stored, but also passed on to third parties in the event of an event, and in these cases there is no protection for the personal rights of the Internet user.
A prime example of this was recently the action against pedophilia in Brazil, in the course of which Google provided the Brazilian government with information collected by the community site called "Orkut" and also enabled the identification of pedophilia.
However, users with personal rights were still able to breathe in in May, when Google, together with the civil rights organization EFF, successfully brought the FBI to justice: thus, Google cannot be forced to release information to the FBI on secret request in the future with any point of the Constitution.
(However, the Federal Government has successfully obtained the publication of 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms with reference to the Youth Protection Act passed years ago, but it has been retroactively withheld from the list of individual users, or their web and search terms list, for two months.)
So Google’s image remains controversial: those who don’t like to release their personal data because they fear the loss of their privacy and intimacy by using Google services are scourged by the company with the outrage due to conservative companies.
Meanwhile, the American “geek culture,” which is present in many countries and unites enthusiastic computer fans, activists and users, sees the next generation of “cool entrepreneurs” in them, unlike Microsoft, which is the market leader thanks to Windows, even though both are fighting for the same goal.
One possible reason for this is that, unlike Microsoft, Google does not require identification codes from its users and provides its services free of charge, making an open, constantly updated source code and program package seem far more attractive, youthful and cool than the official practices of the software giant.
On the other hand, the geeks are looking through the problematic relationship of personal rights and the Internet razor-sharp - a relationship that has become the focus, especially in recent years, thanks to the term "Web 2.0".
Web 2.0 is all about collaboration, that is, users deliberately leave traces and use the available communication channels, and even if the dimensions are individually different, the main thing remains the same, namely to show itself publicly.
An average teenager can simultaneously manage his profile on several community portals - from Facebook via Xanga, they can connect with each other through other services such as Twitter, or music services such as last.fm, and can eventually incorporate all of this into a tracking system such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. In addition, they can run blogs that automatically represent the latest photo galleries that are hosted on Flickr or Picasa.
And a number of other exemplary cases prove: When looking at last night’s party photos, the friend soon finds out who her unfaithful friend was enjoying, or the employee is dismissed because in his blog he is just too honest with his anger about corporate governance – one thing is certain: the term “private sphere” has now been completely reinterpreted.
Whoever leads an online life is what he gives up on himself – so you could sort of formulate the basic idea behind the behavior of today’s youth.
And if you’re trying to keep something secret, or even bypass the Google monopoly, you might like to do so – like with Scroogle, a tool that, while accessing Google’s search engine, deliberately leaves no trace.
Not many people intentionally do not register on community sites so that they are not discoverable, but Google’s online applications, such as word processing and graphic tools and RSS feeds, can be handled with alternative versions that are not tied to huge server parks and therefore do not generate the best possible profile from the user.
However, public opinion is waiting for Google to show its true face.
With its current value of USD 156 billion, the company is even ahead of IBM (USD 140 billion), Intel (USD 124 billion) or Coca-Cola (USD 110 billion), the advertising space of AdWords/AdSense threatens the revenue of the advertising agencies, and the increasingly fast-launched services not only cause Microsoft, but also other software developers headaches.
Critical viewers, however, also find the disturbing counter-poles: for example, the group management rejected a protest by the employees completely after the fees of the company’s own kindergarten were doubled, and the management also said that the multiple meals of the employees were too expensive. But this all seems to be mildly contrary to the fact that in 2006 Google was wonky, that all the employees were even going to their knees before the Chinese government, or even agreed with an agreement with the Chinese government.
The Group’s internal regulation is that no new service is advertised in advance, but only if it is already available. Nevertheless, the events of the coming months and years could once again have a strong effect: while some believe that Google’s book and magazine scan or archiving project is now taking on a scale that the company would soon have to deal with the health of the Supreme Court, the “problems of the Supreme Court” are rather “concerned by the system”.
And the fact that Google is building a genetic database, the next generation of sci-fi authors are already delivering the material – such as “Scroogled,” Cory Doctorow’s famous novel describes in best Orwellian ways a future in which a human being becomes terrifyingly close to the world thanks to Google-related data.
Two young people help <0xC3><0x93>zd's double-murderer in the removal of traces
In connection with the double murder of <0xC3><0x93>zd, the police have now interrogated two young people who are suspected of helping to get rid of the traces, the spokesman of the Borsod Police Commissioner said on Tuesday.
The young people were responsible, and they are currently being charged with the aid.
According to the news agency MTI, these are two girls who defend themselves on their own.
Aid is threatened with a prison sentence of up to five years.
The suspect of the double murder of <0xC3><0x93>zd, a 23-year-old local man, was arrested on Sunday.
The man is under urgent suspicion of intentionally murdering several people for money.
In the course of the investigation, it turned out that the 23-year-old owed a larger amount of money to a 53-year-old.
However, the suspect did not want to pay off his debts, so he lured his creditor last Wednesday to a site in <0xC3><0x93>zd where he murdered him and his nine-year-old daughter.
According to the MTI, the man planned the crime long-term - this also proves the fact that he committed the murders with a weapon hidden at the crime scene.
Together with experts, the police are now investigating the gun and the circumstances of its use.
Warsaw Stock Exchange offers to buy Prague Stock Exchange
About 200 million euros, or 5 billion Czech crowns, have been offered by the Warsaw Stock Exchange for the 100% purchase of the share packages of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, President of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, reiterated the offer that Poland had placed despite the fact that they were previously excluded from the Czechs as potential owners of their stock exchange.
The reason for this is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange belongs entirely to the state.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which, however, wants to sell more than 60% of the papers in the coming months.
According to reports from the Czech daily "E15", the offer of the Poles includes the highest purchase price ever offered for the Prague Stock Exchange.
As the newspaper reports, so far the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Börse have made offers.
Petr Koblic, head of the Prague Stock Exchange said last week that of all the interested parties the Warsaw Stock Exchange would probably be the worst new owner, and he also did not rule out that this could even lead to the closing of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange at 5-10 billion kroner.
According to the shareholders' agreement, 90% of the shares could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is Patria Finance Investmentbank with a 25 percent stake, followed by Cesk<0xC3><0xA1> Sporitelna Bank with 14.7 and Tiger Holding Four S.a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
The financial crisis from the point of view of European newspapers
In their comments dedicated to the ever-increasing international financial crisis, some leading European newspapers spoke on Tuesday of the "second 11th September".
We owe the global financial disaster to the American president, for example, "La Repubblica" - the president has not even been able to turn his own party behind him for the bill into one that should bring some relief to the frightening situation...
Instead of a “new Pearl Harbor,” as billionaire investor Warren Buffett called it, it would be more appropriate to speak of a “second 9/11.”
Parts of the press in Madrid also locate the scapegoat in Washington.
According to El Mundo, the lack of political leadership is due to the fact that the global economy is now on the brink of collapse.
The American financial system is threatening to collapse more and more, and the whole world will suffer from it.
Bush’s plan was not perfect, but now, after voting in Congress, there is a danger that Washington has no political means of crisis management.
The world economy hangs in the air, just at a time when one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism takes place.
One can no longer ignore the threat, for example, the Geneva “day indicator”.
Even though some states might still provide bailouts to their bankrupted financial institutions, and save banks from bankruptcy with taxpayers’ money.
However, if a domino effect is triggered and more banks are still in trouble, then no further financial injections or other immediate measures will help.
In the long term, EU member states would have to jump over their shadows and centralize control of the money markets.
On Monday alone, more than EUR 100 billion were paid out to debilitating financial institutions, recalls the Viennese "The Standard". Moreover, according to the newspaper, the concerns are increasingly realistic that, according to the Americans, European taxpayers now also have to intervene a little deeper in their pockets in order to get out of the crisis.
So far, the EU has not seriously dealt with the crisis, which is now sweeping across the old continents like a tsunami.
Although the "setters" would not have to "remove" immediately with several hundred billion euros, it would be advisable to determine in which case it would be reasonable to touch the taxpayers' money to avoid an even greater damage.
Intelligent car imitates the flight of the bumblebee
What would be the best way to develop new technologies to avoid accidents, if not to imitate the obstacle sensors from nature?
For example, bees.
At the CEATEC in Japan, an amazing project was presented that inspired the Nissan engineers of bumblebees in creating new accident avoidance systems.
In collaboration with Tokyo University, Nissan has built the BR23C autobotter-controlled biomimetic system, a mini-car equipped with the characteristics of the bees, with the aim of supporting the development of a system that avoids any collisions.
In flight, each bee forms its own oval "private area", which is very similar to our own "protective shield", Kazuhhiro Doi, product manager for technology PR and research development, said at the exhibition.
The compound eye of the bee, which can see in any direction and at an angle of over 300 degrees, plays an important role in this.
In order to mimic the function of the composite eye, the researchers took up the idea of the laser-controlled distance meter.
This identifies obstacles before the BR23C in a field of view of 180 degrees within 2 meters, calculates their distances and sends signals to the microprocessor on board, which immediately initiates the collision avoidance process.
The obstacle is registered in fractions of a second, and the autobot immediately changes the course, similar to the movement of the bees, by turning the tires around the corresponding angle.
Unlike previous systems, this maneuver takes place purely instinctively.
"If it were not so, the autobot could not react quickly enough to avoid the obstacles," said Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the Mobility Laboratory and the autobot project.
The system must react instinctively and immediately, as this technology corresponds to the innermost and most vulnerable part of the shield - a layer within which accidents are still considered unavoidable.
The entire process must reflect the behavior of the bees when they avoid other bees.
And that has to happen in a fraction of a second.
However, in contrast to the bees, avoidance cannot be done up, down, or even diagonally - it can only be two-dimensional, and only in the direction of the reversibility of the tires.
While the bees here are open to endless possibilities to avoid other bees, the researchers at the auto-robot could only use the rotary movement, or the acceleration and braking.
The BR23C contains lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and more energy efficient, and therefore have a longer service life than conventional lithium-ion batteries.
Andoh explained that it depends on the instinctive, intelligent response, and less on the processing of the data, and even less on the ability to store it.
This device only has to process a few inputs per second and react accordingly to them.
It does not have to store these, or produce an intuitive, logical reaction on the basis of previous maneuvers, so that it constantly takes only a handful of KB memory.
There is no need for gigabyte and megabyte heavy memories.
This is the first step in the development of the immediate collision avoidance technology, which Nissan estimates will be in production as standard within the next ten years.
Another application could find the technology in GPS satellite navigation by deliberately directing the driver around obstacles and thus guiding him to the destination.
A Name for the Sinister Child
Now, the written version of the $700 billion bailout bill is in place, which will be applicable in several stages and aimed at buying the banks’ bad loans.
In the first round, half of the money will be spent.
In a meeting that ended on Saturday after midnight local time east coast, Congress MPs have reached an agreement on the $700 billion bailout package after several days of debate, Reuters reported.
"We have made substantial progress," said Nancy Pelosi, Democratic President of the US House of Representatives, and said that the agreement should only be put on paper.
The compromise reached on the bailout package supported both presidential candidates - Barack Obama and John McCain.
Finance Minister Henry Paulson said the programme will have an impact and it will be efficient, but it will have to do even more. According to Pelosi, this was not about saving Wall Street, but about robbing the helm of the economy.
The written version of the package was published before the opening of the Asian markets, i.e., Washington time on Sunday evening at 8 a.m. (Central European time Monday 2 a.m.), but did not trigger a high-altitude flight on the stock exchanges.
On Monday, the House of Representatives first votes on the 2008 bill to stabilise the economy, then the Senate is on the line.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi on Saturday night, and the White House also welcomed the news of the agreement.
We are pleased with the progress made at night and appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our markets and protect our economy, said Tony Fratto, White House spokesman.
The program, however, deviates from the Bush administration’s original recommendation that the $700 billion should be spent at once for the purchase of lazy, debt-laden securities.
In a first tranche, a maximum of half of the 700 billion is to be spent, with 250 billion immediately available, after the Congress is expected to vote on the causa on Monday. This sum is to be spent on the purchase of credit-laden, bad securities, and the president is to decide on the additional 100 billion USD.
The program is reviewed by a commission of its own, which also belongs to the President of the Federal Reserve.
The other half of the $700 billion depends on another congressional decision.
Under the law, the Ministry of Finance can also apply a combined tactic: it can simultaneously buy bad loans, mortgages, and mortgage-laden securities, or other “toxic” loans.
As the responsible persons of the Ministry reported, the purchase can be made both in an auction, as well as directly.
The law allows the companies concerned to participate in an insurance program in which the Ministry of Finance guarantees the worrying funds and the companies pay the expected damages corresponding fees.
Henry Paulsen said: “The law defines the necessary funds so that up to $700 billion can be made available as emergency aid to the American financial system, whether for the large-scale acquisition of bad funds, their insurance, or the avoidance of a systemic risk triggered by the collapse of a larger financial institution.”
We are taking the necessary steps so that we are ready to introduce the law as soon as it is signed, Paulson said.
However, the heads of banks in difficulty and now dependent on state aid can expect their shipments, which are called "Golden Handshake" in the overseas slang, to be cut by the government.
There will only be a reduction in salaries in certain cases, and these reductions will depend on how the Ministry of Finance will each help.
The reduction essentially means that if the Ministry buys in the course of an auction, the "Golden Handshake" will be taxed, unless the retired bank manager is deported to the pension.
In the event of a direct purchase of lazy loans, the government will engage aggressively to ensure that manager salaries are not exaggerated.
The picture also includes that the existing Golden Handshake contracts are not changed - the restrictions only apply to new agreements, so that the more people participate in the program.
This is the first case in American history that cuts in manager salaries are regulated by law, commented Democrat Barney Frank, Chairman of the Financial Committee, the measure.
The state gains participation rights in participating banks, so that the risk to taxpayers decreases, as they can also participate as soon as the economy and thus the saved bank recovers better.
The bill foresees that the president will have to make a proposal to Congress over the next five years to get taxpayers back their lost money from the financial sector.
However, there were skeptics on both sides who expressed their doubts about the plan.
That’s not what American citizens expect from us, the plan does not protect taxpayers’ money, according to California Republican Darrell Issa.
His colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur, said: “The measures were pushed forward by the same people who are also responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
Industrial prices continue to rise
Like the Central Statistical Office, domestic sales rose by 0.1 per cent in August 2008 compared to the previous month, and compared to August 2007, by 12.9 per cent.
Export prices were 1.1 per cent higher than those in July 2008, and fell by 3.9% compared to the previous year’s prices.
Due to domestic and export price changes, production prices were 0.7% higher than in the previous month, and 3.2 percent higher than in 2007.
Domestic sales prices have only slightly increased compared to the previous month, i.e. by 0.1 percent.
The sales prices of the manufacturing industry also rose little - 0.1 percent - since July.
The biggest price increase in August 2008 was in leather goods (2.8 per cent) – primarily in bags and belts – the increase here was 4.6 per cent, and in shoes prices rose by 2.5 per cent.
Higher prices for plastics and chemical raw materials significantly increased the prices for chemicals and production (1.6 percent).
A drop in prices was recorded in crude oil processing (1.4 percent), in electrical and technical equipment (0.9 percent), and in wood processing (0.1 percent).
The prices in paper production, as well as in the publishing houses and in the printing industry remained unchanged.
In other branches of the manufacturing industry, a price increase between 0.2 and 0.9 percent was measured.
In the major domestic markets of the industry, such as electricity, gas, steam and water supply, prices rose by 0.3 percent in August, primarily as a result of the price increase for gas introduced on 1 July.
Looking at the domestic sales markets of the manufacturing industry in comparison with the previous year, prices in crude oil processing have risen the most (32.4 percent).
In the metalworking sector, a 13.2 percent increase was observed, while the increase in food, beverage, and tobacco production was 11 percent.
A drop in prices was observed in the textile industry (2.5 percent) and in electrical and technical equipment (0.3 percent).
The level of inflation in the other manufacturing industries was between 0.6 and 9.1 per cent.
In total, prices in the manufacturing industry climbed by 10.2% last year.
Prices for electricity, gas, steam and water rose by 18.7 percent compared to the previous year.
In the domestic sales market, the highest price increase in the asset sector was recorded in August (0.7 percent).
In the consumer goods production sectors, prices rose by 0.3 per cent, while in the energy and further processing sector they remained the same compared to the previous month.
The largest price increase in August 2008 was observed in the energy and re-use sector (16.8 per cent) over the 2007 comparison period.
In the consumer goods-producing sectors, a price increase of 6.8 per cent was noted, while in the case of the investment goods, a price reduction of 1.4 per cent was noted.
Industrial export prices measured in Forint increased by 1.1 per cent in August compared to the previous month, but there was a decrease of 3.9 per cent year-on-year.
The domestic currency was down 1.7 percent compared to the euro, down 7.1 percent to the dollar, and compared to the August 2007 rate, it was up 7.5 percent compared to the euro, and even up 15.9 percent in the dollar.
No more visas in the US from 2009?
Kinga Göncz sees a good chance that the U.S.-Hungarian visa agreement will come into force around the 12th of January, as the Foreign Minister told representatives of the Hungarian community in Chicago.
In their view, "everything now depends only on whether the electronic immigration or control system is being introduced overseas in time."
However, she also stressed that there will be no entry permit in the new system, but the tourists would have to register in advance.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy is now conducting negotiations in Washington.
She meets Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who will hand her over to the Hungarian Republic’s “Middle Cross of Merit with Star,” and she also conducts talks with the foreign policy advisers of Democrat Barack Obama and Republican presidential candidate John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain support bailout package for banks
Barack Obama and John McCain, the two presidential candidates of the major American parties, pledged their support for the $700 billion bailout package for banks on Sunday, but there are also politicians calling for the resignation of the finance minister.
The Congress and government representatives announced after day-long marathon consultations on Sunday morning that they have reached an agreement on the banking bailout package.
The Wall Street crisis, as well as the thawing of the frozen credit market, became the central issues of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain - both claim to be better than the respective opponent to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to recent polls, Obama was able to further expand his lead thanks to the economic issues, while McCain’s high, which gave him the presentation of Vice Presidential candidate Sarah Palin after the Republican Convention, has melted at the same time.
At an election campaign event in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that Congress will quickly adopt the 700 billion-dollar package law.
He stressed that the plan also includes those passages of consumer protection that he has supported.
"We need to act responsibly now ... - your jobs, your savings, entire industries, and the stability of the entire economy are being threatened," he said in front of 35,000 viewers.
He has not failed to describe McCain’s economic vision as “obsolete.”
In an interview given to ABC, McCain said, “We’re all going to have a hard time with that ... but nothing is certainly not an alternative.”
The Republican Senator said the plan also prescribes the establishment of a control commission for the finance minister, as well as the restriction of clearances for top managers - something he insisted on.
Obama told CBS that McCain would not have played a definitive role in the negotiations, whereas Obama was in contact with the minister.
On Sunday, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, announced that the House of Representatives will probably vote on the bill as early as Monday.
Press view of the German-speaking region
The right-wing camp is intact, only the voters became more confident within the camp - so "Der Spiegel" comments on the weak performance of the CSU in Bavaria.
In Austria, Haider and Co are ready to rule to prevent a red-black coalition.
The Mirror (spiegel.de)
In the online edition of the German news magazine located on the left, Franz Walter analyses the reasons for the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article "Bayern's Revolution destroys their fathers".
According to the renowned political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo took over its offices.
The Christian Socialists have been renewing Bavaria for decades – now the modern citizens are turning away from them.
The epochal breakup is at the same time a problem of Christian democracy, as for Angela Merkel.
Surprisingly, the disaster of the CSU did not come to an end, but on Sunday something has come to an end, which, however, was already quite exactly ten years ago: the undoubted hegemony of a state party
Because already ten years ago, in 1998, CSU landed at 47.7 percent and thus fell for the first time since the fifties under the fifty percent brand.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Bundestag elections, i.e. still in the much cited Stoiber era.
The CSU’s consistent modernization in the federal state has finally destroyed their own mothers and fathers.
Sociologists had predicted this 40 years ago, but at the same time they were much surprised at the pace, but without impact the secularization, the educational successes, the influx of East and North Germans into the prosperous regions of Bavaria could not remain true to the loyalty of the CSU voters.
Modernization is always accompanied by an increase in options, and this has political consequences.
The right-wing camp is intact - only voters within the camp became more critical and wilful.
It is striking that in recent weeks the classical civic groups have expressed the greatest distance to the CSU: the free professions, the commercial citizenship and voters with a high school diploma.
The support of the CSU fell to less than 40 percent.
The Press (diepresse.com)
The conservative Wiener Tageszeitung reports in its "Who with whom party leaders with restraint in coalition issues" titled articles about the chaotic domestic political situation in Austria after the new elections.
The SP<0xC3><0x96> wants to negotiate with the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
The <0xC3><0x96>VP prohibits the intervention of the SP<0xC3><0x96> in internal affairs.
The BZ<0xC3><0x96> is open to talks in all directions, while the Greens do not yet want to decide on a coalition.
The new elections are over, and now it’s all about the coalition; in the debates on public television, the party leaders barely looked into their cards.
SP<0xC3><0x96> chief Werner Faymann reaffirmed his desire to negotiate with the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
The SP<0xC3><0x96> wants to show that cooperation between both parties is very likely possible - in some federal states and in the social partnership this is already the case.
The question of whether he could then imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current <0xC3><0x96>VP chief as vice-chancellor, left Faymann open.
As he said, the voters would have opted out of the bowl-molder course.
A repetition of this direction would not be in question.
Molterer, however, reacted cautiously to red offers.
The cooperation could not be fruitful, he said, when Faymann tries to interfere in internal concerns of the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
Whether his party is going into opposition, or into the coalition, is currently completely open, and these issues should be discussed internally by the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
BZ<0xC3><0x96> CEO Jörg Haider was open in all directions.
“To prevent red-black, we are ready to take on government responsibility,” Haider said.
J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today, in Paris, the European Summit on Equal Opportunities has begun, which will be hosted this year by the EU Presidency of the Council of France.
In her speech addressed to the plenary, L<0xC3><0xAD>via J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka, Fidesz Member of the European People's Party, drew attention, in particular, to the education segregation, as it is one of the most serious violations of the rights of Roma children, and this is also the biggest obstacle to their need to apply.
The high-level conference was opened by French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs Xavier Bertrand on behalf of the French Presidency of the Council, and Vladimir Spidla, EU Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Among the participants were representatives of governments, the European social partners, as well as the most important European legal protection and citizens' organisations in the field of equal opportunities.
As the press office of Fidesz MPs reports, J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka has pointed out that, in addition to discrimination in job search, Roma would be pushed out of the labour market primarily because of their low level of education.
"The vast majority of Roma youth do not have middle school education, and thanks to poor primary education, only a small part of them can achieve a university degree".
J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka also stressed that education is a fundamental human right that plays a key role in enforcing other human rights.
Investing in early education of Roma children can strengthen the economy of EU Member States.
In the view of the honourable Members, it is important that these relations become aware of a circle as wide as possible, i.e. Roma and non-Rome.
The sooner a Roma student starts school, the more his chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market increase; and through income and sales taxes they contribute to national spending.
"As citizens of the Union, the Roma must be guaranteed the right to high-quality education - the bad and segregated lessons must be stopped" - says L<0xC3><0xAD>via J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka.
As the honourable Member explained, a joint, objective and action-oriented approach by the European Union is necessary to accelerate the desegregation process in the education sector, which requires proper compliance with the existing and planned anti-discrimination directives.
"We need to break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation, and unemployment and give Roma children the democratic opportunity to contribute to the future of Europe as full citizens," J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka said.
Since last year’s Congress in Berlin, the summit has been held annually with the aim of creating a unique forum for advancing the goals of equal opportunities and discrimination at European, but also national, level, in the sense of the “European Year of Equal Opportunities”.
CSU: Grace on Time
At the end of October, the fate of the fallen duo Huber-Beckstein is decided
Despite the election debacle, there are no heads yet, and at the head of the Bavarian CSU, the personnel debates have been postponed.
Party leader Erwin Huber and Prime Minister Beckstein remain in their offices, the only question is how long this grace lasts.
The fate of the tandem after the disastrous 17 percent vote loss will be decided at the extraordinary party congress on the last weekend of October.
The much-skilled duo, however, already made it clear that it does not want to stick to their armchairs.
In doing so, they want to appease the angry faction and the party base, which one day after the "Bavarian tsunami" demanded personal consequences in the face of the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago, admittedly, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber, the Christian-Social Union reached 60.7 percent, but now, one year after the coup against Stoiber, they were able to secure only 43.4 percent of the vote.
For 46 years, the CSU was the sole shareholder in Bavaria, which generates 18 percent of German GDP.
The conservatives remain the decisive force in the southern federal state, which is also important for the Hungarian economy, but will have to govern in a coalition in the future.
As the first sign of party internal restructuring, the potential successor Hubers, Vice-President and Federal Minister of Agriculture Horst Seehofer will also be involved in the exploration team, which will conduct exploratory talks with the liberal FDP, or the right-wing "Free Voters" about a possible Munich coalition.
An irony of fate is that with the list of "Free Voters" Gabriele Pauli comes into the legislature, whose anti-stoiber appearance the Huber-Beckstein Duo first took advantage of, and then the goal-seeking politician to serve mercilessly.
The CSU leadership now focuses all its forces on stabilizing Beckstein.
In this transition process, Stoiber, who has so far pulled the strings out of the background, will play an active role. The former Prime Minister and CSU Chairman called September 28 the "bitterest day of his political career".
On Monday, Huber made a few toxic remarks towards the CDU – in his view, the CSU would have earned far more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a signal to the CDU and thus also to Angela Merkel.
If the CSU, which also contributed a lot to success at the national level in 2005, is not put back on its feet with a joint act of force, Merkel cannot become chancellor again after the Bundestag elections in September 2009.
Merkel, who has not made a heist out of her disappointment over the fiasco, believes that the land loss of the CSU will not have a negative effect on the large coalition in Berlin.
What is relative, however, is that the wounded CSU will not be easier to govern, and the crisis of the Social Democrats will continue.
With 18.6%, the SPD achieved its best result in Bavaria since 1946.
Lukashenko opposition: 110-0
In the elections on Sunday, no MP of the opposition made it to the Ukrainian parliament.
Russian observers believe that this is due to the prosperity and stability of the country run by Alexander Lukashenko, but the OECD suspects that there are illegals in counting the votes.
The OECD, which has sent 450 observers from 43 countries, has not recognised the elections.
The legislature of the 10-million-domestic state has been running for decades without opposition. Nevertheless, the opposing party assembled under the name "United Democratic Forces" (ODS) before yesterday's elections has seriously hoped that Lukashenko, who would be re-elected for the fourth time in the imprecise elections and thanks to a constitutional amendment in 2006, would be re-elected to his presidential mandate for the fourth time.
That is why the ODS has even distanced itself from the previously planned boycotts.
Ukraine is becoming more and more economically dependent thanks to the rising prices in natural gas imports from Russia. For the relief of price increases, even loans have been taken up, and the country has also agreed to the sale of the Beltransgas, the owner of the gas pipeline leading through the country, to the Russians. So in the light of the opposition’s expectations, the hope was that Ukraine would like to improve its relationship with the EU as a politician, after Lukashenko wanted to improve its relationship with the EU.
A temporary relaxation was ensured by the OECD election evaluation report, in which the emphasis was rather on the positive movements, rather than on the shortcomings - such as the exclusion of a third of the opposition candidates from the elections.
However, the OECD's rapid report already criticised the campaign on Monday - thus oppositionists should not be in the press - and in particular the fact that the opposition was not allowed to be present in counting the votes.
Despite all this, the opposition is able to see an improvement in the political system: political prisoners have been set free, for example, and Minsk is even ready to face smaller confrontations with Moscow by continuing to deny recognition of the independence of the apostate Georgian provinces of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, although Russia, with which Ukraine forms a federal state on paper as an independent since then.
“We have taken two steps forward and one backward, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun,” said Alexander Milinkevich.
According to the opposition candidate of the 2006 presidential election, a continuation is desirable, although "the powerful have been afraid to let even one oppositionist into parliament".
The opposition does not plan protest measures in the face of the results, but rather tries to clarify the need for economic reform for voters.
"We have a lot of problems here - the opposition newspapers have to be printed in Russia, the local authorities are putting stones in our way when it comes to distribution, but yet I see that more and more people are supporting change, even the older ones," Milinkevich said, not even the most supported layer of pensioners agree with the Lukashenko regime, whose only social security is the production.
"Thanks to the country's debt and the increase in the trade deficit, it is only a matter of time until the "social security" that is supposed to break the silence of a cemetery begins to crumble," says Milinkevich.
In contrast to the opposition politician, Russian observers have described the elections as democratic.
Sergei Lebedev, head of the mission of the Community of Independent States, told the news agency Ria Novosti: "People believe in deeds, not words." The absence of the opposition is therefore proof of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on, breakfast will be served before work"
For the first time in the history of Palazzo Chigi there are rotatable doors for the entrances and exits of the officials.
As of today, the measure against those Schlaumeiers will come into force, which will first stamp off and then go to coffee drinking during working hours.
The new anti-faulphelz law was introduced today by Renato Brunetta, Minister of Public Administration and Mauro Masi, Secretary General of the Bureau of the Council of Ministers.
“Turnable doors are a means of increasing work efficiency through a higher attendance rate and more services,” Brunetta said.
“Now begins a new era of responsibility and transparency.
This is reformism," Brunetta said.
With the Palazzo Chigi, the installation ends in all the buildings of the Presidium of the Council of Ministers.
Masi says: "The choice of rotatable doors is also of great symbolic value".
There was no resistance on the part of the officials, the Secretary-General said: "This process was supported by all, cooperation came from all sides".
All in all, there is now no more breakfast during the working hours; finish with coffee or croissant.
Brunettas advises in this regard with a smile: "A good cappuccino at 7 o'clock works wonders".
During a meeting of the Supreme Committee of Public Administration (Scuola Superiore della Pubblica Amministrazione)
From Rome, the minister announced that "within three months, the absences of officials have been reduced to 50%, that is, 60,000 people per year are more present at work".
It adds that it is necessary to strengthen the efficiency of public administration in Italy
"their wage dynamics - as the minister said - have been twice as large as the private sector over the last 8-10 years and well above the rate of inflation".
Meanwhile, thousands of officials have come together to oppose the Brunetta decree as part of Codacon’s vocation.
“While the Minister of Public Service is profiled with figures on lower absenteeism at work — as the Consumer Centre writes — the people of the ‘active laziness’ are constantly growing.
Indeed, thousands of correct and valuable officials of the public service have come together to declare war on the illegal norms of the decree."
In particular, the Regional Administrative Court (TAR) is fighting for additional financial compensation for work-related illness; so will the planned extension of the mandatory house arrest of the sick worker, during which control visits can be made and further aspects of the minister's innovations be challenged.
Napolitano: “Prevention against accidents at work is crucial”
Every day 2,500 accidents occur in Italy, three people die and 27 remain permanently disabled.
For 2007, the data of the Inail (Istituto nazionale contro gli infortuni sul lavoro) confirm that the fatal accidents at work were around 1200.
These numbers prove the seriousness of a phenomenon that causes almost twice as many deaths than are caused by murder.
Today, the Anmil (Associazione Nazionale Mutilati e Invalidi del Lavoro) in all the provinces of Italy will celebrate the 58th national day for the victims of accidents at work, thus drawing the attention of the social institutions and the media to this dramatic situation.
"The worrying, data disseminated by Anmil and the tragic news of these days confirm how crucial the issue of prevention in the workplace is," confirms the president of the Republic of Giorgio Napolitano in his message to the president of the Amil (Associazione nazionale mutilati ed invalidi del lavoro) Pietro Mercandelli.
The head of state expressed his "great appreciation for the constant commitment to prevention in the workplace, to the protection of injured workers, to support the families of victims and to raise awareness of public opinion".
"An outraged "basta" has risen to this; understandable in the case of tragedies, which, measured by their magnitude, trigger some vortexes in the media and public participation. But the everyday reality often confronts us with dramatic events that can even be repeated in their own dynamics".
Napolitano does not conceal that "there is definitely also a resource problem: it needs to be invested decisively in education and information."
The numerous initiatives for a more direct awareness of school frameworks by the young people who feed on the world of work are of particular importance.
It is our duty to draw attention to this phenomenon and not to divert it from its social seriousness; we must put a legislative standard into effect and improve it.
On the other hand, the President of the Gianfranco Fini Chamber stressed "how the phenomenon of work-related deaths constitutes an urgent social emergency that offends the conscience of all of us and forces all institutions to work on decisive rules that aim to put an end to the problem".
"The data on accidents at work seem to signal a slight improvement, but this does not rule out the fact that the number of work-related deaths is far too high," said Anmil president Pietro Mercandelli.
"We don't want this "positive tendency" to mean less attention. That's exactly what causes the tragedy in the end."
"How do you think you basically do too little to counter the phenomenon of accidents, and you can fight against it through various actions.
We believe that stronger controls and inspections are necessary – according to Mercandelli; but also stronger measures to educate the workers who are already starting school.”
"A further effort is necessary - he adds - in terms of communication and raising awareness of public opinion.
But above all, a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers towards a phenomenon that represents a social emergency is in demand.”
Mercandelli also came to speak of "the progressive deterioration of protection for the victims of accidents at work" and denounced "the abolition of the social system against which we have been fighting in recent years".
The aim is, therefore, to return to the worker a guarantee on insurance so that the fate of the victim of a work accident does not depend on voluntary or incidental donations, which are decided from time to time by a legislator.
Mp3 player under charge: risk of hearing damage
Listening to loud music over a longer period of time with portable music devices, such as MP3 players, can lead to permanent hearing damage.
This is reported by the European Commission, which in a report published today in Brussels cites the opinion of the Csrseri (Scientific Committee on the current and recently identified health risks) of the EU.
“The report, as it says in a note, makes it clear that 5-10% of those who listen to loud music with portable music devices for at least five years a week for more than an hour a day risk the permanent loss of their hearing.”
"I am concerned that such a large number of young people, who usually put portable music devices and mobile phones at a high volume, irretrievably damage their hearing without knowing it," Kuneva said.
“From the scientific findings – as it is called by the European Union – there is a clear risk that urges rapid action.
What really matters is to sensitize consumers and turn this information into common sense.
In the light of these scientific findings, we need to re-examine the already existing control systems so that they are fully effective and keep up with the new technology.”
Brussels had commissioned the independent scientific committee in view of the widespread use of portable musical instruments among young people.
"Scientists - as the EU Communication concludes - confirm that one is quite concerned and that the European Commission, together with the other EU members and those concerned, will now examine the necessary measures to better protect children and young people from the noise coming from portable musical instruments and similar devices."
There is already a European standard that limits the level of noise from portable music devices to 100 dB, a concern about the damage that could result from excessive noise pollution.
One can very narrow down these damages by resorting to solutions such as reducing the volume and the length of the noise exposure.
In its report, the Scientific Committee of the European Union points out that if the users of portable music devices only listen to loud music for five hours a week (instead of 89 decibels) so that the legal limits have already been exceeded, which apply to the maximum noise level at the workplace.
Those who exceed this limit risk the complete loss of hearing within five years.
That is to say, 5-10% of users of such devices, the number of which can be estimated at between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Roma, Alemanno kicks off the "Commission for the future of the capital"
We are starting today, in March it is supposed to be over, in June we are going to take stock.
This is the procedure laid down by the Capitol for the work of the "Commission for the Future of the Capital of Rome" and the Commission met this morning in the new headquarters behind the Caracalla thermal baths.
In six months, President Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will work out the guidelines for Rome.
Once the project is completed, the City and Municipal Council will evaluate the analyses and projects to be able to present the strategic plan for Rome in June with the "official stamp" of the Capitol and the Mayor Gianni Alemanno.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and all political, social and cultural opinions are represented in it," - Alemanno stresses. "It will present proposals for a development plan for Rome, whose political responsibility remains with the City and Community Councils.
There is no redistribution of responsibilities, only the will to have a place where one can develop a great project for Rome.
Their task will be completed in March and the Commission will be dissolved again, as such a project must have a time-determined end point.
In June - as the mayor says - we will present the strategic plan in which we will use the work done by the Commission".
If you question the Commission's competence because its opinion lacks accountability, Alemanno replies: "Everything depends on the work the Commission will do and on the quality of its proposals.
If, as in France, the Attali Commission delivers quality results – and this will certainly be the case in Rome – then their contribution will be fundamental.
Too often politics deals with the everyday problems and emergencies that occur from time to time.
We, on the other hand, want to have a longer period of time in mind, in order to work seriously with the development of Rome and the future of the city in a deeper perspective."
The mayor of Rome attaches great importance to clarifying the following: "This commission is neither a useless institution nor a wreck: it is absolutely free, it will not cost the Roman citizens a cent and it will make us think, it will employ the best minds of the capital".
According to Alemanno, “it is necessary to have a strategic plan that is neither hermetic nor static in order to enable our city to take a quality leap – which it really needs – and thus take a common step into the future.”
A future, according to the Mayor of Rome, who "will not only limit himself to the current municipal boundaries, but will look much further", not only with regard to the role of Rome as the metropolis and political capital of Italy, but also as the future capital of Europe and the Mediterranean."
Obama – the first anti-American president? Here a statement
A well-known American politician, who has much to do with being seen as independent, wrote: “Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who decimated the U.S. economy through his decisions and who maintained relations with the enemy Islam (and still does so today as a private man).
The attacks against Obama are becoming increasingly violent, especially now that the elections are approaching.
A lady from Miami wrote on an internet page: “This person is full of ambitions.
Obama is very cheeky: he thinks he will receive the highest office of a nation that has seen a total of two black governors and five black senators."
Actually, these attacks don’t have much to say; they are racist attacks and they don’t answer the voters’ question: will he be a good president? And then there are the polls; everyone says that Obama will win with a big lead.
Even in this case, there are people who talk with the heart and not with the head.
A newspaper from Mississippi, in the deepest south of the United States, wrote in her editorial: Only in the election booth will we know who the real American patriot will give his voice.
Here comes a mentality of the United States that has been kept hidden until the last time.
"Say what you want, then we'll decide who we'll make our crutches for, whether for Obama or for McCain."
There are people there who swear: if Obama wins, we will emigrate from America.
Something you never heard before – only now that the success of the black candidate seems so certain.
In any case, despite all these considerations, the ultimate weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
1500 people were asked: What mistakes did Bush make during his tenure? 89% answered: the war in Iraq.
America is changing.
The nation lost 50,000 soldiers in Vietnam and was sent home with a kick in the ass.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers lost their lives and the Americans were not forced to pack.
However, Iraq remains Bush’s weak spot for the majority.
The one who will take his place is facing a huge task.
The financial collapse also leaves its mark on journalists: in the newspapers you can already feel the cuts. And many accuse the Internet, the "murderer" of the printing press.
Five hundred American journalists were questioned by the PEW Research Center about their situation and their mental control of the future.
Today, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
Nevertheless, they did not really explain to those responsible for the information because of the general credibility.
You don’t feel as alone as you used to.
The problem for American journalists is money.
For these journalists, the 2008 crisis is a crisis of an economic model that has been destroyed.
In addition, the major problems come from the cuts that hit the newsroom, i.e. the space in which the editors work to compile the newspaper.
It’s a problem that needs to be solved – according to the journalists interviewed – if you want to prevent traditional journalism, as the general public understands it, from shrinking significantly.
A clear but complicated pessimism is now being fulfilled by the American journalist.
Six out of ten journalists and executive seniors in the printing press believe that journalism at national level is on the wrong track.
In the local area, it is even up to the 65% of the executives.
Printed vs. Broadcast.
It is not difficult for journalists to imagine in which direction the web is going.
The most important publishing groups are making their way to the Internet, which is considered by many to be the "killer" of the printing press.
The “economic pressure” that journalists feel has increased by up to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed have admitted to wanting to join the new technology, hoping "they bring something good for journalism".
The biggest crack in American journalism today is between the newsroom editors-in-chief and the reporters working for them.
56% of editors-in-chief at national level are confident that their reporters share their values with them, while only 23% at local level.
Some think it has to do with “safety at work.”
The company managers who are afraid of losing their jobs within three years are 47% at the national level.
The number of journalists is 30%.
The topic of "safe work" in the team (our "editors", note d. Red.) is always a current topic in the USA.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In a huge nation, like the United States, with 300 million residents and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio and TV stations and Internet operators, employers offer how they love them and so it becomes a matter of take it or leave it.
The editors-in-chief often get very high wages, but the editor can sometimes only get 10,000 euros per month, plus pension and insurance funds.
When it comes to holidays, things get complicated: a certain amount of days in the first year, so and so many after the third, to finally reach 15 vacation days after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, as they admit to themselves, often get “ill” over the course of the year.
It is a question of climate.
UNIPOL: COURT IN ROME: DANILO COPPOLA STAYS IN GROTTAFERRATA
The president of the second criminal court in Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the real estate agent's request to be transferred from Grottaferrata to Rome.
It is determined against Coppola for bankruptcy in the context of the investigation of the counter-agreement in the case of the acquisition of Unipol-Bnl.
In the course of the trial against him during the last week, his release from house arrest was converted into a residency in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella had asked to allow the real estate agent to move from the provincial city to an apartment in the capital.
According to the court, such relocations (against which the prosecutor’s office had pronounced itself) could give him the opportunity to influence his society and get evidence to accuse him.
The elite are in danger.
The phenomenon had already been revealed a few days ago when the Chamber of Deputies voted against the White House’s $700 billion savings package: a large proportion of Americans were and are more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
This is confirmed by the New York Times’ recent issue, which reports how the crisis in the runoff divides the Republican Party, which is increasingly divided into its old and moderate East Coast souls, which always favored the state institutions and the business community, and those neoconservatives who are hostile to “those in Washington” and the financial world and, above all, win in the South and the center of the states.
This part of the party owes its rise, above all, to the voice of the one I mentioned above.
However, this example just mentioned is only a small part of the major changes that the current economic earthquake announces or even already represents: not only in the US, also throughout the West and perhaps beyond these will be affected by it.
Both in the states and in Europe, the crisis seems to accelerate the long-feared events that are finally taking shape and coming to light under these new conditions.
The first of these phenomena is the rediscovery, the unheard-of renaissance of the state in conjunction with a kind of renationalization of the economy.
In fact, the crisis means a decline in banking and financial institutions, which have close ties to foreign countries and at the same time manage an enormous amount of the assets of private households living in a single state.
This means an immediate political problem for the governments: namely, how to behave towards the families concerned, which are also a huge mass of voters.
So the crisis appears to be economically global, but politically it is almost purely national.
Political internationalism seems to have fallen into disrepair and lost its right to speak: the obvious proof of this has been given by the EU, which, due to its division into various national and international conflicts, does not know how to find a common way.
Therefore, everyone now expects the intervention of their own state; rescue plans, new rules, and, above all, the distribution of aid funds: Since the crisis became increasingly serious, only the US in the economic situation is able to save itself without foreign aid.
In addition to the funds, they also have the legitimacy to use them: thus, two conditions that are not to be overvalued – under certain circumstances – to which otherwise no international organization and no market will be able to use them in a similar way.
That new emphasis placed on the state-national element is, moreover, in perfect harmony with the ever-increasing importance that has recently been associated in the economy with a closely related sector: territoriality.
Paradoxically, it is right now, when we were so convinced that we had long since entered a networked whole empire, into a realm of ever-differentiated technologies, of the immaterial, that we must at once determine how our future will depend more and more on the essential material things: water, harvest and oil.
While these can certainly all be transported from one place to the other in the world, they are nevertheless connected to an extremely narrow piece of earth – a territory.
Therefore, the one who has such a territory is advantageous to another who lives in a cropless, waterless or oil-free area.
I now come to the second novelty, which, however, requires a brief introduction.
Those who have territory, those who have government, those who say politics, say leadership.
In this sense, the financial crisis seems to generate two converging phenomena.
On the one hand, there is the knowledge of the need for respected leaderships, that is, the need for someone who knows how to regulate things.
On the other hand, there is now a wave of outrage over the existing leaderships, especially those of the economy, which have turned out to be inadequate and full of shadow zones.
Finally, there is a deeper and, in a sense, even more disturbing aspect: a loss of trust, an impatience, an image of inadequacy, a sense of distance, all of which is directed at a whole class of managers in Western countries.
It seems the conviction among large sections of the population to pave the way that it is not only the actions of the social elite, but already their world of ideas, their way of life, their culture in the broadest sense of the word, whose salary the majority is increasingly foreign and superior.
The demand for leadership thus feeds underground a branched but powerful movement of power against the leading class and the traditional political establishment. This manifests itself in unforeseen "revolts" of the voters and in the immediate reversal of the collective state of mind of recent times: starting with the rise of the conservatives in Austria and Bavaria, on the rise of the British Conservatives.
One gets the impression that the old elite, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, magazines, intellectual creditors, some would say their format, more and more understanding problems and therefore less representative value as to what is going on in the lower social strata of the West these days, and is still reinforced by the financial crisis and driven to overdimensionality.
In view of all this, it would simply be exaggerated to speak of a “rebellion of the masses.”
But keeping your eyes wide open is certainly not.
The super glue that goes up on walls
Defeat the forces of gravity thanks to an adhesive and be able to climb up walls like Superman.
This is the subject of four American research centers, one of which has now seemingly almost reached the target.
With an adhesive applied on an area of only 2.5 square meters, the researchers managed to fix a 100 kg body on a vertical wall.
The STUDIO – an American journal has published the results of researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the research team is a further development of the adhesives already used, which use a special carbon structure, called carbon nanotubes.
“The principle of glue can be imagined as a series to a stack of spaghetti-arranged tubes,” said Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The scientists have been inspired by the feet of the geckos, which are covered by microscopic hairs that give the animal a perfect hold.
Tests carried out with different materials such as glass Teflon and sandpaper have shown that the new adhesive is ten times stronger than the durability of the feet of the reptiles and at the same time allows "problemless removal from the wall", according to Liming Dai, a researcher at the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Dayton.
"This material could be used as a perishable adhesive," Liming Dai adds.
Perhaps, but the researchers are more likely to think of a less fascinating benefit, such as the connection of electrical devices, because the nanotubes are also the conductors of heat and electricity.
Other areas of application may fall within the space sector.
For the moment, the superheroes still have to wait.
THE OTHER ART OF RESEARCH – also the University of Berkeley, California, is dedicated to a new type of adhesive.
In an article by the American Chemical Society, Californian scientists present a microfiber adhesive that, like hair, cleans itself from dust by moving on a surface and thus always maintains a perfect adhesion.
Medicines: never take with fruit juice
Beware of grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These beverages, which are consumed in summer due to their refreshing quality and vitamin richness, can cause serious health damage if taken at the same time with certain vital medicines, since they can have an extreme effect on the absorption of these by the body.
David Bailey, professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, repeatedly points to the risk of packaged as well as fresh fruit juices in conjunction with medication intake. As part of the 236th meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he again raised an alarm: A glass of apple, orange or grapefruit juice is sufficient to reduce the absorption capacity of certain vital medicines to the extent that they are virtually limped in health.
Grapefruit juice was already suspected to be responsible for increasing the effects of some drugs such as antibiotics, antiasthmatics, cardiovascular drugs, anxiolytic and neurological agents, up to toxic levels.
Medications in Danger – The same agency of the drug had warned doctors and patients about the dangers of this mixture in a report two years ago, stressing to watch out for what is drunk in conjunction with drugs such as diazepan or methadone.
It’s not just GRAPEFRUT – According to the experts, orange juice and apple juice also contain substances that can inhibit the medicines.
The list of active substances inhibited by fruit juices is long.
Therefore, Michele Carruba, director of the Universit<0xC3><0xA0> Statale di Milano, said: "These results are usually immediately forwarded to the various international manufacturers, who are thus free to change consumer information.
Therefore, it is recommended to always read the package leaflet and, if there is any ambiguity, not to be afraid to ask a pharmacist or doctor,” emphasizes the expert of the Ansa Agency.
Nobel Prize goes to Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize is awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his analysis of trade patterns and the settlement of economic activities.
The 55-year-old Krugman is a Neokeynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is known for his regular articles for the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration’s economic and foreign policy.
A few months after the September 11, 2001 attacks, during the days of the Enron collapse, Krugman had claimed in a New York Times editorial that this second event was more crucial to the history of the United States than the assassinations.
A prediction that did not receive little polemics in response and was held to the economist years later, but proved to be absolutely correct today.
"I am surprised and also shocked at how quickly the memory of the scandals disappeared from the public eye as part of the collapses of Enron or Worldcom," Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is an "economist of great value", but also a banaliser with a "very aggressive style, which is particularly directed against the excessive liberalism of the Bush administration."
Open Office, the third version of the "Anti-Microsoft" package will be released
The day of publication of OpenOffice.org 3.0 has come; the Open Source Software wins as a free replacement for Microsoft’s Office an increasing number of users, both at home and in the office, both among freelancers and in public administration.
After a year of intensive work by the volunteer developers, which is monitored by SUN Microsystems, the new Open Office now presents itself to the public with some novelties: in addition to a revised and now more spartanly designed initial menu, now finally a guaranteed compatibility with Apple’s Mac OS x operating system has been achieved, as well as support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2 format, i.e. the latest version of the Open Document Format.
It also noted compatibility with Microsoft Office 2007, whose new formats (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx) can be read by OpenOffice.
Also interesting are some new features, such as those that allow to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, which makes it easier, for example, to send via email. This also includes the possibility of importing PDF files into graphics editing modules and at the same time preserving the original appearance of the page.
Thus, hybrid PDF files can now also be generated, which extend the typical graphics of the Adobe format to the elements of a table and a word processing system.
Collaboration is one of the most improved elements of the applications: tables can now be edited by multiple users, avoiding conflicts in the event of changes; in the case of the word processing system, each editor is assigned a question to guarantee a better correction procedure.
Some companies are just about to publish various features of OpenOffice on the Internet (on the cloud), while the final result will be made public in the coming weeks.
The Italian version is available for download at the following link: http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html. Thus, it follows the English version, which has been on the mirrors since Friday.
Except for Windows and Mac OS, the program is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request, you can have the installation CD sent to your home or office.
However, if cost-freeness can be an incentive for the distribution of the program in private households, it is also in the business sector where OpenOffice could succeed in the big throw: after all, various public administration and schools institutions have already moved to OpenOffice.
In fact, there is not even a lack of a training offer, which means optimal help for small and medium-sized enterprises, and thus even opens up business prospects.
OpenOffice consists of five main components: Writer, the Word corresponding text creation program; Calc, the table program that aims to displace Excel; Impress, for creating presentations such as PowerPoint; Dbase for running databases instead of the more familiar Access; and finally Draw, a graphics module.
The goal for 2008 is to achieve 5 million downloads – a goal that can be easily exceeded with already reached 3 million and 600 thousand.
Kohl also tested positive and thus the fourth doping case
A new doping case opens up in the framework of the past Tour de France: it is the Austrian athlete Bernhard Kohl of the team Gerolsteiner, who is the third-classified and winner of the jersey of the best climber.
The news was published by the daily newspaper L'Equipe on its website.
The 26-year-old Kohl from Team Gerolsteiner is the fourth driver to be tested positive for Cera, the third-generation epo. This was previously the case with the Italians Riccardo Ricc<0xC3><0xB2> and Leonardo Piepoli as well as the German Stefan Schumacher.
The analyses from the blood samples from Kohls are among those carried out in the last weeks by the laboratories Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the counter-samples now confirm the positive results on Cera, the Austrian will lose his third place and be excluded from the races for two years.
The head of the French anti-doping commission Pierre Bordry confirmed the positive epotest, and, according to the Associated Press, also notified the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian rose to the podium behind the Spaniard Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans and also claimed the jersey of the best climber for himself.
THEME IMPLEMENTATION: THE NEW YORK TIMES QUESTION: IS ITALIA RASSISTIC?
Italy, "the former country of emigrants has recently become one of the preferred countries for immigrants", which are only received with reluctance.
This is what the New York Times asks in a long article devoted entirely to the subject of racism in Italy, starting from the case of young Burkina Faso-born Abdul William Guibre, who was murdered a month ago in Milan after stealing a pack of cookies.
The case bears witness to what the Times calls the “Paradox of the North”: the northern regions are those in which “most integration and employment opportunities” exist, and yet “the highest level of anti-immigration sentiments and the greatest support of the Lega North is to be found.”
As confirmation of the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the Times calls for further episodes of intolerance from Milan, Rome, Parma, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
And not just this.
The new legislation introduced by the Lega against immigration and the faster expulsion of illegal immigrants is also cited as a sign of climate change in Italy.
A movement that also underscores the Pope and the President: "Giorgio Napolitano asked the Pope at a meeting at the Quirinal for cooperation between the Church and the State to combat racism."
Students victims of up to 900 euros per room high rental prices
The student housing market has no crisis.
According to the latest Sunia study, the tenant union, a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples and 600 in Rome.
“This phenomenon has already taken on very serious traits, and so many students are losing their right to study, as their families are unable to support them at this level” – according to Sunia executives, Laura Mariani – “in these cities, the high demand on the part of the students leads to a deformity of the market that has also damaged the other residents.
In addition, most rental offers include a number of violations: free contracts, missing registrations, no rental price limit, unauthorized subletting.
For Sunia, there is a need for exceptional measures that lead to lower rental prices by revising taxation.
Looking at the investigation in more detail, it turns out that in Milan a sleeping place in the Brianza district is needed about 450 euros; a single room starts at 650 euros (in the Bande Nere district) and ends with 800 euros in the Lambiate, Udine and Fiera district or even 900 euros in the Vittoria district.
In Florence, a sleeping space costs an average of 350/400 euros, a room costs 700.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in the neighborhoods around the university, are 250/280 euros for a sleeping place of necessities, 370 to 500 for a single room.
In Rome, the prices in the districts around the university are about 600 euros for a single room, 450 for a sleeping place in a double room.
Only a little lower are the rents in the districts around the other universities of Rome: 550 euros in Ostiense and Cinecitt<0xC3><0xA0>.
Only those who dodge in outlying districts can save money: 300 euros for a sleeping place and 450 euros for a single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and similar quarters.
In Naples you need 300-450 euros for a sleeping place, for a room the price is between 400 and 600 euros in the most expensive neighborhoods, the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari a sleeping place costs 250-350 euros, a single room at least 350.
In the smallest cities, prices are lower, but they have a greater weight in the urban economy.
In the cities where the phenomenon of renting out to non-European students is more common, such as Perugia, there is even another anomaly: a rent that is 25-30% above average is demanded by foreign students.
Farewell to the old Paradiso cinema – the cities close their historic cinemas
The historical cinemas close due to the favored multiplex cinemas.
“A city without cinemas is a blind city, like a face without eyes.”
This image of the director Giuseppe Tornatore describes with effect what is currently happening in the major urban centers of Italy, and also in the provinces.
The process of exclusion of cinemas, which began with the birth of the large multi-room complexes in the periphery, means in the long run the death of the single-room cinema in the center, a process that not only seems inevitable and irrevocable, but also carries the traits of a cultural crime.
“It’s like losing a friend with whom you’ve covered a piece of street full of emotions,” says the director of the film “Nuovo Cinema Paradiso”, who brought him the Oscar and the Grand Prix of Cannes 20 years ago. It’s the story of a suburban cinema and its nostalgia, which consists of living in a cinema world that is probably lost forever.
The figures provided by the Anec, the central trade association, speak a clear language: in the last five years, the enormous amount of 316 traditional cinemas have had to close; these works mostly paid for the cinemas in the big cities: 10 in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
The most affected regions include Emilia-Romagna with 82 lost cinemas, followed by Tuscany with 44 and Lombardy with 41.
This proves that the main culprits are the multiplex cinemas, because it is precisely these three regions in which the largest number of these modern cinemas has been registered: with 195 in the last 5 years, Lombardy leads the lists, 81 in both Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna.
"The business has developed in an irrational way," said Paolo Protti, president of Anec, "although it is useful that new structures also arise, but the first priority is the preservation of what already exists, because if a hall in the city closes, not all of its regular customers are ready to visit a multiplex cinema in the periphery instead of the old one.
And here the lack of budget for the fund of the trade association remains to be seen: the debt burden recorded by the state amounts to about 10 million euros.
It is a shame from the ethical-moral point of view that the government does not comply with existing laws.
To maintain the sector would be between 16 and 18 million euros per year of distress".
Interesting is the case of Bologna, the first Italian city, which, due to the fears surrounding the old cinemas, has decided to protect it by an agreement between the municipality and the Anec; it is the first such agreement in Italy aimed at protecting and supporting traditional cinemas, both in the historical centre and in the periphery.
Among the measures envisaged are tax benefits for cinema operators as well as benefits for the public in terms of local transport: it will be allowed to drive to the traffic restricted areas of the centre and also to park at cheaper parking fees.
“It’s a pleasing initiative,” said Giuseppe Tornatore, “I hope that other cities will join our example and also design new concepts.
But certainly we also need better audio and video equipment in order to be able to do something against the superpower of the multiplex rooms, because after all, today’s audience is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema has always been an important issue for me: the closure of Baghiera’s “Supercinema”, the place of my childhood and youth, was the decisive point that led me to found the “Nuovo cinema Paradiso”, even though I had been playing with my mind for 10 years.
For 25 years I have been living in Rome; when I pass by the Rialto or Quirinale in Via Nazionale, where I have experienced so many different emotions, I turn to the side so as not to have to see the dust-covered posters.
The links between politics and 'Ndrangheta lead to the arrest of the mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to adapt the decisions of the community to the interests of the Mafia group Piromalli.
The accusations of the attorneyship of the Antimafia authority of Calabria against Mayor Giorgio Dal Torrione and his deputy Rosario Schiavone of the municipality of Gioia Tauro, who were arrested this morning for involvement in mafia business, are serious.
In handcuffs, Gioacchino Piromalli, the older mediator between the clan and the public administration, as well as his nephew: the lawyer, who bears the same name as the boss of the clan, had already been convicted of involvement in criminal associations of the Mafia, at that time to a compensation of 10 million euros.
"Any kind of moral and legal norm disregarding," the lawyers write, "the two local administrations had decided to pay the lawyer Piromalli funds for consulting activities."
“This made it possible for the mafia group – according to the judges – to enter the town halls on an official basis and to co-determine the policy of public administration.”
The president of the Calabrian Regional Committee Agazio Loiero does not deny that it is "anything but an exception in his region to encounter connections from local administrations and organized crime." "There are places in which the concentration of the Mafia is greater than in others in which such connections are practically inevitable.
But there are also local politicians who resist the pressure of the 'Ndrangheta: heroes who get a white vest."
The arrests of this morning follow those of last July, with which, according to the police of the Clan Piromalli was beheaded.
Since the end of April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved, but as early as 1991 – and even then due to alleged links between organized crime and local administration – local politicians had been removed from their municipal offices.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, then mayor of the Udc, was elected head of the Middle Right coalition after the May 2006 run-off election.
He shouted scandal when the prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
He was interested in Vice-Minister Marco Minniti, who he accused of inventing everything for political-strategic reasons, but the judges, in connection with this morning’s arrest warrant, declare that the Piromalli clan had even dared to request a change to the A3 project.
From a hearing in connection with the investigations into the Dal Torrione case, the willingness to meet the wishes of an entrepreneur who is known to be a representative of the large group around the Piromalli has been demonstrated – making the public administration’s actions identical to the interests of this clan.”
When the energy comes out of the waves, the big ones suddenly run up.
It is a non-depleting source of money that covers over 70% of the planet’s surface and only now seems to understand this the world’s major energy companies.
Waves, currents and tides are the new renewable energy sources that all now look at, and also seek to occupy, such as giants like Chevron.
The possibility of extracting energy from the movements of the sea has been considered and studied for 70 years; not by chance, these studies have intensified considerably since the first oil crisis.
When the price of oil collapsed around 1980, the idea of marine energy was gassed, but now the environmental organizations and the increased price of oil are pushing for new impetus in this sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimates that 15% of the world’s energy demand could be covered by the energy generated by the ocean waves.
This would be equal to twice the energy currently produced by nuclear power plants.
In addition, there were also currents and tides.
Giants in the attack.
The first company to rely on marine energy is Enersis, which signed a contract to build a power plant in northern Portugal in 2005.
When this news was published, it seemed to be a revolutionary step.
Two years later, more and more companies from the traditional energy industry are now relying on marine energy production.
“Chevron is investigating these technologies,” said the spokesperson of a company known to the American giant in the Wall Street Journal, and is considering the possibility of working with us.
This is about obtaining an approval from the U.S. Energy Commission, which is needed to launch a project off the coast of Alaska.
This is a sign not to be underestimated, especially considering that oil is still being promoted by the United States in Alaska, and President Bush recently set in motion plans for new drilling.
In addition to Chevron, New York-based Verdant Power Inc. and New Jersey-based Ocean Power are also investing in the new industry; if the details are not known, observers are talking about an increasing interest.
Even better technologies.
Experts speak of a technology that is still in its infancy, not least because the last doubts have not yet been clarified by environmentalists.
So far, projects such as those in Portugal and Scotland are of rather small dimensions and do not seem to cause any serious ecological problems.
However, in order to produce energy on a large scale, it requires technologies with far greater impact on the environment.
There are several possibilities: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of interconnected buoys.
The thrust of the shafts, which move the buoys up and down, is converted into hydraulic pressure within the floats via pistons and cylinders.
This drives a turbine, which in turn operates a generator.
The electricity is then sent to the coast via underwater pipelines.
So far, there are four planned installations of this kind, which are only waiting for state approval. Part of the energy obtained could also serve military facilities.
However, Verdant Power already produces energy for a department store and a parking lot using submarine turbines in the East River of New York.
The water movements during tides drive the turbines, which feed the generator as a result of the resulting rotational movement.
According to Verdant, a long line of potential clients is already waiting for the necessary authorizations to use these energy sources.
First the waves, then the tides.
A particular interest, according to the Institute for Power Generation Research, is currently deserving of the potential that lies in the tides.
Although it is also an irregular phenomenon, the tides are better predictable than wind currents, solar radiation and also waves, and therefore a more reliable source of electricity.
It is precisely tidal energy that led states such as New York, Maine and Alaska, as well as other coastal states, to invest up to $7.5 million in 2008 – up to 35 million are planned for 2009.
