Well-known officials are concerned about “feeling like a curse”
Uggur is in some councils for a proposal to have their title changed to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, member of the Welsh Parliament).
The concerns are raised as a result of the plan to change the name of the Council in the Welsh Parliament.
Officers from all classes are concerned that it could make them atherosclerosis.
One member of the Labour Party said his party was concerned that “it is rich with Twp and Pwp.”
For readers living outside Wales: in Welsh, twp means nonsense and pwp means poison.
Officer of the Plaid Cymru group said the group as a whole was “unsatisfied” and has made other proposals for the name.
An official from the Welsh Conservative Party said his party had “open mind” about the name change, but pointed out that there was not much difference between the word MWP and Muppet (Flon).
In this context, it can be noted that the Welsh letter w is drilled similar to u in Icelandic.
The Council, which is now working on a legislative bill to submit the name changes, said: “The final decision on all the names that are held over the members of the Council will of course lie with the members themselves.”
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh Council the power to change its name.
In June, the Council published the results of a public opinion poll that showed great support for calling the Council a "Welsh Parliament".
With regard to the title of Councillors, the Council elected WMP (Welsh Parliament members, Welsh parliamentarians) but the MWP received the most support from the public in the polls.
According to the news, ministers are now making other proposals, but it could be difficult to reach an agreement for the Chairman of the Council, Elin Jones, who is to present a bill on the changes within a few weeks.
The initial report on the improvements will also include other changes to the functioning of the Council, including rules on the removal of council members and the organisation of the committee system.
Officers will be able to pay final votes on their title when discussions on the bill begin.
Macedonians to vote in elections on name change in the country
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether to change the name of their country to “Republic of North Macedonia.”
This case was put to the vote in an attempt to resolve a decades-long dispute with the neighbouring country of Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
For a long time, Athens has maintained the name of its neighbours in the northern equivalent of the claim in its territory and has frequently objected to their applications for membership of the EU and NATO.
President of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, who disagrees with the vote on the name change, has said that he will not look at the elections that apply.
However, supporters of the polls, including the Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, have said that the name change is simply the price that needs to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
Church Clock St. Martin Sounds Are Churches in Harlem Having Difficulty
“The older people I’ve talked to said that before could find a bar and a church on every street corner,” Mr. Adams said.
“There is no one to be found there today.”
He said it was understandable that the bars could be reduced.
“People have other ways of meeting,” he said.
“Bars are no longer the centers of the neighborhood where people come together regularly.”
As far as the churches are concerned, he is concerned that the money raised from the sale of property will not last as long as leaders expect “and sooner or later they will be back in the starting line.”
He added that churches might be replaced by residential buildings that were full of people who would not help save the remaining ramparts of the area.
“The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white,” he said, “and will therefore be quick to shut down these churches completely, because it is unlikely that most of the people who move into these apartments will become members of these churches.”
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became the center of blacks – the Metropolitan Community Church was built in 1870, and St. Martin’s Church decades later.
The original White Methodist congregation moved out in the 1940s.
A collection of black people who had worked in the area took over the building.
St. Martin’s Church’s congregation took over the St. Martin’s Church under the guidance of John Howard Johnson, who had the initiative to profile shopkeepers on 125th Street, Harlem’s main shopping street, who wanted to recruit and provide them with a position increase.
The building was seriously damaged in a firestorm in 1939, but members of Johnson's congregation made plans to rebuild it and also allowed them to build the timepiece.
David Johnson, the son and successor to Johnson, called the game proudly “the watch of the poor people.”
The expert who played the clock game in July called it another name: “Human Resources Fund” and “a unique historical instrument.”
The expert, Tiffany Ng, from the University of Michigan, also noted that this was the first time a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, played on the clock, but he moved on to a larger clock game in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr Merriweather said that St. Martin had no one else in his place.
Over the past month, many architects and contractors have made their way to St. Martin, some hired by the church leaders and others of the bishopric.
The Church Council, which oversees the visit and is appointed church leaders, wrote the diocese in July and expressed its concern that the diocese “would seek to transfer the cost to” the church council, even if it had not been involved in the appointment of the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some of the visiting members complained about the lack of transparency of the part of the bishop's papacy.
Shark injures 13-year-old boy who chewed lobster in California
According to the authorities, a shark attacked a 13-year-old boy and injured him on Saturday when the boy was diving for lobster in California on the first day of the lobster fishing season.
The attack occurred just before seven o’clock in the morning near Beacon’s Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy shouting for help and then traveling over with a group of others to help get him out of the water.
Hammel said that he had initially thought that it was just a thrill to have reached the mood, but then “he realized that the boy was shouting, ‘I was bitten!
I was bitten!”
All the work on him was torn up," Hammel said of what he saw when he came to the boy.
“I called everyone to get out of the water: ‘There’s a shark in the water!’” added Hammel.
The boy was transported by helicopter to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is seriously injured.
It is not known what type of shark is that attacks the boy.
The Coast Guard executive Larry Giles said at a press conference that sharks had been seen in the area a few weeks before, but he was not of a dangerous type of shark.
Giles added that the sacrificial lamb had caused serious damage to the upper part of the body.
Authorities closed beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami’s beach in Encinitas for 48 hours, for research and safety reasons.
Giles said that over 135 different shark species were in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s plan to move to the UK cosmetics market
Sainsbury’s aims to compete with Boots, SuperDrug and Debenhams with mall-style cosmetic shelters and specially trained assistants.
This is part of the plan to enter the UK’s cosmetics market, which is worth <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion and is constantly growing while sales of fashion and household goods are decreasing. The larger cosmetics shelves will be tested in 11 stores across the country and will be put up in more stores next year if successful.
Investing in cosmetic products is part of a way of large-scale use of hilltop storage that was previously used by televisions, microwaves and household products.
Sainsbury’s says it plans to double its cosmetic range in up to 3,000 product types, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Current products from L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will also have increased space with marked areas similar to those found in stores such as Boots.
The store also intends to resell its Boutique cosmetics range so that the majority of the products are vegan-friendly, but younger consumers demand it to a greater extent.
In addition, Fragrance Shop will test product stands at two Sainsbury’s stores, the first one opened in Croydon in south London last week and the next one will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham later this year.
Online shopping and an increased tendency for consumers to buy a small amount of food daily in urban shops means that large markets need to put more effort into getting people to come to them.
Mike Coupe, Sainsbury’s chief executive, said the stores would be more like shopping malls as the chain tries to fight the low-cost stores of Aldi and Lidl with more services and products than food.
Sainsbury’s has put Argos stores in hundreds of stores and has also introduced to the history of a number of Habitat stores since both chains were purchased two years ago. According to them, it has increased sales and made the purchase more profitable.
The store’s previous attempt to liven up its cosmetics and pharmaceutical departments failed.
Sainsbury’s partnered with Boots around 2000 and ended up having a dispute over how to share the proceeds of drug sales in the big markets.
The new policy comes after Sainsbury’s sold its 281-count pharmaceuticals to Celesio, owner of Lloyd’s pharmaceuticals, at <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
According to the policy, Lloyds will play a role in these plans by adding a wide range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Marketing Director of Sainsbury’s, said: “We’ve revolutionized the look of our beauty products to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in special training for staff who will be within the reach of advice.
Our brand selection is designed to meet every need. A charming environment and comfortable locations make us an exciting cosmetics store that transforms old shopping habits."
Peter Jones 'safety' after Holly Willoughby quits <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
Peter Jones, the star of Dragons Den, became “aware” after television announcer Holly Willoughby quit his 11 million pound deal with his company to focus on new deals with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time for their household goods and accessories brand, Truly.
The company had been similar to Goop, brand Gwyneth Paltrow.
Willoughby, 37, announced his decision on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has left Peter Jones, the star from Dragons’ Den, with a painful ending by quitting a popular lifestyle company at the last minute to focus on new and profitable deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones has been “satisfied” at a difficult meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of her business district in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, when the television actress popularly acknowledged she didn’t have enough time for the Truly household goods and accessories label due to the new contracts worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million.
The company has been similar to Goop, the Gwyneth Paltrow brand, and was designed to double Willoughby's assets, with an estimated value of <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When Willoughby, age 37, announced on Instagram that she was going to withdraw from Truly flying Jones from the UK to stay at one of her many summer homes.
A source said: “Truly was the longest on Holly’s lead list.
This was to be her future project that would bring her income over the next two decades.
Her decision to quit was completely up to the public.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, it was so short that the line moved to the market.
There is a full stock of products at Marlow headquarters that are ready to go for sale."
Experts believe that the elimination of this morning’s presentation, which is among the UK’s most popular stars, could cost the company millions due to high commodity investments, ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and household goods, and possibly cause further delays in the product line going on sale.
It could also be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a three-child mother, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been friends with Jones and Töra Capp, his wife, for decades.
Willoughby co-founded Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined them as Chairman of the Board in March.
The pair spend their vacations together and Jones owns 40 percent of the company Baldwin, which produces television.
Willoughby will be the official representative of the brand M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as the ITV’s I’m a Celebrity.
A close friend of mine, Jones, said last night, “We don’t want to say anything about his business.”
“We had a hard time, and then we fell in love.”
He took advantage of the criticism he received from the media, for saying something that many would consider inappropriate for presidents, and for being so positive in the garden of the leaders of North Korea.
Why has President Trump given so much?
Trump said, “I’m angry with a reporter’s voice.
“I haven’t given anything.”
He noted that Kim was interested in another meeting after Trump called their first meeting in Singapore in June a major step towards North Korea’s nuclear disarmament.
However, talks have been held about shutting down nuclear weapons.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, Ri Yong Ho, the main North Korean ambassador, told UN leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the North had not received an “appropriate response” from the United States at the first steps towards nuclear disarmament.
Instead, the United States continued to keep up with trade unions for the purpose of maintaining pressure.
Trump was more positive in his speech.
“We’re very close to North Korea,” he said.
“We were going to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have lost their lives.
Now our relationship is great.”
He said his attempts to improve relations with Kim have returned positive results—fire tests would have stopped, hostages would have been released, and the Earthly remains of U.S. soldiers were returned home.
Also, he warned his unusual approach to talking about his relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to behave like a president, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into the tedious stadium, there were only 200 people standing there,” Trump said, pointing out the crowd in front of him.
Floods and earthquakes in Indonesia cause major damage to the island, hundreds have disappeared
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, international aid organizations were told that they were not needed.
Despite the fact that more than 10 percent of Lombok’s residents had to flee their homes, the state of emergency was not described, but it is a prerequisite for international organizations to be able to have relief activities there.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it clear that they are not going to ask for assistance from international organisations, so that this is difficult,” said Ms Sumbung.
While the Save the Children Association is putting together a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet certain when foreign relief workers can have jobs in the area.
Mr Sutopo, a spokesman for the country’s holocaust organisation, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international organisations should be able to assist in the relief efforts.
Considering the prevalence of earthquakes in Indonesia, the country is sadly ill-prepared to defend the natural resources.
The floodplains have been built in Aceh, but they are rarely seen on other shorelines.
So it seems that the demand for flood protection jets in Palu has still increased on human lives, even though the warning has been issued.
Even in the best conditions, it can be a challenge to travel between the many islands in Indonesia.
Natural disasters make planning even more complicated.
A medical ship that has docked at Lombok port to help victims of the earthquake is now on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to arrive at the new accident site.
President Joko Widodo made it the main point of his election campaign to improve the depressed transportation routes of Indonesia and has put a lot of money in the way and railways.
The lack of funding has, however, plagued Mr. Joko’s administration, but elections will be held next year.
Mr. Joko also needs to deal with the ongoing tension between religious groups in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have committed themselves to a more sustainable religious policy.
More than 1,000 people died, and tens of thousands had to leave their homes because the Christian and Muslim gangs were fighting in the streets with swords, bows and arrows and other primitive weapons.
See: Daniel Sturridge, Liverpool player, equals Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing to Chelsea in the Premier League by scoring an 89th minute in Saturday’s game at Stamford Bridge Stadium in London.
Sturridge received a broadcast from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 meters from Chelsea's goal, his team was below 1-0.
He rolled the ball to the left and then attempted a shot to the far pole.
The ball flew high above the target and towards its right corner.
The ball finally crossed Kepa Arrizabalaga, which jumped up, and into the net.
“I just wanted to try to get into this position, to catch the ball, and players like Shaq always play it as fast as possible so I tried to create as much time as I could,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante come and touch once and didn’t think so much about it, but just took the shot.”
Chelsea were over 1-0 in half after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
In the match, the Chelsea goalkeeper handed the ball to Mateo Kovacic and then bounced from the centre over to Liverpool.
Kovacic let the ball run quickly between the center.
Then he sent the ball forward and sent Hazard in for the penalty.
Hazard ran off the defenders and scored in the far corner with a left-footed shot ahead of Alisson Becker, Liverpool's goalkeeper.
Liverpool play against Naples in the semifinals of the Premier League at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea play against Videoton in UEFA European Division at 3:00 p.m. on Thursday in London.
Number of deaths rises to 832 after floods in Indonesia
The number of deaths caused by the earthquake and floods in Indonesia has risen to 832, according to a report by the country’s disaster agency early on Sunday.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the agency's spokesman, said at a news conference that the number of people had been buried when buildings crashed in the earthquake that occurred on Friday and was 7.5 points on the Richter scale. The quake caused flood waves reaching up to 6 meters high.
The city of Palu, which has over 380,000 inhabitants, was covered with buildings that had collapsed.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man, suspected of murder, after a woman was stabbed to death
A murder investigation has begun after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
A 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 this morning near Grayson Mews on John Street and a 32-year-old man was arrested, suspected of murder.
Police have urged people in the area to submit if they saw or heard anything.
Brian O’Hagan, a research representative, said: “The investigation has begun but I would like to ask all those around John Street in Birkenhead to contact us if they saw or heard anything suspicious.
Also, I would like to ask everyone, especially the taxi driver, who may have got something in the picture with their car cameras to contact us, because they could have important information for our investigation."
Police have confirmed that the woman who died lived in Birkenhead and that she was found inside the apartment.
By the end of the day, people who thought they knew the woman had come to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation continues and police say work to let close relatives of the victim know.
The taxi driver, who lives in Grayson Mews, tried to get back into his apartment, but the police told him that no one could enter or leave the building.
He was speechless when he discovered what had happened.
People have been told that many hours could pass until they can go back in.
A police officer was heard telling a man that the entire area was now considered a scene of crime.
A crying woman came to the scene.
She kept saying, “It’s so horrible.”
At 2 p.m., two police cars were parked inside the police area and one car was parked outside.
The number of police officers stood within the marked area and monitored the apartment buildings.
Anyone who may have any information is asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Gl<0xC3><0xA6>palinna anonymously by phone 0800 555 111 and provide the number 247 from 30 September.
Cromwell is the latest monument to the British Parliament that is accused of “rewriting the story.”
The ban would be a poetic justice for the destruction of the Taliban’s puritan followers on so many cultural and religious demons of England.
The Cromwell Society, however, said that Mr. Crick's proposal was "foolish" and "an attempt to rewrite the story."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “In the discussion about the removal of the cut, it was inevitable that the cut of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster Palace would be for the battle.
The Andophian English Civil War against the Cultural Sign was neither the decree nor the execution of Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the century before.
The magnificent bust of Cromwell, by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is a landmark of the 19th-century modernist spirit and is part of the history of a man that many consider to have yet to be praised.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more late in the 19th century than today, to have been the protector of the Parliament against external pressure, in his case the Kingdom.
There is still a lot of historical controversy as to whether this description is entirely correct.
However, it is certain that the conflicts that were in the mid-17th century have shaped the development of our nation and that Cromwell is a well-known person who represents one side of the conflict.
It is worth honoring and remembering his achievements as the protector of the state."
Pigs fight Chinese farmer and kill him
Pigs attacked Chinese farmers and killed them on the market in southwestern China, according to news from the site.
The man, named only by his last name “Yuan,” was found dead with a broken artery and covered blood near a sturgeon on the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, according to news from the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
The pig farmer is preparing to inject vaccines into pigs in the pig industry on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai province, China.
He had reportedly traveled with his cousins from the Yunnan neighbourhood on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, the uncle found him dead and saw that the door to the nearby hospital was open.
He said there was a big hole in the door with a bloody mouth.
According to the report, a legal study confirmed that 250 kg of gold had killed the farmer.
“My uncle’s feet were bloody and wounded,” said the cousin, with the surname “Wu”, to the Guiyang Evening News news agency.
Recording from a security camera showed Yuan coming to the market at 4:40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not owned by Yuan or his uncle.
The owner of the market told Evening News that the pig had been locked inside so that no one else was caught while police were collecting evidence on the scene.
According to the news, Yuan’s family and the owners of the market are in talks about benefits for his death.
There are recorded examples of pigs attacking people, although it is rare.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their home in Massachusetts and seriously injured the man.
Ten years earlier, 300 kg of pigs squeezed a well-to-do farmer by a tractor until his wife dropped the animal.
After a Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, another Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that their blood-stained behavior can arouse aggressiveness.
“They’re just playing.
They like to forget and are curious... they don’t want to hurt anyone.
You just have to show them respect,” he said.
The remnants of the R<0xC3><0xB3>su volcano have a large impact on the southwestern part of the United States.
As was predicted, the strength of the R<0xC3><0xB3>sa volcano decreases as it crosses a cooler port on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, R<0xC3><0xB3>sa will have a large impact that could cause flooding in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the next few days.
R<0xC3><0xB3>sa became a Category 1 hurricane with winds up to 136 km per hour, at 5 a.m. to the east beach on Sunday, and it was located about 600 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is estimated that Ros<0xC3><0xB3>s will be heading north on Sunday.
At the same time, the formation of the Pacific Ocean will be reduced to the east to the west coast of the United States. When Rose arrives at the Baja California shack on Monday as a hot-weather storm, a major heatwave will follow north into the southwestern part of the United States.
Roses will follow up to 25 cm of precipitation in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
The heatwave will then be mixed with the altitude approaching to form a large, wide-footed precipitation over the southwestern part of the region in the coming days.
Local 2.5 to 10 cm precipitation can cause dangerous rapids, movement of soil and possible landslides in the desert.
A high temperature will cause up to 5 to 10 cm of precipitation in an hour in some places, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
It is expected to reach up to 5 to 10 cm of precipitation in some places in the southwestern part, especially in the majority of Arizona counties.
There is a possibility of rapid flooding in a rapidly changing situation due to the distribution of temperature gradients.
People are strongly advised against walking out into the desert when there is a risk of a temperature rise.
A great deal of rain can turn the guilds into the beckoning rapids and thunderstorms have resulted in whaling and dust storms.
The nearby beds will carry a local shed in certain areas along the Southern California coastline.
There is a possibility of over 1 cm of precipitation that could cause a slight movement of the soil and throat on the road.
This is the first rainfall in the area.
A number of distributed thermal baths will begin to approach Arizona late on Sunday and early Monday, before precipitation spreads across larger areas late on Monday and Tuesday.
A significant result will spread across four counties on Tuesday and will last until Wednesday.
We can expect major changes in temperature in October all over the United States as the Arctic is cooling, but the temperature remains rather warm.
Sometimes this can cause large heat waves over short distances.
See a very good example of a great temperature difference in the US mid-Americas on Sunday.
There is almost 7 degree temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the coming days, the surviving summers will try to build up and disperse themselves again.
It is expected that much of the central and eastern parts of the United States will have a warm start to October at temperatures of around 25 degrees or more from the plains in the south all the way to the North-East.
Temperatures could go up to 25 degrees in New York City on Tuesday, which is about 6 degrees higher than the average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates that there is a high probability of temperatures above average for the eastern United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people have been interviewed by Brett Kavanaugh
Over 20 million people watched the exciting testimony of Brett Kavanaugh, nominated Supreme Court Justice, on Tuesday and the testimony of Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual misconduct that was supposed to have taken place in the nineties. The testimony was broadcast on six different channels.
At the same time, the political stalemate continued, and television stations paused on a regular schedule to publish the latest news on Friday: Jeff Flake, Arizona's senior senator, put forward a bill to allow the FBI to investigate the allegations for one week.
Ford told the court that she was confident that Kavanaugh had drunk her and tried to undress her in a school party.
Kavanaugh said in emotional testimony that he was confident that it had not happened.
It is likely that more people have watched the trial than the 20.4 million Nielsen said had watched on Friday.
The company measured average views on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Numbers were not available immediately for other TV channels that showed the interrogations, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Also, Nielsen usually has trouble measuring people’s views in offices.
To put this into context, this audience is similar to the size and for the finals of football or the Oscars.
According to Nielsen, most people watched the interrogations, which took place all day, on the Fox News Channel or 5.69 million. The opinions of that channel have supported Kavanaugh’s nomination firmly.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
There was a lot of interest after the trial.
Flake was the centerpiece of the hit game on Friday.
After the office of this MP of the Republican Party issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh in favor, CNN and CBS took pictures of him as protesters approached him on Friday morning, when he tried to go into an elevator to get to a meeting of the judicial committee.
He stood down for a few minutes while a short rain rained on him in a live broadcast at CNN.
One woman said, "I'm standing right here in front of you."
“Do you think he’s telling the truth?”
People said to him, “You have power while so many women are powerless.”
Flake said his office had issued a statement, and before the elevator door closed, he said he would comment further at the committee meeting.
The cable and television stations were all broadcast live at a later date when the Judiciary Committee decided whether Kavanaugh should continue to be nominated for election by the Department of the Elderly.
Flake said he would only do so if the FBI investigated the allegations against the nominees next week, but a minority of Democrats have urged it.
Flake was partially convinced after talks with his friend, Chris Coons, the Senate of the Democratic Party.
Flake made his decision after a conversation with Coons and several other members of parliament after that.
Flake’s vote was crucial because it was clear that the Republicans did not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has given permission for FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh.
May, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, accuses critics of “being in a political game” because of Brexit
In an interview with The Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union of “being in a political game” about the future of Britain and burying it away from the interests of the country.
Theresa May, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, will attend the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, which was published alongside her interview on the front page of the paper, Boris Johnson, her former foreign minister, gave the so-called Chequers plan on Brexit, saying that the proposal that Britain and the European Union should impose tariffs on each other would be “totally derailed.”
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest Dyteon Simpsons in connection with LSU player's death
Police have arrested one suspect for the death of Wayde Sims in a fatal shooting. He was a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Twenty-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and imprisoned on charges of second-degree murder, according to Baton Rouge police.
The authorities posted a video of the clash between Sims and Simpson and said Sims had lost their glasses in the attacks.
Police found the glasses on the scene and said they found genetic material from Simpson on them, according to WAFB, sister company CBS.
Police say Simpson has confessed to interrogating Wayde and killing him.
According to his lawyer, there was a security deposit of $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge District Justice Office issued an interim report on Friday saying that the cause of death is gunshot to the head and to the neck.
The authorities wanted to thank a special police force in Louisiana, a police criminal investigation agency, the police at Southern University University, and citizens in the area for the help of the investigation that led to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, chairman of LSU’s sports club, thanked the police for “their generosity and their search for justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
The tall two-metre forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He scored 5.6 points on average and took 2.6 away for each game in the last season.
Will Wade, basketball coach LSU, said on Friday morning that the team was “harmed” and “in shock” because of Wayde’s death.
“It’s something you’re always worried about,” Wade said.
Mountain spewing ashes over Mexico City
Ashes from the volcano Popocatepetl have reached the southern part of the capital of Mexico.
The U.S. Center for Disaster Prevention advised Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity increased in the gig and recorded 183 cases of gas and ash emissions over a 24-hour period.
The center was monitored by vibration and earthquakes from the volcano.
Images on social media showed a thin layer of ash on car windows in the neighborhood of Mexico City, such as in Xochimilco.
Earth scientists have noticed increased activity in the volcano, which is 72 kilometers southeast of the capital, from the earthquake to 7.1 on Richter in mid-Mexico in September 2017.
The mountain, known as “Don Goyo”, has been active since 1994.
Police in clashes with Catalan separatists just before the birthday of independence referendum
Six were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independent protesters took part in riot police and thousands took part in protests on the occasion of the first anniversary of the Catalan referendum to declare independence.
A group of masked separatists rocked the eggless police and threw a powder paint that formed dark dust clouds on the streets, which were usually otherwise full of tourists.
Conflicts also erupted later in the day, and police used colds to keep storms in check.
The groups of the separatists shouted, “We don’t forget and don’t forgive” for a few hours while their opponents shouted, “Long live Spain.”
Fourteen people were in need of reassurance due to minor injuries, which they suffered in the protests, according to local media.
Much tension continues in the independent region one year after the October 1 referendum was judged illegal by the authorities of Madrid, but was welcomed by the Catalan secessionists.
The majority of voters chose independence but participation was poor as most of those opposed to separation ignored the elections.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were killed last year when police tried to stop the elections at polling stations across the area, but it was a conflict.
Groups of independents had stayed out overnight on Friday to prevent protests in support of the country’s police.
The protest took place but was forced to go another way.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician, took part in protests by the separatists with his wife and said he was no longer hopeful that Catalonia would gain independence.
“Last year, we had one of the best moments of our lives.
I saw my parents crying with joy for being able to choose, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Despite having achieved the necessary but narrow victory in regional elections last December, Catalonia’s independence groups have had a hard time holding steam this year, as many of the best-known leaders are either in voluntary exile or in detention pending trial for their role in the organisation of the referendum.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanical engineer who took the protest in support of the police on his phone, said politicians both sides had urged the dispute.
“The tension is constantly increasing,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in prison and have been waiting for trial since late last year, announced that he would present himself to the European Parliament next year.
“My offer in the European elections is the best way to condemn the backwardness of democratic values and the oppression that we have seen the Spanish government exert,” he said.
Londonderry: People arrested after a car was driven into a house
Three men, 33, 34 and 39 years old, have been arrested after driving back to Londonderry.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 7.30 p.m. in British time.
Bob Blemmings, a research representative, said the gates and the building itself would have been damaged.
It is also possible that the gun was shot from a crossbow towards the vehicle.
Menga scores 1-0 victory Livingston against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal won Livingston
The team Livingston, who came from the lower division, came to the Rangers in an open shield and Steven Gerrard had to endure his second loss in 18 games as the team's manager Ibrox.
Mark Dolly Menga made the gift and Gary Holt's team is now in second place with Hibernian.
The team Gerrard has not yet won in the field in the top division of this season and plays against Hearts, who are eight points ahead in the top position, next Sunday.
For this game, the Rangers will face Rapid Vienna in the European Team on Thursday.
At the same time, Livingston is still undefeated in the division with six wins, and Holt's head coach has not yet had to experience a loss since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston loses opportunities against bitless guests
The team of Holts should have been over long before it scored a goal, but their leg injury caused Rangers a lot of trouble.
Scott Robinson managed to break through but hesitated in his attempt to score, and Alan Lithgow then passed by after running through the defense to receive a shell transmission from Graig Halkett across the field.
The hosts allowed the Rangers to play in front of them in tranquillity, knowing that they could cause guests trouble in the right places.
And that’s how the important goal was scored.
The Rangers took on the lead and Livingston worked to create a market opportunity. Declan Gallagher and Robinson helped Menga in a union, which accepted the shipment and scored from the middle of the grid.
At that stage, the Rangers had prevailed over the ball but the defense of the locals was unbreakable and Liam Kelly, the goalkeeper did not have to put much on his shoulders.
This continued into the second half, though Alfredo Morelos managed to defend from Kelly.
Scott Pitman was stopped by Allan McGregor, Ranger's goaltender, and Lithgow shot from the finish line after a visit from Livingston.
The questions constantly ran into Livingston's widow but were kicked off, and two demands for the widow - after Halkett's defense against the alternate Glenn Middleton, and one after-hand - were dismissed.
Livingston's "Beautiful" Analysis
Alasdair Lamont, BBC Scotland reporter at Tony Macaroni Stadium
Great performance and result for Livingston.
For a normal man, they stood up wonderfully and continued to move on from all expectations on their way.
Their playing style and team members have hardly changed anything since they returned to the top division, but Holt deserves a lot of praise for putting the team together since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Halkett, the captain was extremely good and led full-fledged defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on his toes all the time.
However, the Rangers lacked inspiration.
As good as they have been under Gerrard's rule, they played well under expectations.
They went badly to complete their quests and managed only once to open the vallar half of the locals so this should be a wake-up call for Rangers now sitting in the middle of the division.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an receives mixed receptions in Cologne
It was a smile and a bright sky on Saturday (29 September), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met over breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an’s controversial visit to Germany with the aim of improving relations between the two nations.
There have been disagreements between them on issues such as human rights, media freedom and Turkey's entry into the European Union.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a new, giant mosque.
The city is home to most of the Turkish population outside of Turkey itself.
The police used security reasons to prevent 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but the number of supporters in its vicinity could see its president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan - many of them Kurds - also heard and condemned both Erdogan's policies and the decision of German authorities to invite him to the country.
The two opposing groups reflect how controversial this guest is, but he is hailed as a hero by some Turks in Germany and hated as a dictator by others.
Deptford accident: cyclist killed in car crash
The driver died in a car accident in London.
The incident occurred near the Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a multi-storey street in Deptford, in the southeastern part of the city, at about 10:15 a.m. to British local time.
The driver of the car stopped, and the ambulances gave a reassurance, but the man died at the scene of the accident.
The accident occurred a few months after another cyclist died in a collision where a driver drove off Childers Street, 1.5 km from Saturday’s accident site.
The police said she was working to identify the man and let his closest relatives know.
The road has been closed and the buses have been diverted and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six people injured in riots
Six prisoners were injured when unarmed men were released into prison for men, according to a report from the prison agency.
The riots broke out in the Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire at 9.30 a.m. to British local time on Sunday and were still raging.
“Tornado” guards have been called to the area to try to restrain the riots, which eight prisoners are facing, and are confined to only one aluminum prison.
The prizes were awarded for minor injury to the face at the scene.
A spokesman for the prison department said: “Specially trained prison guards have been called to deal with cases that are pending in the Long Lartin prison.
Six people have been injured due to injury.
There is no violence in our prisons, and we make it clear that the responsibilities will be handed over to the police and could expect to spend even more time behind bars and bars."
More than 500 prisoners are in Long Lartin prison, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison chief had had to go to the hospital after the prisoner attacked him.
And last October, unarmed police were called to the place to deal with a serious disturbance of peace, where staff with billiard bullets were attacked.
Rose Fields threaten Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with rapid floods (dryer area could benefit from)
It is rare for a temperature to cross Arizona, but it is likely that it will be early next week when the remnants of the R<0xC3><0xB3>su volcano cross the southwest, at the risk of rapid flooding.
The country’s weather agency has already issued warnings for rapid flooding before Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona and southern and western Nevada, southeast California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
R<0xC3><0xB3>sa is expected to travel directly across Phoenix on Tuesday and arrive late on Monday with results.
The Phoenix weather agency said on Twitter that only “twenty hurricanes have managed to maintain strength to be classified as temperature storms or lows less than 320 km away from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a volcano within 64 km of the Arizona border.
Latest predictions from the country's hurricane center predict 5-10 cm precipitation, with a single precipitation of up to 15 cm in the Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
The result is likely to be 2.5 to 5 cm in other areas of the southwest, including the central part of the Rock Mountains and the Great Basin (The Great Basin), with a potential for individual results up to 10 cm.
For those who are not at risk of falling into rapid floods, the outcome from Rosu could be a blessing because there are great droughts in the area.
Although floods can cause a lot of damage, some of these results will have a positive effect, since drought is now in the southwest.
According to the U.S. dry-cleaning agency, at least 40% of Arizona is dry, which is the second-highest category," according to news from weather.com.
First, R<0xC3><0xB3>sa will land on the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa was still classified as a hurricane on Sunday morning with a maximum wind speed of 136 km per hour and is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and travels north at 19 km per hour.
The storm passes over the cooler sea in the Pacific Ocean and its power diminishes.
He is therefore expected to land in Mexico as a tropical storm on Monday or Monday night.
There is a significant risk of flooding in some areas of Mexico.
“It is expected that the precipitation will reach 7.5 to 15 cm in Baja California and into the northwestern part of Sonora, with a potential of up to 25 cm of precipitation,” said a statement from weather.com.
R<0xC3><0xB3>sa will then keep north of Mexico, as a hot-weather storm, and then reach the Arizona border early on Tuesday morning as a hot-weather resort. She will then continue up through Arizona and come to southern Utah late on Tuesday night.
“The greatest danger that is expected to emerge from Rose or her remains is a very high result in Baja California, northwest Sonora and in the southwestern desert area of the United States,” said the country’s paratroopers.
This outcome is expected to cause life-threatening rapids and movement of soil in the deserts, and landslides in the mountains.
The Midsomer Norton attack: Four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested for attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with a knife wound in Somerset.
The juvenile was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton at 4 a.m. on Saturday.
He was transported to a hospital where his condition is said to be “stable”.
One 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-old and one 20-year-old man were arrested at night in the Radstock area, according to police from Avon and Somerset.
The police have asked witnesses who could have phone records of what happened.
Trump says Kavanaugh “has been found guilty of evil and anger” by the Democratic Party
“The vote in support of Kavanaugh judges is a vote that rejects the ruthless and outrageous methods of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a meeting with supporters in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh “has felt the malice and anger” of the Democratic Party throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before the parliament on Thursday, citing allegations by Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her a few decades ago when they were both teenagers.
Ford also testified before the committee about his allegations.
The president said on Saturday that “The United States had seen the generosity and humanity and courage of Kavanaugh the other day.
“The vote to confirm Kavanaugh’s verdict is a vote that confirms one of our smartest lawyers of our time, a lawyer with an impressive career record as an official,” he told a group of his supporters in West Virginia.
The president referred directly to Kavanaugh’s nomination when he spoke of the importance of the involvement of supporters of the Republicans in the midterm elections.
“There are five weeks in one of the most important elections in our lives.
I’m not going to do it, but I’m going to do it,” he said.
“That’s why I’m going through a wide field to fight for great candidates.”
Trump argued that Democrats were working to “step and stop.”
The first key vote on Kavanaugh’s nomination will not take place later than Friday, according to a representative of the Republican leadership in an interview with CNN.
Hundreds of people died after earthquakes and floods in Indonesia, and it is likely that the number of dead will increase
At least 384 people died and many were washed away, a huge century of shelling on the shores, when large earthquakes and floods swept across the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, according to the authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday, when up to six meters of high age shelled the beach at sunset, washed out a crowd of people at sea, and destroyed everything that happened to them.
The flood was caused by a 7.5-point earthquake on Richter.
“When the flood surge occurred yesterday, people were still on the beach and didn’t escape immediately, so it killed,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia’s disaster agency, at an information meeting in Jakarta.
“The flood wave didn’t come alone, it dragged cars, a tree trunk, a house, it was going to everything on land,” Nugroho said, adding that the flood wave had traveled across the open sea at 800 kilometers before it was going to the beach.
Some climbed into a tree to escape the flood wave and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were transferred to 24 centres in Palu.
Photographs from the air, which the disaster agency published, showed many destroyed buildings and shops, twists and turns and unused bridges and mosques surrounded by water.
The aftershocks continued to ride across the beach town on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes took place in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia’s Institute of Food and Technology, said in a statement that the hurricane, which emanated from a lesion in the large quake on Friday, would have been about 200 times greater than the atomic bomb that fell on the city of Hiroshima in World War II.
The geographical location of the city, which lies at the end of long and meagre floods, may have increased the size of the flood wave, the agency said.
Nugroho said the damage was “significant” and that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
The body of a few victims was found trapped under a rampage of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people had been injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the casualties and property damage could be greater along the shoreline 300 km north of Palu in an area called Donggala that is close to the source of the earthquake.
Communication “is completely down and no information is received” from Donggala, Nugroho said.
“More than 300,000 people live there,” the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that their staff and volunteers were on their way to the respective areas.
“It’s already been a tragedy, but could be much worse,” said the Red Cross.
The agency was criticized by many on Saturday for not letting people know that floods had washed up on Palu, although official representatives said that the centuries had come within the time the warning was issued.
In a video posted on social media, a person could hear shouting from the upper floor of buildings to warn the people on the street below that flood waves were approaching.
Only minutes later, the wave of floods on the beach shakes and carries away buildings and cars.
Reuters could not confirm the video immediately.
The earthquake and floodwaves caused an electrical outage that prevented communications across Palu and made it difficult for the authorities to plan relief efforts.
The military has begun to ship planes with relief goods from Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, but people who have been helped by the area still desperately need food and other necessities to keep.
The city’s airport has only been reopened for relief operations and will be closed until October.
Joko Widodo, the president, is planning to visit refugee centers in Palu on Sunday.
The number of deaths exceeds 800 after a flood in Indonesia.
The situation is very bad.
The World Vision staff from Donggala have reached the city of Palu, where it searches for shelter in tents that were installed in the garden outside their offices. Destruction blasted them along the way, according to Mr. Doseba.
“People said they’ve seen a lot of houses,” he said.
The situation is very bad.
Aid teams have begun difficult relief efforts, but some have complained that foreign aid workers with a high level of expertise would be hampered from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, foreign funding, stocks and staff can only begin to arrive if the accident area is declared a disaster zone.
It hasn't been done yet.
“This is still a local accident area,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
Once the government has declared that this is a disaster zone, we can open for foreign aid, but no statement has yet been made."
When the second night fell over Palu after the earthquake and the flood on Friday, friends and their families still missing kept hoping that their loved ones would become one of the miracle stories that sparked hope for the devastating headlines that followed natural disasters.
On Saturday, a small boy was rescued from the scene.
On Sunday, relief workers rescued a woman who had been trapped under rubble for two days with her mother’s body beside her.
Gendon Subandano, the trainer of the Indonesian glider team, had been the coach of two currently missing gliders for the Asian Games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others who locked in the Roa Roa hotel were his students, including Mr. Monday.
“As a man with a long experience in flight, I have my own emotional burden to carry,” he said.
Mr. Gendon said that the hour after the news came within the flyby group because the Roa Roa hotel had crashed, he had sent WhatsApp a message in despair to the contestants who stayed in Palu and participated in the beach festival.
His message, however, showed only a gray signal, instead of a blue one.
“I think it means that the message was not received,” he said.
Thieves steal 26,750 dollars in replenishment at a fast bank in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves robbed 26,750 dollars from employee Brink, who was filling a fast-bank in Newport on the Levee, according to a news release from the police in Newport.
The driver of the car had been emptying the ATM in the entertainment area and was filling in more money on him, said Dennis McCarthy, a police officer, in the announcement.
While he was at work, another man came “running behind the Brink employee” and stole a money bag intended for delivery.
Witnesses saw many suspected escapes from the scene, according to the report, but police did not disclose how many were involved in the case.
Those who may have information about those suspects are requested to contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The Rapper Turns His Name Into Ye
The rapper Kanye West is going to change his name - in Ye.
He announced the change on Twitter on Saturday and wrote: “The world that used to be known as Kanye West.”
West, 41, has been called Ye for some time and used the name as the title on his eighth album that came out in June.
The change comes before his participation in Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to announce his new album, Yandhi.
He replaces Ariona Grandi in the show, but she quit for “sensible reasons,” the producer said.
West has previously said that this name has religious significance for him, but it is also a endorsement of his current name.
“I think “ye” is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means “you,” West said earlier this year when he spoke the name of his album to the radio host Big Boy.
“So that I am you, I am we, that is us.
It went from Kanye, which means the one, and over to just Ye - to be just a reflection of the good in us, the bad, the confused, everything.
“The album is a reflection of who we are.”
He is one of many famous rappers who have changed his name.
Sean Combs has been called Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he would rather be called Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, former partner of West, has also written his name both with and without the band's strings and capitals.
Mexican President-elect Says He Won't Use the Army Against the Public
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the elected president of Mexico, has vowed never to use military force against ordinary citizens, now silent the country will soon commemorate the 50th anniversary of bloody revenge students.
On Saturday at Tlatelolco Square, Lopez Obrador promised to “never use the army to oppress the Mexican people.”
Soldiers shot at a peaceful protest walk in the square on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people at a time when student left-wing movements were shooting roots across all of Roman America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to help young people in Mexico by giving all students monthly grants and opening more free public universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of learning opportunities attracted young people to criminals.
The U.S. should double its funding for artificial intelligence
Now that China is increasingly active in the use of artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount of money it spends in research in that field, says inventor and artificial intelligence user Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments were said to have been made after different departments of the U.S. government issued notifications of artificial intelligence, even though the U.S. does not have a formal overall artificial intelligence plan.
China, on the other hand, announced its plan last year: it aims to be the first in innovation with artificial intelligence by 2030.
“It would be a good start to double the amount of money spent in artificial intelligence research, given that all other countries are so much further behind the United States, and we’re waiting to see the next big discovery in the field of artificial intelligence,” Lee said.
The doubling of funds could double the likelihood that the next major discovery in artificial intelligence will be made in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, author of the book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” published this month by publisher Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of the company Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in Face++, one of the major artificial intelligence companies in China.
He worked on artificial intelligence systems in the 1990s at Carnegie Mellon University, which won the best U.S. player in Othello, and later became CEO of Microsoft Research and President of the Chinese Department of Google.
Lee talked about previous technical competitions, held by the U.S. authorities, such as the Defense Department's robotics competition, and asked when the next competition would be held, to spot the next entrepreneurs.
“Scientists in the United States often need to put a lot of effort into getting a boost from the government,” Lee said.
“It’s not China that likes its main idea, it’s the companies,” Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired geniuses from universities to work with artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee said changes to immigration policy could also help the U.S. strengthen its artificial intelligence research.
“I think those who have a PhD in artificial intelligence should get a residence permit automatically,” he said.
China's Parliament released its future satellite in July 2017.
The China Institute of Natural Sciences provides funding to people working at university institutions, similar to the National Science Foundation and similar public institutions do in the United States, but the quality of scientific work is worse in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense set up an artificial intelligence center, which is designed to collaborate with both industry and educational institutions, and the White House announced the formation of a special committee on artificial intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced that it had invested $2 billion in a project called AI Next.
As far as NSF is concerned, it invests over 100 million dollars annually in research on artificial intelligence.
At the same time, U.S. legislation, which was designed to create a safety council for artificial intelligence, has not progressed for months.
Macedonian citizens vote in a referendum on whether to change the name of the country
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday to see whether the country's name should be changed to "North Macedonia" in an attempt to resolve decades of dispute with Greece, which has closed its application for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a region called Macedonia and therefore claims that its neighbours in the north equivalent requirement in their territory and therefore deny them entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change will undermine the self-image of the majority of Macedonians of Slavic origin.
Gjorge Ivanov, president, has said he will not participate in the vote and campaign to ignore it has raised doubts that participation reaches the 50 percent minimum needed so that the vote payment is considered valid.
The question of the ballot is: “Do you want to go to NATO and the EU by agreeing to the agreement with Greece?”
Supporters of the name change, including Zoran Zaev, Prime Minister, say that this is a fair fee for Macedonia to join EU and NATO, but the country is one of those formed after the fall of Yugoslavia.
“I came today to vote for the future of the country for the young people of Macedonia so that it can live freely under the protection of the European Union because it means safer lives for all of us,” said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the result is not legally binding, enough senators have said they will follow it and tie it into law.
The name change would require the approval of two-thirds of the parliament.
The committee said nothing unusual had been reported at 1 a.m.
However, the participation was only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of registered voters voted.
“I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital of Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko voted in the national referendum in Macedonia on whether to change the name of the country, which would pave the way into NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, aged 54, worked to prepare a small field and set up chairs in front of tents that had been erected by those who will ignore the vote.
“We are delighted with NATO and the EU, but we want to become members with a head high, not go through the service door,” Kavardarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we are living in dignity.
If they don’t want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to China or Russia and become part of the Eurasian Union.”
Zaev, the Prime Minister, said that NATO’s membership will bring the necessary funding to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is over 20 percent.
“I think the vast majority will agree that more than 80 percent of the country’s population is supported by the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after paying his vote.
He said the agreement would be “confirmation of our future.”
A survey published on Monday from the Macedonian political research institute showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum, which is lower than the minimum required.
Another survey from Telma TV showed that 57 percent of respondents wanted to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said yes.
In order for the national vote to be considered valid, the meeting must be 50 percent plus one vote.
If the vote is not approved, it could mean the first serious attack on the government’s policy, which has been fostered by the West, since its adoption in May last year.
See: Sergio Aguero, Manchester City player, goes through all defenses of Brighton and scores
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling easily defended Brighton in the Manchester City 2-0 victory on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy when he scored his mark in the 65th minute.
The Argentine forward received a dispatch in the middle of the field at the start of the search.
He pushed through three defenders of Brighton and then went out to the open field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green-dressed defenders.
He came across one defender and then ran ahead of a few in addition right next to the vietnamese Brighton.
Then he sent to the left and found Sterling there.
The English forward used the first touch within the penalty to send the ball back to Aguero, who used his right foot to play Mathew Ryan, goalkeeper Brighton, with a shot at the right side of the goal.
“Aguero has some footing issues,” Pep Guardiola, City’s chief executive, told reporters.
“We talked about him playing 55, 60 minutes.
Then it happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at the moment.”
But it was Sterling who gave them the blue first goal in the Premier League game.
The mark came in the 29th minute.
Aguero was sent on a long way inside the whale helmet of Brighton in that quest.
He sent a long ball to Leroy Sane.
Sane kicked the ball several times and then sent Sterling to the pole.
City sent the ball to the net just before it ran out.
City play against Hoffenheim in the Champions League at 12:55 a.m. on Tuesday at the Rhein-Necker Stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play a penalty game against Rockies
Since the Nationals team has been excluded from playing in the finals, there was not much reason to force another start.
But the competitive Scherzer hopes to get to throw on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies still have the chance to make it to the final, but they have one game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the West Division.
Rockies won at least a "wildcard" seat with their 5-2 win at the Nationals on Friday night, but the team is still trying to win their first league title.
“Even if we play for free, we can at least play for the electric atmosphere in Denver as well as the other team definitely after playing their best game this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to compete in such a situation?”
The Nationals are still going to announce who will be the first pitcher in Sunday’s game, but they are believed to have Scherzer cast in these circumstances.
Scherzer, who was starting a game for the 34th time, took a practice race on Thursday and would throw on Sunday, which is his usual rest day.
This right-hand pitcher at Washington is 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 winds in 220 2/3 races at this season.
Trump visits West Virginia
The president referred directly to the case around Kavanaugh, a designated Supreme Court judge when he spoke of the importance of the involvement of supporters of the Republican apparatus in the midterm elections.
“Everything is in place in November.
There are five weeks in one of the most important elections of our lives.
These are just one of the big, big...I don’t offer myself up, but I do, so I’m going through a wide range to fight for great candidates,” he said.
Trump continued, saying: “You see this terrible, radical group of democrats, you can see it happening now.
And they are determined to regain power with whatever methods are needed, you see the cruel, evil.
They don’t care who they hurt, who they need to go to get power and control, they just want to get power and control, we don’t give it to them.
He said Democrats were working to “toughen and prevent.”
"And it has been seen in the last four days," he said, "and the Democrats are "ready and evil and cruel and untruthful."
He named the Senate Senator Dianne Feinstein, a leading Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, in his name, and was answered with a loud bauble from the audience.
“Do you remember her answer?”
Was it you who painted the document?
Oh, what?
No, look no. I waited for one... it was really a bad physical appearance, the worst I've ever seen."
The working class is no longer a church.
He does not tolerate those who express their thoughts.
When the action scenes Momentum in my party kissed to give me a call, it was hardly surprising.
After all, I am the last of many members of the Labour Party who have been told that we are not welcome, just to express our thoughts.
Joan Ryan, my fellow senator received similar treatment because she harshly objected to prejudices against Jews.
In my case, the proposal to give me a recommendation was made because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
The issues were the importance of having a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically similar issues and Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The announcement of the meeting for Nottingham East on Friday said that “we want the meetings to understand nothing outside and be effective.”
In my eight-year career as a member of the Labour Party, Friday meetings have often been just that.
Unfortunately, it is not the tone of many meetings today and the promise of “milder and better” politics has been forgotten, if it ever began.
It has become increasingly clear that different opinions have not been reached in the Labour Party and that all opinions are judged on whether the leaders of the party consider them acceptable.
This started shortly after Jeremy became a leader, when colleagues, whom I previously thought to have similar political views as I did, began to expect me to have a complete reversal and suggested views that I had never agreed with before, whether it was about national security or a common EU market area.
Every time I speak publicly – and then little matters what I say – it follows the insidiousness of social media that is called after my departure, central government denied and told me that I should not be in the Workers’ Party.
This is not just my experience.
I know I’m happier than some of my colleagues, as most of the comments I get are mostly political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of those who need to endure the squalor of sexual or prejudiced mutilators daily but never respond.
One of the main disappointments of this political period is how attacks and insults have become a normal part of everyday life.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should be part of a more inclusive culture.
The reality is that we are no longer a controlled church, and with each non-trust proposal or change of electoral rules, the category becomes increasingly narrow.
I’ve had many recommendations over the last two years to make sure I don’t have too much, and that would be “all right” with me.
I didn’t want to participate in politics to do that.
Since I became a member of the Workers’ Party as a student 32 years ago, encouraged by the neglect of the government of Thatcher who left my schoolroom in discontent, I have fought for better public service for those who need it most, whether I was in town or in parliament.
I have never given up my political views, not even at the last election.
No one in Nottingham East can be in any doubt about my policy views and where I disagree with current leaders.
To those who supported the proposal on Friday, I just want to say that when the country is heading for Brexit, which will harm homes, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to spend time and energy in my loyalty to the leaders of the Labour Party.
But my only message, which I want to send from me, is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to those who are within my drive, whether they are members of the Working Party or not: I serve you with pride and I promise that no threats of deviation or political expulsion will keep me from doing what I think is best for you all.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Undefeated team Ayr goes to the top
Two late touchpoints may have failed the final score somewhat, but there is no doubt that Ayr had the win separated in this fast-paced game of the day in the Tennant's Premiership division.
They are now in the top of the list and the only team out of ten that is still undefeated.
In the end, it was their stronger defense and better use of opportunities that made locals a winner and Peter Murchie coach had the full right to be satisfied.
“We’ve had a tough fight in our games so far and we’re still undefeated, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said: “Ayr on the commendation, they took their chances better than we did,”
Mark Grant Anderson came across Ayr on the 14th minute after Frazier Climo turned on the pitch, but a yellow panel on the Scottish team, which was allowed to play the game with the Warriors, allowed Melrose to let the numbers count and Jason Baggot managed to score a touch goal.
Climbo rose to the lead Ayr with a goal before scoring with a kick just before half and then a touch point and came Ayr over 17-5 in half.
But Melrose started the second half of the force and the touch mark Patrick Anderson, after Baggot turned on the pitch, reduced the score to five points.
It took a long time to recover from serious injuries to Ruaridh Knott, who had to carry a playground, and after that Ayr continued to lead with a touch point from Stafford McDowall, after Climo turned on the pitch.
Blair Macpherson, head of Ayr, then got the yellow panel, and Melrose again used to be a man with a touch of Bruce Colvine, at the end of a tough quest.
However, locals came back strong, and when Struan Hutchinson got the yellow panel for hitting Climo without the ball, MacPherson scored a touchpoint for the behind Ayr pursuit, after the extra kick.
Climbo turned the pitch, as he did again immediately after the rematch, after Kyle Rowe fired David Amrstrong from the sidewalk and sent to Gregor Henry, who scored the fifth touch of the team.
Star Still Game episodes ready for new career in the restaurant industry
Ford Kieran, the star of the Still Game series, appears ready to move into a restaurant business after it emerged that he was hired as the manager of a restaurant company.
Kieran, aged 56, plays Jack Jarvis on the BBC episodes popular, in which he writes and plays along with his old partner from the entertainment industry, Creg Hemphill.
The twins have announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last and as it seems Kiernan has plans for life-threatening Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the CEO of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor didn’t want to tell anyone about the news, but Scottish Sun author Kiernan wanted to be a participant in the “living restaurant lobby” of Glasgow City.
“The sea is ours”: The beachless country of Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen its way to the Pacific Ocean
The sails are guarding the naval headquarters in La Paz.
General buildings flag blue flag.
Flotating stations from Titicaca water to the Amazon River are marked by the slogan: “We have the right to the sea.
It is our duty to restore it.”
On the other hand, all of Bolivia's landlocked memories of the coastline, which was lost to Chile in bloody battles in the 19th century, are still in fresh memory - along with the desire to sail across the Pacific again.
These hopes are perhaps the strongest for decades, now that Bolivia awaits rulings from the International Court of Justice in The Hague on 1 October after five years of legal proceedings.
“Bolivia has the power, the spirit of unity and the orphanage, and, of course, is waiting for the verdict with a positive mind,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many people in Bolivia will be watching the International Court of Justice’s ruling on large screens across the country, hoping that the court in The Hague will judge Bolivia in favor of their claim that Chile is obliged to grant Bolivia access to the sea, after decades of difficult talks.
The ruling on Monday is also very important for Evo Morales, the president of the country of Indian descent, who will have a controversial fight for re-election next year.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he promised in late August.
But some analysts consider it unlikely that the court ruled Bolivia in favor, and that it would little change if he did.
The court, which has its headquarters in the Netherlands, has no authority to grant land from Chile and has provided that the ruling will not affect the outcome of the possible negotiations.
The fact that the court’s ruling comes just six months after the hearing of the final debates indicates that the matter “had not been complicated,” said Paz S<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean expert in international law.
It is also possible that the last four years have not been the case for Bolivia to advance, but have caused the country to retreat.
“The current government of Bolivia has stolen the issue of access to the sea,” Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
Morale’s speech has drawn from all the favors of Sile, she said.
Bolivia and Chile will hold talks sometime, but it will be very difficult after this.
The two countries have not changed their ambassadors since 1962.
Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, former President of Bolivia and representative of the country in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision had taken an unusually short time.
On Monday, Bolivia will gain “a unique opportunity to open up a new relationship with Chile” and “a chance to end a dispute that spans 139 years back in time, both countries for the benefit,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of the most popular presidents in Roman America, was using this issue as a political raise.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific,” he added.
“The ruling is an opportunity to see that we need to balance ourselves in the past.”
North Korea says there will be no nuclear weapons unless it can rely on the United States
Ri Yong Ho, North Korea’s foreign minister, said the country will never take down its nuclear weapons unless it can rely on Washington.
Ri delivered his speech on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to follow the promises they made at a meeting in Singapore between the leaders of the nations.
Mike Pompeo, U.S. Secretary of State, appears to be starting talks about nuclear weapons again, more than three months after the meeting in Singapore with Kim Jong Un, leader of North Korea.
Ri says it’s “dreamers” to hold that continued trade ties and U.S. opposition to a declaration of the end of the Korean War will ever crush North Korea.
Washington does not want to accept the statement unless Pyongyang first intervenes in a more transparent way to take down its nuclear weapons.
Both Kim and Donald Trump, President of the United States, want to meet again at another meeting.
However, there is considerable doubt that Pyongyang is serious about taking down weapons that the country is likely to see as the only way to ensure its safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the next meeting between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris introduce the latest line of big headwear that will come in fashion stores near you
If you want to expand your hat collection or be completely hidden from the sun, you don’t need to look any further.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne showed a variety of creepy hats in excess of their SS19 line in the fashion field that delighted the crowd during the fashion week in Paris.
The number of images of extremely casual hats has been published on Instagram this summer and these designers have had their innovative creations on display at fashion shows.
The main work of Valentino was a large light brown hat with wide straps that resembled the feathers and hidden heads of the models.
Of other oversized accessories, watermelons were able to see gems, cedar hats and even pineapples, but these items are not designed to keep the heat on the head.
Thom Browne also introduced a variety of strange masks, just at the right time for the antics.
Many of the colorful masks had assembled items and were more similar to Hannibal Lecter than to Haitian ones.
One grim resembles a diving device with a breathing pipe and glasses, while the other resembles a melting ice cream in a bread form.
If you want to count in the fashion, the luck is with you.
Fashion experts predict that the big hats might soon come on sale in fashion stores near you.
Big hats bring a dose to the heels of “La Bomba”, a boy’s hat with over 60cm tall straps that has adorned the head from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The fashion mark behind the extremely casual hat, which was seen on all social media, was inspired by another large accessory that appeared in the fashion scene – a neck beach bag that was almost the same size as the swimsuit-lined model that carried it.
The orange boy's bag, with a striped and white leather handle, was the main item in La Riviera SS10's Jacquemus fashion week in Paris.
Luke Armitage, the stylist of the famous people, said in an interview with FEMAIL: “I expect to see big hats and beach bags appearing in fashion stores for the next summer – as the designer has caused so much impact, it should be difficult to ignore the demand for accessories in excess.”
John Edward: Language skills are necessary for a citizen of the world
The private schools in Scotland are known for the outstanding performance of their students and it has continued in the year 2018 with new, elegant test results, which are still supported by individual and group achievements in sports, art, music and other social settings.
These schools have up to 30,000 students across Scotland, with The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) in defense of them, and they strive to provide their students and their parents with the best possible service.
Private schools aim to prepare their students for further continuing education, the career they have chosen and their position as a world citizen.
As a teaching sector that can assemble and teach customized curriculums, we see that innovation continues to be a popular subject of study in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, it touches his mind.
If you speak to him in his native language, it touches his heart.”
This is an important reminder that we can’t just rely on English to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
This year’s test results show us that languages are at the top of the lists with the highest percentage of students who complete private school exams.
68 percent of students who learned foreign languages received the grade A.
The data, collected from 74 schools within SCIS, showed that 72 percent of students received grade A in mandarin, while 72 percent of those who learned German, 69 percent of those who learned French, and 63 percent of those who learned Spanish also received grade A.
This shows that private schools in Scotland support foreign languages as the necessary skills that children and young people will certainly need to hold in the future.
At the moment, languages, such as electives, are placed in the same place as science-related subjects (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) in private school curricula and elsewhere.
A survey conducted in 2014 by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills found that for the reasons employers gave up the difficulty of hiring, 17 percent were due to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly important to prepare young people for their future jobs.
Now that more and more jobs require proficiency in languages, this skill is essential in the global world.
No matter what career people choose, it will have a real advantage in the future if it learns another language, but it is a skill that lasts a lifetime.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically give a multi-talented person an advantage over the competitors.
According to a poll conducted by YouGov in over 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent of them were unable to speak another language well enough to hold up talks, and French was the only language spoken by two-digit percentages, or 15 percent.
Therefore, it is important for children of today to invest immediately in language education.
Multilingualism, especially in emerging markets, will give children a better chance of finding a meaningful job.
In Scotland, there are differences between schools in which language they teach.
The chosen number of schools will focus on more classics, while others will teach languages that are considered to be most important for the UK when looking forward to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter where your child’s interest lies, it will always be able to choose from private schools with specialized teachers.
Scottish private schools are committed to offering a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future holds.
It cannot be denied that at this time, in a global business environment, languages continue to be necessary for the future of the country, and it must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern language should really be regarded as “international skills in communication.”
Private schools will continue to offer choices, diversity and superiority for Scotland’s youth.
I'll faut bien le faire.
John Edwards is the Chairman of the Scottish Private School Council
LeBron plays its first game for Lakers in San Diego on Sunday
The wait is soon over for fans who want to see LeBron James play his first game for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Luke Walton, coach of the Lakers, has announced that James will play on Sunday in the opening season against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
It has not yet been determined how many minutes he will play.
“It’ll be longer than a minute and shorter than 48,” Walton said on the official website of the Lakers.
Mike Trudell, a reporter for the Lakers, said on Twitter that James would probably play for a limited time.
After training earlier this week, James was asked out in his plans for six game schedule Lakers before the start of the season.
“In this period of my career, I don’t have to play games for the season to prepare me,” he said.
Timeline for Trump election in West Virginia and YouTube channel
President Donald Trump will hold a number of election meetings and the first is tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
He is one of five scheduled meetings next week, where he will also stop at friendly places, including in Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that the vote to confirm his election to the new Supreme Court has been put on hold, Trump aims to build up support for the next midterm elections, as Republicans are at risk of losing control of the parliament when votes will be paid in November.
At what time is the Trump election in West Virginia, and how can you watch it online?
Trump’s meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled to begin at 7 p.m. on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch the meeting with Trump in West Virginia online below through direct broadcast on YouTube.
It is likely that Trump will discuss the trial of Brett Kavanaugh, a designated Supreme Court judge, in which tension prevailed over allegations of sexual harassment. The Senate's vote to confirm him as a judge was put on hold for up to a week while the FBI investigates the allegations.
But the main goal of Trump’s meetings is to help the Republicans make a better move, but they are waiting for a tough election in November.
Therefore, the message from Trump’s election campaign was that these five meetings, which will be held next week, aim to “fill in volunteers and supporters of violence that Republicans are trying to protect and increase the majority they have in the Senate and in the Senate,” according to Reuters news agency.
“Government over the parliament is so necessary for the president’s plan that he will travel to as many states as can already start a different campaign period,” a spokesman for the Trump campaign told Reuters.
The meeting will be held at the Wesbanco Stadium in Wheeling, and supporters are expected to come from “Ohio and Pennsylvania, and the media from Pittsburgh are telling him about it,” according to West Virginia Metro News news agency.
The meeting on Saturday will be Trump’s second visit to West Virginia this month, but he won by over 40 percent in this county in 2016.
Trump wants to try to help Patrick Morrissey, the West Virginia Republican candidate for the Senate, but he’s down in the polls.
“It’s not good for Morrissey that the president needs to come and try to increase his popularity,” Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team shows willingness to fight to keep hope alive for the individual race on Sunday
After three one-sided rounds, the fourth game, which was late on Saturday, could be exactly what was needed in this race for the Ryder Cup.
Success swings are sports concepts that have been invented and that players really believe in, and never more than in competitions like this.
Where would they say the success is now?
“They had six levels ahead and now it’s four levels, so the success is on our side now, I guess,” said Jordan Spieth as he started the race of the day.
Europe has, of course, an advantage, four points ahead with twelve additional points in the cap.
The Americans, as Spieth said, believe themselves to have some wind in the sails and they can be disappointed by many, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and who got three points out of four.
Spieth has played a big part in flattening and leading with his example.
The cheers rose as the ring progressed, and he put down an important punch to decipher all four points in the game after he and Thomas had been two points down after two games.
His pout, which secured them victory in the 15th hole game, received a similar cheer, a cry of the kind that tells a man that he believes the American team still does not win.
“You just have to dive deep and think about your own game,” Spieth said.
That’s all these players can do now.
18 holes to earn points.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinaro and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable story of the Ryder Cup.
This strange but thrilling European couple has won four games out of four and can't do anything wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple to get a late-night school on Saturday, but they also managed to avoid school on Saturday mornings, late Fridays, and on the nine-hole field on Friday mornings.
The game and how their energy seems to flow both to and from the loud crowd clearly shows that they are the couple who need to win on Sunday, and there would be no popular player to seal the potential victory of the European team than Fleetwood or Molinari, the sun set over the Le Golf National court.
The best option would be to do both at the same time in different holes.
It is still too early to talk about the victory of the European team.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson went easy with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the fourth game in the morning, where he played with Alex Noren.
A school and two doubles on the first nine holes dug the Spanish and the Pig into a hole from which they never managed to clear themselves.
But on Sunday, no one can help you out of your hole.
The quadruples and quadruples are so exciting to watch in the vicinity because of the communication between the couples, their advice, the advice they don’t give and how the game plan can change in one winter.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has a considerable lead before the end of the day, but these four-game slots also showed that the team of the United States has the fighting spirit that some had doubts that it had, especially other Americans.
Europe with 10-6 lead for the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will have a good lead before the end of the Ryder Cup after the 4th and 4th of Saturday, with a lead of 10-6 against the United States.
Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the attack with two victories over Tiger Woods, who were in trouble, and have scored four points on the Le Golf National field.
European team Thomas Bjorn, who would like to regain the award-winning biker, which it lost on the Hazeltine field two years ago, showed great superiority over the team of the United States in the quarterfinals of the morning and won 3-1.
The U.S. showed more opposition in the four games and won two games but failed to win the score.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points from 12 individual games on Sunday to keep the cup going.
Fleetwood is the first European team to win four points in a row, and he and Molinari, who share the nickname "Molliwood" after a great weekend, are just another pair to win four points from their first four games in the Ryder Cup's history.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the four-ball game, they showed a great team total and won the Woods download and U.S. rookie Bryson Dechambeau 5-4.
Woods, who pulled himself through two games on Saturday, showed his genius uniquely, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 games in four-ball and four-game games and seven consecutive games.
Justin Rose, who was upset for the quarter-finals of the morning, returned to his partner, Henriks Stenson in the quarter-finals and they won 2-1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – who are first and third on the list of the best golfers in the world.
Europe did not, however, go all in on this mild and ghastly day southwest of Paris.
Three-time winners in the big golf competition, Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the goal for Americans with two points on Saturday.
They struggled 2-1 against Jon Rahm from Spain and Ian Poulter in the four-ball games and later came back and defeated Poulter and Rory Mcllroy 4-3 in the four-game after losing the first two holes.
It has only happened twice in the history of the Ryder Cup that a team has won up four points will at the start of the individual race, though the team of Furyks only needed a tie to keep the cup going.
After being the second best for two days, however, a data attack on Sunday seems to overwhelm them.
North Korea says unilateral disarmament “impossible” without confidence
North Korea’s foreign minister said on Saturday that continuing trade ties would only jeopardise their distrust in the United States and it would be impossible for the country to dismantle its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho said at the UN General Assembly that North Korea had taken “important actions to show goodwill” over the past year, for example by stopping nuclear and fire tests, taking down the nuclear test site, and promising to stop the development of nuclear weapons and nuclear weapons.
“However, we have not seen any corresponding responses from the United States,” he said.
“Without confidence in the United States, there is no certainty about our country’s security, and under such circumstances it is impossible for us to take down our nuclear weapons first.”
Although Ri has reiterated familiar North Korean complaints about Washington’s opposition to the “step-by-step” approach to nuclear disarmament, where North Korea would be banned for each step it takes, his statement appeared to be special in that he did not deny a one-sided ban on nuclear weapons.
Ri referred to the joint declarations of Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first meeting between current U.S. Presidents and North Korean leaders, in Singapore on June 12, where Kim said he was working to “nuclear disarmament of Korea” and Trump issued a pledge to ensure the security of North Korea.
North Korea has sought a solution to formally end the Korean War in 1950-53, but the United States has said Pyongyang must leave its nuclear weapons behind first.
Washington has also called for a strict trade ban on North Korea.
“The United States demands that ‘nuclear disarmament takes place first’ and increases pressure by using trade unions to get ahead, and even protesting the declaration to end the war,” Ri said.
“There are only dreamers who don’t know anything about us that business can get us on our knees.
But the problem is that continuing business ties increase our distrust.”
Ri did not mention any plans for another meeting between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader talked about at the U.S. earlier this week.
Instead, the minister spoke about three meetings between Kim and Moon Jae-In, the leader of South Korea over the past five months, adding: “If the party to this nuclear disarmament issue were South Korea instead of the United States, it wouldn’t be these spots on the issue of nuclear disarmament in Korea.”
Despite this, the tone in Ri’s speech was very different from his speech last year when he said at the UN General Assembly that it would be inevitable to target missiles from North Korea to the U.S. mainland after “the devil president” Trump called Kim a “firefighter” in suicide.
Last year, Trump threatened to “destroy” North Korea, but this year he praised Kim for his courage in taking steps towards disarmament, saying that there was still a lot of work to be done and that trade unions would have to continue until North Korea had destroyed all its nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time frame for this and said, “If it takes two years, three years, or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia say that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps it has taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that “the Security Council’s trade agreement must remain in force until a full nuclear disarmament has taken place and it is confirmed.”
The Security Council agreed to increase trade ties with North Korea from 2006 in an attempt to close funding for Pyongyang’s nuclear and fire programs.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare another meeting.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said that success had been achieved, but just a few hours later North Korea condemned him for making “crime claims.”
North Korea promised to meet with Moon this month to take down the area of fire and nuclear power stations if the United States took “consistent action.”
He said Kim had said that the “equivalent actions” he was looking for were security assurances Trump promised in Singapore and actions toward normal relations with Washington.
Students at Harvard take classes at a sufficient rest
A new course at Harvard University has given all students more sleep in an attempt to track against the growing tendency of students to wake up and learn all night long with the help of caffeine tablets.
A study revealed that students at the best universities in the world often know little or nothing when it comes to the basics of thinking about themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and an expert at Brigham and the Women’s Hospital, designed the course and believes it is the first of its kind in the United States.
He got the idea to do the course after having lectured about the impact that sleep deprivation has on learning ability.
“At the end of the lecture, a girl came to me and asked, ‘Why is this being said to me first now, in my final year?’
She said that no one had told her anything about the importance of sleep, which surprised me,” he told Telegraph.
The course, which is held for the first time this year, explains to students the basics of how good sleeping habits help learning ability and performance in sports and even contribute to general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of mental health at Harvard Medical School and director of the school’s health services, said the university had decided to present the course after finding out that students were very sleepy over the week.
The course is an hour in length and involves various interactive tasks.
In one part there is a picture of a room at home, where students click on coffee balls, windows, sports shoes and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how performance in sports can worsen the lack of sleep, as well as the importance of a good routine for sleep.
In the second part, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the school area with interactive symbols then encourages participants to think about their daily habits.
“We know that this will not change the behavior of students under the same conditions.
But we think they have the right to know this, just as a person has the right to know about the health effects of smoking cigarettes,” added Professor Czeisler.
The culture that honors those who watch and learn all night long is still there, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students meant that sleep deprivation was a growing problem.
Ensuring that enough sleep is of good quality should be “secretively open” to students to defend stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said – even to avoid fattening, because sleep deprivation increases the brain’s call for food so that the body is fit.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student in chemical and physical biology from California, helped Professor Czeisler put the course together, but he sat one of the professor’s courses last year at Harvard.
He said the course had opened his eyes and encouraged him to call for a course for all students in the school.
He hopes that the next step will be to ask all masters to complete a similar course before they start studying at the university.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider setting an alarm clock, which reminds them to go to sleep, and to wake them, and bear in mind the harmful effects from blue light emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, but this can confuse the internal clock of the body and lead to trouble falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Mark from Menga shoots down men Gerrards
Rangers were still struggling on the field when a broken team of Stevens Gerrards had to settle for a 1-0 loss at Livingston, after goal from Dolly Menga.
Team Ibrox wanted to win his first victory at the field after his victory at St Johnstone in February, but team Gary Holt gave Gerrard's team only his second loss in his 18 games as manager. The team is now eight points behind Hearts, who is in the top position in the Ladbrokes Premiership division.
Menga scored seven minutes before half-time and the Rangers team seemed to lack all the inspiration and was never likely to equalize.
Rangers now fall to sixth place but Livingston rises to third place and are only behind Hibernian in goal difference.
Rangers might face further trouble after the lineman Calum Spence had to be hooked due to head injury after some item was thrown into him from the visitor’s vault half.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that swept Ayr away and came to the finish in the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, stayed with the same Liv 11 installation that reached the level of Hearts last week and he would have been pleased with how well-trained his teammates rolled over the anti-spy.
Rangers might have been more with the ball, but Livingston created more opportunities with the balls it reached.
They should have scored just two minutes after the playoffs when the first broadcast from Menga came Scott Pitman in front of Mark Allans McGregors, but he passed.
Many of Keaghan Jacobs' extras ended up with Craig Halkett, while Alan Lithgow, his defenseman, passed the bar.
Rangers regained control of the game but seemed to live in hope rather than belief in their game in the final third of the game.
Alfredo Morales truly felt that he should have gained a foothold when a quarter of the game was over, when he and Steven Lawless collided, while Judge Steven Thomson dismissed the Colombian's appeal.
Rangers only managed to take two shots to the finish line in the first half, but Liam Kelly, former goaltender Ibrox, didn't have to have much to defend the shells from Lassana Coulibaly and easy shot from Oviedo Ejaria.
Although the opportunity from Liv in the 34th minute had come despite the fact that the other team had overtaken, no one can deny that they deserved it, though not only because of their perseverance.
Rangers again failed to do anything from Jacobs' long-range lead.
Scott Arfield failed when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his calm and chose to send to Menga, who then easily scored.
Gerrard took the lead in half and sent Ryan Kent in instead of Coulibaly and the switch had an effect almost immediately as the rear guard came in Morelos, but Kelly rushed in quickly and ran forward to close the shot.
Livingston continued to fool the guests to play exactly the type of game they enjoy playing and Lithgow and Halkett each long got the broadcast on each other's feet.
The team of Holts could have increased their lead at the final rounds, but McGregor was good at denying Jacobs a chance before Lithgow ran to the limit from the corner.
Glenn Middleton, Ranger's deputy, wanted another clue as he and Jacobs fell down together, but Thomson rejected it again.

Here is a page from our almanac “Sunday Morning”: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today and <0xC3><0x81>FRAM... this is the day that future historian Johannes Wilhelm “Hans” Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for studying and measuring radioactivity and the invention eventually led to a device called the Geiger meter.
The Geiger meter has gained a permanent seat in the scientific world since then, but was also popular in pop culture, for example in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans in unlikely roles as scientists:
Man: "What the hell is this?"
Rogers: “This is a Geiger meter, used to find radioactive materials such as uranium.
When you put this hearing aid on you, you can hear the effects of the atoms due to the radioactivity of the stones."
Evans: “It’s really going to work now!”
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the invention that bears his name survives.
New anti-cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” dangerous cells
New anti-cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” dangerous cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize dangerous cells as part of the treatment
Treatment involves taking immune cells from the patient and changing them to a laboratory
Then they can “see” protein, which is common in many cancer cells, and is then injected back into the patient
Experimental vaccine has shown positive results in patients suffering from different types of cancer.
In one woman who received the vaccine, ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months. The vaccine teaches immune cells to recognize dangerous cancer cells.
The method involves removing immune cells from the patient and changing them to a laboratory so that they can “see” a protein called HER2 found in many types of cancer, and then reinjecting the cells back into the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. Cancer Institute in Bethesday, Maryland, said: “Our findings suggest that the vaccine is highly effective.”
HER2 “feels various types of cancer stop growing,” including breast cancer, ovarian, lung, and colon and rectum, said Berzofsky, a professor.
A similar method by which immune cells are taken from patients and those “known” to attack cancer cells has been effective in the treatment of one type of leukaemia.
Kanye West held a long talk in support of Trump and carried MAGA’s attention after appearing on the TV show SNL.
It didn't end well
He was featured on Kanye West in the studio on Saturday Night Live after a lengthy speech praising President Donald Trump and saying that he would present himself to the president in 2020.
After performing the third song of the night, Ghost Town, where he wore the Make America Great hood, he spoke for a long time against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“I’ve talked so many times to white people who say, ‘How can you like Trump, he’s a race hater?’
If I were worried about racial hatred, I would have long since moved from the United States,” he said.
SNL started the show with a stabbing, with Hollywood star Matt Damon joking about Brett Kavanaugh’s testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee for Christine Blasey Ford’s allegations of sexual harassment.
Although West's long-lost record was not broadcast, it was recorded on social media by Chris Rock.
I don't know if Rock wanted to make a joke about West by publishing the recording.
West had also complained to the audience that he had received bad receptions from the back of his head because of his choice of hat.
“I was stuck in the back.
They said to me, “Don’t go up to the field with this thimble.”
They put me in a hurry!
Then they say I'm in a deep hole," he said, according to news from the Washington Examiner.
West continued: “Do you want to see the deep hole?” and said that he would put on his superhero costume “because that means you can’t command me for work. Do you want the world to make progress?
“Try the love.”
His comments were echoed by audiences at least twice, and the actors SNL appeared to be embarrassing, according to Variety, and one presenter said to the paper: “There was a stone silence in the studio.”
West had been invited to the show instead of the singer Arion Grande, but her boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West surprised many with his performance as he sang the song I Love It, dressed like a bottle of Perrier.
West received support from Candace Turner, TPUSA’s chairman, who said on Twitter: “To one of the bravest souls: THANK YOU FOR SIGHTS.”
Speaking on Twitter, Karen Hunter said West was “just being himself and that’s quite wonderful.”
“But I chose not to reward anyone (by buying his music or clothing or supporting his ‘list’) that I feel supports and expands ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
We are, too,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and said he was now “a creature previously known as Kanye West.”
He is not the first artist to change his name and feet in the footsteps of Diddy, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, has also called himself Snoop Lion and must not forget the music legend Prince Hot, who changed his name to symbol and later called himself the artist who was previously known as Prince.
Accused of attempted murder after knife attack at restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after being stabbed at a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Tuesday.
The incident occurred in Ballyhackamore, according to police.
The accused is expected to appear in Belfast court on Monday.
The defendant will pass the charges.
Kit Harington, star of the Crown Games, criticises male poison
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow in the violent adventure series from HBO, The Crown Games.
However, the 31-year-old has criticized the stereotype of the male hero and says that such a role on the screen means that young boys often find that they need to be hard off to gain respect.
In an interview with Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed that “something has gone wrong” and wondered how to deal with the problem that toxic maleness is in the #MeToo period.
Kit, who recently married his companion from the Crown Games, the 31-year-old Rose Leslie, admitted that he had “stronger views” on how to deal with this issue.
“I think at the moment, what’s wrong with man?”
“What have we taught men in their upbringing about the problems we see now?”
Kit believes that the television is partly responsible for the increase in male toxicity, due to the very male characters on television.
He continued: “What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on television and on the streets that makes young boys feel like they must be a certain type of man?
I think that’s one of the most important questions of our time – how do we change that?
“It’s clear that something has gone wrong with young men.”
He also admitted in the interview that he would not play in any other Crucifixion series after the series resembles the following summer and said that he had received “enough of evictions and horses.”
As of November, Kit will play in the remake of True West, a film by Sam Shepard, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother who is a robber.
The actor recently said that the best thing about having played in the Crown Games was to have met his wife, Rose.
“I met my wife in these shows, so they gave me somehow my future family and my life after that,” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, Jon Snow's girlfriend, as Kit played in these Emmy Awards.
The couple married in June 2018, on the land of the Lesliar family in Scotland.
HIV/disease: China reports 14% increase in new infections
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of people infected with or suffering from HIV.
The health authorities say that more than 820,000 people are infected in the country.
About 40,000 new infections were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new infections occurred with sex, which is a change from what was before.
Previously, the HIV virus spread rapidly in some parts of China due to blood transfusions.
The number of people infected by the HIV virus in this way, on the other hand, has fallen to almost zero, as Chinese health professionals said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, the number of people infected with HIV or AIDS has increased by 100,000 from year to year.
HIV infection caused by sex is a serious problem within the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality has not been illegal in China since 1997, but there is still a lot of discrimination against LGBT people.
As a result of stricter standards in the country, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men eventually get married to a woman.
Many people become infected due to inadequate contraception in these marriages.
Since 2003, the government of China has promised access to all HIV medicines as part of a plan to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that an employee has leaked data from the Republican Senate, criticizing “dangerous lies” and “collusion theories”
On Saturday, Maxine Waters, a congresswoman, denied allegations that one of her employees had disclosed the personal information of the three-year-old members of the Republican Party on their Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat said these allegations came from “super-righteous” extremists and websites.
“Lies, lies, and more nasty lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information published included addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information was published online on Thursday from unknown parties at Capitol Hill during interrogation at the Department of the Elderly at Brett Kavanaugh, appointed Supreme Court Justice, for allegations of sexual harassment.
The play came sometime after the three MPs had interrogated Kavanaugh.
Content pages such as Gateway Pundit and RedState said that the IP numbers identifying the originator of the information were linked to the Waters office and displayed information about one of its employees, according to information from Capitol Hill.
“This inexcusable accusation is absolutely wrong and a pure lie,” Waters continued.
“My employee – whose personal data and security are now at risk because of these incorrect accusations – was in no way responsible for this information leak.
This unspoken accusation is absolutely wrong and pure lie.”
Waters’ statement was quickly criticized online, including by Ara Fleischer, former White House reporter.
“This denial is full of anger,” Fleischer wrote.
“That means she doesn’t have the capacity to sit in parliament.
When someone is accused of reasonless, do not react with anger.
It must not show opposition.
You can’t ask for reasons.
There must be peace and quiet.”
Fleischer seemed to compare Water’s reaction to critics of Kavanaugh’s judge, who critics said had seemed too angry at the trial on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, the leading Republican against Waters in the mid-term polls, also said his views on Twitter.
"It's a big deal if it's true," he said.
In his statement, Waters said that her office had informed “the appropriate authorities and law enforcement officers of these untrue claims.
“We will ensure that the guilty are found,” she continued, “and that they will be brought to account for all the acts that are harmful and dangerous to all my employees.”
Movie review for Johnny English Strikes again - spy grin film with Rowan Atkinson turns out to be powerless
It has become a habit to look for Brexit references in all new films where the UK comes up with a story, and that seems to be the case in this revival of the Johnny English series of jokes - which began in 2003 with the film Johnny English and just woke up to life in 2011 with the film Johnny English Reborn.
Will this Kankvis satira about how clearly miserable we are as a new export opportunity for the country?
Whether it’s or not, Johnny English has been given renewed permission for the second time to scratch everything – his name shows above all that he’s a creative work designed for a show in countries other than English speaking countries.
He is, of course, a witness to the secret serviceman who is believed to have a captivating personal touch, but is a bit of a mix of Clouseau, that of Mr. Bean and a little bit of the man who played one note for the song Chariots of Fire at the 2012 London Olympics.
It is also originally based on the traveler and the mysterious city of the world that Atkinson once played in the forgotten Barclaycard television commercials, where he left everything to himself in turmoil.
There are one or two good things in this latest Johnny English movie.
I enjoyed watching Johnny English go to a helicopter dressed in a medieval brow and the helicopters slid in his helmet.
Atkinson clearly shows his quirkyness, but the humor seems rather powerless and strangely superficial, especially now that “serious” films like James Bond and Mission Impossible films also offer hilarious jokes.
The joke seems more intended for children than adults and I found the adventures that Johnny English ended up in not as imaginative and focused as the silence of Atkinson’s joke sticks in the art of Mr. Beans.
The main reason for this is that the UK is in serious trouble.
The computer hacker has managed to break into the secret network of Britain and come up with the identity of all British spies, to the great ama for the spy who is on the watch - but there Kevin Eldon unfortunately comes in too small a role.
This is the final straw for the Prime Minister, who is haughty and controversial of the characters and already in great pain because of the enormous political odds: Emma Thompson does her best with her role as a character to remind Theresu May, but the script is not up to many fish for her.
Her advisors tell her that all active spies are in danger and that she must find someone who had been put in a holy stone.
And there comes Johnny English himself to the story, now a school principal in some fine school, but also provides a secret lesson in how to be a spy: here are some funny jokes that English offers at a news school reminiscent of the film School of Rock.
English is called back to Whitehall at an emergency meeting and meets there Bough, his former long-time partner, who Ben Miller plays again.
Bough is now a married man, his wife is a submarine master, but in that energetic role Vicki Pepperdine does not quite shine.
The N<0xC3><0xB3>snatv<0xC3><0xAD><0xC3><0xB0>i<0xC3><0xB0>i island, which claws everything in its service to the Highness, is now back in the gear and meets the high-pitched Ophelia Bulletovu, played by Olgu Kurylenko.
At the same time, the Prime Minister is at the mercy of the magic of the fascinating billionaire within the tech sector, who claims to be able to solve Britain’s computer problems: it’s the evil Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their raids: they ignite in a fine French restaurant disguised as servants, they cause a noise when they sneak into the luxury corner of Volta, and English turns everything upside down when he tries to use virtual reality glasses to introduce himself to the interior of Volta's house.
There is nothing to be saved in that finality, but although the film is rich and energetic, it still contains some of the children’s material in it as a whole.
Medium-sized material.
And just like with the other Johnny English pictures, I couldn’t help but think: can the British film industry let Rowan Atkinson get a role that really qualifies his skills?
The Labour Party denies that it is preparing a plan for a four-day working week for Britain, with the same wages as for five-day week.
The Labour Party, led by Jeremy Corbyn, is now considering a radical plan that would allow the UK to work for four days a week, but get paid for five.
According to the report, the group wants to make use of the savings generated from the revolution in artificial intelligence, and to make the employees benefit by getting one extra day off.
Employees can enjoy three days of long weekends without dropping their wages.
Sources say that the idea would “fit” the group’s economic plan and its strategy to improve the welfare of workers.
The Trades Union Congress has supported the reduction of the working week for four days, as a way for workers to make use of changes in the economy.
A source from the upper division of the Labour Party told the Sunday Times: “It is estimated that a policy review will be announced before the end of the year.
“The change will not happen overnight, but four days of working week is a goal that fits the group’s approach to changing the economy for the benefit of workers and the overall industry policy of the group.”
The Labour Party would not be the first party to support this idea, but the Green Party promised four days of work in its 2017 election campaign.
The goal, however, is not supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
The Labour Party spokesman said: “Four days of working week is not on the policy paper of the party and the party is not considering implementing it.”
Last week, John McDonnell, the Secretary of Commerce of the shadow ministry, used the Workers’ Party conference to describe his ideas on social revolution within the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from “unknown leaders” and “greenhouses” providers.
The shadow minister’s plans also mean that current shareholders in water utilities may not be able to get their entire share back as the Labour Party’s government could impose “abstract” due to impaired wrongdoing.
He has also confirmed plans to put workers on the board of directors of companies and create a joint holding fund to give 10 percent of the assets of private companies to their employees, who could receive <0xC2><0xA3>500 of them annually in their pocket.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy say “60 minutes” if the FBI’s Kavanaugh investigation could get them to change their mind
The FBI’s investigation into allegations against Brett Kavanaugh has caused at least a week-long delay in the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court, raising the question of whether its findings could get Republican MPs to withdraw their support.
In an interview that will be shown on Sunday, Scott Pelley, a reporter on the episode of “60 Minutes,” asked Republican and Senate Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could reveal anything that could get them to change their minds.
Kennedy seemed to be more open than his South Carolina colleague.
“I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
“I said when the trial started, I said I was talking to Kavanaugh’s judge.
I called him after the accusations were put forward and asked, “Do you do this?”
He was determined, determined, undivided.”
However, Graham’s vote seems to be invariable.
“I’ve made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh and it needed an incredible excuse to change it,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know this: Brett firmly denied it,” Graham added, addressing Christine Blasey Ford.
“And everyone she mentions by name couldn’t confirm it.
This case is 36 years old.
I don’t think anything new will change.”
What is the International Citizens’ Day and has it done something to reduce poverty?
The International Citizens Festival will be held on Saturday in New York. It is an annual music event in which a series of big stars will emerge and with a similarly influential strategy; ending poverty worldwide.
This is the seventh year that the International Citizens’ Festival is being held and tens of thousands of people will flee to Central Park, not only to listen to music from Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to draw attention to the real goal of the festival of ending hurtful poverty by 2030.
The International Citizens’ Day, first held in 2012, is part of the Global Poverty Project, which aims to end poverty by increasing the number of people fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (except for those who want to pay for VIP tickets), performers had to complete various tasks, or “actions”, such as volunteering, sending emails to any of the world’s leaders, calling calls, or using other valid ways to help attract attention to their target audience.
But how much success has the festival achieved, now for 12 years there is a strategy to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of awarding people with free concerts a real way to convince people to call for action, or is this just one so-called “click action” – where people feel it’s doing something that matters by signing up to a checklist online or sending a message on Twitter?
Global Citizen says that since 2011, it has recorded over 19 million “actions” from its supporters, calling for a variety of different goals.
It says these actions have helped to get world leaders to declare commitments and policies equivalent to over $35 billion that will impact lives of over $2.25 billion by 2030.
Early in 2018, the group listed 390 commitments and notifications for its actions, of which at least $10 billion has been invested or raised.
The group estimates that the funds collected so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
One primary commitment comes from The Power of Nutrition, a UK investor and executive director working to “help children enjoy themselves to the fullest,” and promised to provide 35 million dollars to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country, after receiving 4700 messages from Global Citizen on Twitter.
“With the support of the UK government, its sponsors, governments around the world and international citizens like you, we can leave the social injustice that malnutrition is a thing of the past,” said Tracey Ullmann, a representative of The Power of Nutrition at London’s concerts in April 2018.
The group also said that after 5,000 calls were sent that the UK should improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children and provide them with better nutrition.
In the list of common questions on the group’s website, one question is as follows: “Why do you think you can end up hurting the poor?”
Global citizen replied: “It will be a long and difficult task – sometimes we will fail in the meantime.
But, we will reach our goal, just like movements that fight for the rights of citizens and the abolition of racial segregation before us, because we are stronger together.
Among those featured at the event this year are Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, and Janelle Monae. The event will be held in New York and the presenters are Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use the Navy as a “block” to stop Russia’s energy exports, Interior Minister says
“If necessary,” said U.S. Secretary of State Ryan Zinke, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke argued that Russia’s aid to Syria, especially as the country works in the government’s capacity, would be an incentive to explore a new market.
“I think the reason for their existence in the Middle East is that they want to do business with energy like in Eastern Europe and its southern part,” he said.
And, according to official notice, there are ways and methods to track against it.
“The United States can use the Navy to ensure that sea routes are open and to create a barrier, if necessary, to ensure that the storm from them does not reach the market,” he said.
Zinke addressed visitors to the Consumer Energy Alliance, a charity that calls itself the “voice of the energy consumer” in the United States.
He continued and brought Washington’s approach to dealing with Russia and Iran, saying it was more or less the same.
“The economic option for Iran and Russia is more and less the exploitation of energy sources and the replacement of them for others,” he said, saying Russia has only one card in the sleeve with an economy that is dependent on fossil fuels.
The statements come after Trump’s administration wants to increase its exports of natural gas to Europe and replace Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To do this, public officials in Trump’s administration, including Donald Trump’s president himself, have tried to get Germany to stop participating in the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 project of laying new energy pipeline, which Trump says would make Berlin “capture” Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly argued that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 energy pipeline, which will double the capacity of the current pipeline to 110 billion square meters, is a purely economic project.
Russians say that Washington’s strong opposition to the project has simply been pushed forward for economic reasons and that it is an example of untrue competition.
“I think we share the view that energy must not be a tool to exert pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers,” said Aleksandr Novak, Russia’s Minister of Energy after meeting with Rick Perry, US Energy Minister, in Moscow in September.
The state of the United States has been criticized by Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industrial association, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the United States not to switch from the EU’s energy policy to a bilateral agreement between Berlin and Moscow.
“I’m very reluctant to have a foreign state switch from our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, chairman of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a meeting recently held with Angela Merkel, Chancellor of Germany, and Vladimir Putin, President of Russia.
Elizabeth Warren will “consider serious” to present herself to the presidency in 2020, she says.
Elizabeth Warren, Massachusetts's general secretary, said on Saturday that she would "consider seriously" presenting herself to the president after the midterm elections.
Warren confirmed that she would consider presenting herself at a civil meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and take care of our government, and then a woman also needs to be a leader,” she said.
“After November 6, I will seriously consider inviting myself to the office of President.”
Warren spoke about Donald Trump’s president at the meeting and said he was “going with the country in the wrong direction.
“I’m very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren has been adamant about his criticism of Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, the nominee of his Supreme Court Justice.
On Friday, Warren said on Twitter that “of course we need to have the FBI investigate the matter before the vote is taken.”
However, a survey published on Thursday shows that the majority of voters in Warren’s state do not feel that it should be presented in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts’s “probable” voters said that the Senate should not present itself, according to a poll published by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent said they supported her efforts.
The survey showed more support for Deval Patrick, a former head of state, where 38 percent said they supported his possible bid and 48 percent said they opposed it.
Among other popular Democrats who were discussed for a possible presidential bid in 2020 were Joe Biden, former vice president, and Bernie Sanders, Vermont's senior senator.
Biden said it plans to make an official decision in January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talks about track palin attack at Donald Trump's election meeting
Track Palin, 26, was in Iraq for one year after joining the army in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
“My son is going through a lot of trouble after coming back, I feel with other families who are affected by seizure disorder and the mental wounds that our soldiers return home with,” she told the audience at the election meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest “the elephant in the room” and said that her son and other warlords “go back a little differently, they are hard-hearted and wonder if any respect is earned for what their military and air forces and other military units have done for the country.”
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, trying to prevent domestic violence and gun violence under the influence of alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and Washington D.C. support challenge against new asylum policy
Eighteen states and Washington City support a legal challenge against a new U.S. policy that denies victims fleeing bribery or domestic violence for asylum.
Representatives of the 18 states and the city submitted a court report on Friday in Washington to support the asylum seeker who opposes the policy, according to news from NBC News.
The full name of the defendant in the Grace v. Sessions lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union against the federal policy has not been given.
She said that her husband “and his violent sons who were exiled,” had violently abused her, but U.S. state officials rejected her application for asylum on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
The prosecutors, who support Grace, described El Salvador, Honduras, and Gvatemala as countries where gang-related problems and domestic violence are increasingly increasing. The number of asylum seekers to the United States comes from these countries.
The new asylum-seeking policy revokes the decision of the Immigration Appeals Committee in 2014 to allow unregistered immigrants who fled domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Washington State Prosecutor Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy “hugged decades of federal and international law.”
“The Federal Act requires a decision to be taken on all asylum applications based on the facts and circumstances of the application, and this policy violates this rule,” the court report said.
Lawyers further said in the report that the policy that denied immigrants entry was harmful to the U.S. economy, arguing that immigrants were more likely to start a business and “provide significant labour force.”
Jeff Sessions, a federal prosecutor, ordered judges in immigration cases to cease providing a refuge for victims who fled domestic violence and retaliation in June.
“Those who leave their homeland because of persecutions based on race, religion, nationality, or membership in a particular community or political review can apply for asylum,” Sessions said in a statement on June 11.
Healers were never meant to solve all the problems, not even all the serious problems, that people deal with every day around the world.
Desperate rescue operations in a race to find survivors in Palu, the number of dead doubles
The situation will be even more difficult for those who survived.
“There’s a lot of excitement in the air,” said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, as she comforted her sick son in the relief center in the city of Palu.
“The ambulances are bringing their bodies here all the time.
There is little about clean water.”
Residents were seen returning to their ruined homes and looking for their water-nose possessions to try to save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals are overcrowded and damaged after the earthquake, which measured 7.5 points on the Richter scale.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who had broken his back and shoulders, were located outside the Palu military hospital, where patients were rushed outside due to continued forceful aftershocks.
Tears filled his eyes as he told how he found the earthquake shaking his hotel room on the fifth floor, where he was with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save ourselves.
I’m pushing up to the wall walls, I think,” Haris told the Associated Press, saying his family had been in town to go to a wedding.
“I heard my wife calling for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they are safe.”
U.S. ambassador accuses China of “offensive” allegations
A week after China’s official newspaper published four recent announcements in the U.S. newspaper to address the mutual benefits of trade between the two countries, U.S. Ambassador to China Beijing accused Beijing of using U.S. media to spread the rumors.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, last Wednesday spoke about the announcement of the Chinese newspaper in the Des Moines Register - which is the most sold newspaper in Iowa - after accusing China of trying to interfere in the U.S. parliamentary elections that will be on November 6. China denies this excuse.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing wanted to interfere in the U.S. election market what official U.S. officials said Reuters news agency was a new stage in a growing campaign from Washington to apply China pressure.
While it is normal for foreign governments to publish advertisements to push for business, Beijing and Washington are in a perpetual trade war, with new tariffs on imports from both countries.
Chinese and U.S. experts say that early in the trade war, China’s retaliation tariffs were designed to harm expatriates in counties such as Iowa, which supported Trump’s Republican party.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former Iowa governor for a long time, but it exports a lot of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had damaged U.S. laborers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad said in his submission to Des Moines Register on Sunday that “China is now increasing its persecutions by publishing quotations in our own free media.”
“With the spread of its appeal, the government of China is making use of the beloved language of the United States and our free media by publishing a cost-effective advertisement in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad said in his article.
“Against this, few protest lines can be found in Beijing’s street newspaper booths, and no true reflection can be found on the different views that the Chinese could have on China’s worrying economic policy, as the media is stuck under the Chinese Communist Party’s heel,” he wrote.
He added that “one of the biggest newspapers in China got away from the offer to publish his” article, but he did not state what the magazine was.
Experts warn that the Republicans are making female voters question them for the midterm elections with the Kavanaugh case.
Experts have warned of negative reactions, especially from women, in the upcoming midterm elections, because many Republicans have supported and defended Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court’s nominee, who has accepted allegations of sexual harassment.
Very strong feelings have been around this issue and most Republicans have already shown publicly that they wanted to start voting.
“These things cannot be backed up,” said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Maxwell School at Syracuse University, to The Hill for an article released on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted Jeff Flake, the senior Republican senator in Arizona, had called for an investigation into the FBI’s ability to calm voters.
“Women won’t forget what happened yesterday, they won’t forget tomorrow and not in November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, a consultant and spokesperson for the liberal movement MoveOn, on Friday, according to Washington D.C. news magazine.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted “November is approaching!” as they protested in the passage of the Old Testament when the Republicans who ruled the ruling committee decided to proceed with Kavanaugh’s nomination, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, according to Mic.
“The interest and ferocity of voters will come from all over the world,” said Stu Rothenberg, independent of political analyst, on the news website.
“People will say that the interest has already been great, and that’s true.
But he could be bigger, especially with female voters in the polls and younger voters, aged 18-29, who dislike the president, but rarely vote."
The investigators expressed a reluctance if the Republicans press for confirmation of Kavanaugh, even for Ford's testimony, in which she described her allegations of sexual harassment from him.
“This has become a big mess for the Republican Party,” said Michael Still, a former member of the Republican National Committee, early last week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about the committee’s vote or the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh will be allowed to sit in the class, it’s also about how the Republicans handled it and how they dealt with it,” said Guy Cecil, Chairman of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, at the news station.
However, Americans seem to disagree with who should believe in the testimony of both Ford and Kavanaugh, and the majority support the latter.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents believed the testimony of Ford, while 35 percent said they believed the testimony of Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent of respondents said they believed Kavanaugh to have probably or certainly lied about his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following the Flake call, the FBI is now investigating the allegations that Ford put forward and from at least one other woman, Deboruh Ramirez, according to the Guardian news.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh had attacked her at the age of 17 and that he had been under the influence of alcohol.
Ramirez says Kavanaugh carried her genitals in front of her when they were both at a party at Yale University in the 1990s.
The man who invented the internet has plans to start a new internet to fight Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the man who invented the internet, plans to set up a brand company to fight Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt is a company based on Solid, an open platform of Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people are allowed to access any information.
In a private interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt was “home ownership.”
“We have to do this now,” he said of the company.
“This is a historic moment.”
The application uses Solid technology to enable people to create their own “personal online data store” or POD.
This may include a list of contacts, project lists, calendars, music collections and other personal and work-related devices.
It’s similar to Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify all being present in one browser and all at the same time.
The unique thing about the personal data store is that it is completely under the user’s control who can access any information.
The company calls it “personal empowerment by using data.”
According to John Bruce, CEO of the company, the idea of Inrupt is that the company provides access, process and appropriate expertise to help make Solid accessible to everyone.
Currently, the company consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform bought by IBM, several developers hired as contractors to work on the project, and a group of volunteer programmers.
As of this week, technology developers around the world could create their own independent application with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team shouldn’t be talking to Facebook and Google about whether to initiate a complete change that would put their current business models on the head in one night.
“We don’t ask for permission.”
Berners-Lee wrote in an article published on Saturday on Medium that Inrupt had “the goal of creating energy in business and ecosystems that helps protect the honesty and quality of the new website based on Solid.”
Berners-Lee revolutionized the Internet in 1994 when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate about the neutrality of the Internet.
Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and CEO of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation of the Open Data Institute, even while he is setting up Inrupt.
“I’m fully optimistic for the next period of the network,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Priest and Chief of the Victorian Cross from the First World War Honored
The only English priest to be honored with the Victoria Cross in the First World War as a soldier has been hailed in his hometown 100 years later.
Bernard Vann, who was the commander of the army, was given the cross on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later, and he never learned that he had been awarded the highest honour of the British Army.
Two of his grandsons unveiled a memorial to him in a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his great-grandsons, Michael Vann, said that it was “extremely symbolic” that the memorial was unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather’s honorary birthday.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Vann led his sub-prime army over the Canal de Saint-Quentin, “through a very thick fog and under a heavy gunshot attack from the pits and machine guns.”
He later ran to the firing line, and with “great courage” he led the line forward before fighting a single-armed gun and ambushing three soldiers.
He was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918, just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s heroes were “something I could never do, but something that makes a person humble.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also placed a flower wreath after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he felt the “great honor of participating in the parade” and added that “the true heroes are shown with the support that so many show.”
MMA fans watched all night to watch Bellator 206, instead got to see the Guru Pig
Just imagine, having woken up all night to see the overcrowded Bellator 206, just to be denied seeing the main event.
The schedule included 13 battles from San Jose, of which six were on the main roster and they were shown live broadcast all night in the UK on the Channel 5 channel.
At 6 o’clock in the morning, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory McDonald were preparing to fight, British viewers were given an unexpected turnout when the broadcast changed to Gurru Pig.
Some were unhappy after waking up all night to watch the battle.
One fan on Twitter described the changes to the child subject as “some kind of sick joker.”
“According to official rules, the material was not suitable for viewers at six o’clock in the morning so they had to switch to children’s material,” said Dave Schwartz, vice president of marketing and communications for Bellator, when asked on the broadcast.
“Greetings, yes.”
Scott Coker, CEO of Bellator said they would go over their schedules and take viewers in the UK into the account in the future.
“I think when I think about the re-show that we could probably get rid of this,” Coker said.
“But it’s six o’clock in the morning on Sunday and we can’t get rid of this until Sunday in our time, which is Monday with them.
But we are working on it.
Believe me, when the broadcast was changed, many text messages were sent back and forth, and they were not all friendly.
We were trying to fix this, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn’t, it was a public problem.
I can promise this won’t happen next time.
We limit the night to five fights instead of six, as usual, but we tried too much and walked out.
It’s an unfortunate situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley found ‘disabled’ due to sexual assault
Olympic champion Tom Daley says he has found incompetence with other people in his upbringing because of his gender, but that it has encouraged him to succeed.
The 24-year-old Daley said he had not realized that “he was different from others” until he went to secondary school.
In the radio show Desert Island Discs on the Radio 4 channel, with Lauren Laverne, Daley said he talked about the rights of homosexuals to provide “von.”
He also said that his role as a parent has diminished his interest in winning the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the usual director, has taken a few months off due to illness.
Daley met with Laverne in the first episode and said he found him to be “my husband” but everyone else when he was a child because “it was not agreed in society to be liked by both boys and girls.”
He said: “All the way up to the present day, these feelings of feeling have given me the power and strength to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was “something,” he said, so that he would not cause any disappointment when he finally came up with his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has made a significant contribution as a supporter of LGBT and used his participation in the Commonwealth games in Australia to call on more nations to legislate homosexuality.
He said he was happy to be able to live publicly without punishment and wanted to give “von” to others.
The world champion triple said it was “unsurprising” to fall in love with a man – American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he first met in 2013.
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, last year, but said the age difference had never been a problem.
“When a man goes through so much at a young age” – but he participated in his first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later – he said it would be difficult to find peers who had experienced similar success and difficulty.
The couple adopted a child in June, the son of Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said that his “all life-views” would have been condescended.
“If you had asked me last year, it was all about winning a gold prize,” he said.
“You know what, there are more important things than the gold prize at the Olympics.
Robbie is my Olympic gold medalist."
His son is baptized in the head of Robert, his father who died in 2011, aged 40, after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father had not agreed that he would die and one of the last things he had asked was whether they had received their tickets for London 2012 - because he wanted to sit in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him he wouldn’t live long enough to sit in the front row,” he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and it wasn’t until his breath stopped and he was dead that I finally recognized that he wasn’t victorious,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
“I just knew that I had dreamed of this all my life, to immerse myself in front of viewers at home at the Olympics. There’s no better feeling,” he said.
It was also inspired by the choice of the first song - Proud by Heather Small - which had inspired him for the Olympics and still gave him goosebumps.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 a.m. to British local time.
Mickelson in bad shape and left to sit on the class in the Ryder Cup on Saturday
U.S. Phil Mickelson will strike on Sunday as he plays his 47th game in the Ryder Cup, but he must find his old pace again so that the score is not surrounded by bad memories.
Mickelson, who plays in the competition for the 12th time, which is rated, was allowed to sit on the class after deciding his team's Jim Furyk for the four-ball and four-game competitions on Saturday.
Instead of being the centerpiece of the hare, as he has been so often before the United States, the day of the five-time champion splits between being a clapper and training the players on the pitch in hopes of correcting what’s on his mind.
Mickelson, 48 years old, was never the one who shot direct with the killer, and is not the best player for the Le Golf National Golf Course, as long as globs often punish for bad shots.
And not only is the golf course a big challenge in itself, but Mickelson has to compete against Frances Molinari, winner of the British Open, in the ninth game on Sunday. Molinari is with the new team Tommy Fleetwood and together they have won all four of their games this week.
If the Americans, who are four points below when they take the first game of 12 singles, get a good start, Mickelson's game could be a game of chess.
Fury expressed confidence in his husband, but he could hardly say much else.
“He perfectly understood the role he had today, patted me on the back and took care of me and said he would be ready tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence.
He is in the famous palace and he has been so much better for the teams before and this week.
I didn’t expect him to play two games.
I saw more for myself, but that’s how it ended and we thought we had to go this way.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else.”
Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo in a number of played games in the Ryder Cup on Sunday.
This could market the end of the process in the Ryder cup which has never reached quite as high as other achievements on its record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and 7 tie-ups, but Furyk said his presence had a certain indistinct effect on the team.
“He’s funny, he’s the crook, he’s the bitch, he likes making jokes and it’s great to have him in the team room,” he explained.
“I think the younger players enjoyed fighting him this week too, and it was fun to see.
He gives so much more than just the game of golf.”
Thomas Bjorn, Head of Europe knows that a lot of progress can disappear quickly
European team leader Thomas Bjorn knows from the experience that a good lead for the last day of the individual race in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable experience.
The Dane first played in a game at Valderrama in 1997, where, side by side under the command of Seve Ballesteros, had a five-point lead over the American men, but managed to score a victory at the end with the lowest possible score, with 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 wins.
“It’s a constant reminder that we had a lot of lead in Valderrama, we had a lot of lead in Brookline where we lost and in Valderrama where we won, but only right so,” Bjorn, who is seen here in the picture, said after watching the 2018 vintage win 5-3 both on Friday and on Saturday and reaching the 10th on Saturday.
The story will show me and everyone in the team that it’s not over.
We'll all be moving forward tomorrow.
Let’s do everything right.
This is not done until all the steps are on the tablet.
We have our goal and it is trying to win this cup, we focus on it
I’ve always said this, I’m focused on the players 12 in our team, but we’re very aware of our opponents in the other team – the best golfer in the world.”
Bjorn was delighted with how his players had been on a difficult level and added: “I never go beyond myself in this.
Tomorrow will be different.
Tomorrow is the performance of the individuals that matter, and that’s another thing.
It’s great to play with a partner when everything goes well, but when you play one is tried on everyone’s skills as a golfer.
It is the message that needs to be sent to the players, to get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind and he also has to play his best game himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent, Jim Furyk, will strive for his players to stand up better in individual games than with partners, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three points out of four.
Furyk has experienced both sides of this big deal on the last day, but he was a winner with his team at Brookline but ended up losing when Europe performed the “Powerwork in Medinah.”
“I remember every damn word,” he replied, questioning how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had been encouraging his players for the last day.
“We need to play 12 important games tomorrow, but you want to start fast as happened in Brookline and Medinah.
When the crotch is close to being built up, it causes a lot of pressure on the game that is in the middle.
We ranked our players according to that and let them play as we think will go best tomorrow."
Thomas has been given the task of trying to lead the defense and play against Rory McIlroy in the first game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the other European players in the first half of the games.
“I chose these players in this series because I think they cover all the way through,” Bjorn said of his choice of players in the individual competition.
Germany's new military fleet has been delayed
The latest German naval ship should have been built in 2014 to replace old ships from the Cold War period, but it will not be ready until the first of the next year due to faulty systems and increasing costs, according to news in the area.
The construction of the “Rheinland-Pfalz,” the flagship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class warships, has now been delayed until the first half of 2019, according to reports from the military spokesman who spoke to the Die Zeit newspaper.
The ship had to be taken advantage of by the Navy in 2014, but serious problems after delivery plotted the project.
The four ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg group ordered by the Navy in 2007 are to replace the Bremen-class ships, which have arrived in their years.
They should be equipped with a more powerful parachute, many anti-aircraft and anti-aircraft missiles, and covert technologies such as reduced radar infrared and audible signals.
Other important features are longer service life - it should be possible to use the latest ships for up to two years away from their home ports.
However, constant delays mean that these latest type of ships – which are said to enable Germany to show its strength at sea – will already be obsolete when they are finally taken into service, says Die Zeit.
The F125 came to the news last year when the German army officially refused to accept the fleet and returned it to the Blohm & Voss drop in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy has returned a ship to the manufacturer after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons behind the divorce, but German media spoke of a number of serious “mistakes in software and hardware” that made the warship useless if it were sent to the military.
Software faults were particularly important because the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class warships will be managed by 120 crews, which are half smaller than those of the Bremen-class warships.
It was also found that the ship was too heavy, which reduces its performance and limits the ability of the Navy to make improvements to it in the future.
The 7000-ton ship "Rhineland-Palatinate" is thought to be twice as heavy as ships of a similar class used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to hardware failures, the cost of the entire project - including the training of the crew - is starting to cause problems.
It is said to have reached 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars), but was originally to be 2.2 billion euros.
Problems affecting the latest ships are particularly important in the light of the warnings that the supremacy of the Germans in the sea is diminishing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliamentary Defence Committee, acknowledged that the naval army was in fact to become “the focal point of an operational ship.”
The representative said that the problem had arisen over time, because older ships were taken out of service but no ships were put in their place.
He lamented that none of the orders of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could be put into service by the Navy.
The National Trust of the Conservation Society on the Secret Life of Leather Sheets
A new study, carried out on the territory of the Scottish Highlands, aims to find out how leaves use the landscape when they fish for food.
It is hoped that the results will shed new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help guide nature conservation activities in the future.
The study, conducted by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland, will monitor different types of leather diapers in the Inverewe gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be installed at key locations around the area to monitor the behaviour of the leather sheets over the period.
NHS staff and volunteers will also go on hand-held sensory check-ups.
Experts will analyze all the recordings to get to the frequency of the callers, which the leather blades give off, and what types do what.
Maps of habitats and reports will then be issued to create a detailed picture of their behaviour on a geographical scale.
Rob Dewar, the NTS nature conservation consultant, hopes that the results will reveal what kind of habitat is most important for the leather diapers and how they are used by each type.
This information will help determine the benefits of managing habitats, e.g. by creating meadows and how best to maintain forest cover for leafy leaves and other related species.
Leather diapers have decreased significantly in the last century in Scotland and all over the UK.
They are at risk because of construction and development projects that affect their nests and reduce habitats.
Windmills and light can also cause risks, including fly-papers and certain chemical treatments on building materials, as well as attacks from household items.
Blinds aren’t really blind.
However, their ears are more beneficial than their eyes when it comes to fishing, because they are used to fishing at night.
They used advanced rock mining technology to find insects and objects that are on their way to flight.
NTS, which is responsible for the maintenance of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, is taking diapers very seriously.
The organisations employ ten experts, who carry out regular inspections, field inspections and sometimes rescue operations.
The association has even established the first and only leather-bleaching country in Scotland at the Threave farm in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight out of ten leather-bleached species of Scotland own a home.
David Thompson, the farm manager, says he is the perfect place for them.
“The area here at Threave is great for leather diapers,” he said.
“We have old buildings, lots of trees and lots of good habitat.
But there is still a lot of uncertainty about diapers, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us better understand what they need to wear.”
He emphasised the importance of checking with leather diapers before maintenance at a residence, as the possible accidental destruction of one nest can kill up to 400 female leather diapers and young and destroy all leather diapers in the area.
Leaves are protected and it is forbidden to kill them, harass or disturb, or destroy their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish representative at the Bat Conservation Trust, has urged the public to help.
She said: “We still have a lot of unlearned leather diapers and we don’t know how many of them are going well.”
Ronaldo denies allegations of rape as lawyers prepare lawsuit against German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has called accusations against him about the rape of “false news” and says that people want to “get attention” by using his name.
His lawyers intend to prosecute the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
Portugal and Juventus have been accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is said to have paid her $375,000 to silence the incident, according to Der Spiegel on Friday.
A few hours after the allegations were published, Ronaldo, 33 years old, said in an Instagram Live video with 142 million followers that they were “fake news.”
“No, no, no, no.
What was said today is fake news,” the world champion told the camera five times.
“These people want to draw attention to themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
It wants to be famous by using my name, but it’s part of the job.
I’m a happy man and everything is fine,” the player added with a smile.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for the allegations, which they have called “unacceptable disclosure of private-life suspects,” according to Reuters news agency.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said Ronaldo would demand compensation for “the amount and severity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.”
The alleged incident is said to have occurred in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After seeing a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga went back to the player's room, where he is said to have raped her in the rectum, according to documents filed for Clark County, Nevada.
Mayorga says Ronaldo fell on his knees after a suspicious incident and told her he was “99 percent good man” who had fallen into temptation for “1 percent.”
The documents state that Ronaldo agreed that the couple had sex but that it had been with the consent of both.
Mayorga claims that she went to the police and had photos taken of her injuries at the hospital, but finally agreed to sit outside the courtroom because she was “feared of revenge” and worried about being “degraded publicly.”
She says she wants to quit because she is still in shock after an incident.
Ronaldo was close to going to Real Madrid from Manchester United when the rape was supposed to have taken place, and this summer he crossed over to the Italian giant Juve with a €100 million deal.
Brexit: Britain would ‘look after forever’ to lose car manufacturers
Britain would “look for it forever” if it lost its position as an international leader among carmakers after Brexit, said Secretary of Commerce Greg Clark.
He added that it was “a concern” that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if the UK left the EU without a deal, the company would temporarily cease production of its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
“We need a deal,” Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of delaying the border would be if Brexit without a deal would cost reality jobs.
The Burnaston factory, which produces Toyota Auris and Avensis cars, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to other European Union countries.
“My opinion is that if the UK jumps out of the EU by the end of March, we will see production facilities in our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s Director General at Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers have expressed concern about exiting the EU without consenting to how international trade should take place, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW says it will close its Mini factory in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concerns lie in what car manufacturers say to be a supply chain risk if Brexit without a deal becomes a reality.
Toyota’s production line is based on receipt at the “last hour”, where parts are delivered every 37 minutes from suppliers both in the UK and the EU for cars manufactured after order.
If the UK withdraws from the EU without a deal on 29 March, there could be a disruption to the borders that the industry believes could lead to a lack of components and delays.
It would be impossible for Toyota to store more than a daily warehouse in its factory in Derbyshire, the company said, and therefore production would stop.
Mr Clark said that the Chequers programme Theresu May for future relations with the EU “was aimed specifically at preventing these views at the border.”
“We need to have a deal. We want to get the best deal that allows us to enjoy not only success in the modern world, but as an opportunity that we can take advantage of,” he said on BBC Radio 4.
“The evidence, not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers, shows that we need to be able to continue with extremely effective approaches.
Toyota could not say how long their output would stop, but warned that in the long run, increased costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and is a member of the union’s trust in the factory, said that his employees were increasingly concerned: “My experience is that when these jobs disappear, they never come back.
The government spokesman said: “We have put forward a detailed and comprehensive plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
A meeting between Trump and Rosenstein could be postponed again, according to the White House.
The White House said on Sunday that an important meeting between Donald Trump and Rod Rosenstein, the state prosecutor, could be “rescheduled for a week” now the dispute over Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court’s nominee, continues.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Robert Mueller, a special prosecutor, who investigates Russian elections, connections between Trump and Russia’s assistants, and possible obstacles to the success of the President’s justice hand.
For weeks, Washington’s storyline has been about whether Trump will run a state of emergency prosecutors, putting Mueller’s independence in jeopardy.
Earlier this month, the New York Times newspaper said Rosenstein had discussed carrying a recording device to record talks with Trump and the possibility of rolling the president out of session using the 25th Amendment to the Constitution.
Rosenstein denied these claims.
But last Monday he visited the White House, among the news that he was going to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced with Trump on Thursday, but he was then with the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he “preferably doesn’t” want to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was suspended for not being at the same time as being heard by the Senate Judiciary Committee, where Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who has accused him of sexual harassment, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the Senate vote.
Sarah Sander, Trump’s media representative, was on the Fox News Sunday.
When asked out at the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “It is not yet a date for him, it could be this week. I think it is possible that he will be suspended for another week because of everything else going on at the Supreme Court.
But we see it, and I am always happy to inform the media.”
Some reporters disagree with this statement: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
Chris Wallace asked me why.
Sanders said that a small number of meetings were not a result of the dissatisfaction that TV reporters had with “visualism,” but she said: “I disagree with the fact that they have visualism.”
She then gave evidence that direct contact between Trump and the media would increase.
“The president answers more media questions than any other president has done before,” she said, without referring to sources: “We’ve gone over these numbers.”
“If the media have the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, it’s much better than talking to me.
We are trying to do a lot of it and you have seen us do a lot of it in the last few weeks and it will replace media meetings when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or media meetings with other leaders who visit him.
Media meetings with him are rare.
The president may have demonstrated that reason in New York this week, when he showed off a rude and at times strange behavior in front of a group of reporters.
Minister of Health writes EU staff within the health system in Scotland due to concerns about Brexit
The Minister of Health has written to EU staff working within the health care system in Scotland (NHS Scotland) to express the gratitude of the nation and wishes that it will continue to operate after Brexit has passed.
Jeane Freeman sent letters when within six months until the UK leaves the EU.
The Scottish Government has already promised to meet the costs of applications for authorisation for EU citizens working within the public service sector.
Ms. Freeman wrote in his letter: “Over the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU for the verdicts have continued and the decision-making is expected this autumn.
The British government has also been preparing for a deal if it is not possible.
I know this must be a lot of uncertainty for all of you.
That is why I want to reiterate how much I appreciate the work of all the staff, no matter what their nationality is.
EU and international partners provide valuable experience and expertise to strengthen and improve the functioning of the health services and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is truly your home and we really want you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie went under emergency surgery after having a head injury
Christion Abercrombie, a Tennessee State Tigers lineman, had to undergo an emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in a 31-27 loss to Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, according to news from Mike Organ, Tennessean newspaper.
Rod Reed, Tennessee State's head coach, told reporters that the injury had been a half-time injury.
“He came to the sideline and fell down there,” Reed said.
Trainers and nurses gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before it was put on the bar and drilled off for further inspection.
A Tennessee State representative told Chris Harris, a WSMV radio station in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was undergoing surgery at the Vanderbilt hospital.
Harris added that there was “no information about the type or severity of the impact yet” and that Tennessee State was trying to find out when the accident occurred.
Abercrombie, who is in the final year of school, plays his first season with Tennessee State after fleeing from Illinois.
He had five sets on Saturday before leaving, which raised the total number of sets with him to 18.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp fees when they buy real estate in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp fees when they buy property in the UK. The excess will be used to assist homeless people, according to the new plan of the Conservative Party
The action will make no success of Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters
Increased stamp fees will be charged to those who do not pay tax in the UK
The government plans to raise <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year - to help homeless people.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp fees when they buy real estate in the UK. The excess will be used to assist homeless people. Theresa May will announce this today.
The action will be considered an attempt to make the unsuccessful campaign of Jeremy Corbyn to attract young voters by promising housing at affordable prices and taxing high-income people further.
Individuals and companies that do not pay taxes in the UK will have to pay higher stamp fees, and the excess will go to the government’s actions to assist the homeless.
The increase – which is in addition to the current stamp charges, including the increase imposed two years ago at an extra home and real estate for rent – could be up to three percent.
The government estimates that the increase will generate up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of new buildings in London are purchased by foreign parties, but this causes price increases and makes it more difficult for those who want to buy real estate for the first time to enter the market.
Many of the country's most populous areas - especially the capital - have become "treasure towns" due to the number of foreign buyers spending most of their time abroad.
The new policy comes just a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in stamp fees to help more young people get their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping property prices high by buying land but not using it, and urged May to stop mortgages on homes at affordable prices to fix Britain’s “housing shortages.”
Mr Corbyn has announced a number of significant improvements in housing, including rental controls and the end-of-life issue of rental housing without charge.
He also wants to give us more power to build a new home.
Theresa May said: “Last year I said I would dedicate myself to the restoration of the British dream in my first period – that each new generation should enjoy better quality of life.
And that includes fixing our unused real estate market.
UK doors will always open to those who want to live here, work and build their lives.
However, it cannot be right that it is as easy for foreign parties and companies with headquarters in foreign countries to buy a home and for good British nationals.
For many, the dream of their own home has become far too distant, and the scourges of homelessness are still too real.”
Jack Ross: “My main goal is to train Scotland.”
Jack Ross, coach Sunderland, says it’s his “first goal” to become coach of Scotland at some point.
This 42-year-old shot now enjoys the challenge of blowing a new life in the North-East club that now sits in third place in the first division, three levels from the top.
He moved to Sunderland this summer after returning St. Mirren to the Scottish Premier League in the last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I was injured on my knee and that was the end of it,” Ross told Sportsound at BBC Scotland.
“But I grew up watching Scotland a lot in Hampden with my dad, as a child, and there’s always something that has pulled me back.
But that opportunity would only be given if I did well to train the division.”
Ross' predecessors as coaches Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The club’s former coach Alloa Athletic said there was no fear of following in the footsteps of such famous names at such a large club, but he had previously denied coaching positions at Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“As usual, I’ll measure my success by thinking, ‘Can I bring this club back to the Premier League?’
This club is in a double-crossing home in the Premier League because of its structure and facilities," he said.
“It’s not an easy job to get him there, but I’d probably just look at myself as a success here if I got the club back up there.”
Ross has only three years of experience as a coach, after a period of being an assistant coach at Dumbarton and 15 months as part of a coaching career for Hearts.
He then helped Alloa recover from falling into the third division, and turned St Mirren, who was about to fall into a division, into a divisional army officer the following season.
Ross claims to be more confident now, but he was once on his playing career with Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“It was probably a real time game,” he says of the season when he became coach Alloa.
“I really believed that the coaching job suited me, even more so than playing.
It sounds strange, because I went well, I had decent income from it and enjoyed moderate success.
But change can be difficult.
You have to go through a lot every week.
I’m still going through it in terms of stress and pressure from work, but the coaching job just seems right for me.
I always wanted to train and now I do, I’ve never felt better with myself in all my adult years.”

The best time for beer is at 5.30 p.m. on Saturdays, according to a survey
The heatwave this summer has been a hit for the British bar that owns the bass, but increased pressure on the restaurant chains.
Sales in pubs and bars increased by 2.7 per cent in July, while sales in restaurants decreased by 4.8 per cent, according to figures.
Peter Martin, from the CGA business consultancy, which compiled the figures, said: “Continuous sunshine and unexpected success of England in the world cup meant that July followed similar patterns and the month of June, when the bar sales increased by 2.8 percent, except what restaurants sold even less.
The sale fell by 1.8 percent at restaurants in June and worsened again in July.
The pubs and bars, which are mainly aimed at drinking, stood for a long time with more excitement while restaurants went down.
Pöbbar who sold food also had a hard time in the sun, but not as much as restaurants.
It seems that people just wanted to go out to drink.
Sales of drinks in pubs and bars increased by 6.6 per cent per month, while food sales decreased by three per cent.
Paul Newman, an analyst at RSM, said: “These results are continuing on the fluctuation that we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of important social events or sporting events are still the biggest factors when it comes to sales at markets outside the home.
It comes as no surprise that restaurants are still in trouble, although sales declines of 4.8 percent between months are particularly painfully above ongoing pressures due to cost.
This long and hot summer could hardly come at a worse time for food outlets and only time will reveal whether tempering temperatures, as we have had in August, will improve the situation."
The total sales growth for pubs and restaurants, including newly opened venues, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting how the openings can be made.
Coffer Peach Tracker, the UK-based monitoring company with sales in the pub and restaurant industry, collects and analyzes data from 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion and is the industry benchmark for the industry.
One in five children has secret accounts on social media that they hide from their parents.
One in five children, up to 11 years old, have secret accounts on social media that they hide from their parents and teachers, according to survey results.
Survey that reached 20,000 students showed an increase in “gervi Insta” pages
The news has raised concerns that sexual content is being published
Twenty percent of students say they have a “primary” account they show parents
One in five children, up to 11 years old, create secret accounts on social media that they keep secret from adults.
A survey of up to 20,000 students showed a large increase in “gervi Insta” accounts – which is a reference to the Instagram website.
The news has raised concerns about sexual content being published.
Twenty percent of students said they had a clean “primary” account to show parents, as well as having secret accounts.
One mother, who fell down on her 13-year-old daughter’s secret website, found a youngster who encouraged others to “need me.”
The study, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and HMC, showed that 40 percent of children aged 11-18 had two accounts and half of them admitted to having secret accounts.
Mike Buchanan, chairman of HMC, said: “It’s a concern that so many young people are tempted to create an area online where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the “voice of athletes” on the Scottish Athletics Sports Committee
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Scottish Athletics Committee as a non-executive executive officer at the Annual General Meeting of the Board.
Doyle is Scotland’s most successful free-at-risk athlete and Ian Beattie, the chairman of the committee said the nomination would be a great opportunity for those who led the sport to benefit from her extensive experience in the international arena over the past decade.
“Eilidh enjoys great respect within sports communities in Scotland, the UK and internationally, and we are confident that sports in Scotland would benefit a great deal from getting it on the committee,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I am very interested in speaking on behalf of athletes and hope that I can make my mark and help lead the sport forward in Scotland.”
The American, who won the 200-metre and 400-metre race at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, but has a total of four Olympic golds, and is now a regular visitor to the BBC, was paralyzed after having a short-term hemorrhage.
He wrote on Twitter: “One month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time would tell if I was going to normalize and then how much.
It’s been a tough job, but I got back to normal, learned to walk again and do sports exercises today!
Thank you for your encouragement!”
Breastfeeding advertising, which compares mothers with cows, causes an online dispute
A company that manufactures breast pumps is now discussed online for advertisements bearing lactating mothers with milked cows.
The company Elvie published an advertisement to mark the launch of what is said to be “the world’s first silent breast pump that can be worn outside”. The advertisement is inspired by music videos and should show the freedom that the new pump provides to mothers who are breast-feeding children.
Four real mothers dance in a pile full of hay and cuddle with a song with lyrics such as: “Yes, I’m milking myself, but you don’t see a tail on me” and “If you didn’t notice it, it’s not juggling, but the breasts on me.”
“Pump, pump, I feed the children, pump, pump, pump, I pump milk out of the julls.”
However, the advertisement, which appears on the company’s Facebook page, has caused a stir online.
The video has 77,000 views and hundreds of reviews and has received a mixed response from viewers, who say many people liked it with the “wrinkle” that comes with the milk industry.
“A really bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Just as we do, they need to become calfish and bear to produce milk, except what the calves are taken from them just a few days after they are born," he said.

Another viewer wrote: “Very difficult for both mother and child.
But yes, why not use them to advertise breast pump for mothers who get to keep their children?"
Another added: “This advertisement is completely out of date.”
Others came to the defense of the ad and one woman admitted that the aspect of the song was “absolutely funny.”
“I think it’s a great idea.
I would have bought this if I still had a baby.
I felt like a cow when I was pumping milk.
The advertisement is a bit crazy, but I took it as it is.
“It’s great,” one of the audience wrote.
Another said: “This is a fun advertisement that’s directed to mothers who pump milk (often at work or inside the toilet) and feel like “cougar.”
This is not an advertisement that praises or condemns the dairy industry.”
At the end of the advertisement, the women’s group shows that they have all been dancing with their breasts hidden in their chests.
The idea behind the advertising campaign is based on the fact that many women say they feel like cows when they pump milk from themselves.
However, the Elvie pump is completely silent, has no wires or wires and comfortably fits down into the chest, which gives women the freedom to move, hold on to their baby and even go out while they pump.
Ana Balarin, co-owner and head of Mother, said: “The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a prominent presentation that would make a mention.
By mimicking women we cows, we wanted to direct the spotlight to the breast pump and all its challenges, and even show in a fun and familiar way how much freedom the new pump would provide.
This is not the first time Elvie Pumpan has come to the news.
During the fashion week in London, two children’s mother appeared at a fashion show for the designer Martu Jakubowski, while she was using the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children quietly moved to camp next to Texas border
The number of immigrant children in custody has suddenly increased even though the number of those who cross the border monthly has remained somewhat the same. Part of the reason is that harsh speeches and policies that the Trump administration has put forward have made it more difficult to bring the children into temporary fostering.
Usually, the foster parents have been unregistered immigrants themselves, and have been afraid to put their chances of staying in the country at risk, by offering to foster a child.
The risk increased in June, when public authorities announced that potential foster parents and other adults within the home would have to present fingerprints, and that the data would be shared with the immigration inspectorate.
Last week, Matthew Albence, head of immigration and customs control, testified in front of the Department of the Elderly, saying his institution had arrested a number of people who applied to foster single children.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested were not on a criminal record.
Nearly 80 percent of those who are either foster parents or inside a home that fosters children are illegal in the country, and much of them are illegal immigrants on the criminal record.
“That’s why we continue to look for those individuals,” said Mr. Albence.
In an attempt to speed up the child's proceedings, representatives reported new rules requiring some of the children to appear in court within a month of their detention, rather than after 60 days, which were the previous criteria, according to staff working in the response.
Many of them will attend a video meeting, rather than in person, to give reasons for their legal status before judges in immigration matters.
The children who are convicted of being unfit for entry into the country are sent out of the country quickly.
The longer children are in custody, the more likely they will be to become anxious or depressed, which may lead to violent tendencies or refugee attempts, according to employees of the responses and reports published by the system in recent months.
Speakers said these problems were even more likely in a larger institution than in Tornillo, where no one is likely to notice even though a child has a hard time, because of how many they are.
They added that the transport of the children to the tent city without giving enough time to prepare them spiritually or to say goodbye to friends could increase the shock that many of them are already struggling with.
Syria says U.S., France, and Turkey will withdraw immediately
Walid al-Moualem, the foreign minister, also said in his speech at the UN General Assembly that Syrian refugees should return home, even though the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also plays the role of Deputy Prime Minister, said that the foreign military was illegal in Syria, under the false pretext that they were fighting terrorism, and that “they will be treated accordingly.”
“They have to retire immediately and without any conditions,” he told the parliament.
Moualem said the “war on terrorism was almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have had to flee their homes.
He said Damascus would continue “to wage this holy struggle until we clear all Syrian territories” of both terrorist groups and “all illegal foreign parties.”
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, with most of them training and advising both Kurdish soldiers and Syrian Arabs who are fighting against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops in this war-torn country.
Regarding refugee issues, Moualem said conditions were good enough for them to return and he taught “some Western countries” to “spread out unfounded fears” that encouraged refugees to stay away.
“We have called on international society and humanitarian organizations to facilitate their return,” he said.
“They’re creating politics out of something that should be a mere humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not provide any funding for reconstruction in Syria unless there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
The UN says that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a neutral area at the last major stronghold of the opposition has created an opportunity to continue political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevented a major attack by Syrian troops supported by Russians, in the region where three million people live.
On the other hand, Moualem stressed that the agreement had “clear finality” and expressed hope that military action would be directed toward jihadists, including Nusra Front fighters, who are linked to Al-Qaeda, and that they would “be exterminated.”
Staffan de Mistura, UN ambassador, hopes to be able to attend the first meetings with a new committee composed of members of the government and the opposition, to draw up a constitution for Syria after the war and pay the way for elections.
Moualem put forward the conditions for the Syrian government’s participation in the committee, saying that her work should be limited to “exceeding the provisions of the current government,” and warned against all interventions.
The reason why Trump will win another election
According to that rationale, Mr. Trump would win the re-elections in 2020, unless the indictment and scandal ended his presidential campaign, as many liberal viewers are likely to hope for.
In what would certainly be “the most dramatic end to the presidency ever!”
As is the case with the audience, there is no fatigue.
Since 2014, the best-time viewership has more than doubled to 1.05 million at CNN, and nearly tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at its best, which is an increase from 1.7 million viewers four years ago, according to Nielsen, and the show MSNBC, “The Rachel Maddow Show” has topped the audience with up to 3.5 million viewers at key news nights.
“It’s a fire that people are attracted to, because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Baer, ABC’s director of the “Designated Survivor” drama about a government employee who becomes president after the parliament is destroyed in an attack.

There is entertainment in the chaos.
However, unlike what is shown on television, the stories from Washington could determine the fate of Roe v. Wade, whether families of immigrants can be united and the health of the international economy.
Only the viewers who enjoy the greatest privileges have the ability to stop watching.
And yet, this is more than being an informed citizen when one looks at the sixth time at a group of experts arguing the use of Bob Woodwards on “closer” sources for his book “Fear,” or $15,000 jacket from a stretcher that Paul Manafort was wearing (“a little bit of Trump fed with horror,” the Washington Post said.)
I will never see Super Mario again.
“A part of what he does to an abusive person feels this is like a reality show, is that he gives a person something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and author of the episodes “Pawn Stars,” as he discussed the workforce in Trump’s show and daily changes to the storyline.
You can't miss a single episode, or you'll lose the thread.
When I contacted Mr. Fleiss, 26 degrees of heat and sunshine were outside his home on the north coast of Kauai, but he stayed indoors and watched the MSNB while he was recording CNN.
He could not get away with it, not when Brett Kavanaugh was to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was imminent.
“I remember when we were creating all these crazy elements in the old days and people said, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilizations,’” Mr. Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turned out that people were right.”

Money outside flow in the narrowest elections of the mid-term
It is no surprise that the 17th district of Pennsylvania sees the money flowing to it, thanks to the reorganisation of the electoral districts that led to two representatives competing for the same seat.
The newly reorganized Pittsburg area is sending out Democrat Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another electoral district in special elections last summer.
Lamb presents himself to fellow Republican Keith Rothfus, who is now the representative of the old 12th electoral district in Pennsylvania, who is racing a lot towards the new 17th electoral district.
The maps of the electoral districts were reorganized after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old electoral districts were organized for the benefit of the Republicans and that it violates the Constitution.
The competition in the new 17th election area has been the start of a competition in the financing of electoral campaigns between the main funding bodies of both categories, the Democratic Electoral Committee (DCCC) and the Electoral Committee of the Republicans (NRCC).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after the nave won a special election in March for the 18th electoral district of Pennsylvania, many of which followed suit.
The Republicans had previously held that seat for more than a decade, and Donald Trump, the president, won the election with 20 points.
Political experts have given a bit of an edge to the democrats.
The U.S. is planning to punish El Salvador for its support of China, but it has since stopped.
The Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with Juan Carlos Varela, President of Panama in June 2017 and stayed at a hotel in Panama until the co-owners ran the Trump administration team away.
Representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs decided to call back the U.S. ambassador to El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of “a recent decision to no longer recognise T<0xC3><0xA6>van,” said Heather Nauert, the ministry’s spokesperson in the statement early this month.
However, penalties were only considered against El Salvador, which is estimated to have received $140 million from the United States for relief efforts in 2017, including drug surveillance, development efforts and economic support.
The penalties imposed and included, among other things, a reduction in financial support and restrictions on the issue of residence permits would have been painful for the Central American country, where high levels of unemployment and murder rates are high.
As in-house meetings continued, U.S. and Central American representatives postponed the Security and Economic Success Conference and were to follow a similar agreement held last year that was considered a step forward in actions to prevent people from moving to the United States.
But in mid-September, representatives from the top ranks made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, and thus ended all the inconsistencies about the punishment against El Salvador.
Mike Pence, vice president, is now going to address the conference, which is due to take place in mid-October, which is a sign of how important it is in the eyes of the government, the archivists said.
The three U.S. ambassadors also quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic, with no new hard messages or punishments from Washington.
The White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton refused to discuss further the discussions described by the three U.S. representatives, including two mercenaries, who agreed to discuss the housing regimes against being anonymous.
Their descriptions were confirmed by an external analyst who works closely with the board and also talked about the issue of anonymity.
Learn the story
The next scandal could be a report by Robert Mueller, a special prosecutor, on the possible actions of Mr. Trump to obstruct justice, but for that accusation there is a variety of public evidence.
It is also said that Mr. Mueller is also turning his investigation into whether Mr. Trump’s election campaign has worked with Russia in its attack on our elections.
If the parliament is to be governed by a different party, Trump might have to be responsible for it, in the sense that he is prepared to meet his constituents again, and, if necessary, the jury ordered his peers.
However, this is very uncertain and I do not want to argue that Trump’s fall is unequivocal, nor does his colleague in Europe.
We all need to choose, both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect how long the battle will be.
In 1938, German officials were ready to rob Hitler of power, only if Western countries had given him the resistance and brief Czechoslovakian in Munich.
We missed it and missed the opportunity to avoid the painful years that followed.
The story revolves around such important points and faster or tardy for the unstoppable progress of democracy.
The United States is facing a number of such important issues now.
What do we do if Mr. Trump runs Rod Rosenstein State Prosecutor, the man in charge of the fate of Mr. Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a bad position since this magazine reported that last year he had proposed to make secret recordings of the president and discussed whether he was unfit for office.
Mr. Rosenstein says the news from the Times is not right.
“How will we respond if the FBI’s recent investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not thorough or fair, or if he is confirmed in the seat of the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual harassment and dishonesty?
And above all, will we elect a parliament in the mid-term that will let Mr. Trump shoulder responsibility?
If we fall on these tests, democracy will have to endure long winters.
But I don’t think we will fall, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia and was sent to Auschwitz by the same Nazi government and was previously in my embassy residence.
She survived, moved to the United States, and 60 years later she sent me to light the Sabbath candles on the table with the crochet cross.
With such a legacy, how can I but look positive to our future?”

Graham Dorrans, Rangers team, vision for the game against Rapid Vienna
Rangers will receive Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that the victory against the Austrians will put them in a strong position to emerge from the G-Group of the European Union. Rangers made an impressive tie in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month.
Injury on the knee prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from playing his first game of the season until in the game against Villareal which ended with 2-2 tie, but he believes Rangers can take advantage of the results as a stepping stone for better results.
“It was good to get this score for us, because Villarreal is a strong team,” said Dorrans, 31 years old.
“We started the game in the belief that we could achieve something and ended up taking one point.
Perhaps we could have achieved victory at the end, but in the overall view it was probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we got stronger in the second half and played better.
Thursday is another important night for the European Union.
Hopefully we can reach three levels but it will be a difficult game because they went well in their last game. But with viewers who support us I am sure we will endure this and get a positive result.
Last year was difficult, both because of my injuries and the changes that took place in the club itself, but now there is a good feeling on the spot.
The team is good and the boys enjoy their training, the training is good.
Hopefully we can move forward now, put the last season behind us and achieve success.”
Women lose sleep because of fear of losing their retirement savings
While the participants in the survey had a clear idea of how they wanted to take care of themselves, few spoke to their family members about it.
About half of the individuals in the Nationwide survey said they talked to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they were talking to their children.
“People want a family member to do it, but it doesn’t take the right steps to have those conversations,” said Holly Snyder, deputy director of the National Insurance Department.
This is how to start.
Talk to your partner and children: You can’t prepare your family to provide care if you don’t make your wishes light up with good care.
Talk to your counselor and family about where and when you receive care, because these options can change a lot in terms of cost.
Get your financial advisor involved: Your advisor can also help you find a way to pay for this expense.
Among the options you have to pay for long-term care are traditional life insurance with long-term care, blended life insurance that pays out in cash, to help pay costs, or self-insurance with your own money – as long as you own it.
Prepare all legal documents: Prevent legal disputes in advance.
Get responsible for your health care so that you can appoint someone you trust to oversee your health care and ensure that your health care staff attend to your wishes if you can’t express them directly yourself(s).
Also consider getting a procurator for your finances.
You would choose someone you trust to make financial decisions on your behalf and make sure that your accounts are paid if you can’t do it yourself.
Don’t forget the details: Imagine that your elderly father or mother is in an emergency and is on their way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medication and allergies?
Give this information exactly in writing so that you are ready.
“It’s not just about the finances, it’s also about who the doctors are,” Martin said.
“What are the drugs?
Who will take care of the dog?
“Be prepared for that plan.”
Man shot multiple times with air gun in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air gun while he was on his way home walking after being out for fun.
The victim was a man in his fifties and was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Representatives describe the shooting, which occurred at 2:30 a.m. to British local time, as a “random attack.”
The victim did not see her attacker.
The man was not injured in a life-threatening manner, and the police called for witnesses.
Earthquakes and floods in Indonesia
At least 384 people died after a powerful earthquake and flood in the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, and the number of dead is expected to rise.
Since all communications are down, aid workers have been unable to provide any information from Donggala County, which is an area north of Palu and is located near the centre of the earthquake, which was 7.5 on Richter.
More than 16,000 people were left home in Palu after the disaster raged.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi region and is located at the bottom of a narrow river on the western coast of the island of Sulawesi. The estimated number of inhabitants was 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and the flood were set.
Donggala is a county that covers more than 380 km of coastline in the northwest part of the island of Sulawesi.
The county, which is the administrative area of the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main industries in the Central Sulawesi region, especially in the coastal area of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the region, but most of them are in Morowali, which is on the beach opposite Sulawesi.
Floods have washed up on Palu and Donggala several times in the last century, according to the Indonesian Disaster Agency.
In 1938, more than 200 people died when a flood struck and hundreds of homes in Donggala were destroyed.
In 1996, there was also a flood in the western part of Donggala, where nine people died.
Indonesia sits on the active estuary of the Pacific and there are earthquakes on a regular basis.
Here are the major earthquakes and floods of recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the western coast of the Aceh region in northern Sumatru raged on 26 December and triggered a flood to hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coastline, of which more than half were in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong quakes crossed the western coast of Sumatru in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people leave their lives on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatru.
2006: Earth quaked at 6.8 on Richter riding across the southern part of Jövu, the most populous island of Indonesia, and caused a flood to hit the south coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: Earthquake at 7.6 on Richter crossed near the city of Padang, which is the capital of the region in western Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: Earthquake at 7.5 on Richter raged across one of the Mentawai islands, near Sumotoru, and raised up to 10 meters of high flood waves that destroyed the number of villages and killed around 300 people.
2016: Ground earthquake raged over the Pidie Jaya county in Aceh, causing destruction and aggravation as people remembered the devastation in the deadly earthquake and flood in 2004.
No floods were formed this time, but over 100 lives were destroyed.
2018: Large earthquakes rage across the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia and over 500 people died, mainly on the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed hundreds of buildings and thousands of tourists were trapped on the island temporarily.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of Sarauh Palin, former Alaskan governor and presidential candidate, has been arrested on charges of a physical assault.
Palin, 29 years old and from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, in an attempt to prevent domestic violence and counter-attacks, according to a report by the Alaska State Police, which was published on Saturday.
According to the police report, Palin took the phone from her friend when she tried to call the police to report suspected crimes.
Palin is held at the Mat-Su station where he waits for a hearing, and he is held against 500 dollars of insurance, according to news from KTUU.
He was brought to trial on Saturday, declaring that he was “not guilty, potty-proof” when asked to declare a crime or innocence, according to the news agency.
Palin is charged with three offences in category A, which means that he could be sentenced to imprisonment for up to one year and had to pay $250,000 in fines.
He has also been charged with Class B crimes, which is punishable by one day in prison and 2,000 dollars in fines.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently pending before the Alaska Data Protection Tribunal.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, preventing domestic violence and carrying weapons under the influence of alcohol in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claimed to have slapped him in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by groups of surrenderers in 2016 after she learned of a terrorist attack on her son’s violent behavior, following his military service in Iraq.
Earthquakes and floods in Indonesia: hundreds killed
At least 384 people died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The earthquake, which was 7.5 on Richter, triggered a flood and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electrical and communication systems are down and the number of dead is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck right in the middle of Sulawesi Island, northeast of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
Videos that show when the incident happened are now circulating on social media.
Hundreds of people had gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu when the wave of floods hit the beach.
Prosecutors seek rare death penalty for suspected terrorist attack in New York City
Prosecutors in New York want a death penalty over Sayfullo Saipov, who is suspected of participating in a terrorist attack in New York City, which killed eight people. This is a rare punishment that has not been used in the state for violating federal law since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, is believed to have taken a Home Depot truck on rent to attack people on a bike ride along the West Side Highway in the lower part of Manhattan. He went down there walking and cycling road users in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the defendants must prove that Saipov killed the victim eight “willingly” and caused serious bodily harm “willingly”, according to the declaration of the will to apply the death penalty, which was registered in the Southern District Court in New York.
Both of these defendants can lead to possible death sentences, according to the court document.
Many weeks after the attack, Saipov's federal court charged 22 teams, including eight charges of murder for criminal purposes, which are usually used by prosecutors in charges of organized crime. Also, Saipov was charged with violent crime and for destroying the vehicle.
The attack included “countable planned planning,” the prosecutors said, describing Sapiov’s actions as “terrible, cruel, and immoral.”
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov was chosen to be a victim of injury, injury and loss to family and friends Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," the statement said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It’s been a decade since the southern region of New York took the last death penalty to treat.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The death sentence was last carried out in New York City in 1953, against Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, married after being convicted of spying for the Soviets in the Cold War two years earlier.
The couple were both killed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, who was born in Uzbekistan, showed no evidence of repentance in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators that he was fine with what he had done, police said.
Saipov told authorities that he had gotten the idea of the attack after watching videos from ISIS on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also asked to show ISIS the flag in his hospital room, police said.
He has pleaded guilty to all 22 charges.
David Patton, one of Saipov’s public defenders, said they were “of course disappointed” by the decision of the prosecution.
“We believe that the decision to request a death penalty instead of accepting a life-time prison sentence without the possibility of an experiential solution will only prolong the shock caused by this event for all concerned,” Patton said.
Saipov's defenders had previously asked prosecutors not to seek a death penalty.
A member of the Conservative Party said that NIGEL FARAGE should lead negotiations on Brexit.
Nigel Farage promised to “activate the people’s army” today at the protest of the conservatives’ conference.
This former leader, Ukip, said that politicians should “find pressure” from EU doubters, at the same time as one of Theresu May’s MPs suggested that he should lead the negotiations with the EU.
Peter Bone told the Birmingham protest that the UK would “go out” if Mr. Farage were the leader of Brexit.
But May’s challenge to settle a deep dispute between her own team members was even more evident when conservatives, who want to remain in the EU, took part in other protests against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep Chequers' plan on the right track and is under criticism from those who are favored by Brexit, those who are opposed, and the EU.
Ally said she will continue to fight to reach an agreement with Brussels despite opposition – forcing those opposed to Brexit and the Workers’ Party to choose between her plan and “disarmament”.
Mr Bone told Leave Means Leave the protest walk in Solihull that he wanted to “lose the Chequers plan”.
He suggested that Mr Farage should have been allowed to participate and shoulder responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
“If he were with the government, we’d be out now,” he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: “I will support Brexit, but we have to get rid of the Chequers plan.”
He explained his opposition to the EU and said: “We do not fight in world wars to serve others.
We want to write our own laws in our own country.”
Mr. Bone pointed out that the public’s opinion had changed since the 2016 elections: “The idea that the British public had changed their views and wanted to remain silent is totally untrue.”
Andrea Jenkyns, a longtime Brexit supporter, also attended the rally and told reporters: “I just want to say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers program is unpopular among the general public and the opposition will not vote with it. It enjoys the unpopularity among our peers and the actions that are on the streets outside and choose us.
Do it, stop the Chequers plan and start listening."
In a message to May, she added: “Presidents hold the job when they keep their promises.”
Mr Farage said that the politicians would have to “get pressure” if they tried to evade the decision taken following the 2016 referendum.
“This is now about trust between us – the people – and our political party,” he said.
“They want to try to betray Brexit and we’re here today to say to them, ‘We won’t let you get away with this.’
He added in his message to the crowd: “I want you to let your political party, which is about to betray Brexit, feel pressure.
“We are running a public army in this country that gave us victory in Brexit and we will never rest until we become independent, self-governing, proud Great Britain.”
At the same time, EU supporters held a protest walk in Birmingham which ended with a two-hour protest meeting in the city centre.
A small group of activists waved the fighters against Brexit after the group was set up this weekend.
Adonis L<0xC3><0xA1>vard, a member of the Workers’ Party, made jokes that keepers for security issues that came up in the party’s telephone directory when the conference was opened.
“These are the people who tell us that it can have all the computer systems in place and all the technology for Canada plus, for borderless, for free trade with Ireland without border,” he added.
“It’s a complete scandal.
“There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he said.
Warren is going to “consider seriously” to present himself to the presidency.
Elizabeth Warren, a U.S. senator, said he was planning to “consider a serious offer to the presidency” after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat talked about his future at a rally in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who has infrequently criticized Donald Trump’s U.S. president, is appealing for re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was co-director of Trump’s 2016 Massachusetts election campaign.
She has been the centerpiece of the infamous idea that she could stand up to Trump in 2020.
The meeting in Holyoke on Saturday was her 36th meeting in the form of a civil meeting with residents in her constituency, since Trump took office.
One of her colleagues asked her if she wanted to run for president.
Warren replied that it was time for “women to go to Washington and take care of our government, and then a woman also needs to be a leader.”
Arrest after fatal attack on Sims from LSU
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, reported Saturday that she had arrested one suspect in the case of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims, but he was shot to death on Friday.
Police in Baton Rouge reported on the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, aged 20, at a news conference at 11 a.m.
She had previously posted a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help to identify a person who was seen on the recording.
Sims, aged 20, was shot to death near Southern University early on Friday.
“Wayde Sims got a gunshot wound to his head and died from it,” Murphy J. Paul, a police officer, told the media on Saturday, according to news from 247sports.
Wayde came to the defense of his friends and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to having been on the scene, with weapons in his sacrifice, and admitted to having shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested and detained by the Baton Rouge Police Department.
Sims was two metres tall and grew up in Baton Rouge, he played in 32 games, of which 10 in the starting team in the last season and played an average of 17.4 minutes, scoring 5.6 points and achieving 2.9 goals in each game.
Grand Prix in Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world championship after Sebastian Vettel gives him the victory seat after a command from their team.
It was evident from the time that Valtteri Bottas took a seat in front of Lewis Hamilton for the start of Saturday, that orders from the Mercedes team would play a big part in the race.
Bottas got a good start at the start and left Hamilton almost behind as he defended his position in the first two bends and ordered Vettel to fight against his teammates.
Vettel first entered the pit and allowed Hamilton to drive into the traffic at the end of the group, which should have been able to handle the results.
The Mercedes car went into the pit one round later and came out after Vettel, but Hamilton emerged from a series of battles in which the driver of Ferrari was forced to leave the inside of the pit after having been at risk of being left behind, after defensive attempts at the third turn.
Max Verstappen started in the group and was in seventh place at the end of the first round, on his 21st birthday.
He then led the majority of the race he is delayed to change tires to try to finish quickly and progress from Kimi Raikkonen to reach fourth place.
He finally went to the pit in the 44th round but could not increase the speed of the eight remaining rings, and Raikkonen took fourth place.
This is a difficult day because Valtteri stood up beautifully all weekend and was a true gentleman to let me out.
The team has done a great job of achieving this success,” Hamilton said.
It was a really bad exercise.
US President Donald Trump made a joke at a meeting of U.S. Attorney General Dianne Feinstein on Saturday, on the grounds that she had not read the letter from Christine Blasey Ford, accusing Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court’s nominee, of sexual harassment.
The president spoke at a meeting in West Virginia, but did not directly address Ford's testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee. Instead, he said that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were "wrong and cruel and untrue."
“The only thing that could happen and the wonderful thing that has been going on in the last few days in the Senate, when one sees the anger, when one sees people who are angry and hurt and cruel and untruthful,” he said.
“When you see the lights and the leaks and then they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, do you like this?
Remember her answer... you nailed the document - "Oh, yeah, what?
Oh, no.
I don’t paint it.”
Wait a minute, slow down.
Let's... No, we're not leaking it," he said, slashing after the Senate.
The letter was sent to Feinstein in July, where the allegations of Ford against Kavanaugh were made, and was therefore leaked early in September. Feinstein denied that the leak had come from her office.
“I don’t hide the accusations of Dr. Ford, I don’t close her story,” Feinstein told the committee, according to a news report from The Hill.
“She asked me to keep it in faith and I did what she asked me to do.”
But her denial didn’t seem to go well down to the president, who said at the meeting on Saturday: “I’ll tell you, this was really a bad physical appearance.
Maybe it didn’t work, but it was the worst physical appearance I’ve ever seen.”
The president continued his defense of Brett Kavanaugh, who has been charged with sexual harassment by three women, and argued that Democrats were taking advantage of the allegations.
“They are determined to regain power, no matter what methods need to be applied.
You see the cruel, the wicked, the ones who hurt, the ones who have to choose to gain power and control,” the president said, according to a news report from Mediaite.
Elite League Division: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars added to their loss on Friday in the Elite League division against the Belfast Giants, winning in the next game, 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants won an early two-point lead by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie equalized for the locals, but Dwyer then came back across the Giants.
Francois Bouchard averaged for Dundee and two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen then secured their victory.
This was the third loss in the season for Adam Keefe in the Elite League division, but it had won Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
This was the fourth game between the teams during the season, and the Giants had won the game three before.
Dwyer scored the first goal in the fourth minute at 3.35 a.m., following a support broadcast from Kendall McFaull. David Rutherford then came with a support broadcast when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
There was a lot going on in the first few minutes and Sullivan came back into the game when the clock showed 13.10 and Cownie then averaged after a support broadcast from Matt Marquardt in fifteen minutes.
Dwyer made sure to bring the Giants over by half when he scored his second goal in the game at the end of the first game third.
The home team got together and Bouchard returned to the finish line when they were one man in the 27th minute of the second game.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran teamed up and helped Nielsen bring Dundee over for the first time in the game late in the second season and he secured his team's fifth goal when half of the last season was over.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, will face Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controllers take their lives to ensure that hundreds of passengers in a plane escape the earthquake
Indonesia’s air traffic controller has been hailed as a hero after he left his life to ensure that a plane with hundreds of passengers could take on the air whole and keep.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a major earthquake raged over the island of Sulawesi on Friday and started a flood following.
Large aftershocks continue to ravage the area and many are trapped under the ruins of the city of Palu.
The 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave, even though his associates had fled the administrative tower that swung violently at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He was about to rest to ensure that the Batik Air aircraft number 6321, which was on the runway when the earthquake crossed, could safely take off.
He then jumped out of the control tower when he thought he was crashing.
He later died in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, a spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said his decision may have saved hundreds of lives, according to news from ABC News in Australia.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to transport it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“We are very sad to hear this,” he added.
Authorities fear that the number of dead could exceed a thousand, according to the country’s disaster agency, access is limited to the towns of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
“The number of dead is still rising because many bodies are still under rubble and cannot be reached,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the agency’s spokesman.
Up to six metres of high tides have caused a massive destruction in Palu, where mass landslides will be held on Sunday.
The army and passenger aircraft work to bring relief data and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute a car comes with a body.
There is little about clean water.
The small markets have been robbed everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said in an interview with CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is competing to find survivors but we don’t know what they will find there.
It’s already a tragedy, but it could get worse.”
Joko Widodo, President of Indonesia, came to Palu on Sunday and told the country’s army: “I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the deportation.
“Are you ready?” said CNN.
Earlier this year, earthquakes swept across Lombok, Indonesia, killing more than 550 people.
Flight crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says the same thing is missing after a plane crashed into a ion
The airline, which had a plane that crashed into a mine in Micronesia, now says one person is missing, having previously said that all 47 passengers and crew had been rescued from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that as of late on Saturday, it did not know about the performance of a male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately answer questions about further information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Boats in the area helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water when she tried to land at the airport on Chuuk Island.
On Friday, officials said seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in hospital on Saturday and that their condition was stable.
It is still unclear what caused the accident and what the exact sequence of events was.
The airline and the US Navy both said the plane had landed in the lagoon just before the runway.
Some people thought the plane had gone too far over the runway.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said the plane’s approach had been very low.
“It was really good,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that he and others were able to water the mid-deep water and come to emergency exits on the sinking plane.
He said the flight attendants had been frightened and screaming and that he had suffered minor head injuries.
The U.S. Navy said that seafarers who were at work short of making up a pier also helped with the rescue by using an inflatable boat to transport people ashore, before the plane sank into about 30 meters of deep water.
Data from the Agency show that 111 people have been killed in a plane crash over the last two decades, none of which were related to Air Niugini.
An expert describes the timeline of the evening that a woman was burned alive
Prosecutors filed their case on Saturday in reopening a case against a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an expert from the U.S. Department of Justice, was in the courtroom for several hours as an expert in the field of information analysis.
He explained to the court how he used cell phone records to pull together the journeys of the accused, 29-year-old Quinton Tellis, and 19-year-old victim, Jessicu Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said she received location data from several mobile phones showing Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, across from his previous claims, according to news from The Clarion Ledger.
When data showed that his cell phone was with Chamber at the same time he said he had been with his friend, Michael Sanford, police went to Sanford to talk to him.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he had not been in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he had been in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said it was "a lie, because my car was in Nashville."
Another disagreement was that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks before she died.
The police said they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that sometime after Chambers' death, Tellis had deleted text messages, phone calls, and her contact information from her phone.
“He took her out of his life,” Hale said.
It is estimated that the owners will move their final speech on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the case to be brought before the court later that day.
The High Breed: What is Conscious Hip Hop?
Hipp hop trio wants to fight against negative opinion of the music genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, argues that hip hop has removed its origins as it contained political messages and discussed social issues.
They want to search the origins again and make conscious hip hop hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently seen a boom in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
New York foetuses legal couple for expulsion after “prejudiced” text message
New York’s foetuses legalized her for illegal removal after she received an unexpected text message from her mother complaining that she was “another black person.”
The couple therefore refuses to be prejudiced and compares the lawsuit to “rejection.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a two-child mother, expressed dissatisfaction when she found out that her new foster, Giselle Maurice, was black when she was able to work for the first time in 2016.
‘NEEEEIIIIII OTHERS BLACK HUMAN’, Mrs Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
But instead of sending the message to her husband, she sent them twice to Mrs. Maurice.
After discovering her mistake, Plasco-Flaxman, a former nurse, told the New York Post that she had been ill, and that she had expected to have a Filipino wife.
Ms. Maurice was paid for one working day and then sent home in an Uber car.
Maurice now legalizes the couple and wants to receive compensation for the termination, up to $350 a day for the six-month job she had originally been hired for, although no contract was signed.
“I wanted to show them that you shouldn’t do that,” she told Post on Friday, adding, “I know this is discrimination.”
The wives have objected to the allegations that they are prejudiced and say that it was the right thing to do to expel Maurice, because they felt that they could not trust her after insulting her.
“My wife sent her a message she didn’t want to say.
She's not prejudiced.
We are not a damned people," husband Joel Plasco told Post.
“But who would trust their children for someone after having shown their respective drowsiness, even if it was surprising?
His newborn son?
Don't be like that."
Plasco likened the lawsuit to “recovery,” and said his wife had come seven months on the way and was in “extremely difficult circumstances.”
“Are you going to attack someone in this situation?”
It’s not very beautifully done,” said Plasco, who works in the investment industry.
The matter is still before the court, but the public has spoken harshly about the couple on social media and shamed it for their behavior and reasoning.
Paddington’s publishers feared that readers might find it difficult to even talk to a bear, says a new letter.
Karen Jankel, Bond’s daughter, who was born shortly after the book was approved, said of the letter: “It’s hard to put yourself in the footsteps of someone who reads it for the first time before it was released.
“It’s very funny now that we know of Paddington’s tremendous success.”
She said that her father, who worked as a BBC recording artist before he was inspired to write a children’s book about a small toy bear, had taken the rejection of his work with a calmer positive attitude, adding that the 60th anniversary of the book’s release was “beautiful” after his death last year.
As far as Paddington is concerned, which she describes as “a very important member of the family,” she added that her father had been proud of his success in the end.
“He was a very quiet man and not used to fitting himself,” she said.
“But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child who accomplishes something. You’re proud of it even if you haven’t actually done anything yourself.
I think he somehow looked at Paddington’s success.
Although Paddington was a work of creation and his imagination, he always gave Paddington the honor of himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye through the phone.
When she arrived, her daughter had been transferred to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors did everything in their power to save her life, but without success.
“Nad called me regularly and told me that the situation was very bad, that she wasn’t expected to survive,” said Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then Nad called me and said that she would die within the next two minutes and that I would have to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, my love.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs that the doctors had given her to keep the heart beat up were gradually losing their function and getting out of the body.
She had died a short time ago and this was the body giving up.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing it was all happening.
I couldn’t grow or cry or cry, because I was surrounded by family and other people.
I had to be in control.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who now mourned her dead daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers who knew nothing of the difficulties she experienced.
“Nobody knew anything,” she said.
“I killed my head and tears fell all the time.
It’s hard to explain, but during the flight I found a lot of sympathy with Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Sorrowing women hang up messages to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who had loved ones who committed suicide are now trying to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have set up a message bridge in Wales, with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call and get help.
Tyler, the son of Mrs. Davis, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide when he was 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel like I have to feel every day,” she said.
Ms. Davis is 45 years old and lives in Lydney and said her son had been a successful cook with an infectious smile.
He was known for his smile.
Everyone said that his smile could describe any room."
He stopped working before he died, because he was “sucked down to a very dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old brother found his brother dead after taking his own life.
Ms. Davis said, “I’m constantly worried that it will be the end of it.”
Mrs. Davis made the message “to let people know that it is possible to go and talk to others, even a friend.
Don’t sit and say nothing – you have to talk to someone.”
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been a friend of Mrs. Davies for years, lost his partner to 15 years, shortly after the death of his mother.
“He didn’t talk about him being ill or being depressed or anything like that,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we took on a change in his mood.
He was up at his worst on Christmas Day - when the kids opened their gifts he didn't look in the eyes of them or anything."
She said that his death was a great shock to them, but that they had to recover from it: “This rips a hole in the family.
It divides us.
We have to fight and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs on blueprints as the FBI has its investigation
“I thought that if we could get something similar to what he asked for — a limited-time study and scope — we might get a little bit of a deal,” Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would be “jointly divided” in the middle of a dispute between the parties where everything was in the back seat.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his supporters of the Republican Party not want the FBI to investigate the matter?
Their inertia is due to the timing.
The midterm elections are in just five weeks, on November 6th. If the Republicans go bad, as expected, it weakens their serious attempts to get their man elected to sit in the Supreme Court of the country.
George W. Bush has been calling the Senate to encourage them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush in the White House and met Ashley, his wife through him, but she was a privateer Mr. Bush.
What happens after the FBI releases its investigation report?
The vote will be held at the General Assembly, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats sit as is.
It is not yet certain whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes on the floor of the Senate, but that would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to break up the balance and confirm him in the office of the Supreme Court.
Number of people fleeing North Korea “reminisces” under Kim’s rule
The number of people fleeing North Korea and going to South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean parliamentarian.
Park Byeong victory, testified in data from South Korea's Co-ordinating Council, saying that 1,127 people had fled last year, as of 2706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that stricter border crossings between North Korea and China and higher fees charged by smugglers with people were key factors.
Pyongyang has not issued any official statement.
The vast majority of those fleeing North Korea are invited to receive South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 people from North Korea have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most people flee to China, but it has the longest border with North Korea, and it is easier to cross them rather than the well-maintained neutral area between North and South Korea.
China sees refugees as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often forces them to return to their homeland.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are still at war, technically speaking, have improved considerably over the past month.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks mainly on the postponement of negotiations on nuclear disarmament.
This was after a historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed to work together on the nuclear crisis in Korea.
On Saturday, Ri Yong Ho, North Korea’s foreign minister, however, taught U.S. trade unions about the lack of progress since then.
“Without confidence in the United States, there is no certainty about our country’s security and under such circumstances it is impossible for us to take down our nuclear weapons first,” Ri said in a speech at the U.N. General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh “the mother sick” and says he is unfit to serve as a Supreme Court justice
Nancy Pelosi, the leader of the minority in parliament called Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court’s nominee “the mother sick,” and told him too timidly to be able to work in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi had these words in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t help but think that if a woman had ever died like this, she would have been called a mother’s disease,” Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied the allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
In his opening speech, Kavanaugh was extremely emotional, and sometimes drew close to it shouting and getting cake in his throat when he spoke to his family and school years.
He also publicly condemned Democrats in the committee, calling the charges on him “disgusting and organized genocide” organized by liberals who were angry at Hillary Clinton’s losing the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that Kavanaugh’s testimony proved that he could not work in the Supreme Court, because he showed that he is biased towards the Democrats.
“I think these claims and how he attacked the Clintons and Democrats show that he is incapable of the job,” she said.
Pelosi did not answer when she was asked if she would try to get Kavanaugh fired from work if he is confirmed and if Democrats reach the majority in parliament.
“I’ll say this: if he’s not telling the parliament or the FBI the truth, then he’s not only incompetent to be in the Supreme Court, but also in the court he’s now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is now serving as a judge in the appeals court in Washington, D.C.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh’s possible decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade abortion laws, where he is considered to be a conservative judge.
During the interrogation, Kavanaugh turned away from questions about whether he would reverse certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“It’s no time for a mother’s disease, a biased person to go to the Supreme Court and expect us to say, ‘That’s wonderful,’” Pelosi said.
Women need to use it.
This is a fair word, months and years of rage flow out of it, and it does not come from it without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” said Mrs. Steinem to me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's uncommon, but you?"
She continued, “I got a lot of help from a woman who was managing director somewhere and said she was crying too when she was angry, but she had developed technology so that when she was angry and started to cry, she said to her interviewer, ‘You may think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then she just kept crying.
And I thought it was great.”
Tears are allowed to express anger in part because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories from my previous job in the office with men in the majority, where I started to cry out of a rage that I couldn’t express, an older woman came and grabbed my knee strap. She was a cold boss that I had always feared a little bit and she pulled me into a ladder.
“Don’t ever see me cry,” she said.
They don't know you're a bully.
They think that you are deaf and rejoice because you have been brought in.”
Patricia Schroeder had worked with Gary Hart when he was in the presidential bid, but she was then a Democrat from Colorado.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in the act of exodus on board a ship called Monkey Business (Apaspil) and withdrew his offer, Ms. Schroeder, a full grudge, said there was no reason why she could not consider presenting herself to the President.
“It wasn’t a well-designed decision,” she said laughingly, 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates and the last thing they needed to keep was one more.
Someone named it “White Mountain and the Seven Dwarfs.”
Since the election campaign had gone a long way, she was behind in terms of funding, so she decided not to offer herself unless she was able to collect 2 million dollars.
It was a losing battle.
She found that some of her supporters who gave 1,000 dollars to men gave her only 250 dollars.
“Do they think I’ll get a discount?” she asked.
When she delivered her speech and announced that she would not formally present herself, she was so overcome by feelings - gratitude to the people who had supported her, resentment towards the system, which made it so difficult to raise funds and direct her views to voters instead of representatives, and rushed into the gender gap - that she burst into tears.
“I think I might have had a nerve attack,” said Mrs. Schroeder, recalling how the media reacted.
“I think Kleenex was my supporter.
I remember thinking, what will be written on my bedrock?
"She's crying?"
The reason why trade disputes between the US and China could be good for Beijing
The first shoot-out in the trade war between the United States and China was aggravating, and although the war is far from over, the gap between the countries could be favorable for Beijing for a long time, experts say.
US President Donald Trump shot the first warning shot earlier this year by taxing China’s main export goods, including solar batteries, steel and aluminum.
This week’s biggest valuation came with new tariffs covering products worth $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), and taxing nearly half of all products imported into the United States from China.
Beijing has responded in the same coin each time and recently imposed 5 to 10 percent tariffs on U.S. goods at a value of $60 billion.
China has vowed to respond to US tariffs, and it is unlikely that the world’s second largest economy will be abandoned in the near future.
To get Washington to jump, it would be all too humiliating for Xi Jinping, the president of China to publicly bow down to the United States.
Experts still say that if Beijing holds the right to play, pressure from the trade war with the United States could have a positive effect on China for a long time, by reducing the mutual need of both economies for each other.
“The fact that a quick political decision either in Washington or Beijing could lead to a situation that leads to economic collapse in another country is actually far more dangerous than viewers have previously acknowledged,” said Abigail Grace, a researcher who focuses mainly on Asia at the New American Security Center.
Syria 'ready' to return refugees, foreign minister says
Syria says refugees are ready to return to the country and seek help to rebuild the country, which is now in a bad state after a seven-year war.
Walid al Moualem, Minister of Foreign Affairs, spoke at the United Nations General Assembly and said that the situation in the country is improving.
“Today, the situation on Earth is more stable and secure, thanks to its success in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to come under normal conditions by building areas that were destroyed by terrorists.
Everything is now ready for refugees to return willingly to the country they were forced to leave because of terrorism and one-sided economic decisions that centered on their daily lives and jobs.
It is estimated that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Six million more people still living in the country are in need of assistance.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian authorities would gladly accept help in rebuilding the country.
However, he stressed that they would not accept aid subject to conditions or aid from countries that supported the rebellion.
Europe wins Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the U.S. team with a final score of 16.5 versus 10.5 points on the Le Golf National field outside of Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six times in a row on a European basis and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when the team, led by Danish captain Thomas Bjorn, reached the 14.5 points it needed to win the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who was in trouble most of the race, struck his starting blow down into the water on the 16th hole, par 3, and lost his game against Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari shined brightly in all his games and became 1 of 4 players to get the result 5-0-0, from the start of the competition using his current format in 1979.
Jordan Spieth lost 5&4 against Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark, but he was in the lowest position in the ranking of the players in the European team.
Dustin Johnson, who is in the top spot on the list of the best golfers in the world, lost 2 and 1 against Ian Poulter from England who possibly played in his final race for the Ryder Cup.
Spain’s Sergio Garcia, who has played eight times for the Ryder Cup, became the most successful European with 25.5 career points.
“I usually don’t cry, but today I can’t do anything else.
It has been a difficult year.
I am so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I am so happy to get the cup back.
This is about the team, and it was my pleasure to be able to help," said emotional Garcia after the victory of Europe.
He directed his country's John Rahm driver, but he defeated the American golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in a one-off game on Sunday.
“I was incredibly proud to have won Tiger Woods. I grew up watching him,” said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his games in France and is now listed with 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup competition.
This is a strange result for one of the best players in history, who has won 14 major titles and is only in second place after Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had a hard time finding themselves on the pitch all weekend, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau, who played a good game throughout the race.
The U.S. team, Jim Furyk, said after disappointment with the performance of his team, “I’m proud of them, they fought.
It was at some point in the morning that we put pressure on Europe.
We lost him down.
I'll take it down for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players play very well.
We'll get back together, I'll work with the PGA in the United States and named the Ryder Cup and we'll keep going.
I love these 12 men and am proud to be their captain.
You have to take it down.
“They played better than us.”
