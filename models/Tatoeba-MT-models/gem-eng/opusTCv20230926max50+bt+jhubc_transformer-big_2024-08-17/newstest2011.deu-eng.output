What should she do, the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD? The Czech Social Democrats in Prague know neither Voldemort nor the "Conditions".
The new Councillors of the capital from the ranks of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD will obviously have to overcome certain language barriers in order to be able to understand their old-new colleagues from the ODS in the Prague Council and the City Council at all.
The newspaper Aktu<0xC3><0xA1>ln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz has sometimes "knocked off" members of the new Council from the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD as they master the notorious slang, which has become a national in recent years, in which today's coalition partners in Prague were at the helm.
The coded vocabulary introduced by the Prague political elite in the disused era of Mayor Pavel Bém is borrowed from some of the most well-known actors, situations and causae.
Surprisingly, it turned out that the new councils were somewhat in the dark in terms of which these new terms are in the dark.
At least they say so.
"Who is Voldemort?"
"I don't know."
"I'm more of a newcomer to Prague's politics," Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Kauck<0xC3><0xBD>, the new councillor for culture, responded to the test of the "patent vocabulary".
But also the councillor Karel B<0xC5><0x99>ezina - a political veteran - reacted in a similar way.
For example, the term "golf hole".
"This is the only expression of those you present to me here that I use every now and then."
"Otherwise, I don't like slang much."
From the vocabulary published by the newspaper Aktu<0xC3><0xA1>ln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz in this year's June before the ODS election congress, the editors picked out six terms, especially those that are notoriously linked to the Prague Magistrate.
The Social Democrats were supposed to define the terms "Voldemort", "biggest Prague golf hole", "go into confectionery", "stiernacken", "trait of the capital" and "bleach".
Three Prague councillors agreed to the test, while the fourth - Anton<0xC3><0xAD>n Weinert, the future head of the Prague school system - promised his participation in the conversation at first, but did not even take the listener off.
The fifth councillor, Petr Dol<0xC3><0xAD>nek, rejected the test from the outset.
"I don't care about these things and how the bourgeois democrats talk to each other, I don't judge that."
“For me, it’s important how we understand ourselves as part of our programs,” he said.
As already indicated, Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Kauck<0xC3><0xBD> would not have realized in the headline mentioned above that there is talk of the influential entrepreneur and friend of the former mayor Bém, Roman Janou<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
The term "Voldemort" says nothing at all and the only term he correctly learned during the test was "the biggest Prague golf hole".
"This is the Blanka tunnel," says Kauck<0xC3><0xBD>, adding to the security, "but I know that from the newspaper."
And jokingly, "I guess I'll have to take a language course."
The "golf hole" is then not only deciphered by Matador Karel B<0xC5><0x99>ezina, but also by the Councillor for Environmental Affairs Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Plach<0xC3><0xBD> as a tunnel Blanka.
However, both Social Democrats also know for whom the term Voldemort stands and Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Plach<0xC3><0xBD> even knows where this figure can be found and thus what it means to "go into confectionery".
"I think that means going to some Prague catering business," Plach<0xC3><0xBD> is pretty close to the puzzle solution, knowing that this is the seat of Janou<0xC5><0xA1>ek's companies.
In harmony with B<0xC5><0x99>ezina, however, he insists that he had drawn this knowledge out of the newspaper rather than that this vocabulary would be his own.
Judging by the test participants, there does not seem to be a similarly civilized slang among the Social Democrats.
"I also asked my colleagues, but obviously there's no such thing with us."
"We call ourselves by name, sometimes we also use abbreviations or nicknames," says the chairman of the Prague <0xC4><0x8C>SSD Petr Hul<0xC3><0xAD>nsk<0xC3><0xBD> - called "Hulla" by his party comrades.
“At school I was called B<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>za (Birke), but I don’t know if my colleagues call me that,” says Karel B<0xC5><0x99>ezina.
The newspaper Den<0xC3><0xAD>k Aktu<0xC3><0xA1>ln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz tried the name and see - it works.
Councillor Weinert is friendly to the party comrades of the "Opa" or less friendly to the "old", the representative Miroslav Poche, who drew attention to himself before the elections through machinations at the party sponsorship, is called by some colleagues "Igr<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek" (known Czech Lego figure).
Nicknames are the only ones that allow the Social Democrats to use the language of the internal party.
Hul<0xC3><0xAD>nsk<0xC3><0xBD> does not like to be called "Hulda", but Den<0xC3><0xAD>k Aktu<0xC3><0xA1>ln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz registered another nickname of the Prague chairman.
His nickname "Doctor of Rubber Knuckle Rights" is allegedly related to Petr Hul<0xC3><0xAD>nsk<0xC3><0xBD>'s acquisition of his title Doctor juris at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The government wants to stop the torture of "witches" and issue a brochure
Women who are stamped into witches in Burkina Faso usually have some common social characteristics.
They are more of an older generation, they don’t find work – for health reasons, they are unemployed and have no children.
When one of these women becomes a witch, she is strictly isolated so that she cannot become dangerous to the rest of the village.
"Men are very rarely affected by this fate."
“Young and healthy women, too, are spared this because they help with work and give birth to children,” one religious sister describes the situation that in the capital of the West African state of Burkina Faso, in a special home, cares for more than a hundred women who have been expelled from their communities.
The local government now decided to take action against this abnormal "social measure".
And for this reason, issued a brochure to stop the "witch chase".
But the thing has a hook.
"More than 70 percent of all adults in Burkina Faso cannot read," the newspaper "the standard" pointed to the dilemma of written enlightenment.
But being accused of witchcraft is also commonplace in other African countries.
In Ghana, the neighboring country of Burkina Faso, 27-year-old Ammy Hemmahov<0xC3><0xA1> was tortured to death by three women and two men - they poured them over with petroleum and just lit them.
This incident was reported by the BBC server.
The perpetrators, however, claimed that the matter would have been just a coincidence of unfortunate circumstances.
According to their version, oil is inflamed, which is used for ritual anointings.
That is, after the group tried to "expulse an evil spirit" from the woman.
The isolation of "witches" supports people here without regard to their education.
"The Standard" quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso as saying, "Creating human souls is a danger earlier than today," he said.
While the government in Burkina Faso is at least trying to defuse the witch hunt, last year the president of the Gambia himself took a good mix.
"President Yahya Jammeh sparked a monstrous witch hunt after his aunt's death, as this allegedly had a share in their deaths and would now try to kill the president himself through black magic."
"To this end, he called on shamans from nearby Guinea to help, who, accompanied by police officers, soldiers and the President's bodyguard, indiscriminately kidnapped women and men from Gambian villages and brought them to the President's farm in Kanilai," Amnesty International said in its report.
On the farm, the incarcerated people were forced to drink an absud from plants with hallucinogenic effects, but this also caused intestinal and kidney problems.
Two of the arrested people did not survive the stay on the farm.
It was only because of international pressure that nearly a thousand prisoners were released.
A tenant of Bakala: He heats in the oven - still pays higher rent
An elderly man is currently leaving the client center of RPG Byty of the "Kohlebaron" Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k Bakala, the largest private owner of rental apartments in the Czech Republic.
Under his arm a folder with three new leases to three apartments: for the own and the apartments of his daughters and his son, who is currently serving a prison sentence.
All three have just increased the rent as part of the so-called "deregulation".
Instead of 3500 kroner monthly rent, the son is expected to rent a 2 bedroom apartment next year with kitchen of the second category 4100 kroner.
"And there's not even running hot water in the apartment and you have to heat in a simple coal oven," he tapped with his finger on the new lease of the son, to whose signing he has a power of attorney.
"But what - I signed," he explains half-consented and half-resigned.
BytyOKD.cz, which described the new lease terms as "incorrect and immoral", advises tenants not to sign the new contracts and to wait until December 7 to publish a guide on how to proceed against such contracts.
But the man just waved.
"One says this, the other says this," he makes a dark face.
The Ostrava region thus becomes a large "deregulation laboratory".
After the new year, this deregulation is ahead of most rental apartments in the Czech Republic, whose tenants so far do not pay a market-oriented rent.
Aktu<0xC3><0xA1>ln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz therefore decided to visit this "laboratory" in person.
The RPG waiting room in Hav<0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0x99>ov is one of four in the Ostrava region and already nine o’clock in the morning on this Tuesday breaking full.
Right next to the door are the bodyguards of a security agency and a calling device.
"Rent 2011", a special touch field on the touchscreen lights up.
In short, the device spits out a number plate.
We barely deciphered the number "157" and already beeps it on the large display on the ceiling of the waiting room.
Half a second later, you're on your way.
A little later, an older couple enters the waiting room to ask for the rent, but the rush in the waiting room apparently does not apply to the new rent.
Most people are here to solve the usual problems - repair requests, insurance matters and the like.
From mid-November, the envelopes in the Ostrava region will be fluttering into the mailboxes with the new leases most tenants of the total of 44,000 homes of the RPG’s portfolio.
The RPG Byty suggests a rent increase of about 15 to 38 percent in the letter.
The special switch for the new rentals in the client center has been open since 18 November.
"The action is going a little over a week, that is, this is only the beginning," the ladies behind the switch respond after a moment of hesitation when the "client" turns out to be a journalist.
Deregulation and Bakala’s former miners’ apartments are a hot topic.
Before the elections, the Ostrava-based parliamentary vice-president Lubom<0xC3><0xAD>r Zaor<0xC3><0xA1>lek of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD had taken up this topic quite loudly, no wonder that today the newspapers are full of it.
"Twenty years I want a new floor from them."
"They couldn't even change the toilet glasses," the man mentioned at the beginning said.
So far, the employees are mainly retired at the counter to convince themselves that they really get the promised rent reduction that RPG promises them when they sign the special offer on time.
A half-reduced February rent is also to be enjoyed by the other tenants who sign the new lease until 15 December.
So far, however, "deregulation switch" in Hav<0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0x99>ov is anything but overloaded by demand.
“Of yesterday’s 360 clients, only about 40 to 50 of the rent was due to be here in 2011,” the switch officials estimate.
RPG offers individual rental agreements on their websites as well as wall panels where it seems necessary.
However, if the rental parties do not agree on the new rental, it will be determined by an independent court.
“This should not be a threat, but should be understood as information about the only possible and completely legitimate legal approach,” RPG explains on its websites.
“No one goes to court here,” says one of RPG Byty’s employees and a man on the street in front of the client center, at least partially right her.
“I have 13,000 (crown) pensions, of which 5,000 are left for me to eat, where should I take the money for a court dispute,” he says.
Then the employee becomes insecure.
"Let's see."
"Mr. Zaor<0xC3><0xA1>lek tells them about the media, they should not sign and so people are still waiting," she says.
The regulated rent ends in most of the Czech Republic in the New Year 2011 and RPG Byty says the rent increase is an economic necessity.
"The existing amount of rents is not even sufficient to maintain the housing fund," argues Pavel Klime<0xC5><0xA1>, director of the housing portfolio of RPG Byty company and - especially the neglect of the housing fund, which is criticized by the tenants, is, in the opinion of the homeowners, the main reason for the rent increase.
While RPG was able to invest four billion in the apartments from 2005 to 2010, in the four years from 2011 to 2014, it is expected to be 5.2 billion.
On the large-format LCD display on the ceiling opposite the upholstered chairs in the waiting room of Hav<0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0x99>ov, a few red-lit information pops up again and again.
"The rent increases in 2011 by 15% and less affect 31,200 apartments, that is, more than 90% of the homes of RPG."
“Always this means a maximum of 7.50 CZK per square meter per month,” can be read on the LCD monitor.
Only 400 apartments from RPG’s portfolio increase the rent by 38 percent.
“In these cases, it’s about raising extremely low rental prices of CZK 19.66 per square meter,” argues RPG.
For 2600 apartments, the rent will remain at the same level next year.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation won’t drive rents up, but gradually takes place within four and eight years.
What's more - the company imposes another obligation: All income from the rent increase (see diagram) the company wants to put back into the apartments, especially in heat savings - in new windows and in thermal insulation.
But - primarily, these should benefit those people who sign the agreements on the increase in rent.
The architects saw - the office also includes a kindergarten
The Avriopoint office building in Brno is the new headquarters of the company Arch.Design.
But who would expect a mini kindergarten here, with everything that includes: colorful walls, creative furniture, a lot of toys and even a mini playground on the outdoor terrace.
This kindergarten has been available to Arch.Design employees since last year.
The design and architecture firm Arch.Design, from whose studios a number of well-known Brünner buildings come, calculated from the first designs for the new building Avriopoint with the premises for its company mini-kindergarten.
In a wise perspective, because most of his 90 employees are in the baby boom age and the company is in the position to return to their workplace as soon as possible.
Together with the possibility to work shortened, the kindergarten is another bonus that Arch.Design has to offer its employees in the concept of their social program.
The civil engineers have made it easier to bring their demanding profession and childcare under one roof.
The Mini Kindergarten is an original idea of Arch.Design’s employees and with the support of the management, they managed to win funding from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs for their project.
The operational mini-kindergarten is financed by the Operational Programme Human Resources and Employment Policy from the resources of the European Social Fund and from the state budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to this financing (CZK 2.8 million grants), the necessary facilities and equipment could be procured and for the duration of 2 years qualified personnel and for operation is provided.
After the funding has been exhausted (2 years), Arch.Design is obliged to continue operating the Minikindergarten 3 more years at its own expense.
The preparation of this project took a whole year, with the Society providing active assistance in the processing of applications.
All-day qualified staff take care of the children - a nurse and a kindergarten teacher, the kindergarten can visit children without age restrictions, although most of them are over three years old.
And since this is a mini-kindergarten, only 5 children may be present at the same time, but the day will alternate over several children.
The kindergarten company is flexibly adapted to the needs of the parents, the children of all employees have the same rights in relation to the use of the kindergarten - without regard to the company hierarchy and their respective position.
Although it is individual education and care, the program content in the mini-kindergarten is nevertheless comparable to the supporting program of pre-school education.
The children play here not only, but above all they are offered excellent lessons - from basic knowledge to pre-school lessons, in addition they also learn English.
The classroom is equipped not only with toys and creative games, but also with a computer that is available to the children.
What's more - the presence of young children in the company contributes to a friendly and positive corporate environment.
The parents can take a look at the children at any time and thus the stress of late collection of the children from a far away kindergarten is eliminated.
Parents use their working hours more productively.
No wonder that there are also natural and loyal employer-employee relationships.
Arch.Design thus ranked among the Czech companies, which offer significant benefits in recruiting new employees, who are family-friendly and through such programs strengthen their staff marketing.
A bone house fascinates even after 100 years. Check out Gaudi’s interiors
The roof resembles the back of a prehistoric lizard, the stairs like the spine of a dinosaur and the balconies are torn fish m<0xC3><0xA4>uler.
This is the Casa Batll<0xC3><0xB3> of the Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona.
Of the local inhabitants, the house with its organic forms was nicknamed "Knochenhaus".
Organic shapes, wild colors, the unusual use of stone, tile splinters and mosaics, the dandruff-remembering facades and ubiquitous soft lines, all these are typical features of Antonio Gaudi’s Art Nouveau style.
The fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade of the house plays with dreamy lines, tender colors and textures reminiscent of nature and living beings.
It is only with a closer look that everything is dominated by geometry, rhythm and thought-out order.
At night, the whole facade looks even more plastic, more dramatic and the special lighting enhances the luster of the colours.
The same swinging lines and intricate shapes also dominate the interior of the house.
Wave-shaped wood copies the window frames, railings, decorative elements of doors, even look holes and strips.
The house Batll<0xC3><0xB3> in the Eixample district on the busy shopping street Passeig de Gr<0xC3><0xA1>cia No. 43 was built by the reconstruction of a house from 1877, which architect Emilio Sala Cortese carried out.
The reconstruction took two years and was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrialist Josep Batll<0xC3><0xB3>, originally consisted of the demolition of the old and the construction of a completely new building, but ultimately he agreed to the idea of Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>s for an unusual and also cheaper conversion.
The Casa Batll<0xC3><0xB3> rental house, however, did not design Antoni Gaud<0xC3><0xAD> alone.
He worked with the architect Josep Maria Jujol.
It was precisely on his drawing board that the decorations for the representative apartment of the reality owner were created and also the use of mosaics on the fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade was his idea.
However, numerous other sculptors and artists also worked on the design of the fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade.
The joint work on the designs for the Casa Batll<0xC3><0xB3> was the beginning of a fruitful collaboration between Jujola and Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>.
Jujol also participated in the construction of Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>’s Casa Mil<0xC3><0xA1> in the Güell Park, where there are also other works by Antoni Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>.
Shortly after its completion, the house was given by the local inhabitants of its organic forms because of the nickname "Knochenhaus".
Others, in turn, called it the special window opening mechanism because of the "coming house".
It is also said that at the top of the building is the sword of Saint George, patron of Catalonia.
But other sculptural elements also symbolize hidden religious motives.
Gaud<0xC3><0xAD> designed a central heating system with ventilation ducts and typical fireplaces that were unique to the house at the time.
A bit bizarre, their 45-degree inclination is already hinting at.
In his work, Gaud<0xC3><0xAD> consistently ignored all the building regulations at the time and was by no means fooled by them.
Before the start of construction, he obtained the corresponding building permit from the city, but the information he gave about the planned reconstruction was so vague that the city fathers were so horrified at the completion two years later that they demanded relief.
Among other things, the councilors also encountered the fact that the construction with its pillars even intervened in the public sidewalk.
However, there were no further changes, quite the contrary - only fifteen days after the district's request in this respect, Josep Batll<0xC3><0xB3> submitted a request for permission to lease the two highest floors of the house - and it was promptly granted to him.
The owner himself moved into the lower floors.
In the gallery on the 2nd floor there was a social lounge, on the third floor there were the bedrooms and private rooms of the apartment.
The ground floor was leased to a jewelry store.
The entire six-storey building goes through a staircase all the way up to the roof terrace.
Due to the basic elements of the conversion, all right angles and straight lines were removed and replaced by curved and curved walls.
Gaud<0xC3><0xAD> also worked with a modern concept for the mutual connection of spaces.
The social part can be completely connected by opening the salon doors and so a larger society could easily chat without having to forgo a certain intimacy in more confidential conversations.
The house received a rather unusual roof and two other floors through Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>'s conversion in addition to a new fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade.
Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>’s play with the light as well as the blue and white glazed tiles with which the courtyard is dressed and the lighthouses.
The play of these two colors gives a maximum of light to all floors of the house.
He simply made use of the principle that white reflects the light better than dark colors that absorb the sunlight on the contrary.
The Casa Batll<0xC3><0xB3> house, which was included in the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2005, can be visited by anyone today.
On the first floor, the most spacious and magnificent apartment is made accessible to the public.
The homeowners only decided in the year to take this step and this on the occasion of the 150th birthday of the famous creator.
When it was found that this was a fairly profitable business, the visits were kept, yes it was extended to other common areas and the attic rooms, including the roof terrace.
However, the price for visiting the monument is not a cardboard stall, it is 16.50 euros, students, pensioners, groups and holders of tourist cards get 20 percent discount.
This amount exceeds the entrance fees to other Gaud<0xC3><0xAD> buildings in the city.
If you want to get to know the real atmosphere of the house with its dragon towers, you should try to make friendships with one of the house dwellers and visit him at home.
The right mattress and the right bed rest? Women have different wishes than men
Not the best bed frame, but the quality of the lying area - so mattress and rust make up the good bed.
However, these must complement each other harmoniously in order to meet the wishes of the specific user.
When choosing, many things play a role - the weight, the size, the state of health and, last but not least, the sex of the sleeper.
Equally important is the interior in which mattress and rust have to be subordinated.
Typical example?
In a weekend house where not regularly heated, latex mattresses are not well suited, as they take much longer to "get warm".
In addition, they are significantly heavier than conventional polyurethane mattresses.
And - they should be turned regularly.
If they do not have enough venting channels in the core and are also on a solid plate, moisture accumulates: it is therefore not excluded that it forms under their mold.
Of course, the choice also plays a role in what you are used to.
If you have been abroad for a long time, where very high soft-layer mattresses are common, it will be difficult to get used to a low hard-surface mattress.
"Whether all hockey players who have come back from the NHL have complained to me that they can't sleep right here anymore."
"For their shrunken shoulders, heels and hips, they just need a soft layer of visco foam (memory foam - a shape memory polymer)."
"I also recommend these to people with diabetes who suffer from nervous system disorders, so that they can receive the "information" from the joints and skin badly," explains Sylva Hadamczikov<0xC3><0xA1>, who specializes in upholstered furniture.
That’s why I bought these mattresses with Visco foam (Memory Foam) from many ice hockey players years ago, but also from other customers.
"Today, this is no longer a problem, because such mattresses offer, among others, the manufacturer Tempur, the Italian company Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer Tropico."
And you don’t necessarily have to be a famous ice hockey player to appreciate the benefits of Visco foam.
This "miracle" actually works quite simply.
The foam optimizes its hardness and shape according to the absorbed heat, in other words, it really conforms to the warm body.
Nowhere does it press, at night you do not roll around like after a heavy battle.
You just sleep much better.
The viscoelastic foam also offers protection against decubitus (wound burn).
When choosing the mattress size, the length of the soles of the feet should still be added to the height, i.e. about 21 to 34 cm.
Man and woman, who are 180 cm tall, need a 210 to 220 cm bed.
Each sleeper should have at least 90 cm lying width available, i.e. 180 cm together.
For single beds, for example for singles, 120 to 140 cm are attached.
For the sake of comfort and also for any visitors.
Otherwise, the following rule of thumb applies to the ideal bed width: "If you are lying on your back, there should still be enough room for the slightly angled arms", advises Ing. Helena Prokopov<0xC3><0xA1>, the assistant master of upholsterers and room equipment, who has been dedicated to the problem of healthy sleep and the ergonomics of furniture for years and this topic is also dedicated to specialist schools.
With a double bed, everyone needs their own grate and mattress, but be careful when shopping so that the mattresses are the same height.
Otherwise, there is nothing left but to mount the grate at different heights and this is not possible with every bed frame.
Foam mattresses should be at least 14 cm high, mattresses with a spring skeleton 15 cm, of which at least three centimetres should be applied to the mould layer and the fine padding.
"By hand or while sitting down, you can't feel the feathers in any way," warns Helena Prokopov<0xC3><0xA1>.
Each mattress requires a special type of rust.
Fully upholstered beds with mattress and underlay like grown Siam twins have nothing to look for in the bedroom.
These mattresses cannot be ventilated and the cover can not be washed, which is already happening today.
And since you lose between 0.2 and 0.75 l of sweat in a single night, it is clear that after five to seven years, the mattress slowly becomes a huge (and clogged sieve).
This is also why professionals reject advertising slogans that promise a lifetime of up to 25 years, even life-long warranty, for mattresses.
Every thing has its if and but.
And therefore a practical advice from the dealers: For mattresses of 120 or 140 cm width one should not shy away from the hygiene of the washable, removable covers, but it is recommended to use a mattress protector that can be easily removed and washed.
Even though mattress covers with a full zip are usually made today, so that after opening you get two halves (immensally important for the washing process and the washing machine size!), the manipulation with larger mattresses, especially executed alone, often resembles the unequal struggle between David and Goliath.
Do they have a solid plate in bed instead of a grate?
Get out of here!
Or at most for a bed for unloved guests and for a single night.
Even so, they should rather provide the plate with ventilation holes (unless they are already in it) and use mattresses with spring skeleton and 15 cm minimum height with so-called pocket spring cores and fine cushions.
Polyurethane mattresses do not belong on such a substrate.
For non-adjustable slatted gratings with 14 to 18 spring strips (lamellas) latex or sandwich mattresses (if applicable also combinations of latex and coconut) always pay for slatted gratings with a larger number of slatted bars, i.e. of 28 and more spring strips, with lordose support in the lumbar region and the possibility of regulating the slat hardness.
Adjustable slatted gratings do not include mattresses with a spring skeleton, as they do not respond to the ergonomic adjustment.
In addition to adjusting the stiffness of the spring strips, special flexible shoulder modules are also offered.
This involves a special fastening of the spring strips, which makes it possible to press the spring strips or even to angle them in such a way that they make it possible for the shoulder of the sleeper to sink in to a point.
Especially for men with broad shoulders an important thing.
There are even mattress manufacturers who have started using soft zones for the shoulder area in "men's mattresses".
The ladies are also thought of - they are given these soft zones in the hip area.
For the most demanding customers, point-elastic wing spring systems (Lattoflex) or rust with point-elastic contact pads with so-called multitorsion springing are designed.
The pressure is distributed over several points, reducing the voltage.
But - if you use a bad (too big and full) pillow for the right mattress and rust, most benefits are lost again.
Here, too, a rule of thumb: the pillow should support the head, its tips should only reach up to the shoulders so that the shoulder muscles can relax.
Therefore, a 50 x 60 cm cushion appears ideal, as the Scandinavians, for example, like.
In the side position, the pillow (together with the shoulder relief zone in the grate or the soft zone in the mattress) should balance the shoulder height.
Our modern mattresses have something in common with the former (filled with hay) straw sacks.
Modern manufacturers are increasingly using natural materials or at least their admixtures.
The word “bio” is also used in mattresses.
Instead of petroleum raw materials, natural oils are increasingly used for the production of polyurethane foams - for example castor and soybean oil.
Soy is probably used by all well-known manufacturers.
“Bio means for mattresses that are made of materials of purely natural origin,” explains Petr Va<0xC5><0xA1><0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek from Tropico Plus.
However, natural materials are also used in the production of mattress covers - one of the first was aloe vera.
However, you can also enjoy microcapsules that spread fresh forest or lavender scent when you sleep.
Here, too, there is a difference between man and woman.
While men use a "cooling" plant extract of birch leaves to allow the mattress cover to absorb heat and cool the body, the covers have "warming" effect for women.
Extracts from red peppers stimulate blood circulation, so the weaker sex gets warm when you sleep.
And today's favorites?
Mattresses made of cold foam (it has larger pores with destroyed cell structure and is therefore more breathable than commercially available polyurethane and also much more flexible).
The combination of the different stiffness (hardness) of cold foams and visco foams creates multi-zone mattresses that know exactly where the head, hip and heel are located.
For a high-quality mattress, however, you have 7000 crowns and more to coat.
However, health mattresses are usually burdened with lower VAT, as they are considered medical aids.
As the first Czech company, Gumotex was given this advantage.
You can see that saving on the mattress and the rust is not so easy.
From time to time, there are special offers from manufacturers and dealers that offer two mattresses at the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex brand offers the mattress Duofreeze with visco foam memory for 11,990 CZK.

It was the material Tempur that initiated the era of viscoelastic foams with open cell structure and high density at an almost cosmic pace.
No wonder, they were developed for NASA, because the astronauts are exposed to enormous overloads during the launches.
Tempur becomes soft with heat, in the cool environment it in turn solidifies.
So it perfectly adapts to the human body and distributes the body pressure in an optimal way.
It is therefore not only ideal for preventing pressure burn, but generally increases sleep comfort.
However, viscoelastic foams are not only used in mattresses, but also in other health products, such as special foot pads, which are intended to provide relief to the legs and vessels.
Local manufacturers, for example, use the foams Eucatherm C, Twinsaver or similar products.
More and more parents want human-monitoring devices to keep the kids under control
The fear of their own children is growing and so more and more parents are considering monitoring them via GPS.
The system, which was originally invented to find cars, can find people just as well, which would be helpful in such cases as recently when nine-year-old Ani<0xC4><0x8D>ka Janatkov<0xC3><0xA1> disappeared.
The device is currently about the size of a cigarette box but soon it should not be bigger than a wristwatch.
Many people have put the case of the disappeared Ani<0xC4><0x8D>ka in fear and horror and so they look for means and ways to better protect their children.
Also for the price of impairing their privacy.
“We are trying to tell everyone that this is not about spying around, but rather about an effective means of reducing the likelihood of tragedy,” said Petr Pilin of the company Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of GPS location devices on the Czech market.
"I admit that in individual cases there may be abuses of such devices, for example, if you put it in someone's pocket without him knowing about it, but we have not had to report such a case so far."
“Most customers really buy it for security reasons,” Pilin adds.
In his opinion, however, the child should always know what purpose the "box" serves and how to use it in an emergency.
However, child psychologist Dana Bo<0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1> points out that if a child does not like to wear such a thing, he simply gets rid of it.
“Even very small children show great creativity when it comes to intentionally losing certain things if they don’t want to be controlled.”
"Even the mobile phones initially aroused great expectations among parents, but they can be switched off just as easily as these new surveillance devices," says Mrs Bo<0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1>.
In your opinion, it is also controversial whether such a facility actually helps in the event of an attack.
"In the case of planned kidnappings, the kidnapper almost always checks whether the child has any electronics with which it could be located."
“Today it’s the cell phone.”
“If such surveillance devices found wider use, they would also seek them, as their sale would certainly be accompanied by massive advertising.”
"In these cases, the criminals of the police are always one step ahead," the psychologist says.
However, she admits that similar devices can be quite helpful in a sudden attack by a pedophile.
According to Roberta <0xC4><0x8C>ech of the company RC Monitoring, which offers location services for both automobiles and people, the existence of such a device can also help if it is destroyed immediately after the attack.
"The device can be set in such a way that it reports the respective position at certain intervals."
"Even if it was immediately destroyed, at least the last position of the person concerned is available."
"In the case of more expensive devices, even a tilting knife is integrated, that is, if you fall down and stay motionless, the device immediately sends a warning stating the position," Mr. <0xC4><0x8C>ech claims.
In his opinion, similar services could also perform intelligent mobile phones with navigation, only a special software is needed.
The problem with the current tracking devices is that this is either about devices in matchbox size, similar to trailers or smaller phones.
There is always a risk of losing them.
According to Mr Pilin from Macro Weil, therefore, in the present, devices that look like normal digital clocks are being tested.
"This has the advantage that the possible attacker does not have to realize at all that it is a monitoring or locating device.
“Or he won’t notice it until after a certain amount of time, which gives the police a time advantage,” he adds.
No matter in which direction the development goes - to bracelets or trailers, the same technology is always used as in the vehicle location.
So about the combination of location function using the GPS system (just like the Navi in the car) and the function of a mobile phone that reports the current position.
The army has so many spark cords that you could wrap all over the Czech Republic but only hold them for two years.
The Czech army has purchased 445 kilometers of ignition line, being ignited with explosives.
In the previous year, the Ministry of Defence had already supplied 224 kilometers of ignition line to the army camps.
It is reassuring to know that the armed forces have been outsourced for 225 years.
The problem is only the durability of the ignition line - two, but not more than four years.
The army bought the ignition line from the joint stock company STV Group, a.s. for Lippian 40 million kroner.
In his reasoning for the purchase of this huge quantity of ignition line, the general staff MF DNES replied that the soldiers would consume the 60 km of ignition line annually.
According to the research of army pyrotechnicians, which MF DNES addressed, it is clear from this statement that the entire army would have to complete an extremely intensive pyrotechnic training every year - from all generals and officers of the army command, to the secretaries and cleaning women.
Defence Minister Alexandr Vondra and Army General Vlastimil Picek not excluded.
Only in this way could the considerable annual consumption of sixty kilometres of ignition lines be justified halfway.
This length corresponds to 25,000 detonations.
But even so, these army stocks would last for more than ten years.
However, if the old rule of experts still applies that for training every new professional soldier two meters of ignition cord is completely sufficient, then the army has created a reassuring supply for the already mentioned 225 years through these new purchases - also from the point of view of the increased need of the pioneer and special units.
Soldiers of the rapid deployment brigade recently complained to Minister of Defense Vondra that they had almost no cartridges for handguns anymore, so shooting exercises of the missing funds are severely restricted because of the lack of funds.
Not to mention the lack of underwear.
"I also don't understand why they buy such a lot of ignition cords from us."
But that’s ultimately their decision, they’ll already know what they need.”
“For us, the army is a good customer, which we as a trader want to meet as much as possible,” says the sales manager of STV Group Jan D<0xC4><0x9B>ck<0xC3><0xBD>.
Jan Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek, the spokesman for the Ministry of Defence, has made the purchase of hundreds of kilometers of ignition cords, saying that the army would have covered itself with this "munition" for at least ten years.
Jan D<0xC4><0x9B>ck<0xC3><0xBD> of the STV Group, however, speaks only of a four-year service life of the ignition line and police and army pyrotechnicians only of two years.
"With perfect storage, the four years mentioned are probably also possible," admits one of them, who wants to remain unnamed so as not to be accused of criticism of the army as a soldier.
After the end of the service life, any ammunition must be thoroughly tested, whether it is still reliable and not endangering the lives of the soldiers.
However, these tests are not for nothing, but cost more money.
Another argument of the Ministry of Defence is the quantity discount for the 445 km ignition line.
"They cost us sixty percent less than last year's delivery of 244 kilometers," spokesman Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek told us the position of the Department of Defense's buyers.
For comparison only: The annual consumption of spark cords by police pyrotechnicians liquidating ammunition from World War II or the Soviet Brotherhood has barely exceeded 1,500 meters for a few years.
And the police always order only such quantities of this ammunition, which they can consume before the end of the period of use.
Because of the safety of the pyrotechnicians, in addition, the possibility of flexible purchases is kept more modern and thus also reliable ignition lines open.
In any case, the Ministry of Defence has huge problems with the liquidation of tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from times of the Warsaw Treaty, when the two hundred thousand-strong Czechoslovak People's Army prepared for their campaign to the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnics, which MF DNES addressed, the Czech Armed Forces expect the same problem in a few years when liquidating hundreds of kilometers of old ignition line, which they have bought so "cheaply" today.
To this day I still have the contacts that I have won thanks to the competition
Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun helped to sell the franchise of his hotel.
The winner of the last year of the competition "Small Entrepreneur of the Year" was Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun from Liberec.
The story of his success is like a film scene.
Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun liked to travel.
Only abroad did he become aware that there is no good accommodation at reasonable prices in Liberec.
From the savings of his holiday work abroad and with the help of a bank loan, he acquired a edifice-like house with five apartments.
Considering that he was a college student in the sixth semester at the time, this was certainly a bold undertaking.
“The price-quality ratio at the time annoyed me and so I tried to do something about it,” says Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun.
He rented the first reconstructed apartment to foreign workers.
He immediately invested the entire profit back into the house, which he then gradually converted to a 54-bed pension.
Since then, he has managed to open four pensions, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of over 300 beds of all accommodation categories in just seven years of entrepreneurial activity in Liberec.
The most comfortable of them was until recently the four-star hotel "Pytloun Design Hotel".
Another first-class hotel was added this year.
"We have just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tisé, which we have sold our franchise concept and other interested parties in the franchise of Pytloun hotels have already registered," says the entrepreneur number one of last year.
"A large share of this licensing sale for the operation of hotels had just won the "Entrepreneur of the Year" competition," adds Mr Pytloun, acknowledgingly.
The victory has brought him greater fame, yes popularity in Liberec and the surrounding area.
“People recognized me on the street, often they even congratulated me afterwards and I have to say that did really well,” he recalls.
I really recommend everyone who wants to do something to participate in this competition.
You don’t have to win right away either, any visualization is good.
He says that he still benefits from the contacts and acquaintances that otherwise would not have come to him at all.
“With some people I’ve met thanks to the competition, I still have regular business relationships to this day.”
In his opinion, the fame associated with the success is also a little on each of his employees.
And there he is to the seventy.
“I notice with them greater loyalty and pride that they are part of something that is universally recognized.”
I really don’t see this as just personal success, no, that’s the result of the good work of all of us.”
"My name has only come to the fore," says Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun modestly.
I wish my successors a quieter year when we had it in Farmet
Victory euphoria was quickly replaced by the consequences of the crisis.
Thanks to his determination, Farmet has the worst behind him.
Last year, Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F><0xC3><0xA1>rsk<0xC3><0xBD>, the owner of Farmet, accepted the prize for the first place in the Vodafone Company competition.
At that time, the jury praised the efforts it made to stamp out a company from the small tool making plant in <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xA1> Skalice, which makes hundreds of millions of sales.
“I can say that this appreciation not only encouraged myself, but also all my employees and strengthened our self-confidence in the fight against competition,” says the previous year’s winner.
At the beginning of Farmet’s company history, there was an effort to do something useful.
And when the state offered his father Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F><0xC3><0xA1>rsk<0xC3><0xBD> as compensation for the property confiscated by the communists a small workshop for rent, he did not hesitate for long, let his career in the company in which he was employed until then, suck and set up his own company with a few comrades of his father for the production of plastic tubs.
A short time later, they began to focus on vegetable oil presses.
Within 18 years, they have become the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in all of Central Europe.
But it was only through the success of the mentioned competition and its medialisation that it also entered the consciousness of the non-expert public.
“Not only did our customers now perceive the Farmet brand much more intensively, but our foreign partners also began to work with a company that has achieved the greatest possible success in their country to attach greater value,” says Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F><0xC3><0xA1>rsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
Last year, however, Farmet did not just focus on victory euphoria.
The valuation was based on the company’s economic results in 2008 and part of 2009.
And 2009 was the most difficult year for the sale of tool building products.
The crisis, which then shook even less citizens, but above all companies, reached its peak – many companies were forced to stop their investment projects and restrict the purchase of new facilities and technologies.
“Of course, we couldn’t escape this situation.”
“Sales decreased by 40 percent, we had to limit production and even resort to layoffs,” explains Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F><0xC3><0xA1>rsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
A viable company sometimes has to take such unpopular measures.
However, it managed to get the situation under control and keep the company in the black numbers, even if with lower profits than before the crisis.
At one, the company was not willing to make cuts - in terms of investment in research and development.
"From the grant we built a research and training center, we strengthened our presentation at international trade fairs and won major prizes at domestic exhibitions," says <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F><0xC3><0xA1>rsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
It all proves that we have overcome the crisis.
Sales are growing again and with them the number of new employees.
"I wish the new winner a lot of joy in victory - but in a quieter atmosphere," says Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F><0xC3><0xA1>rsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
An opinion poll that cleans up with nonsensical regulations
The opinion poll on the "absurdity of the year" is part of the entrepreneurial competition for the fourth time.
Some foolish rules have already succeeded in creating out of the world.
To the dubious winner of the next year's opinion poll "Absurdity of the Year", the obligation to create documents on authorities available online advanced.
Thus, more than a third of not quite four thousand voting entrepreneurs decided.
For example, the Social Security Administration requested a paper extract from the commercial register, even if the official could have retrieved it by two mouse clicks.
Thanks to the opinion poll, this is changing now.
"The Czech Social Security Administration will no longer require withdrawals from the commercial register in the future in the case of checks on social security payers," the spokeswoman for <0xC4><0x8C>SSZ Jana Bura<0xC5><0x88>ov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
The purpose and purpose of the opinion poll "Absurdity of the Year" is to examine all the regulations and orders that entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic have to comply with and lift the unsense.
For the fourth time this year, it is already part of an entrepreneurial competition organised by the German Economic Newspaper (HN) and enjoys growing popularity among the public.
If the three thousand people took part in the vote last year, it was already four thousand this year.
No wonder, because there are still a lot of legal obligations that serve solely to hinder business activity.
“As for the number of income tax forms, for example, we are taking a leading position in the world,” says Karel Havl<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Traders of the Czech Republic.
Simplification of entrepreneurial activity has been the declared goal of all governments in recent years.
Compared to the world, however, the situation in the Czech Republic has hardly improved.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic ranks 74th in terms of company conditions, down eight places from the previous year.
The competition absurdity of the year was declared for the first time in the year and takes place every year according to the same scenario.
Anyone can report administrative and bureaucratic nonsense from April to the end of September.
The website www.firmaroku.cz is used for registration. Afterwards, the organiser of the competition selects seven candidates for the "Antipreis" and allows the public to vote via the Internet on the websites www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
It wins the absurdity that gets the most votes.
More than a hundred, more precisely 105 meaningless regulations and orders have already been registered for this year’s opinion poll.
The tips come not only from entrepreneurs, but also from professional associations and journalists.
Among the nominated "finalists" of the competition are, for example, provisions that maintenance vehicles have to pay toll for motorways and highways or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two toilets have to present every two years.
The list of this year's "Seven" is published on the pages of the competition.
The competition at the beginning of November at Prague’s Wenceslas Square is part of an event in which people of political and public life regularly participate.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodov<0xC3><0xA1>, the director of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Traders of the Czech Republic and Petr Ku<0xC5><0xBE>el, the President of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic, were at the height of the competition with the party.
“Where the state throws a knot between entrepreneurs, there can be no real economic upswing, so my goal is to repeal at least thirty paragraphs every year, which today make it unnecessarily difficult for entrepreneurs to do business,” said Martin Kocourek, Minister of Industry and Trade.
Efforts to create senseless orders from the world have an effect.
In 2007, the people most disturbed the entrepreneurs’ obligation to report to the commercial office at the location of their permanent establishment three days in advance the intention to travel with an exhibition stand to an exhibition or a church.
This obligation was lifted by a short story of the commercial law.
The duty, which in 2007 received the second largest number of votes - the duty to report to the employment office trips of employees in the amount of up to 30 days - was abolished by the law on them so-called "Green Card".
And - all good things are three:
For the absurdity of 2009, the regulation imposed on physiotherapists was chosen to have a mirror, a refrigerator and two scales in the meeting room.
This regulation was somewhat mitigated by the Ministry of Health this year - the refrigerator obligation fell away.
A new category recognises socially responsible companies
Evaluation criteria are humanitarian, environmental, educational or sports projects
A novelty in this year’s fifth year of the competition of the business newspaper (HN) is the category “Responsible Company of the Year 2010”.
The basic idea of this competition is to promote reasonable and fair business.
“We want to support companies that are aware of the consequences of their entrepreneurial activities on the environment and support socially responsible initiatives,” says Patrik Bartholdy, regional manager of mobile phone company Vodafon, who is the originator and guarantor of this competition, as well as the “Rebell of the Year” competition.
For this year’s first year of this special subcategory of the main competition Vodafon Company of the year, companies for which success is not the only long-term goal signed up.
The story of each of them is extremely inspiring and offers enough material for an independent article.
Although they differ diametrically in relation to the subject matter of their activity, their efforts nevertheless have a common denominator - support and consideration.
This is for example about disabled people, because of personal problems or the health of their own employees.
Among the fourteen finalists from all over the Czech Republic, for example, the Prague software company Et Netera also emerged, which promotes the creation of non-formal sports teams among its employees, who then participate in numerous tournaments in various sports.
Another example of a responsible company from the Pardubice region is the company Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main sponsor of a foundation fund for disabled children for seventeen years.
A paper mill from Pod<0xC4><0x9B>brady, too, is exemplary in taking care of its health-impaired employees, which make up 70 percent of their workforce, for which it was honored with the title "Responsible Company of the Central Bohemia Region"; in the Vodafone Company competition of the year, it ranked third in this region.
In the Olomouc region, the accounting firm MiRyz Soft won, which, among other things, introduced a fluid and also reduced working time to an average of 35 hours per week, without a relative reduction in wages.
The jury also honored the fact that the company mainly buys from Czech manufacturers, supports citizen initiatives in its environment and works according to environmentally friendly principles.
"We strive to recycle as much as possible in order to minimise the impact of our business activities and administration on the environment," explains Milu<0xC5><0xA1>e Ryznarov<0xC3><0xA1>, Managing Director.
In turn, the responsible IT company Enlogit from the <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem region is based on the health of its employees and that is why it has acquired ergonomic armchairs and keyboards for all notebooks, as well as promoting home work with its employees and using Cartering services provided by a local protected workshop.
"In addition, we support the foundation "People in Need", which provides concrete help to the local Roma community," says Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Such<0xC3><0xBD>, the company's representative.
Last but not least, the activity of the cleaning company "Pran<0xC3><0xAD> a <0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC4><0x9B>n<0xC3><0xAD>" from the Karlovy Vary region is also worth mentioning, which contributes to the pension insurance of its employees in the form of extra bonuses.
"We give our employees contributions to food, work, to increase their qualifications and for holidays," says Josef Strap<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D> of the construction company Czasch from Brunt<0xC3><0xA1>l, the winner in the Moravian-Silesian region.
All district finalists of the Vodafon Company of the Year competition were automatically registered for the category Responsible Company of the Year, who answered the questions of the questionnaire enclosed with the registration and sent it to the organizer no later than 15 August.
Incorrect or incomplete answers in the questionnaire were excluded from the evaluation by the organizer.
"If the representatives of the competing companies left the questions unanswered, they were excluded from the "Responsible Company of the Year" competition, but in the main Vodafone Company of the Year competition they were therefore not disqualified."
"A separate registration for this competition is not possible because it is only a sub-category of the company's main competition of the year," explains Karel Goldman of the organizing agency Bison & Rose.
Pilsner Bodenfonds - Arrests of the police at a public tender
In the building of the ground fund in Pilsen, the anti-corruption police have made arrests in recent days.
The local media entrepreneur and real estate dealer Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. was abducted by the detectives in handcuffs.
The latter had allegedly attempted to manipulate a public competition for the settlement of claims for restitution in such a way that the land offered in the competition fell to a specific interested party.
He is said to have paid Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. half a million dollars.
"At this point, I can only confirm that the police are pursuing a person in a public competition because of the delicacy of fraudulent machinations," said Antonie Zelen<0xC3><0xA1>, the head of the Pilsner prosecutor's office of the newspaper "Pr<0xC3><0xA1>vo", who could not provide further details with regard to the ongoing investigations.
24 hours later, the 46-year-old entrepreneur was released by the police.
How he was able to manipulate public competition can only be speculated about this given the sparse official information.
The spokesperson of the Lubom<0xC3><0xAD>r <0xC4><0x8C>ern<0xC3><0xA1> Foundation stated on the question in question of Pr<0xC3><0xA1>vo, that the police had actually made arrests in the Pilsner subsidiary of the Foundation during a public competition.
“It was about a client and not about one of our employees,” she concretized.
According to the public competition, Ms <0xC4><0x8C>ern<0xC3><0xA1> had the correct designation "request for the supply of claims for the transfer of land under the Land Act" and would take place in cases where several applicants expressed interest in the land offered.
"These persons offer, within the framework of the call, a higher value of their restitution claims to be settled by the transfer than the declared property value."
"According to the claims offered, the order of the potential acquirers is determined, then the ground fund transfers the property to the person with the highest offer," the fund's spokesperson said.
Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. was obviously at the disposal of information on who had signed up for the request and, since he was a person entitled to a number of restitution claims, he offered a land interest that he withdrew from the competition.
Obviously against a fat squandering.
That would also be a sufficient explanation as to why he had such a large amount of money with him when he was arrested.
In the past, Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. had very good contacts with the Pilsner Bodenfonds.
For example, he also played a role in the causa of the former head of the V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Sankota land fund, which was prosecuted because he issued land in replacement refunds, which had already made site decisions on construction projects.
At that time, Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. from the Land Fund, for example, also acquired land intended for the construction of public roads, more precisely, at the place where the construction of the access magisterium to the commercial area Borské pole was planned.
Later he exchanged these very cheaply with the magistrate for a house directly in the historic center of the city, which far exceeded the value of the land.
At that time, the town hall had to give little attention to heavy hearts in order not to jeopardize the construction project by blocking the plots of land.
Household housing costs rise by a few hundred per month
From January onwards, households will not only have to expect higher costs for all types of energy, but also higher water and wastewater fees and for district heating and in some places rents will also grow.
As of January, families will have to withdraw several hundred crowns more each month from the wallet than before.
Electricity will be up to 4.6 percent more expensive, gas up to 2 percent and more, in some cities you will have to pay up to a tenth more for water supplies and in some places district heating supplies will also be expensive.
The cost of electricity alone is several hundred kroner a year.
The strong electricity prices have been reduced by all the main suppliers, so debt is the significant promotion of electricity generation from renewable sources, especially from photovoltaic systems.
Gas only gets moderately more expensive, but this is exactly when people need to heat the most and have the highest consumption.
Here, too, a few hundred crowns more can be expected per year.
While electricity and gas are becoming more expensive throughout the Czech Republic, the prices of district heating vary from city to city.
Larger places in particular are planning price increases.
For example, households in Pardubice and Hradec Kr<0xC3><0xA1>lové will have to pay up to 50 kroner per month for district heating from January, more than 1000 kroner more per year for families in Liberec.
The inhabitants of Prague, on the other hand, are facing 9 percent higher water and wastewater charges, and this in case the city increases the infrastructure rent.
If the rent does not change, it is only 6.8 percent.
However, the price in Prague remains one of the lowest compared to the whole of the Czech Republic.
In northern Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and wastewater charges are expected to rise by 7.4 percent.
Huge rental price increases can be expected, for example, in 140,000 rental apartments, where the so-called rental regulation will be eliminated from January.
For example, the housing company CPI Byty, which owns 2500 apartments in <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem, plans to increase rents by a hundred percent from January.
If you do not agree with this increase in rent, the company wants to take legal interest.
The regulated rents, which are still being paid today in nearly 300,000 apartments, are expected to increase by more than 10 percent next year.
Czech children get drunk with farnet and rum beer is out - it just seems too slow
Fernet, Rum and Vodka, exceptionally also a good whisky, which was stolen from the house bar by the father.
These are the drinks, after which drunken Czech teenagers under the age of fifteen most need emergency treatment.
No exception are children who have to sleep their hangover repeatedly in the hospital.
This is evident from the experience of doctors who are confronted with similar cases in the admission of children’s departments to clinics.
“Beer or wine are completely out of fashion because it just takes too long for you to get drunk.”
“Today’s trend is clearly hard alcohol,” said Pr<0xC3><0xA1>vo Lud<0xC4><0x9B>k Pelik<0xC3><0xA1>n, chief physician of the children’s department in the Central Bohemian clinic Ho<0xC5><0x99>ovice.
"Whisky, if he manages to get his father a bottle from the house bar, and if not, then at least Fernet or Vodka.
“Wodka has the advantage that you can mix it with juice, then it doesn’t smell as strong,” explains the chief physician.
The spokeswoman for the faculty hospital Motol Eva Jurinov<0xC3><0xA1> is right.
"Most often it's about distance or rum."
"This is the current alcohol trend, especially in primary schools."
"It was also isolated about Slibowitz, which is taken from home," Ms. Jurinov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
According to Pelik<0xC3><0xA1>n, thirteen- or fourteen-year-old drinkers have long been no exception in hospital admission.
Before the clinic in Ho<0xC5><0x99>ovice, where he has been working since this year, he worked for ten years in the pediatrics department of Motol Hospital, where the ambulances delivered drunken students from near and far.
"A girl had to be hospitalized four times."
“She began her career at the age of 12 when she first received 3.5 per millilitre of alcohol in her blood and in combination with ecstasy,” the doctor described a particularly severe case.
"She was at the exhibition grounds in Hole<0xC5><0xA1>ovice at some dance party."
“The interesting thing was that it wasn’t strange for her mother that her daughter didn’t come home for 48 hours,” he said.
It is precisely the lack of interest of parents or their incredible tolerance in starting up with their own sprouts that is considered one of the main causes of the growing alcoholism of children.
According to experts, it is not a question of true dependence in the true sense of the word in children.
"Under alcoholism, a long-term chronic dependence on alcohol and all related phenomena is to be understood and this is not the case in these children."
For those who repeatedly enjoy alcohol, a negative family-social background is usually characteristic,” explains Pelik<0xC3><0xA1>n, chief physician.
According to Ms. Jurinov<0xC3><0xA1>, the spokeswoman for the Motol hospital, about forty drunk children were admitted to the local department of paediatric and adolescent medicine by mid-November.
However, only cases of heavy alcohol poisoning that required hospitalization are included in the statistics.
Drunk children who are taken home after outpatient treatment by the parents or, if necessary, by the police are not registered.
In addition to the cases where children only drink such a bottle of liquor at the school bench, Mr. Pelik<0xC3><0xA1>n believes there are three seasonal amplitudes to which one hundred percent rely: Walpurgisnacht, New Year’s Eve and the end of the school year.
"The latter for two reasons - either for grief because of the bad testimony or for joy on the holidays."
"On Walpurgis night I have also experienced seven drunk children at once in the recording," emphasizes Dr. Pelik<0xC3><0xA1>n.
A drunk child who spends the night under medical supervision is paradoxically better off than a child who only struggles with an unpleasant hangover the next day.
The headache in the morning, which results from dehydration and glucose deficiency, can be expelled in the hospital with a fluid-spanning infusion of glucose and nutrients that are missing from the organism.
"They are clearly better off, because after the "glory" experience in the evening, they wake up in a good mood without anything hurting."
"They're just a little confused about where they are," admits Dr. Pelik<0xC3><0xA1>n, sometimes spoiling the patient's good mood by adding to the cost of treatment.
Because the transport by ambulance and the night in an acute bed come well and gladly on a few thousand crowns.
“I used this every now and then as a means of education when I directly predicted the children at the visit, which cost their drunkenness and that it may well happen that they have to work all the holidays to earn the money for a single such feat,” added Dr. Pelik<0xC3><0xA1>n.
In his opinion, however, the health insurance companies do not resort to recourse procedures to demand the costs necessary for the healing of the drunken children from the parents.
Two training aircraft L-159 for the first time in foreign hands - in Spain
Two light combat aircraft L-159 out of a total of five, which the Czech Ministry of Defence exchanged for the Casa C-295M transport aircraft, flew to the Spanish city of Seville on Tuesday, where the Spanish aircraft manufacturer Casa - EADS resides.
This is the first time machines of this type have been owned by a foreign army.
So far, they have only been seen in maneuvers or flight shows abroad.
This is the two-seater version L-159T1, which was operated by the Czech army.
The other three aircraft are single-seat L-159.
These are still preserved in Aero Vodochody, the intermediary of this business - the company Omnipol - took over last week.
Jan Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek, a spokesman for the Ministry of Defence, is still unknown when she physically inspects the aircraft from Vodochody.
The one-seat combat aircraft L-159, in turn, were separated from long-term-imposed aircraft, and this was done without further input and investment from the Ministry’s headquarters.
"The double-seated L-159T1 was replaced in its current condition and appearance," Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek told Pr<0xC3><0xA1>vo.
He added that the army would not have to do without two-seat combat aircraft, as in May 2009 the Ministry of Defence signed a 200 million contract with Aero Vodochody for the conversion of four superfluous L-159s to a two-seat version.
A new aircraft has taken over the army in July, the second it wants to take over by the end of this year.
According to Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek, EADS has committed to force the fighter aircraft into the equipment of one of the NATO countries.
"The contract clearly states that EADS is a customer of aircraft L-159 and that it is intended to serve as a training for pilots of NATO countries.
"It is therefore the customer's business in how he realizes the matter," Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek said.
The economic newspaper (HN) had previously reported that the Spanish government has no interest in the L-159.
The trade of five L-159s against a Casa transport aircraft and the purchase of more aircraft for 3.5 billion kroner had been approved last year by the government of Mirek Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek.
At the time, the Ministry of Defence had not advertised a tender procedure for purchasing, but addressed EADS directly.
The defense office at the time argued that this exchange would support the future export of the L-159 abroad.
The Czech army purchased Aero 72 machines, of which it used only 24, the rest they wanted to sell.
The purchase of the aircraft Casa, by the way, should also have a judicial replay.
The European Commission sued the Czech Ministry of Defence at the European Court of Justice because it had to select the aircraft on the basis of a whole-European call for tenders and did not respond to a single manufacturer.
The army has already taken over three aircraft Casa, the last to land at Kbely Airport within fourteen days.
A longer index finger than a ring finger means a lower risk of developing cancer
Men whose index finger is longer than the ring finger are obviously at a lower risk of developing prostate cancer.
This is the surprising result of a study published on Wednesday by the British Journal of Cancer.
This is related to the level of the male hormone testosterone.
“Our results show that the relative length of the fingers can serve as a simple test for the risk of prostate cancer, especially in men up to sixty,” said co-author Ros Eeles, a professor at the University of Warwick’s Cancer Research Institute.
The finger could help determine which men should necessarily undergo a prostate cancer test, especially if there are genetic risks or other risk factors, such as family health problems, Ms. Eeles added.
In the period 1994-2009, she and her colleagues in Britain followed more than 1,500 patients with prostate cancer, while also following 3,000 healthy men.
In more than half of the participants of the study, the index finger of the right hand was shorter than the ring finger.
For these men, the probability of prostate cancer was the same as for 19 percent of men whose ring and index fingers were the same length.
However, in men whose index finger was longer than the ring finger, this risk decreased by 33 percent, in men up to sixty even 87 percent.
The ratio of the length of the two mentioned fingers, which form already in prenatal age, obviously reflects the different levels of sex hormones that the child was exposed to in the womb.
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer index finger.
Previous research has shown that testosterone accelerates the growth of prostate cancer.
V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Pa<0xC4><0x8D>es, a leading Czech geneticist and former chairman of the Academy of Sciences, told <0xC4><0x8C>TK that he was well-known for this study, but he does not yet consider the relationship between the finger length and the cancer risk to be “completely proven”.
Czech Republic in the snow - D1 and D5 are locked
Just like most of Europe, the Czech Republic is also under a snow cover on Thursday morning.
On the roads and footpaths there is mostly snow, the winter servants were in many places all night on the axis.
The D5 motorway between kilometres 89 and 90 in the direction of Rozvadov is blocked by some accidents of trucks and cars and the D1 at Brno is also "standing" in the direction of Prague.
Novinky.CZ told the dispatcher of the Central Auto-Moto Club (<0xC3><0x9A>AMK).
At kilometre 91 a truck crashed, at kilometre 93 two trucks collided, in this accident there are injured.
There are also a few cars in the road.
There are also problems at kilometres 185 of the D1 motorway in the direction of Prague.
Here, too, two trucks collided.
Drivers should drive right behind Brno at 190 kilometres or drive over Brno and drive up at 182 kilometres at K<0xC3><0xBD>valka.
There are miles of traffic jams.
An accident happened on the D11 as well, just at the entrance to Prague.
In Prague itself lies a snow cover several centimeters thick and the thermometer shows minus seven degrees Celsius.
Car columns, for example, form in the town line Prosek, the street <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>rboholsk<0xC3><0xA1> is also completely clogged.
The safest way to get there is by metro.
The trams run with delays, for example on the line between Karlsplatz and Friedensplatz.
At eight o’clock in the morning, the Prague Crisis Staff meets.
There are also problems with the railway and the airport.
The Czech State Railway had to cancel seven quick train connections due to snow damage.
There are problems, for example, on the route Prague - Kralupy or also Prague - Beroun.
Travellers should be informed about the current situation.
Ruzyn<0xC4><0x9B> Airport is closed from Wednesday 11 a.m. until 5 a.m.
Most roads in South Moravia are only accessible with increased caution.
Around Vy<0xC5><0xA1>kov, three side roads are completely impassable, in the vicinity of Brno there are occasional snow sleet and in the vicinity of Blansko one is forced to use snowblowers on some higher roads.
One of the most affected areas is V<0xC3><0xBD><0xC5><0xA1>kov.
There are still three roads completely closed: Rous<0xC3><0xAD>nov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Ku<0xC4><0x8D>erov and also <0xC5><0xA0>aratice - Mile<0xC5><0xA1>ovice.
Here, too, snowblowers will have to be used for snow clearing.
When they become re-driveable, it is not possible to estimate until now.
Caution is advised in the area of the White Carpathians in the Hodon<0xC3><0xAD>n region.
On the roads, which can only be scattered with inert dispersants for reasons of nature conservation, lies a snow cover up to five centimeters thick, <0xC4><0x8C>TK led.
In the Czech Republic, from two to ten centimetres of new snow fell, most in northern Bohemia - sometimes up to 18 centimetres.
In the Moravian-Silesian region, up to 15 centimetres of new snow fell.
In the Czech Republic, however, it slowly stops snowing.
American soldiers have a new “intelligent weapon.”
The U.S. troops have used a new "intelligent" weapon in Afghanistan for the first time, which is known only under its code name XM-25.
The generals hope that this new automatic weapon will influence the conflict with the Taliban and shift the power ratio in their favor.
The new weapon is something like a super-accurate cannon.
Your projectiles are guided to the target by laser with a meeting safety of only a few meters.
The special 25 mm calibre projectiles, designed for this rifle and containing highly explosive explosives, function practically like small grenades.
The projectiles can be programmed in such a way that they can explode not only at the impact on the target, but at any point of their ballistic trajectory.
That is, you can use it against an enemy who hides behind an obstacle - a wall or in the trench.
He is usually not protected from above, so the murderous steel splinter rain from above can easily put him out of combat.
According to Richard Audett, who participated in the development of the XM-25, the new combat rifle is the first infantry weapon to make use of "intelligent" technologies.
"The soldier basically goes like this: he vises the target and sends out a laser beam that determines the distance, so he wins an exact point of sight after which he corrects the angle of elevation, then he just has to press.
"Let's say we measured 543 m."
"When you press down, the gun charges up and shoots the projectile at a distance of 543 meters plus minus one, two or three meters.
400 jobs will be relocated
The Fujitsu Group is relocating its headquarters in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July next year, 400 employees will move their jobs from the previous office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to the Astro Park.
The Japanese company Fujitsu is relocating its headquarters in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the industry giant specializing in computers and their maintenance announced on Wednesday, in July next year 400 women and men will move their jobs from the previous office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to the Astro Park, which is a large office complex on Lyoner Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e in the Frankfurt district of Niederrad.
A spokesperson for Fujitsu said that in the medium term, another 100 jobs of the Group should be accommodated there, which were previously distributed across the region.
The rental offer was extremely attractive, and the large-scale offices in the Astro Park were also better able to accommodate the working methods of the employees.
In Bad Homburg, Fujitsu was also just a tenant.
Bernd Wagner, Managing Director, said: “With Frankfurt-Niederrad, we have found a central location with excellent infrastructure.”
The excellent connection to the airport is of great importance for a global company like Fujitsu.
The new move of an important company within the region yesterday brought joy to the winners and disappointment to the losers.
Frankfurt-based business associate Markus Frank (CDU) said that a "Global Player" was once again won.
This is a “great location.”
Fujitsu fits the city, the settlement is an important impetus for Niederrad.
Bad Homburg mayor Michael Korwisi (The Greens) regretted Fujitsu's decision.
The city was informed of the intention early on by the management.
"We offered our help to the company, of course," Korwisi said.
However, the friendly contacts could not have changed anything about the difficulties of the computer manufacturer with the landlord of the property at Marienbader Platz.
In the end, economic reasons would have resulted.
Now it is about preventing a long vacancy in such a prominent place.
"I hope the owner and landlord of the building will be cooperative."
The house on the Town Hall Square and the neighbouring "Small Vertical" were among the most controversial construction projects of the spa town with the other buildings on Marienbader Platz ten years ago.
As a joint project of the city and a private project developer, a new city entrance was created between the station and the town hall, which caused criticism both because of the massive construction of the areas previously used as parking spaces and the height of the buildings.
In 2001, Feri, the investment consulting and rating company, the software manufacturer for travel distribution systems, started Amadeus, and the computer manufacturer Fujitsu, which was still connected to Siemens, moved the houses.
The buildings used by Fujitsu were acquired in 2006 by the Frankfurt-based German Real Estate Opportunity Group together with the Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund and sold to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid a year later.
Tokyo-based Fujitsu Group is the third largest IT provider in the world.
For example, it provides companies with computers and servers and also provides the necessary service.
The office in the Rhine-Main area is one of the largest in Germany, but far more employees count Fujitsu in Munich.
From Bad Homburg, the Fujitsu Technology Solutions subsidiary is located in Frankfurt-Niederrad, the other subsidiaries at this location are Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
For this purpose, 7,000 square meters were rented in the Astro Park office building.
In the twenty-year-old complex - the name depends on its star-shaped floor plan - the Central Association of Electrical Engineering and Electronics Industry has its headquarters, among other things.
Amazon suspends server - threats against Assange
Wikileaks is increasingly in trouble.
The internet service provider Amazon has banned the disclosure platform from its servers.
Perhaps there is political pressure behind this after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomats-depesches.
WikiLeaks founder Assange is reportedly staying in England.
Wikileaks is increasingly under attack in the United States.
The Internet activists lost access to their previous American server and are now looking for an internet home in Europe.
U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman has called on other countries and companies to boycott WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who is on Interpol’s search lists, is expected to stay in the UK, according to a newspaper report.
"Wikileaks displaced by Amazon server."
“Free speech in the country of the free,” the disclosure activists told Twitter via short news service on Wednesday (local time).
Recently, the internet company Amazon had banned the WikiLeaks documents from its servers.
The Internet activists had resorted to the Amazon Web Service (AWS) when the secret diplomatic deprecations were released to handle the high numbers of access to the documents.
On Twitter, Wikileaks said: “Prima – our dollars are now being spent to employ people in Europe.”
If Amazon had such a problem with free speech, “they should stop selling books.”
Amazon stopped using its servers through Wikileaks after employees of Senator Joe Lieberman investigated, CNN reported, citing Lieberman's office.
The chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee had threatened Amazon with a boycott, the British "Guardian" reported.
"I would have liked Amazon to take this measure earlier in light of the previous releases of classified information by Wikileaks," he said.
Lieberman called for the platform to be banned from using servers in other countries as well.
"Wikileaks' illegal, monstrous and reckless approach puts our national security at risk and endangers life around the globe," the Senate said in a statement.
“No responsible company — whether American or foreign — should help Wikileaks in its efforts to distribute stolen material.”
WikiLeaks founder Assange, who is being sought by the authorities in Sweden for rape, is on Interpol’s search list.
According to a report by the London newspaper "The Independent", the 39-year-old Australian in the UK is staying in the exact place Scotland Yard is known.
The internet activist has always described the investigation in Sweden as an intrigue of his opponents.
Wikileaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London that there had been threats.
"There were even calls for a murder of Julian Assange."
Therefore, Assange rightly fears for his safety, Hrafnsson said.
The WikiLeaks founder will remain hidden.
Hrafnsson obviously responded to statements from North America.
In America, former Arkansas Republican governor Mike Huckabee had demanded that the person responsible for the WikiLeaks revelations be charged and executed for treason.
In Canada, an adviser to head of government Stephen Harper - obviously ironic - said on television that Assange should be "killed" and Obama could "use a drone."
Meanwhile, between the White House and Assange, there was an exchange of blows.
US President Barack Obama’s spokesman, Robert Gibbs, called it “ridiculous and absurd” that Assange had demanded the resignation of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton if she is responsible for recent espionage calls to diplomats.
"I'm not quite sure why we're taking care of a guy's opinion with a website," Gibbs said.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more significant than its website."
The U.S. government is now thoroughly testing the protection of its databases.
As a special representative, the Vice-Director of the Centre for Anti-Terrorism Measures, Russell Travers, was appointed, the White House said.
Travers was responsible for developing “necessary structural reforms” that had become necessary after the disclosure of the message reports by Wikileaks.
The White House also wants to have the ways in which the entire government exchanges and protects information.
The U.S. government also announced plans to ensure the safety of dissidents and activists should they be put at risk by the WikiLeaks release.
“We’ve done everything we can to get in touch with them,” Foreign Office spokesman Philip Crowley said.
“We are ready to protect them if necessary.”
The Ice University
At the "Gelato University" near Bologna, ice confectioners are prepared for better seasons.
The three-day basic course for future Gelatieri has the largest entrance and visitors from all over the world.
Where does the whole ice come from?
From Gelatiere and Gelataio.
The gelatiere, somewhat old-fashioned in German by the ice confectioner, produces the cream according to all the rules of Italian ice-making.
The Gelataio takes the ice cream from the fridge with a spatula, sprinkles it into the waffle and then sells it.
To know this, you do not have to drive to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But if you want to know more about ice, you won’t pass the “Gelato University” of the Italian company Carpigiani.
Eis-Universit<0xC3><0xA4>t established the manufacturer of ice cream machines in 2003 so that the ice cream from its machines meets the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The three-day basic course for future Gelatieri has the largest entrance and visitors from all over the world.
However, there are also several days of special courses around chocolate ice cream and internships in the in-house ice cream shop.
Some dream of a new career in the midlife crisis, others just venture on the smooth ice of their vague yearnings.
This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents - from Brazil to Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, art teacher from California, loves the slow food movement and wants to offer a European quality product in the country of industrial ice cream in the future.
Anke from Berlin is a business consultant and wants to make something of her own after years in a nerve-racking job.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening an ice cream parlor in Cairo.
A man from Malta and a man from Brazil wants to improve the quality of the ice cream in their bars - and the Canadian housewife Julia comes because her children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro-Gelatiere Luciano Ferrari first explains to the participants the ideal properties of the perfect ice cream.
Not only good taste is decisive, but also silky suppleness and good consistency.
In his training, Luciano does not forget the cream of the national and even southern superstructure: "Italian gelato is simply the best - and then there is a lot of romance."
The first step to manufacturing seems simple.
Luciano tipped the basic ingredients of milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large mixer, which heats everything to 85 degrees with an electronic program and then immediately cools to four degrees.
Then he turns a tap on the machine, and comes out a pasteurized white base cream, the basis for all types of milk ice cream.
The teacher is immediately disturbed with questions: Can ice cream be produced only with natural substances without a stabilizer?
How can you let go of your own desire to experiment?
Luciano warns against being led astray by the zeitgeist.
Anyone who talks about ice cream "only from natural ingredients" may have used stabilizers anyway - mostly a natural product, such as guar kernel flour from the guar bean.
Of course, you can also make ice cream without a stabilizer, only then it has to be sold within a day, otherwise it will slump into itself, and the customer bites on loud ice grains.
Certain variations on the matrix are allowed.
It gets more exciting with the aromas.
For the taste of the ice cream, Maestro Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients you buy in the fruit department or in the sweets of the supermarket.
There are also powders and pastes.
"Suppliers will all try to turn you dozens of flavored additives."
“You just have to experiment.”
Either with the fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruits.
Or even with the ice cream from the white base, which becomes a yellow cream with eggs and with cocoa powder as the basis for all kinds of chocolate seductions.
Now students are allowed to use the ice machines.
Luciano allows them to produce four different types of vanilla, chocolate, mocha and hazelnut ice cream - with or without eggs in the matrix, with more or less vanilla flavor or other natural additives.
In the same experiment, the fruit ice varieties are also subjected to the same.
More flavourings, more fruit puree - tasteful is not necessarily better.
Hazelnut ice cream does not necessarily taste more nutty when it contains more hazelnuts.
The most popular kiwi ice makes the working group that uses more fruit, less water and slightly less stabilizer.
First, a balanced mixture really highlights the taste of a gelato, says Luciano.
Ice making is a computational task: If peach puree is used with a lot of sugar, the sugar content must be reduced in the basic recipe.
For lemon ice, an extra portion of sugar is needed.
Luciano draws out a device by which he determines the sugar content of the fruit varieties (wines thus measure the oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately, tables make computing easier.
Making ice no longer requires as much physical use as before.
Not only does the device for the automatic production of the matrix help.
There is also a device in which the finished ice mixture is simultaneously creamy beaten and cooled to minus temperatures.
Despite all the automation, small breakdowns are not enough.
The Brazilian Gustavo cares for himself and his classmates from top to bottom with fruit puree as the oversized bar mixer gets out of control.
“In every course,” says Maestro Luciano, “it’s only a matter of time until something like that happens.”
Controllers in the Twilight
The European Food Authority (Efsa) has been undermining the gene-planting industry.
The expert group Testbiotech now formulates this accusation, which sees itself as an independent institute for the impact assessment of biotechnology.
“It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we’ve documented it well,” said Testbiotech chief Christoph Then on Wednesday in Munich.
The head of the Efsa expert group for genetically modified plants, Harry Kuiper, and another Efsa expert have also been under contract with the Ilsi lobbyist association for years.
It is paid by corporations such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper has played a major role in the EFSA testing regulations for gene plants and is thus in a clear conflict of interest, then criticized.
The EFSA regulations are, on the contrary, identical in terms of the position papers of the Ilsi and thus bear the signature of the industry, which is actually to be controlled by the authority in Parma, Italy.
This is already the second time that Testbiotech has faced a conflict of interest.
For example, a high-ranking Efsa manager was recently without conditions or transition time to the Swiss agricultural group Syngenta – and changed sides.
The Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk (MDR) had also recently revealed personnel links between controlling EU authorities and industrial lobbying, which made the Federal Environment Agency as well as EU parliamentarians sound.
However, the EFSA cannot recognise a conflict of interest.
All serious data are used, including those of industry, as long as they are of high technical quality.
Experts working for Efsa do not require that they have no contacts with the industry.
But you would have to disclose them.
Kuiper grants his work to the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the United States.
This describes itself as a neutral forum for experts from science, industry and politics – including risk assessment for biotechnology without lobbying.
In the case, independent experts such as Then criticise that genetically modified plants are currently approved in animals without any feeding attempt and that the reaction of gene plants to environmental influences is not tested.
“We want to know what genetically modified maize, for example, is doing on the field,” says Then.
Current practice is to test only isolated proteins, but not the entire gene plant, which did not deliver reliable results.
"If you're not looking for the risks, how are you going to find them?" then asks the prosecutor.
Angelika Hilbeck sees this as well.
She has been researching genetic engineering since 1994 and is currently working at the Zurich University of Technology.
The industry is now increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists in this area, as in the USA, in Europe.
There are therefore hardly any researchers who are not affiliated with corporations.
For companies, critical studies are usually not published.
“The industry controls security research,” Hilbeck claims.
The trail of the stones
Uli Gsell has also worried about some, a total of about 400 kilos.
On Monday evening he stood in front of Stuttgart station, the tuba on his back.
It was a demo.
It's snowing.
The story is well known: In September, the excavators had moved on and had begun to break off a large piece of the north wing.
The Stuttgart world was no longer the same: tens of thousands demonstrated against S21, the station’s billion-dollar depression.
When it came to the construction stop, much of the wing was in ruins.
Broken into 6000, 7000 pieces.
Crailsheim shell lime, a soft coarse stone, built between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years old.
He's secured some of the chunks.
"These stones are relics."
"You must not disappear."
He swears, "A cheap and poor stone, simple and earthy."
When he saw one, he smelled like a cigarette.
What he's going to do with the chunks, he doesn't know yet.
Stones have time.
Uli Gsell as well.
The trail of the Stuttgarter Steine leads into a forest near Tübingen on a former ammunition depot of the French army, where Manuel Rongen built his stone empire.
The 44-year-old is dealing with old stones.
He bought all those who fell in love with the demolition in Stuttgart.
“It would be a shame to grind them to gravel or disappear into the landfill,” he says in his office, a wooden bulge that was once a guardhouse.
He told reporters in September that he had bought the remains of the northern wing from the demolition contractor.
But he talked to the S-21 opponents for days.
And he told them that he couldn't do anything for the demolition.
And if it happens now, then it would be the most reasonable if the stones were used further.
About 200 S-21 opponents then took one of the 80-pound quadruples on average, unit price 6.50 to 14 euros.
As a souvenir, but also in the hope of being able to return him during a reconstruction.
500 tons had bought Rongen, 25 large truckloads.
About half are still in the forest, the rest have long been sold.
Garden owners, landscape gardeners, house builders.
They had come from everywhere and had dragged away what luggage and trailer could carry.
The stones of Stuttgart have long been transformed into "M<0xC3><0xA4>uerle" or into limitations of herb beds.
"In fact, this stone is nothing special," Rongen says.
“It wouldn’t be the political component.”
He climbs into his off-road car, makes a tour through his 20 hectare empire.
He studied law and aborted, later biology, then he became interested in computers and eventually became a stone trader.
And stone lovers.
40000 tons of stones are stored.
From all over Germany, he gathered his treasures.
He said he was the Republic’s largest brick-and-mortar merchant.
It's braked.
Artificially carved sandstones lie in the snow.
"They once belonged to the Dresden Marienbrücke," he says.
Elbe sandstone, yellow, warm, it swarms.
"My favorite stone."
It goes up the path through the forest.
It points to a pile: red sandstone, formerly part of Karlsruhe railway station.
And more.
"Beautiful travertine."
Once, the quads were part of the Stuttgart Neckar Stadium’s grandstand.
Everywhere in the snow stones and stories, Cannstatter Travertin from the Stuttgart Police Bureau, reddish granite from the Cathedral of Saint Blasien, Tuff from Heilbronn Hospital.
What work, what effort, what sweat.
When Rongen thinks about how the stones were cut by hand and moved with simple bottle pulls and ox carts, he becomes quite awe-inspiring.
“It would be a scandal if you did something like that.”
He didn’t become rich, he didn’t become rich.
But 14 people are employed by the stone merchant today, besides, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glassblower and a gardener have settled on top of the forest.
“We work hard, but it’s satisfying,” says the rest of the reviewer.
Soon he will have to go to Cologne.
There are also stones to save.
Talent Struggle for High-Potentials
There's a lot of excitement in the buffet.
16 students are pressing for salmon buns, tomato soup and sweets.
The Technische Universit<0xC3><0xA4>t Braunschweig and the car manufacturer Volkswagen invited the mechanical engineering and design students to a workshop.
In a kind of idea competition, they are supposed to team up with VW developers about the car of the future – and get to know Volkswagen at the same time.
In the competition for the smartest minds, many companies are now entering the melee and, like VW, are relying on cooperations with universities.
Your mission: to recruit the most talented graduates as early as possible in the lecture halls before they get to the job market and are recruited by others.
And because the universities do not issue statements about the achievements of their students, they try to see the exceptional talents in practice projects and to bind them to themselves.
On the second day of the workshop at TU Braunschweig, the car company is promoting the talents.
A young lady from the personnel department distributes ballpoint pens, rubber bears and folders with VW logo.
She tells the hopeful young talents of internship programs and student jobs and shows them ways into the group.
Nico Selle from the TU Braunschweig supervises the project with VW.
He sees the benefits for both sides: “Students get in touch with the industry and gain experience.”
"VW can get to know students at the same time, look closer at interesting candidates and think about who would be eligible as an employee."
Such collaborations, according to Selle, are not uncommon.
New is that so aggressively being bullied around the students.
“Otherwise, the focus was more on the technical project,” says Selle.
The struggle for the newly graduated will probably be even harder.
In many industries, companies can no longer choose their employees from a large group of applicants.
Instead, they have to praise themselves and especially to provide highly qualified workers.
In particular, graduates from the engineering disciplines are in an excellent negotiating position.
According to the Association of German Engineers VDI, more than 40,000 engineering posts remained unoccupied in October.
And the so-called engineering gap will become even bigger, according to VDI forecasts.
For the auditing and consulting company KPMG, Roman Dykta goes on the talent hunt.
He organizes elaborate recruiting events such as the KPMG Race, a kind of modern scavenger hunt where participants have to find their way through GPS coordinates.
Eight promising students want to send the company across the U.S. next year.
By the way, participants can look at KPMG branches and get to know the company.
Those who are allowed to participate will decide in two selection rounds in advance.
Only the cr<0xC3><0xA8>me de la cr<0xC3><0xA8>me of the many applicants flies to the USA.
As the high potentials of the universities grow, the guns are getting bigger and bigger, according to Dykta.
“We want to stand out from the crowd with the race.”
"Only a simple sailing trip was too little for us."
For talent hunter Dykta, the bill seems to come up.
"We have been in contact with all participants of a similar action to this day last year."
“Some are about to graduate and want to apply to us soon,” he says.
In addition to direct buhlen on the campus, especially small and medium-sized companies also play a classic role at professional fairs.
"We are trying to reach graduates at trade fairs."
"Sometimes at the Intersolar," says Sitha Stübe, head of staff at solar technology manufacturer Solarworld.
The Bonn-based company employs around 1,500 people in Germany.
Stübe knows about the young people's problems.
Currently, 35 positions are advertised on the company website.
"It is very difficult to occupy vacant positions."
“It takes a lot of time and money,” she says.
Another way is to contact the university professors.
Solarworld cooperates with various universities, such as the University of Freiberg.
"The professors give clues that you can do internships with us or write your diploma thesis."
Expensive promotions are not recommended by the solar specialist.
For this purpose, the company tries to promote itself with other advantages: personal atmosphere, flat hierarchies and easy communication.
“A large group often can’t offer that,” says HR manager Stübe.
Money no longer plays the leading role in job search.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good ascent opportunities are other decisive factors.
Solarworld ranked 55th among Germany’s top 100 employers in a study conducted by the Great Place to Work Institute.
The Institute draws up an annual list of top employers in Germany.
To this end, it asks employees how satisfied they are with their work and their job environment and looks at the framework conditions for employees.
Staff manager Stübe also expects positive points from the jobseekers from the placement.
“I think applicants are especially looking for external reviews about a potential employer,” she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler from the German Employer Branding Academy advises companies that want to build a good reputation as an employer with a long-term strategy.
He advises his clients to be more authentic.
And that means, according to Kriegler, especially internal measures.
“The best way to make yourself attractive as an employer is through your own employees,” he says.
In the industry jargon, the internal employer branding is called employer branding, i.e. employer branding within the company’s own workforce.
“Satisfied employees are the best ambassadors.”
If you treat your people well and identify them with the company, they would advertise to their employer by themselves with friends and acquaintances.
“It’s like a game with gangs,” says Kriegler.
Obama halts new oil drilling
Off the coast of the U.S. state of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico, there will be no new oil drilling in the coming years.
A corresponding ban has been issued by the government in Washington - and thus definitively revoked its previous plans.
Also off the Atlantic coast, new drilling is prohibited for the time being.
Interior Minister Ken Salazar said this on Wednesday.
The trigger for the strict ban, which should apply for at least the next five years, is the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon drilling platform in April.
Before the disaster that cost eleven workers their lives and led to the largest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama, under pressure from the opposition and industry, had signalled his willingness to allow new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
The supporters want to reduce the dependence of the United States on oil supplies from abroad.
Whoever is responsible for the devastating oil spill in the Gulf has not yet been finally clarified.
At the heart of the criticism is the British energy company BP, which faces billions of demands.
A commission of inquiry on behalf of Obama is due to present its findings in December.
In October, Interior Minister Ken Salazar lifted the drill stop after the explosion.
Subsequently, various oil companies immediately submitted applications for new drilling projects.
With tighter controls and stricter security regulations, Obama and Salazar want to rule out a new disaster.
At present, the competent control authority, which had been subject to numerous allegations of corruption, is being fundamentally reformed.
At the same time, Obama has announced that it will close lucrative tax loopholes for oil and gas companies.
The industry is now publicly warning that the volume of exports in the Gulf would be significantly lower than before due to stricter regulation.
"The government's plans are the biggest brake on the growth of the oil and gas industry," the BDO's latest industry survey concludes, ahead of Wednesday's drilling ban.
The American Energy Alliance also laments the uncertainty in the industry: “No one knows what will change with regulation.”
Investment in new funding projects would be postponed until further notice - at the expense of growth.
Ogoniland has been burned
The water in the rivers is oil-brown, it smells like at the gas station: billions of liters of run-out crude oil have destroyed nature in Nigerian Ogoniland.
People live by theft, corruption and illegal oil cooking.
Celestine Akpobari means it well.
"Don't worry," the eco-activist reassures the journalists, "you will still get enough oil sludge in front of the lens today."
The 37-year-old Nigerian has pursued an attempt to expose a boy waving up to the chest in the water with the shimmers surrounding him: in the rainbow-colored water gloss, the scene looks almost pretty.
The fact that brown oil swaths float under the surface is not visible.
She used to gather shrimp here, says Esther Badom on the banks of the Bodo Jetty River.
In the meantime, the slow-flowing waters are completely dead.
Five years ago, large quantities of crude oil poured out of a brushed pipeline into the huge wetland.
Fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo now have to row for six hours to get into fishy waters: the Ogoniland, located in the heart of the Niger Delta, is considered one of the worst ravaged regions in the world.
On the journey through the mangrove swamps traversed by rivers, the whole extent of the devastation becomes apparent.
Instead of bright water, the motor boat blows up brown broth, who dips his hand into the water, pulls out oily fingers.
The roots of the mangrove trees protrude from the ground like black licorice rods, leaving the palm trees to hang their weeds in a sad way.
Bird swarms, as they are otherwise common in wetlands, are sought in vain: as soon as the outboard stays silent, the former paradise, which smells like a gas station, spreads ghostly peace.
“What happens here is ecological warfare,” says Celestine Akpobari darkly, “we live in constant danger to health.”
The war comparison is appropriate.
The settlement area of Ogoni is a battleground fought for decades: here the first explorers from Europe invaded more than 60 years ago, here organized in the 80s with the later-executed writer Ken Saro-Wiwa the first resistance, here the Shell Group had to stop its production in 1993 because it became too dangerous for its oil workers.
Even today, the company is denied the return to Ogoniland: while more than two million barrels of black gold are pumped every day from the entire delta region of Switzerland’s three-fold size, with over 5,000 drilling sources and 7,000 kilometres of pipelines, the oil fields in Ogoniland are too unstable.
Every few hundred meters, steel frames protrude like bizarre sculptures from the water: "Christmas trees" are called the heads of the holes far too tender.
They are up to 50 years old, most corroded to the mark.
Again and again such a drill head breaks apart, says Akpobari, then a constant stream of crude oil flows into the water.
More than two billion litres have flowed into the Delta ecosystem in 50 years, according to experts: year after year, the amount of oil that it pushed into the sea before Alaska at the quarry of the supertanker "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago - one of the largest environmental disasters in human history.
Anyone who is responsible for the ongoing eco-GAU will be disputed about it.
While the Shell Group blames sabotage and organized oil theft for more than 90 percent of the pollution, environmentalists see bursting drill heads and leaking pipelines as the main cause.
Shell set significantly lower safety standards in Nigeria than usual in the world, U.S. scientist Richard Steiner told the company in 2008: “The rate of defects at the lines alone is many times higher than elsewhere.”
In a place that looks like an abandoned, oil-lubricated workshop in the open air, emerges from the mangroves shapes: they are split-naked and oil-lubricated to the neck.
Under one of the many barrels, which are partly connected to tubes, partly arbitrarily scattered on the site, a fire flickers: an illegal small refinery.
In the barrel, the crude oil is heated over the fire for several hours, explains Michael, the head of the group.
First gasoline penetrates through the pipes into the collecting pot, later dripping out at the end of the kerosene line and finally diesel.
For example, Michael and four employees produce up to four barrels of diesel 300 litres a day: "This brings us 34,000 Naira" - around 22 dollars.
Delta residents are using the chronic fuel shortage in the largest oil state in Black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
The ridiculously low price of diesel with almost 40 Euro cents per litre can still subvert the illegal cookers: because they get their raw material for free.
It comes from "bunkers" who tap the pipeline network across Ogoniland: this way, according to experts in the entire Niger Delta, the country loses at least 16 million litres of crude oil every day.
However, only a disappearing small part of the temporary intermediate stockpiled raw material is illegally refined: the lion’s share fills organized criminal networks, including politicians and high-ranking military personnel, in tankers and aggravates it on the world market.
The debate as to whether the environmental disaster is more due to the circulation of the population or the lax mode of production, considers the activist Akpobari to be purely academic.
"If the oil companies were not perceived as invaders and if they had not destroyed the livelihoods of the fishermen so thoroughly, there would be neither sabotage nor theft and illegal refineries."
In the meantime, Ogoni’s relationship with Shell was largely destroyed to such an extent that only one withdrawal from the Group would be eligible: “Perhaps other nationalities like the Chinese are better off.”
Michael gets nervous.
"The greatest time you're going away," says the muscular oilman.
"Every minute the soldiers can come."
If the illegal oil refiners are caught by the special forces unit, there is no threat of arrest, but a painful lubrication.
Even the soldiers who come mainly from the north of the country, like all Nigerians, want to profit from the raw material.
“This damn stuff has brought our country to the dog in every way,” says Akpobari.
Investigators discover dangerous construction defects in A380 engines
The A380 seems to have a major security problem.
Investigators have discovered a possible construction defect in the investigation of an emergency landing machine that could lead to a "catastrophic engine failure".
Qantas now wants to sue the engine manufacturer.
At the beginning of November, passengers of the Qantas-Airbus were apparently more fortunate than before: the Australian Air Safety Authority has identified a major safety problem in its investigation of the engines of some A380 machines – and is now warning of a possible construction failure.
The potential defect would have serious consequences: in the case of an oil hose connection, it could cause fatigue cracks and leaks, the Authority said in a statement published on Thursday.
This could have led to “a catastrophic engine failure.”
Rolls-Royce-made engines were affected in 20 A380-series aircraft.
Below is the Qantas Airbus, which had to land in Singapore on November 4.
The Australian airline has now taken legal action against the British turbine manufacturer.
She filed a plea in law with an Australian federal court in Sydney, which allows him to take further legal action against the company.
Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce said his airline would demand compensation for the incident in early November.
During the fire of the engine, parts had dissolved and the wings were damaged.
Rolls-Royce made an oil fire as the cause of the damage.
After the incident, up to 40 engines have now to be replaced worldwide.
The Australian investigators announced further safety tests on the superjumbos equipped with the affected engines.
The safety recommendation was the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, ATSB spokesman Martin Dolan said.
The security issue was considered to be sufficiently important to inform all concerned.
After the emergency landing of the Qantas machine, the airline had kept its A380 fleet on the ground for weeks.
Singapore Airlines temporarily left about three of its eleven A380s on the ground.
Lufthansa replaced the engine in an A380 as a precautionary measure.
The double-story aircraft is the largest passenger aircraft in the world.
State-wide snowfall triggers traffic chaos
Germany in white: Snow has fallen almost all over the country overnight.
There is chaos, trains and flights on many roads.
In car accidents, at least three people were killed.
Winter frosts Germany: At icy temperatures, almost the entire Republic is snowed down to Thursday at night - which leads to traffic chaos in many places.
In the north and east, there are partly 15 centimetres thick snow blankets.
On several highways and many roads, traffic is severely restricted.
On the A7 near Flensburg, the winter service was in continuous use, but was not finished with the constantly reawakening snow.
In addition, heavy bows swept across the Baltic Sea coast.
The Federal Office for Maritime Navigation and Hydrography (BSH) expects storm surges with water levels of 1.2 meters above normal levels on the Baltic Sea coast of Schleswig-Holstein from the morning.
In Saxony, snow damage on the highways and federal roads caused considerable problems.
According to the meteorological center Meteomedia, therefore, the alarm level in Saxon Switzerland was in a violet trend - the highest level ever.
Partly, 30 centimeters of fresh snow fell there, fresh and strong winds caused some disappearances.
There were several trucks and cars there that night.
Also in Saxony-Anhalt, the police authorities reported major disturbances on the streets.
On the A2, snow and wind led to traffic jams and traffic jams.
In Thuringia, the snowfalls affected the A4 and A9.
According to German Railways, there are significant disruptions in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
Snow on the tracks, fallen trees on the tracks or destroyed overhead lines and turns are the main problems.
In Saxony, long-distance traffic from Leipzig to Nuremberg had to be stopped.
In the Thuringian Saalfeld, an ICE had to stop its journey to Munich.
The 165 passengers were supplied by firefighters and rescuers with blankets, food and drinks on the train.
Snowstorms swept over the streets.
At major German airports, the snow winds lead to numerous flight failures.
Some cancellations have already been reported in Munich, according to a spokeswoman for the Flight Information Centre.
According to a Fraport spokesperson, 40 flights have already been cancelled in Frankfurt am Main.
The winter service is in continuous use.
Although there are only a few stranded passengers at the airport, there are still almost 400 field beds available for them.
There were accidents on many roads on Wednesday evening.
In the evening, a truck driver was killed in a collision with a train on a railway crossing in Ostholstein.
The driver was slightly injured.
A similar accident occurred near Nuremberg due to snow-covered roads: here too, a truck was caught on a railway crossing because the vehicle was stuck.
The driver died.
Four passengers were injured on the train - the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was therefore closed until the morning hours.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died after skipping her car at Aschaffenburg on a slippery road.
However, the meteorologists have a good news: Although the snow will still be loose and powdery, and therefore will swirl even in light bows.
But the wind will weaken.
Only the Baltic Sea is hit by fast and stormy winds.
However, it remains very cold - locally up to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for its twin towers
Deutsche Bank wants to separate itself from its landmark: According to a newspaper report, the Geldhaus is looking for buyers for the two office towers at its Frankfurt headquarters.
Up to 500 million euros could bring in the property.
Deutsche Bank has just made its corporate headquarters beautiful: the twin towers in the Frankfurt banking district have been modernized; meanwhile, the bankers were allowed back to their old workplace.
But now the financial group apparently wants to recover the cost of the renovation - and is looking for a buyer for the two high-rise buildings, as the "Financial Times Germany" writes, citing a spokesman.
Reasons for the planned sale did not mention the speaker.
“We always check whether it makes more sense to own or sell real estate ourselves and then rent it back,” he said.
This means that Germany’s largest credit institution will relinquish its headquarters after a short period of time.
The bank had only taken over the double towers in mid-2007 for 272 million euros from the investors of an in-house fund and subsequently rehabilitated it.
The energy conversion slowed down the data after around 200 million euros.
A sale would probably bring a lot of money to the bank.
Industry experts estimate the value of the newspaper's towers, which have since been renamed "Greentowers", to around 500 million euros.
Whether the buildings will be sold again to a fund owned by the bank or to an independent investor is still open, the spokesman said.
Thousands of people mourned for their dead friend
More than 10,000 people in New Zealand have thought of the spilled miners who were declared dead after several explosions in a mine.
The bodies still could not be recovered because the security situation in the shaft is still precarious.
Nearly two weeks ago, a violent explosion had occurred in the Pike River Mine near the town of Greymouth.
29 miners between the ages of 17 and 62 were buried underground.
A probe had been dropped into the shaft of disaster, but had not discovered a trace of survivors.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and further subsequent explosions, no rescuers were able to descend for safety reasons.
After the second fierce detonation, the authorities and experts assumed that there was no longer a chance of survival for the buddies.
So far, the bodies have not been recovered.
Now relatives and friends remembered the dead with a memorial.
Tens of thousands of people had gathered in Greymouth on the New Zealand South Island in bright sunshine.
They remained silent for two minutes.
In honor of the scattered miners, 29 tables were set up on which helmets, lamps and the names of the companions could be seen.
Pictures and personal items, including clothes and surfboards, also found their place here.
In front of the country’s government buildings, the flags blew half-mast.
New Zealand had hoped that the miners would come back to the surface “from the depths of the earth,” New Zealand Prime Minister John Key told the attendees of the commemoration.
“But they never came home.”
He could not complete the death of his son until he had not seen his body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was spilled into the pit.
In addition to the Prime Minister and members of the victims, several foreign diplomats took part in the commemoration.
At the first explosion on 19 November, miners of British and South African origin were also spilled.
Rescue workers began to extinguish a fire inside the coal mine on the South Island of New Zealand.
Once the explosive gases have been displaced, they will begin to cool down the glowing temperatures inside the mine, police President Gary Knowles told reporters.
To hell, warriors!
Is Splatter suitable for art cinema?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn re-imagines old genre boundaries with his fighter epic "Walhalla Rising".
What audience might the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn have thought of when he shot "Walhalla Rising"?
A captured Viking warrior with only one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) frees himself from his tormentors and turns his opponents with almost superhuman powers - sounds ideal for young male spectators in search of bloody action, precisely because our hero likes to use rabid methods of killing and his enemies have already ripped the guts out of the living body when he has torn the bad mood.
On the other hand, one eye, as it is actually called, says the whole film about no word, and even the other figures can be torn to one or two sentences or a few painful death screams at most.
Otherwise, silence is silenced and swallowed up in Scotland’s creepy beautiful hilly landscape, which the Viking world of about a thousand years ago offers the backdrop.
Ideal for adult cineasts with an interest in existentialism and very quiet camera rides.
If a film has multiple audiences, it’s only a pity if it excludes each other.
Director Winding Refn has been regarded as a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino since his wild and styled drug dealer trilogy "Pusher", but stubbornly refuses to make his works accessible to the mainstream or to the Arthouse with a little more humor or a little less brutality.
Most art cinema friends are likely to be deterred by the buzzing brain mass and the guts.
The action fans die of boredom at the latest when, for freely interpretable reasons, the eyes of a force of violent Christian missionaries break up to Jerusalem via ship and settle for an eternity in sleet and fog before the team apparently arrives in America and continues to remain silent there.
No wonder, then, that "Walhalla Rising" in Germany has not found a movie rental and has now only been released on DVD.
This is a pity, especially because of the magnificent pictures, but also because behind the pretentious to blood-stained fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade a sometimes exciting piece of cinema is hidden that deserves some attention.
This film is not about dialogue or a strict plot, it is all atmosphere, a film-making fever room.
And from that there is no escape for the viewer.
Refn hardly gives him a moment of relaxation, and with his icy pictures and the dark trance-like soundtrack, he slowly tightens his throat, but above all with the unimaginable hatred that strikes him from the hearts of the characters.
Only a little blonde boy who stands by his side faithfully keeps himself something like innocence, everyone else is driven by anger.
Mostly the one-eyed hero whose motives are never explained, but who eventually becomes a warrior from hell for enemies and temporary allies, possibly an ambassador of the devil himself.
It means destruction, but perhaps only for the depraved.
"Walhalla Rising" is an enigmatic film that one can hate and admire, to annoy, excite and wonder.
An experience.
Enigmatic earthworks
The nuclear power agency IAEA has new clues to a secret nuclear program in Syria.
The country, however, refuses to comment on this - nor does it allow controls.
At midnight from September 5 to September 6, 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighter jets attack a mysterious, cube-shaped building in Syria.
It stands on the banks of the Euphrates; the next larger city, 30 kilometers away, is Dair as-Sour.
Their name appears in documents of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) when it comes to the reactor that Syria allegedly built in the quadratic with the help of North Korea, hidden in a valley that drains from the current.
According to a U.S. intelligence briefing from the CIA in late April 2008, the reactor, also known as the nearby town of el-Kibar, would have been well-suited to producing plutonium from which nuclear weapons could be built.
For other purposes, on the other hand, the technique of the fifties is hardly suitable.
The CIA presented a video presentation with blurry satellite images.
By computer animation, she blinded what components of the reactor were said to have been before the destruction, which was a reduced copy of the North Korean model from the Yongbyon nuclear center.
In addition, she presented photos showing the building from the vicinity or even the interior.
The reactor was standing just before commissioning, it said, but had not yet been equipped with fuel rods.
Today, more than three years after the bombardment, is hardly more known than at the time, indeed the puzzles became larger over time.
Former U.S. President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that the CIA was quite certain before the attack that Syria was building a reactor in el-Kibar, but saw little evidence that there was “an active nuclear weapons program” in the country.
Some intelligence agencies in Europe prefer to be even more cautious and only speak of a “probable reactor,” even if they consider the CIA presentation “plausible.”
They lack hard evidence, as well as the IAEA.
Asked how safe he is to have a reactor in front of him, a high UN diplomat in the summer only responded lapidar that the IAEA has “enough material to ask questions.”
The “unused military building” was said to have been destroyed by the Syrians, and the area was thoroughly planned.
Nevertheless, in June 2008 an IAEA team under former chief inspector Olli Heinonen found traces of uranium produced by humans in el-Kibar.
In addition, the IAEA received satellite images of commercial vendors from a Member State directly after the attack, which are likely to be more meaningful than those presented by the CIA.
However, these recordings are not available on the market because the unknown client - perhaps Israel - has bought them exclusively.
The IAEA cannot therefore independently verify its authenticity.
Syria has always claimed never to have run a secret nuclear program or built a reactor.
Uranium comes from Israeli weapons, Damascus said.
However, the IAEA rejected this as unlikely after analysis of the particles.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss it – as well as satellite imagery.
In addition, it denies the inspectors a second inspection in el-Kibar and access to the ruins of the bombed building.
But Israel is also silent.
"We will never comment on this," Prime Minister Ehud Olmert recently confirmed the official position.
Thus, the investigation of the case since June 2008 drags on without results and "is increasingly developing into a serious credibility problem for the authority", as a high Western diplomat at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna admits - after all, there is a serious violation of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in the area over which the IAEA is watching.
As a key to progress in the Enlightenment, the IAEA apparently sees three other facilities to be "functionally connected" to the alleged reactor - and, unlike this, still exist.
So far, the inspectors have not disclosed which facilities they are dealing with, what function they have or what makes them appear suspicious.
According to information from the Süddeutsche Zeitung, they are internally referred to as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandayah, in turn derived from nearby cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) has identified these locations and found a building complex at Masyaf on satellite images, which is most likely one of the suspicious objects.
It may be located in or right next to a military base - precisely with this justification, Syria denies the IAEA access to the three locations.
In Vienna, the Syrians feared a fishing expedition – that the IAEA would be sent by the US to spy out military facilities.
Because the nuclear detectives had become aware of the facilities through a tip of the US intelligence services.
The IAEA has evidence, including satellite photos, that material was transported back and forth between the three locations and the quadrangle at the Euphrates.
A senior Western diplomat in Vienna said at least one of the facilities could be “related to fuel production.”
However, there are "no indications of sensitive activities", i.e. uranium enrichment or reprocessing; processes necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The reactor type is operated with uranium that is not enriched.
But where the uranium should have come from and where the plutonium for the bomb should have been separated from later, there are plausible assumptions about these central questions.
It is also unclear whether debris that could hold valuable traces were stored in the three locations.
As if the hundreds of truckloads had disappeared from the ground, no one wants information about where the debris remained.
The salt mine al-Tibni, located just a few kilometres from el-Kibar on the other side of the Euphrates River, which Syria investigated in 1998 for its suitability as a camp for radioactive waste, is considered unlikely by the IAEA.
Former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley had recently linked them to the reactor in an analysis of satellite images for Jane's Intelligence Review.
However, footage from the orbit shows that Syria was carrying out groundwork in the three suspicious locations and removed large containers after the IAEA had requested access.
This may be a coincidence, but it has hardly helped clear the suspicion.
In addition, diplomatic circles say the IAEA has spent several months developing a plan for inspections there that should allow Syria to keep any military secrets - only the effort shows how much the inspectors' interest is.
However, Damascus also cancelled this proposal.
Had Western diplomats in Vienna complained a year ago that the reactor had been destroyed, so the matter has not been of high urgency, for example, U.S. Ambassador Glyn Davies has been bringing so-called special inspections into play for a few months, one of the sharpest means the Vienna nuclear authority has to enforce controls.
IAEA chief Yukiya Amano, who would have to propose these inspections, has already spoken of "an option for which I am open in the future", but he still hesitates.
There is a high risk in this path: First, a majority of the IAEA’s Board of Governors is needed for this, and some of the 35 countries represented there are anything but eager for escalation.
On the other hand, as a diplomat points out, "What if they don't find anything in the end?"
Love in times of war
Since Angelina Jolie started working on her unnamed directorial debut in the summer, there has been trouble.
She wrote the script herself, a love story between a Bosnian woman and a Serbian man.
You don’t know much more about it, but that’s enough for unrest.
Persistently, the rumor remains that the woman, a Muslim, falls in love with her Serbian rapist during the Yugoslavian war.
Bosnian women's associations immediately protested, after which some days of shooting planned in Sarajevo were moved to Hungary in the short term.
Meanwhile, the film is shot in Hungary and in post-production, but it is still being protested in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the organization of female war victims wrote to Jolie about the UN refugee relief agency UNHCR and requested a meeting with the actress, a Bosnian newspaper has now reported - Jolie herself is an ambassador to the UN refugee relief agency.
She is not diplomatic - she offered the women a meeting in Hungary weeks ago, but they refused.
The meeting must take place in Bosnia, Hasecic said.
There have been no love stories in rape camps, and Jolie’s attitude towards the victims tells her enough about the script.
According to the UN refugee agency, her organization has recommended that Jolie be dismissed as an ambassador, the Guardian reports.
But what exactly did Jolie write for scenes?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, who got to read her screenplay, has granted Sarajevo a screenplay permit after some time - it is not quite clear why Jolie did not come anyway.
The young author herself asserts that she does not pursue political intentions with her film, has worked with much effort in the Yugoslavian conflict, wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and give a voice to all involved sides.
In terms of content, however, it remains vague.
A second synopsis of the film on the net, which then sounds quite different: The lovers knew each other in it before the outbreak of war and meet again when she, a Bosnian Muslim woman, is taken to a Serbian camp where he works as a guard.
What sounds a lot different than the variant "rape victim slams into torture servant".
That Jolie's film actually starts before the war - so much is certain.
The pressure on them, Jolie said, was “unfair and based on misinformation.”
Now, all she can do is give her the Hollywood hackers peace: by illegally posting the script, like so many before, on the Internet.
Nothing like leaving here.
This evening, it’s finally going well for the Irish.
No trace of grief.
For this, the home team dominates its guests from Sweden, Finland and the USA too much.
The fans yell for joy at cracking loud music, they stomp with their feet.
The Bailey pub in South Irish Cork trembles because players throw and hit table tennis balls over a three-meter distance in beer cups.
"Bierpong" is called the bizarre spectacle, to win there is 500 euros winning prize plus airline tickets to Las Vegas for the beerpong World Championships in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet guy; this shrill drinking game and the restrained computer scientist, that doesn't really fit together.
And yet the 26-year-old tries to have fun distracting himself from the boring question of what the future will bring.
His plan is not to have fun in Las Vegas, he will hold job interviews in New Zealand in January.
“I have a very soft feeling,” he says.
"It's so far away from home and I still don't have work there."
After all, his girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland - "she had jerked, jerked her desired job as an event manager, maybe a good sign," says the young man, smiling.
Due to poor prospects at home, two of Tanner’s three siblings have already been looking for their happiness abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now has a job as an IT consultant in London.
The boys go: As with the Tanners, it looks on the island in many families.
100,000 Irish will probably leave the country in the near future, experts from the ESRI Economic and Social Research Institute in Dublin predict.
By 2015, they expect 200,000 emigrants.
For the small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants a heavy loss.
If the forecasts are true, there will be an emigration wave comparable to that under which Ireland suffered in the 1980s.
After a decade of recovery, which brought great prosperity to the Irish, sadness is now spreading again.
The economic crisis is particularly concerned with the young, well-educated Irish, for whom up to now it has only gone uphill.
Job loss and social decline seemed absurd in the boom years.
Everyone was needed, there was money in abundance.
Meanwhile, three out of ten women and men under thirty are without work.
In the Irish Times, there are plenty of readers’ letters from young emigrants who complain: “Everything goes down the stream in Ireland.”
“There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers – but who can, goes away and our country loses a whole generation.”
"The last one, please, turns off the light."
Law student Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish Student Union, sees a gloomy future as the government is only making eyelashes and is no longer offering the young people prospects for the future.
“They’re reducing the minimum wage, but they don’t have a strategy on how to create new jobs,” the 20-year-old says.
She observes how her fellow students hang themselves from one unpaid internship to the next.
Her biggest concern, she says, is to have to emigrate yourself in four years.
"This thought is sad and depressing."
Men like Stephen McLarnon try to occupy the topic positively.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo", a trade fair that offers an all-round service on the subject of working abroad.
“For beginners, working abroad is a great opportunity to take the first steps on the career ladder,” says the manager.
On his website, photos show surfers in Australia and snowboarders in Canada.
The message is clear: working abroad is not a galley service, but also brings freedom and fun.
Se<0xC3><0xA1>n O'Donovan has known for half a year how it feels to build something elsewhere.
Because there was nothing left to do for the 29-year-old engineer in Ireland, he is now working with 15 Irish colleagues on construction in Germany.
In Gelsenkirchen they are currently raising a fashion house.
In January we continue to Hanover or Berlin, to the next project.
O'Donovan's home is now rarely seen, as he makes extra layers to pay off the loan for his home.
“The situation is already a bit crazy,” he says, as he steps over the threshold of his house for the first time after a long time.
"I'm making money in Germany for a house in Ireland where I'm almost never again."
He laughs a little embarrassed and walks through chilled rooms.
The small house stands in a fine residential area with well-kept front gardens, in the entrances parking large, expensive cars.
Together with a sister, O'Donovan bought the house for €380,000 four years ago - 100 percent credit-financed.
“It was crazy times, there was simple money without many questions,” he says.
Is he afraid that it could go wrong with the loan?
O'Donovan thinks for a while, pours hot tea and says, "I don't have any children to feed through and I'm young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start again."
The civil engineer does not like the lament that he often hears at the moment.
"No one has to go hungry - our situation is by far not as dramatic as it was in earlier times here on the island," he says.
“Working abroad for a while isn’t the worst thing that can happen – maybe we feel like Irish.”
He laughs and then tells of his father, who went to England in the last major economic crisis.
"After seven years, he was back and life went on in Ireland, quite simply."
Cian Tanner likes this idea.
Leave the future open and just look at how life goes elsewhere.
He has a few years of work in London and why shouldn’t he and his girlfriend be doing well in New Zealand?
But there is one thing that worries him these days: the celebration of his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin.
He fears that it might end up in a good-bye party.
“Just don’t have too many emotions,” he says, drinking a big sip of his beer.
"Good-bye, that sounds scary."
"Let's call it a walkaway party, quite casual, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games."
The Democratic Routine
The democratic movement in Latin America is becoming stronger, as is the support of private companies.
Crime is a bigger problem than unemployment.
In many parts of the region, Brazil’s influence is greater than that of the United States.
These results were obtained by the Latinobar<0xC3><0xB3>metro survey, which was conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively in The Economist.
This survey has been conducted on a regular basis since 1995 and thus shows the change of opinion in this region.
Two facts are particularly important in this year’s September and October survey.
First, the good mood in Latin America
And secondly, the growing interest in democracy and its main institutions.
In many countries on the South American Pacific coast, the democratic movement has increased sharply (see Table 1).
In Peru, for example, where the economy has grown by about 6% annually since 2002, the number of democracy advocates rose from 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
Even in Mexico, where the economy has recovered since the sharp collapse of last year, such a trend can be seen.
However, only half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the region’s most populous countries, are convinced Democrats, which lowers the regional average (see diagram 2).
About 44% of respondents said they were satisfied with the democratic practice of their country, which is as many as last year, but 25% more than in 2001 (chart 3).
About 34% trust the Congress of their country and 45% of their government. Both values correspond to those of last year, but show a significant increase compared to 2003 (17% and 24% respectively).
A decade ago, Latin America’s economic crises undermined efforts to achieve more democracy.
This continued even during the global economic crisis, perhaps because the countries of Latin America experienced only a brief recession and recovered quickly.
In addition, the poor were caught up by a stronger social network.
(According to reports by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America this week, in 2009 the poverty rate in Latin America rose only slightly and fell by 32% again this year.)
But there are strong mood differences from country to country (see diagram 4).
Brazil’s strong economy and the popularity of outgoing President Luiz In<0xC3><0xA1>cio Lula da Silva is reflected in a widespread thinking of progress.
In Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more noticeable and violent crimes have increased, this is less so.
For the second time since the start of the survey, many respondents in Latin America see a greater problem in crime in their country than in unemployment (see diagram 5).
About 31% say that either they themselves or a family member were the victims of a crime last year, but compared to 38% last year, values have fallen, reaching the lowest level since 1995.
The increase in economic performance is reflected in the increased support of the private sector and the market economy: approximately 71% of respondents nationwide stated that the private sector is indispensable for development, in 2007 it was 56% (see diagram 6).
About 58% said that only the market economy can bring their country progress, compared to 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela have maintained this view (and 80% are for a private economy), although their left-wing president, Hugo Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez, nationalized many private companies.
Brazil has the largest weight in the region, according to 19% of respondents (18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, unchanged since last year) and Venezuela (9% compared to 11% last year).
Respondents in Mexico and most of Central America, on the other hand, see the United States as the most influential country, with this role being taken over by Venezuela in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
An election slump
No one expected the elections to be perfect on November 28 in Haiti.
But the facts far exceeded the fears of the electoral assistants who rushed to the aid of the besieged country.
Overcrowded ballots, multiple votes cast, ballot papers in the gutter, destroyed polling stations, and intimidation were only part of the problems.
Elections opened with hours of delay.
Many Haitians, many of whom had become homeless by the January earthquake, roamed around in search of an option.
After all, some gave up completely.
A dozen presidential candidates, including some suspected top leaders, demanded the repeal of the election results due to an alleged fraud.
There were some violent protests throughout the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, the head of the UN mission in Haiti, called the election “as quite good in many respects.”
According to a cautious statement by observers of the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community, “these irregularities, however serious they may be, do not necessarily invalidate the process.”
In other words, the show goes on.
The election authority, allegedly committed to the unpopular outgoing President René Préval and his candidate, Jude Célestin, will announce the preliminary results on December 7.
The expected election is scheduled for January.
There is still hope in the election.
The two leading opposition candidates, rap musician Michel Martelly and former First Lady Mirlande Manigat, have withdrawn their initial indifference lawsuit.
If Jude Célestin, who has little or no approval from the voters, declares the polling station the winner of the polls, this could lead to problems.
Due to the cholera epidemic and the fact that more than 1 million of the earthquake victims still live in tents, a small turnout was feared.
On Election Day, many Haitians were prevented from voting by a lack of organization.
Shortly before the start of the election, about 250,000 ID cards needed for the election were not yet distributed.
There is a lot at stake.
The donor countries consider a legitimate, recognized government as an important step in rebuilding Haiti.
The Haitians themselves are of the same opinion.
Secretly in the middle
In the weeks following her husband’s sudden death, Argentina’s president, Cristina Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez, experienced a wave of sympathy that pushed her popularity rate up by 20 points to over 50%, the highest since her election in 2007.
However, whether this will help you re-election next year depends on whether the visibly grieving Cristina Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez is more willing to compromise than her late husband, her predecessor and political partner Néstor Kirchner.
The signs for this are not clear.
Néstor Kirchner, who also steered economic policy after his wife’s election, often drew up budgets that did not take full account of tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the presidential couple to spend the extra revenue at their own discretion.
On paper, the Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez government lost the majority in Congress last year.
But the opposition is divided and Kirchner's death after a heart attack on 27 October led to further divisions.
Some regime critics from the ranks of the ruling Peronists stood behind Cristina Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez.
But after chaotic meetings (in which one parliamentarian slapped another in the face and others accused the government of bribery), Congress failed to pass the budget for 2011.
“I’m not going to talk about it,” the president said.
The 2010 budget is now also valid for the next year, giving the president even more opportunity to spend money at her own discretion.
The economy is running hot: it is likely to grow by up to 9% this year.
The official rate of inflation currently stands at 11.1%, but numerous private estimates – and wage demands of the unions – drive the value to almost 30%.
Kirchner, who took office in 2003 when Argentina was shaken by economic crises, declared growth and poverty reduction as his main goals, not the fall in inflation.
He refused to cooperate with the IMF, harassed the private sector, and purged the National Institute of Statistics and Census INDEC, which subsequently favored official inflation statistics.
Can Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez now take a more moderate path?
She called the private sector and the union leaders for talks.
According to official reports, wage increases are expected to be limited to 18% next year.
The high world market prices for Argentina’s agricultural products have given the economy a strong boost.
However, inflation undermined the growth spurt by a major devaluation in 2002.
For this reason, Cristina Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez may want to reconnect Argentina financially to the rest of the world.
Earlier this year, the government reached an agreement with securities holders who had rejected the country’s previous debt restructuring in 2001.
Now Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez seems to be pushing for an agreement with the Paris Club funders to whom she owes about $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners had always rejected a review by the IMF, as usual elsewhere.
But last month, the Minister of Economic Affairs, Amado Boudou, announced that the fund will provide "technical support" in the creation of a new national consumer price index, which looks like this would be the first step towards cleaning up the INDEC.
It is not known whether Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez will be politically active even without the support of her husband after the end of her term of office.
If so, it needs the support of the middle class, which has largely enough of churchism.
When the Argentinians return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy that was brought to her will be leveled.
If she wants to win another election, she has to decide whether to quietly and quietly cancel many of her husband’s political decisions.
Poor applause for China
Taiwan’s voters are slowly approaching closer ties to the mainland.
What does Taiwan think of its big brother beyond the strait?
On 27 November, more than 7.5 million voters, 70% of whom are eligible to vote, rose to elect mayors and city councils in the five districts, which is considered to be the broad rating of President Ma Ying-jeou.
By building ground-breaking business relationships, including a partial free trade agreement, Ma himself is a symbol of relations with the mainland, and his policies have changed relations with the Chinese motherland for the first time since 1949.
Ma passed the exam, but only barely.
Although his Kuomintang Party (KMT) represents three of the five mayors, it did not receive a majority vote.
Instead, the Democratic Progress Party (DPP), which advocates Taiwan’s greater independence, received nearly 50% of the votes that KMT received 45%.
In a presidential election, this would have been a problem for Ma.
Since his election two years ago, his party’s vote share has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP even moved into the city councils together with the KMT.
During the election, the usual occurrences in Taiwan such as truck convoys with rioters, flag-swimming mass parades and only sparsely clad dancers occurred.
There was even the obligatory, mysterious assassination attempt.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan and honorary chairman of the KMT, gave a speech on the eve of the election to a KMT candidate,
When a man from the crowd shot him in the face, Lien was wounded and a blind man was killed.
Interestingly, it is not clear whether the shooter wanted to kill Lien or settle a dispute with the candidate.
Regardless, according to Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the DPP, the attack affected the election and put the DPP in a bad light, giving the KMT more votes.
China may have been the biggest winner of the campaign.
Remarkably, relations with the mainland were not discussed.
Instead, the candidates debated plans for social housing and job creation.
The Taiwanese love their actual independence and reject China’s military threat.
For this reason, the KMT does not like to focus on its relations with the government in Beijing.
But this time, the DPP also avoided too much fueling the anti-Chinese feelings.
She responded to the new awareness that Taiwan’s economy cannot survive without China.
Ma, for his part, would like to be confirmed that the majority of Taiwanese support his China policy.
The Beijing government will continue to pursue its strategy of attracting Taiwan back to the Community with economic incentives.
China immediately sent a negotiator to Taipei to prepare a summit meeting on investment security and medical cooperation.
It certainly wants political integration, but the most important thing first.
It would be better to wait until after the 2012 presidential election.
The DPP has since reinvented itself.
Two years ago, she was severely weakened: former party leader Chen Shui-bian was in prison for corruption.
During his presidency from 2000 to 2008, he vehemently advocated for absolute independence.
But under Tai’s reign, a new generation of moderate politicians developed and the DPP is fighting for the voices of the professionals and youth.
Tsai found great support as a DPP presidential candidate, such as Su Tseng-chang under Chen.
Her party is now doing everything possible to show that she is also able to build close relations with Beijing.
Tsai is planning a forge of ideas as a point of contact between the DPP and China, but this requires unbiased discussions.
Tsai publicly stated that her party offered a “confidential alternative” to Mas’s quick approach to China.
Chen seems very upset about this change.
From his cell, he explained that the DPP candidates would have done better to insist on Taiwan’s independence.
He even called on the Pragmatist Su to renounce the presidential candidacy.
Even without Chen’s interference, the DPP is hard to choose its potential candidate.
The KMT will have to undergo its own self-analysis.
Mas values are bad, despite the rapid economic growth; the KMT candidates wanted to run their campaign without him.
The main reasons for his unpopularity seem to be unemployment and the ever-increasing gap between the rich and the poor.
According to a KMT spokesperson, he will redesign his cabinet as well as local facilities.
The strong appearance of the DPP suggests that Taiwan only favours re-approaching only to a limited extent.
At the same time, most Taiwanese see economic cooperation with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, "there is no turning back."
Grammy nominations: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding has surprisingly been awarded in the Newcomer of the Year category
If you appear at the request of a president, people will notice.
President Obama himself asked Esperanza Spalding to perform at the ceremony at the 2009 Nobel Prize ceremony, and now the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer was nominated for this year’s Grammy in the Newcomer of the Year category.
Given that Spalding has already been a celebrated star in the jazz scene since their 2008 album "Esperanza", the nomination seems a little unusual, but it complies with the Grammy rules, according to which an artist may have released a maximum of three albums before the release of the album, with which he became known to the general public.
Their ambitious 2010 album, "Chamber Music Society", is certainly a step forward. And with its powerful voice and a good sense of pop, funk and Latin music, Spalding can be quietly compared to Norah Jones 2003, whose great success in 2003 as a jazz performer in this category of nomination Spaldings comes closest.
In addition, the album "History" of the Vijay Iyer Trio was nominated in the category Instrumental Albums, which resulted in a huge success for the critics.
Competitors include "Moody 4B" by experienced saxophonist James Moody and "Positootly" by keyboardist John Beasley.
Trombone Shorty, a rough-legged favorite from New Orleans and frequent guest in HBO's "Treme", has been awarded in the category Contemporary Jazz, where otherwise more albums by Stanley Clarke, John McLoughlin and Jeff Lorber can be found.
The Secret Societ of the wild steampunk musician Darcy James Argue received well deserved attention in the category of a large group, so he competes against the Billy Childs Ensemble with his chamber jazz and the adventurous Dave Holland and his octet, whose life-ablum "Pathways" is a good example of a bassist as a democratic band leader.
Grammy nominations: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey lead in the classical categories
The classical nominations for the 53rd Grammy Award include a colorful mix of musicians and composers from all over the world.
The list is led by Michael Daugherty's "Deux Ex Machina" for piano and orchestra with five voices, and Steve Mackey's "Dreamhouse", an eclectic orchestral work, with three voices.
Among the nominees with connections to Southern California is the Estonian composer Arvo P<0xC3><0xA4>rt with his Symphony No. 4 "Los Angeles". This piece was commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonics and premiered at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The L.A. based composer Avner Dorman was also nominated for his mandolin concerto.
Classical nominations are divided into 13 categories, from orchestra, opera, choir to solo recordings.
In the category of classical producers, five artists were nominated this year - Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Among the nominated classical albums are Bruckner's Symphony No. 3 and 4 from the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty's "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" played by the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey's "Dreamhouse" from the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati" performed by various orchestras and artists.
In the opera category, Berg's "Lulu from the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasses "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" from Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariaho's "L'Amour de Loin" from the German Symphony Orchestra Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin's "The Enchanted Wanderer" from the Orchestra and Chorus of the Mariinsky Theatre; and Arthur I.
As composers, P<0xC3><0xA4>rt was nominated for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatamente Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer" for a Grammy.
P<0xC3><0xA4>rts Symphony No. 4 was premiered and recorded at Disney Hall on January 4 by the L.A. Philharmonics under the direction of Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The 30-minute play is titled "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to former oil magnate Mikhail Chodorkowski, who is in prison in Russia.
Dorman's "Mondoline Concerto" received a nomination in the category Instrumental Solo with Orchestra.
The composer from L.A. stated that he wrote the 15-minute piece specifically for the mandolin artist Avi Avital, who performed the concert with the New York Metropolis Ensemble.
"I used sounds from the Middle East and numerous North African sounds and rhythms," Dorman said in a telephone interview.
Conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the category of orchestral performance for a recording of Stravinski's works with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under his direction.
As instrumental soloists, pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin, organist Paul Jacobs, violinist Julia Fischer and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson were nominated.
As vocal soloists, only women were nominated this year, including Anne Sofie of Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonov<0xC3><0xA1>, Vivica N<0xC3><0xA4>chtex and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the category of classic crossover, soprano Jessye Norman was nominated for her recording "Roots - My Life, My Song".
Mosque in Temecula wins approval of planning committee
The construction of a mosque in Temecula, after a five-hour, often hot public hearing, found the unanimous commitment of the local planning committee.
Critics accused the project of promoting both terrorism and traffic congestion.
However, according to a statement from the Commission on Wednesday evening, the new religious centre is in line with local regulations and will become an aesthetic eye-catcher.
"The project is supported by many good people - Christians, Jews, Bahais, and many others," Hadi Nael, chairman of the Islamic Center of Temecula Valley, said on Thursday.
“As an American, it makes me proud.”
"It shows that justice prevails."
“There are few opponents,” he added.
"They're just very loud."
"There are wonderful people living in this valley."
The meeting began at 18:00 and the discussions for and against the construction of the center lasted almost until midnight, with votes on both sides being fairly evenly distributed, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The debate was continued on the newspaper's website.
“There is no America anymore,” said one comment.
"It's another planet of the monkeys, and the Statue of Liberty is dead in the sand."
“America is in the end.”
Planned Islamic centers have also led to protests in other parts of the country, for example near Ground Zero, the scene of the terrorist attacks on the City of New York on September 11, 2001.
In Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmoush called for non-violence.
His community of about 135 families has been living peacefully in Riverside County for years, but they wanted a bigger and better place than the camp they rented together with a water filter plant manufacturer.
The new, approximately 2,300 m2 mosque in Mediterranean style is said to have two minarets and be about 13m high.
It is to be built on the approximately 17,500 m2 plot on Nicolas Road near Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still object to the project at the city council.
Arsenic-resistant microbe could enable new life forms on Earth or elsewhere
The discovery of a foreign species of bacteria that can live on arsenic, among other things, opens up new possibilities for new life forms on Earth and elsewhere.
Although scientists discovered this unusual bacterium here on Earth, it is in their view a sign that life is possible even without the elements previously considered vital.
"This organism has two possibilities."
"He needs to grow either phosphorus or arsenic."
“This makes it something very special, although it’s almost a kind of ‘foreign’ form of life,” Paul C.W. Davies of Arizona State University and co-author of the report, who appears on Thursday in the online issue of the journal Science, said in a statement.
So far, six main elements have been considered vital - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur.
But as the scientists found out, the bacterium in California’s Mono Lake grows even further when it replaces phosphorus with arsenic.
“You wonder what else is possible,” said Ariel D. Anbar, a co-author of the Arizona State University report.
The discovery is an important step in the search for extraterrestrial life, as scientists must recognize life and its forms, Anbar said.
The study deals with microbes found on Earth.
The announcement of a press conference in which no details of the discovery were announced gave rise to widespread speculation on the Internet that the report might be about the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
This is not the case.
The discovery "shows that organisms can initiate biochemical processes in other planetary systems using other elements and that the 'standard elements' that we believe are absolutely vital are not necessarily fixed," said Charles Cockell, a professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute at the Open University of Milton Keynes in the United Kingdom.
Cockel was not part of the research team.
"This work is a novelty because it shows that in basic biochemical processes and structures one element can be replaced by another," Cockell added.
This discovery was not accidental.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA’s Astrobiological Institute, who led the study, chose Mono Lake because of its high arsenic content.
Since arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar, they assumed that microbes exposed to both may be able to replace one element with the other.
"The toxicity of the arsenic is mainly due to the chemical behavior similar to phosphorus."
"This makes it difficult for the organisms to distinguish one element from another."
"However, the difference is so great that arsenic works differently than phosphorus, and it gets into our biochemical system, where it almost smears everything," explains Anbar.
The researchers exposed the bacterium GFAJ-1 to an increasing arsenic concentration, adapting and growing.
Although the microbe grows better in phosphorus, it can also survive in arsenic, showing that an arsenic-based life form can occur naturally, either on Earth or on another planet or moon, on which arsenic is more common.
According to Jamie S. Foster, professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, the idea that phosphorus can be replaced by arsenic is not new, but so far there has not been a working example.
Arsenic was more common in the early Earth years, she says, so science has assumed that early life forms have used it.
"This gives reason to believe that life may have evolved differently than it did in the early Earth Age," said Forster, who was not a member of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Health Authorities.
Other stolen exhibition dogs found in Compton
The remaining two of the four exhibition dogs stolen in front of a Bellflower motel were found on Thursday, according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Office.
The four exhibition dogs - two Akitas and two Pembroke Welsh Corgis - disappeared on Tuesday, when unknowns stole the 2006 Chevrolet Express van, in which the animals were housed in front of a Bellflower Motel 6 at night, the authorities said.
Two of the dogs were discovered on Wednesday afternoon, and the last two on Wednesday evening, explains Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
"The good news is that the dogs are well," Whitmore said.
"They're in good condition."
"They were returned to their rightful owners."
Whitmore did not provide detailed information on the location of the dogs nor on the circumstances that led to their discovery.
"The investigation is still ongoing."
“We don’t want to say that anymore,” Whitmore said.
"We're following some tracks."
The dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were not available for information on Thursday.
They welcomed their two dogs on Wednesday afternoon in a district animal shelter in Downey.
Representatives of the sheriff found the van and the two dogs in different locations in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a 3-year-old male, and Didi, a 10-month-old female - were unharmed, according to the authorities.
But the Corgis Bunny and Peter, who wanted to present Rickard and Peek this week on behalf of their Japanese owners at the competition, remained missing until Wednesday evening.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were in town this weekend because of the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship in Long Beach, because Trace was supposed to participate in the competition.
As Peek told the Times on Wednesday, the other dogs should participate in other competitions on the days before the AKC/Eukanuba show.
Southern California is a stop on the almost one-month tour of the couple from dog show to dog show.
On Monday evening, Peek and Rickard checked into the motel.
They often stay in motels and park their van in front of their room window.
They took three more dogs - a boxer puppy, a Parson Russell Terrier and a Brittany - to their motel room.
The thick-skinned Akitas and Corgis stayed in the van because it was cooler there.
They left the window wide open so that the dogs had fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported their car stolen on Tuesday at 6:00 a.m.
Peek promised anyone who could give a clue to the corgis, a finder's wage, and microchips were implanted for the animals to identify.
On Thursday, it was not yet clear whether a finder’s salary will be paid.
The lion roars again after court approval of MGM restructuring
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, MGM finally got the green light for a new start.
A New York bankruptcy judge on Thursday officially blessed the “prepared” plan to pay off the $5 billion debt and pave the way for the 86-year-old entertainment company to make new films and television shows.
According to Thursday’s statements, the plan meets the requirements of U.S. bankruptcy law, so that the relaunch of MGM under the direction of Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, the founders of Spyglass Entertainment, will no longer stand in the way.
The number of employees is reduced from over 400 to about 320.
For MGM, Chapter 11 will not actually enter into force until JPMorgan Chase has completed a planned $500 million bond to finance the new MGM productions.
At the moment, a consortium of the investment bank, which is itself raising $75 million, is running the company, which is expected to be funded by mid-December.
The restructuring of the studio began in May 2009 with the order to the investment bank Moelis & Co, the company management who struggled with interest payments of $300 million/year, to help solve their financial problems.
In August, CEO Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO at Enron and restructuring expert, who became known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis & Cooper’s efforts to solve MGM’s financial woes and pay out the studio’s more than 140 runners took longer than expected.
After months of discussions, the parties decided at the end of 2009 to offer the company for sale.
But the auction attracted only a few bidders and no one wanted to pay the $2 billion demanded by the creditors.
In the spring of this year, it all began when the MGM team started the restructuring plan, which was finally signed by the creditors after months of debate and internal disputes at the end of October.
If MGM has officially outlasted the bankruptcy in the next few weeks, Moelis and Cooper will receive a multi-million dollar bonus for their work.
The share for Moelis & Co., which has already received $1.2 million, amounts to $9.5 million.
Cooper, who was paid $375,000 a month to run the company, receives a "success bonus" of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production at MGM. This year, the studio released only one film and created an annual plan with seven or eight films to be released in cinemas in early 2012.
They are also planning two films after "The Little Hobbit" in co-production with Warner Bros.
The studio needs a separate bond between $265 million and $275 million for its financial contribution to these two films, which are to be produced under the direction of Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who financed about 18% of the MGM loan, attempted to merge the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, whose largest shareholder he is.
However, the last negotiations between the two companies did not result in any results.
Tech Toys keeps your gift budget in balance
This year’s favorite among the gifts is the iPad, possibly followed by a Microsoft Kinect video console. Both players can tear a significant hole in your gift budget.
An iPad costs as much as five BMX wheels for $99, while the price for a Kinect game equals about 10 classic jump ropes or about 48 cans of play-Doh.
But you can save your gift budget.
Recently, I visited three electronic toys under $80 – a Wal-Mart, a Toys "R" Us, and a BJ's Wholesale Club.
I immediately realized that Moore’s law had come into effect, and this year the technology toys are more powerful and cost slightly less than last year.
And although fewer new toys with their own website appear, the most well-known of these, Webkinz and Club Penguin, is a broader offer.
There are more and more button cell-operated toys on the market, and many contain rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(If not stated otherwise, all prices of Toys "R" Us.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, for children 3 years and older) are plush figures, as tall as guinea pigs singing a note when pressed on their stomachs.
Pressing once corresponds to a note, by pressing several times you can play a song.

Note: Once you have started pressing, you will no longer be able to stop.
For a combination of sending and dancing, the Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price $60, for children from 2) is the best choice.
Based on the Elmo Live technology developed last year, the animatronic doll offers interplays like 'Simon says', and thanks to the novel hinged feet with wheel blocking, it dominates the Moon Walk.
Kids who tested the device use Mickey as a dance teacher, but their parents complained about the lack of volume control.
If you are a child of the 80s, remember certainly Alphie, one of the first computerized learning toys.
Now he's back (Hasbro/Playskool, $40, for kids from 3), with a whole bunch of question cards that can turn a car ride into a lesson, with a better-skilled auto-correction function as a teacher.
If you don’t want to trust your child with your smartphone, here are three independent alternatives.
MobiGo by VTech ($60 for children from 3 to 8) is the cheapest and most user-friendly solution, equipped with a qwerty keyboard, but the games included on it are not as instructive as the games on the Leapster Explorer ($70 for children from 3 to 12) which, after Leapfrog's first major revision of the Leapster series, is equipped with a new, brighter screen.
None of the versions are compatible with older cassettes.
Fisher-Price’s iXL ($90 for children from 3 to 7) uses a system similar to iTunes for the games and eBooks, and thanks to the SD card drive, family photos can also be viewed on it.
Finally, there is Scrabble Flash ($30 from Hasbro, for children from 8 onwards). The five blocks are no larger than a matchbox and have their own LED screen.
The game is about putting the blocks together before time runs out, which is great for an improvised lettering competition.
More and more toys have some sort of online connection.
If you go to the toy stores alone after the offer, Webkinz and Club Penguin are the most important.
For example, to give your child an online animal at Club Penguin, you can buy a Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match Figure Pack ($5 for children from 6 to 12) containing a coin with a secret code.
If you enter the code online, your child will receive enough credits in the Club Penguin Store for two more parts.
These can be roller shoes or a puffle fabric.
The latest head cell-powered microrobot, Hexbug Nano ($10 for children over 5) is no bigger than the head of your toothbrush.
The beetle moves quickly on 12 vibrating silicone legs in any direction.
It's fun to send him through a maze of blocks.
And he holds out a lot.

Police operations in China are becoming more gentle
Like a training officer, Tang Shenbin stepped over an urban square, checked his nervous subordinates and issued commands with military authority and muted voice.
He wanted his female members of Chengguan - China's robust city order guards, feared and despised for their arbitrary raids and their propensity to violence - to impress the spectators.
"Stand straight!"
"Look straight!"
"Show them," he whispered to them, "how pretty girls are like that!"
Four girls, barely out of the teenage age, with white gloves and identical olive green jackets and pants stood tight.
Four pairs of black pumps were in straight line.
Four neat hats sat perfectly on the hair held with blue-white striped loops.
“For me, they look average,” Mr. Tang remarked modestly.
"Models are pretty."
Several governments have already tried to polish up the image of China’s city inspectors.
In a city, all new applicants must have a university degree.
The province of Guangdong introduced a bright blue uniform instead of the grey green.
Wuhan in central China replaced violence with low-starting: in 2009, 50 officials reportedly circled a misplaced snack cart and stared at the operator until he packed in after half an hour and left the place.
Xindu, a municipal district in Chengdu with 680,000 inhabitants, wants to fundamentally change the image.
Since 2003, 13 women have been strengthening the urban police strip, specially selected for their appearance, good figure and youth.
They should give the brutal police a softer, feminine aspect.
Unfortunately, Scarlett Johansson would not be able to improve the bad image that the Chinese have of these city commands.
Right, the critics say.
Unlike the police, these officials may enforce the city laws only by means of fines or other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese media routinely show a different picture.
In January 2008, officials in Hubei Province beat a spectator to death when he filmed them with his mobile phone as they struck down a protest against a garbage dump.
Last year, a training manual of Beijing officials was stolen and published on the Internet, describing how offenders can be beaten without bloodshed.
This year, a Shanghai watermelon dealer suffered brain injuries after a hand-mix with five officials.
A violent video game that can be downloaded from the Internet shows officials trained in China in an attack on street traffickers.
"Chengguan scares the government," the national newspaper China Daily lamented last year, after further controversy over the tactics.
The newspaper called for a “really thorough cleanup.”
Skeptics find the current approach to be clearly inadequate.
When the district sought eight female recruits by advertisement in October, an editorial in the Beijing Evening News questioned whether the women had real tasks or should only serve as optical distractions.
Probably both.
According to the job advertisement, women aged 18 to 22 were sought with good figure and "harmonic facial features".
You should be above average in size - over 1.5m or 5 feet, 2 1/2 inches.
The employment relationship ends at the age of 26.
According to officials, the work for women over 25 is too physically exhausting.
"The most important thing is their image," an unnamed district official told the quasi-government website Rednet.com.
"Whether the candidates get the job depends first on their external appearance, such as size, weight, facial features, etc."
Then comes temperament and "inner qualities".
“Female Chengguan are like flower vases,” he said, adding, “but beyond that, they have other duties.”
Zheng Lihua, deputy head of the district's municipal administration, does not wish to accede to this description,
However, admitted that in China size specifications in job advertisements for both sexes are not uncommon.
The same goes for even facial features.
Whether this is to be equated with good looks is controversial in China.
But people with disabilities or physical disabilities do not need to apply.
"Unfortunately, we cannot use lames or humpbacks here," Mr. Zheng said.
“Your image would not be good.”
Liu Yi, patrolling on Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22, has apple trays and a well-shaped mouth.
She didn’t feel like sexist that so much value is placed on her appearance.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asks with an ironic look.
Her colleague with the grumps, 21-year-old Xu Yang, commented, "We have the task of representing the image of the city."
According to their data, they do not regret the short-term attitude, as they have more ambitious career plans than simply shunning traders through the streets to prevent them from doing business.
Every morning, the strip deals with about twelve street vendors who try to sell as many rolls and tofu dishes as possible on foot or on a bicycle before they are chased away.
"Mr. Wang, please get out of here."
"We have told you this so many times!" explains Ms. Xu to a dealer who had fled on foot and had temporarily abandoned his noodle kitchen, which had been fixed on a bicycle cart.
According to the officials, the activity is rather monotonous than exhausting.
“It’s almost the same every day,” explains Huang Jing, 20, who studies in leisure sales.
"All routine."
One reason for this is that female officials are not allowed to confiscate the merchandise of traders, like their male counterparts.
They can only threaten offenders to report them to their male superiors.
This is to protect them from public hostility, which officials in China are often exposed to.
This year, hundreds of residents of Kunming, the capital of Yunnan Province, ransacked after the rumor circulated that Chengguan officials had killed a trader.
More than a dozen police officers and Chenguan officials were injured in the nightly incident, 14 government vehicles were overturned or set on fire.
Xindu has been spared from such violence so far.
But unrest cannot be ruled out.
Only two blocks away from the quiet Baonguang Square, where the female officials patrolled that morning, over 50 people gathered at a street corner.
Officials had confiscated a motorcycle that was repaired on the pavement instead of in a workshop, contrary to regulations.
The owner shouted Zeter and Mordio.
After 15 minutes of hesitation, the officers made their way to their vehicles with a grim face and continued with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a male strip coordinator, stayed behind, turning his white name tag to remain anonymous.
Like their colleagues, the coordinators - men over 40 - play a purely supportive role.
But they were not trained to present a clean image.
"Sometimes we go verbally."
“Sometimes, but also physically,” Mr. Li says soberly.
"Most of the time, people start the fight."
Attorney General Will Not Charge Senator Ensign
Attorneys at the Department of Justice have acquitted Senator John Ensign of the charges brought against him after his affair with a former electoral assistant and his attempt to lobby her husband, the Senator’s attorneys announced on Wednesday.
This decision ends the most serious lawsuit against Senator Ensign, the Republican from Nevada, until the scandal that caused headlines across the country and put a damper on his career, he was considered a possible Republican presidential candidate for 2012.
As Senator Ensign's office announced, he was "highly pleased" with the verdict after the one-year investigation.
However, the Senate ethics committee could still impose a disciplinary penalty.
According to Ensign’s lawyers, they were informed by the Department of Justice that the investigations against Senator Ensign had been stopped and that there were no further charges in this matter.
The Justice Department did not want to comment on the case.
The verdict was a surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Department of Justice, and in their opinion there was sufficient evidence that Ensign had violated the lobbying ban.
Interviews, emails, and other documents first published in the New York Times in October 2009 gave rise to the assumption that Ensign Douglas Hampton, one of his electoral assistants, helped to lucrative orders to buy his silence over an affair with Hampton's wife Cynthia.
Cynthia Hampton served as treasurer during Ensign's election campaign.
Ensign contacted some political friends to get Hampton to work. According to the documents and interrogations, he took over for them after hiring Hampton's lobbying work.
Since Hampton was recently still in Ensign's electoral team, he was not allowed to lobby for his former employer or the entire Senate for a year.
According to ethics experts, the unusual agreement between Ensign and Hampton, who were close friends before the affair, violated the so-called ban on revolving door lobbying.
According to the published evidence, "everything seems to be about an agreement and a violation of the revolving door statutes," said Stanley Brand, a Washington attorney specializing in the defense of clients targeted by the government.
While the Department of Justice officially refused to disclose the reasons for the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other Ethic attorneys said the Ministry seemed very cautious in taking up political charges after a variety of defeats that were pursued by the media with great interest, including the decision last year, leaving the indictment against former Senator Ted Stevens due to misbehavior.
Prosecutors “are obviously terrible,” said Melanie Sloan, the chairman of the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics Association in Washington (an organization whose goal is to combat corruption in U.S. parliamentary and government circles), a group of lawyers who have brought various charges against Mr. Ensign to court.
“This basically means that senior government officials can now assume that the laws do not apply to them,” she added.
Paul Coggins, chief defenseman of Mr. Ensign, said in an interview that he received a phone call from a prosecutor on Monday and another the next day, in which he was told that the ministry would not bring any lawsuits against his client.
Mr. Ensign's defenders had cooperated with the prosecutors to convince them that the Senator, as his office reiterated in a statement on Wednesday, had "acted in accordance with the law."
Mr. Coggins refused to explain in more detail the legal arguments he had brought against the prosecutors.
"I'm not comfortable going into the details of the conversation between the Department of Justice and me, only so much has been said: we think we made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to stop the investigation for a separate lawsuit by the ethics group, after which a payment of $96,000 from Mr. Ensign's parents to the Hamptons violated the Federal Election Act.
The Electoral Commission said there was not enough evidence that the money was anything but a gift.
NV Energy, a large company in Nevada that long supported the Senator, was one of the companies in which Mr. Hampton found lobbying work thanks to the help of Mr. Ensign.
An e-mail from December 2008 proves that after the company continued Mr. Hampton as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensing's chief of staff, John Lopez, had an interview with Mr. Hampton, in which he informed him that he "attacked" at the Ministry of the Interior for one thing.
Mr. Ensign was also meeting with Mr. Hampton and another Nevada customer, Allegiant Air, for lunch and asked the Minister of Transport to arrange a meeting on behalf of the airline after that Mr. Hampton had stopped for lobbying.
Last year, when information about this affair first came to the public, Mr. Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned his position in the Senate, where he had been in fourth place in the Republican ranking.
After not noticing for many months, Mr. Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he was seeking a third term in the Senate.
In the announcement that Mr. Ensign is no longer the target of police investigations, his press secretary, Jennifer Cooper, told the Senator that the ethics commission is very quick to follow the example of the Department of Justice and to stop its investigations.
"Senator Ensign is looking forward to continuing his hard work in the service of the people of Nevada," she said.
Cheshire call draws attention to Twitter
Half a dozen of them tipped away in the riots in the courtroom.
In the minute, they sent their reports of horrendous witness statements via Twitter.
In the end, according to the defense, there were more than 140,000 Twitter messages about the process of rape and on-bed chained children in a house that went up in flames.
On Thursday, Steven J. Hayes, who was accused of killing three members of a Cheshire, Connecticut family, will find an official end when the judge's verdict on the jury's death sentence falls.
However, Mr. Haye’s lawyers have already filed applications before the court, explaining the reasons for an appeal and which the courts will employ for years.
One of the most provocative reasons is that the intensive reporting of the process – including the extensive use of Twitter by average reporters – has led to a “circus atmosphere” and such widespread, immediate penetration of stirring details, so that the jury has been inadmissible influenced by public outrage.
This opposition could lead the appellate courts to deal with the question of whether the new technologies will make new rules in the courtroom necessary.
"As I have experienced during this process, I believe it is really a danger if the entry of the new technologies into the courtroom affects the right of each individual to a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullman, Mr. Haye's chief defender.
The chief judge, Jon C. Blue, of the Supreme Court of Appeals, rejected the motions by decision last week when he said that the New Media would be “carefully controlled” and that there was no evidence that the jury had been driven by passion.
But that was certainly not the last word on this matter.
For decades, court filings have found that reporting on notorious cases raises doubts about the fairness of a trial.
In his 1966 historic decision, the Supreme Court of the United States overturned the ruling against Dr. Sam Sheppard, a Cleveland osteopath who allegedly killed his wife, and said in his decision that there would have been a "carneval atmosphere in the courtroom" due to the New Media.
Some people believe that the television series and feature film "Auf der Flücht" is based on this crime.
Some lawyers say court claims that Mr. Haye’s conviction half a century later could follow the argument that new rules have become necessary to regulate the communication pathways out of the courtroom that were still unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard’s case.
"There is a good reason to be concerned about the influence of the New Media in processes pursued by a broad public," said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School who investigated the death penalty in Connecticut.
Professor Donohue said some appellate courts might be intrigued by the idea that restricting immediate communication from the courtroom could make the processes fairer.
The Twitter affair is just one of many that Mr. Hayes’ lawyers set out to discuss for years and thus delay a conviction.
The defenders also claim, for example, that Mr. Hayes may have already been convicted when Judge Blue had not allowed them to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them gruesome crime scene photos during the jury selection.
Some of the jurors have said photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48 years old, and her breeder, Hayley, 17 years old, and Michaela, 11 years old, would have filled them with disgust.
The defendants say they would also question the constitutionality of the death penalty Constitution, arguing that the judge had mistakenly exchanged a juror who had been a critic of the prosecutor’s office, and that he had inadmissible pressure on the verdict when he had made the unusual decision to release the jury over the weekend.
The jurors were not isolated.
However, their arguments about the impact of detailed reporting on the process may attract the greatest interest.
In a lawsuit filed last month, they found that the case had dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed by the candidates during the election campaign for the governor’s office and for the U.S. Senate.
They argued that the New Media had continuously rekindled the flames of emotions about the case.
“Such a daily rush of media whistleblowers, cameras, and reporters outside the courtroom,” the lawyers wrote, “has not been experienced before in New Haven and perhaps even nationwide.”
Her focus on Twitter reporting is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists said that the claim that these direct messages are more upbeat than reports that are being reported more slowly is a tech-hosted look that impoverishes reporting on future processes.
However, some lawyers said that appellate courts would often face the argument, social and technical changes needed to be adapted by the courts.
Mr. Hayer's lawyers reinforce this claim.
In their opposition, they referred to the Supreme Court’s 1966 ruling, which annulled Dr. Sheppard’s conviction on the grounds of reporting, and made it clear that the New Media required new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "represents Sheppard against Maxwell of the 21st century."
Can politeness connect the separation?
After a campaign of blasphemous words and negativity, little politeness has erupted in Washington this week.
Is it the omen of a real two-party cooperation or a moment of illusion before you quickly return to the struggle of the parties in the capital?
The meeting on Tuesday between President Obama and the tops of Congress did not bring a breakthrough into the big issues that one had to deal with during the so-called "lame duck session", the session at the end of a government period in which no more decisions are made.
After all that you hear, it was neither a polite discussion between two different sides nor a consideration of their shared responsibility to govern, but rather an empty episode of a partial collection of points.
The public meeting of the President’s deficit commission on Wednesday was also civilized, despite the political differences that continue to exist between the members.
It seems clear that close interaction over a period of months creates mutual respect that obscures the ideological divide that continues to divide members.
This is hardly enough to say that a new era of cooperation has begun.
Both sides are now in a test phase - one in which one of the other signs of willingness to cooperate and compromise is called for, while one tries to weigh the limits of public opinion and the patience of the voters after a renewed party war.
Therefore, the meeting on Tuesday itself and its assessment by the participants were limited to a minimum of claims or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and Republicans are too big and too deep to expect a rapid change in the atmosphere that prevailed over the past two years.
Whether it’s taxes, donations, health or expectations, the two sides are miles away from each other.
Last but not least, the November election in Washington voted mildly for at least a short time.
“No question, the tone has changed,” said Pete Wehner, an official representative of the Bush administration, who is now working for the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
“This is inevitable after elections.
Elections awaken partisan passions that die again.
And that's good."
On some issues, especially those on the agenda of the “lame duck session,” Republicans and Democrats have little choice but to find a solution.”
Bush’s tax cuts will end at the end of the year, and no one will support that.
Both sides want to find a way to get some or all, whether temporarily or permanently.
Similarly, a compromise on increased unemployment benefits is to be expected, if only because Republicans can’t afford to believe the favored tax cuts for the rich, while denying unemployed workers support.
After the meeting on Tuesday at the White House, the optimism has increased that one can agree on these issues during the "lame duck session" and at the same time also ratify the New START contract.
But William Glaston of the Brookings Institution warns that successful cooperation on urgent issues of the lame duck session "does not necessarily lead to permanent cooperation of the parties when the new 112th Congress is convened in January.
Instead, he says, a phase of non-conformity is more likely, perhaps even inevitable.
“After the things that need to be done are done, this short-term psychology will turn into confrontation,” he said.
Wehner is also skeptical – and this skepticism is shared by many – that politeness leads to true cooperation.
"I see a lot of what happens from today to 2012 as a pre-fight, or shadow boxing, for the main event of 2012," he said.
The reasons for this have a lot to do with the presentation of the new Republican majority in the White House and with the tea party voters who served their education.
As concerned as the Republican leaders may be that they are playing too high poker, they know that they must try to keep up with their promises to lower government spending and put an end to health reform.
These party lines are already made clear in the initial reactions with regard to the recommendations of the deficit commission, which include tax reform and the raising of some taxes, as well as the raising of retirement age and the lowering of government spending.
Vice-Presidents Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken on one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and, according to their own opinion, have pushed so much to put the deficit issue on the public agenda that it can no longer be ignored.
But they need 14 of the 18 votes within the Commission to make their plan an official recommendation and they are struggling very hard to get even close to that number.
The greatest resistance is found in the elected representatives of the committee, since in financial matters, at least today, there is little room for manoeuvre or little sympathy for compromise.
Galston predicts two phases in the struggle between the White House and the Republicans in Congress.
The first fight will take place next year in the form of party clashes, when Republicans challenge Obama regarding the state budget, taxes, and health care system, later followed by a phase of greater bipartisan cooperation.
What will lead to this change?
The public opinion.
It has been proven that, despite the partisanship of the current election, the majority of Americans still want the two parties to work together.
If confrontation leads to a dead end, as happened in 1995, then both parties must pay careful attention to the public response.
Whoever is condemned to lose will have to change the course and seek compromise.
This may indeed be an optimistic view.
Partisanship and polarization are now larger than in the mid-1990s, and they seem to be a greater ideological gap between Obama and Congress Republicans than between President Bill Clinton and Republicans at the time.
At the same time, the activists of both parties see 2010 as a mere prelude to a far broader election in 2012.
In this way, the courtesy shown this week may be welcomed by many Americans.
But it will take a lot more effort on both sides to find a common denominator in the questions that still separate the two.
US leaked document portrays Moscow as a port of corruption
The control of the city lies in the hands of the "Kleptocracy" and it passes on to the Kremlin part of the bribery and protection money it collects, as reported in February by the American Embassy in Russia in a memo.
Both the police and the state security service are blackmailing high protection funds so that they can maintain their expensive standard of living in Moscow, it says.
They collect money not only from legitimate businesses, but also from organized criminal gangs.
Every layer of bureaucracy – which Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called “vertical of authority” – takes its share of the money that the leaders are moving up.
The memo, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was published by WikiLeaks on his homepage on Tuesday.
The memo is based on sources whose names have been edited.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still Moscow's mayor, and it accuses him of corruption.
He was fired in October by President Dmitry Medvedev, but there is little evidence that he had been cleared in the meantime.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a well-known construction company, have repeatedly denied corruption allegations for years, and he has won numerous defamation lawsuits against such accusations.
In September, he told a Russian television station when he was asked about a documentary suggesting he was corrupt: "It's crazy, it's dirty, it's dirty."
> An incredibly large number of Russians believe that their society is corrupt, according to surveys.
But it is unusual that, as happened in the ambassador's report, individuals are called, and it is unheard of that this is done by a diplomat of a foreign country.
“The direct link between Moscow’s government and crime has led some to call it “disturbed” and conclude that the government acts more like a kleptocrate than a government,” the memo said.
"Criminal elements enjoy a "kryshna" (a term from the world of criminals/mafia, which literally means "roof" or protection), which extends across the police, state security (FSB), the service supervisory authority (MVD) and the office of the prosecutor as well as through the entire Moscow government bureaucracy.
Experts have discovered a three-layered structure within the criminal world of Moscow.
"Luzhkov is at the top."
"FSB, MVD and the militia are on the second level."
"Ultimately, the ordinary criminals and the criminal inspectors follow at the lowest level."
"This is an incompetent system in which criminal groups in some areas close a gap because the city offers no help."
The report goes on to say that the FSB is cashing money from the largest companies and that the police are arresting small businessmen.
A source, it is said, "explained that Moscow's business owners understand that it is best to get protection from the MVD and FSB (and not from organized crime) because they not only have more weapons, resources and power than the criminals, but also because they are protected by law."
"For this reason, protection by criminal gangs is no longer as in demand as it used to be."
The memo notes that while collecting funds is comprehensive, the protection itself is not very modest; even those who pay are sometimes arrested.
Those who do not pay will find their business closed very quickly - due to one or another pretext.
Medvedev has spoken on several occasions about fighting corruption, but at the same time has noted that he has made little progress.
The memo of the message contains descriptions of men who go to the Kremlin with suitcases that were probably full of money.
“In his fight against corruption, Medvedev must rely on the bureaucrats,” said Georgy Satarov, director of Indem, a Moscow commission of experts.
"But he's part of this bureaucracy."
“It’s not part of the political class because a political class in Russia no longer exists.”
Without politicians, without an opposition, without a separation of powers, he says, corruption is inevitable.
Globally, according to estimates, corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year.
The country ranks 154th in a recent investigation into the global perception of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International (countries are listed from "at least corrupt" to "most corrupt").
The revelation of the memo of the American embassy, which happened after Moscow time late at night, will certainly cause mishaps within the Russian government, although, since Luzhkov can be accused of Moscow’s mistakes, it may also be a way for the Kremlin to claim that the problems are solved.
In an interview with Larry King for CNN, Putin claimed that the WikiLeaks documents could be a fake and reacted furiously to the revelation that American diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
“The truth is that it’s about our interaction, which is an important factor in domestic politics in this country,” he said.
"But to be honest, we didn't expect this to happen with such arrogance, with such pressure and in such an unethical way, you know."
Khmer Rouge veterans forced to confront the past
In a dimly lit, accentuated classroom with dirty and peeling walls, the director of Anlong Veng High School recalls the man who built it, the later Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Mok."
“He was a good leader and he cared for his people,” said Sreng Kor Ma, 42 years old.
Because of his brutality during the Khmer Rouge rule known as "the butcher", the commander remains popular in this remote former Khmer Rouge stronghold in northwestern Cambodia, where he built hospitals and bridges, developed infrastructure and where thousands of former soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the surrender of the Khmer Rouge to the government, longtime supporters are challenged in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local Truth and Reconciliation Forum allowed the victims to face public confrontation with the people who once supported the regime.
In June, the government distributed a textbook that first tells children of former soldiers the history of the Khmer Rouge.
And in July, a joint tribunal of the UN and Cambodia first sentenced a former member of the Khmer Rouge when it sentenced the former head of the notorious Tuol Sleng torture chamber, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, to 35 years in prison.
With each of these developments growing fear among Khmer Rouge veterans, Alnlong Vengs, made their efforts to reconcile and reintegration into Cambodian society more difficult.
“There is still rejection and fear in the former Khmer Rouge, but they have no power to do anything,” said Chhang Youk, head of the Cambodian Documentation Center, an independent organization that is exploring the regime.
"For her, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
“It divides families.”
During the Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or died of disease, revision or starvation.
When the Vietnamese invaded and the Pol Pot-Ied government crashed in 1979, the remnants of the regime and its military fled to the Cambodian border to Thailand.
Here they spread unrest until December 1998, when the last movement capitulated.
When Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the guerrilla war from their base in the west of the mountains and jungle of Cambodia, Ta Mok moved to the next generation in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, when a UN-sponsored peace agreement in 1993 led to the country’s first democratic elections, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to run over to the government, leading to the capitulations of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died in 1998 of a natural death, and Ta Mok, who had not succumbed, was arrested in 1999 by government forces at the Dangrek Mountains.
He died in 2006 in Phnom Penh, where he waited for his trial.
When their patrons no longer protected them, most former Khmer Rouge fighters fled into the gloomy poverty of rural Cambodia and many kept the movement in nostalgic memory.
Even though a few Khmer Rouge elite officials kept their local government posts because they laid down their weapons, the simple soldiers remained poor, uneducated peasants.
“These people have benefited very little from capitulation,” said Sok Leang of the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, which holds public forums throughout Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
"They are anchored in the regime's utopian agricultural ideology."
"They grew up without any professional knowledge."
Sor Lim, 55, who joined the Rhmer Rouge in 1974 as a teenager, fought in the jungle for Anlang Veng before settling down in 1998 to lead a life as a poor rice farmer.
“Life under the Khmer Rouge was good,” he said.
"Ta Mok gave everyone something to eat."
"But now life is hard because we have to take care of ourselves."
The current Khmer Rouge Tribunal has raised concerns here too.
Early next year, the court will try to bring Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, as well as Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister, to justice.
The order of the court is to condemn the old leaders and those who are mainly responsible for the atrocities, but it is not said whether it will pursue further acts beyond these four cases.
This has contributed little to mitigating the fears in Anlong Veng.
Current media speculations have focused on Im Chaem, 64 years old, who had been district chief in Manteay Meanchey Province during Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told the Cambodian Documentation Centre officials that she had led the construction of the Trapeang Thma Dam, a project in which thousands of forced laborers were believed to have died.
On one hot evening, Im Chaem returned from work in the fields to her wooden house on a dirty street outside of Anlong Veng.
When the sun threw long shadows on the withered grass, Im Chaem refused to discuss her past at the Khmer Rouge.
If the court had invited her, she would refuse to leave, she said.
“Cambodia lives in peace and stability,” she said.
"If there were no more persecutions, there would be war here."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who fled the Khmer Rouge in 1878, has also repeatedly warned that the situation would become unsafe, the court would charge more suspects, although experts and historians discuss this.
“Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past,” he said.
But confronting the past is what Cambodia needs to do to move forward, Chhang Youk of the Documentation Center said.
“Reconciliation with the Khmer times means gathering the broken pieces,” he said.
“It is our duty to put these broken pieces together so that we can understand everything.”
The center created the first government-approved textbook on the Khmer Rouge, the 75-page "History of Democratic Cambodia".
It distributed the book in June in Anlong Veng as an appendix to the history book for the Ministry of Education’s High School, which contains less than four pages about the Khmer Rouge.
How often in Cambodia, the young people in Anlong Veng know little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city’s ties to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said the new textbook helps students understand an important part of their history.
But his parents reacted skeptically when he brought the book home to read it.
"My family rejects many parts of the book and the court," he said.
“They’re suspicious because they’re not sure how many people are being convicted by the court.”
Such resistance makes the reconciliation process complex and complicated, Sok Leang said.
But the public forums, the textbook and the court gradually gain influence,” he said.
The Khmer Rouge still has a powerful attraction here.
Up in the Dangrek mountains, a path overgrown by shrubs and drenched with plastic waste leads to a rectangle of black soot, covered with a rusty metal roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned here on a tire pile after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a cell phone salesman on the streetside, said she didn’t know much about the man who had been burned here.
"But he has a strong spirit and many people here go to him to pray," she said.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday and later in the day she wanted to go to Pol Pot's last resting place, where she will lay down a bush of ripe bananas - hoping that he will bring her happiness.
Belarus agrees to stop collecting weapons-capable uranium
In a surprise victory for President Obama’s campaign to secure nuclear material worldwide, the government of Belarus announced on Wednesday that it will no longer collect highly enriched uranium, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was announced in a joint statement following a meeting of Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton with Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov in an additional article of the Security Summit.
The U.S. government had been trying for years to convince Belarus not to collect highly enriched uranium and seemed to have reached a hurdle last spring.
But officials of the U.S. government told the Washington Post that in the past two months, two secret agreements with Belarus have been made to remove 187 pounds of weapons-grade uranium from a Belarusian research facility.
This prepared the stage for the agreement on Wednesday to remove the rest of the material – according to an official employee who remains anonymous due to the sensitivity of the topic, about <0xC2><0xA3>500.
The agreement appears to be one of the key results of Obama’s “Nuclear Security Summit of the 47 Nations” of April, which had ruled out Belarus.
And it was obviously good enough to secure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the next summit in 2012.
"I was really excited about the fact that they want a seat in the Nuclear Security Summit (of 2012)."
“This proves to me that it works,” said Ken Luongo, president of the Global Security Partnership, a group to promote nuclear security.
Clinton called the agreement “a very important, important step” of Belarus.
Obama promised in April 2009 in Prague to secure all the precarious nuclear material within four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be the seventh.
A dozen countries did so under the government of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama’s Nuclear Security Summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has declared that the nation will never give up its uranium.
"How to keep highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilos, which is fundamentally weapons-capable, and less enriched uranium," Lukashenko said.
"This is our raw material... We won't make dirty bombs out of it and we won't sell it to anyone."
"We use it exclusively for research purposes, that's all".
Belarus, however, approached the United States a few months ago when it indicated interest in the meeting of an agreement.
The first call to remove the Uranium Belarus in October was particularly complicated because the material was slightly irradiated, officials say.
It was loaded into a special train that took more than 1,300 miles to a Russian factory for storage and disposal, officials say.
The second call was decided on Monday and was carried out by plane, according to the officials.
The U.S. government is paying $14 million for these efforts, with much of the money flowing into Belarusian research using weakly enriched uranium, which cannot be used for nuclear weapons.
“This was extremely carefully coordinated and coordinated to build trust,” which led to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, a representative of the Department of Energy working on the Global Hazard Reduction.
The James Martin Center for Non-Providing Studies estimates that Belarus had at least 88 pounds of weapons-grade uranium this year, as well as hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
According to the joint agreement, Belarus wants to dissolve its camp by 2012.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, primarily because of Lukashenko’s harsh disregard for human rights.
But the statement from Wednesday suggests a possible rapprochement.
“Welcomeing the progress of these global security issues, the United States of America and Belarus announce that increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a key issue in improving bilateral relations and it is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens,” she said.
No objections from the Spanish government to CIA flights
The Spanish government had no objections to the CIA flights with Taliban and Al-Qaeda prisoners over Spanish territory to Guant<0xC3><0xA1>namo, according to a telegram from the U.S. Ambassador to Madrid.
This reflects the documents unveiled by Wikileaks and forwarded to the daily newspaper "El Pa<0xC3><0xAD>s" (by cable), adding that former deputy head of government Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Teresa Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez de la Vega called for the Spanish government to be informed "to prove that foreign aircraft flying over Spain are adequately monitored."
In June 2006, following the publication of a report by the Council of Europe accusing the aid of human rights abuses in a dozen countries, including Spain, former North American Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez de la Vega.
The deputy head of government admitted that the Council's report "had met Zapatero in the distance" and reiterated that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
"De la Vega stressed that Spain has no objections to intelligence flights over Spanish territory."
“They just want to be informed” so as not to be “unprepared to be surprised,” Aguirre reports via cable.
The former foreign minister, Miguel <0xC3><0x81>ngel Moratinos, also pointed out to the ambassador that the Spanish government "does not want to pay much attention to this matter, although the government has little influence, as these are in the hands of the judges."
In January 2007, prosecutor Vicente Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez told the embassy that he would not block the judicial initiative to declassify the documents of the Spanish intelligence center (CNI) and the defense minister about the CIA flights.
"These reports do not contain any burdensome or sensitive information," the ambassador said after a conversation with the prosecutor.
Nevertheless, the US was more concerned about the "apparent coordination between the Spanish prosecutor and the German prosecutors" than about the declassified information provided by the CNI and the Ministry of Defence.
“This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to discreetly manage between governments,” Aguirre laments.
At a lunch in March 2007, attended by Ambassador of the United States and Spanish Interior Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, the latter commented that "although the Spanish judges are insanely concerned about their independence and do what they deem appropriate," he had instructed his staff to avoid "blown rhetorical comments to let the tension run out."
The ambassador also expressed his concern about the PP's approach in this matter.
"Despite their generally pro-American attitude, our experience teaches us that the PP will not doubt it, from a note that the US government will tolerate or deliberately ignore Zapatero's actions that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, capital will strike, even if these revelations could have a negative impact on the US government," he said.
The child killer admits that she has complained on the Internet about the "painful" of motherhood.
The young woman spoke of the child when this was already dead and she had a blog: "Terror in a Galician way"
M<0xC3><0xB3>nica Juanatey Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez is on the Internet "Muki".
Under this nickname, which she performs from a young age, she keeps in touch with a cousin and at least one friend, both of whom come from Noia, a village in the province of La Coru<0xC3><0xB1>a where she was born.
The announcements are from 2008.
To understand this, one must know their love life, which the daily ABC reconstructs based on testimonies of their family members.
The 30-year-old Galician woman began a relationship with Iv<0xC3><0xA1>n T<0xC3><0xBA><0xC3><0xB1>ez, an industrialist, in 1998.
She lasted a year.
Shortly after she dissolved her relationship, it became known that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was from him, but his former husband never let him carry out a DNA analysis.
Shortly thereafter, she entered into a different relationship.
The chosen one was Alberto, a young man from Lousame, a neighboring community.
She lived with him for a long time.
César lived with them.
When the young woman went to the Balearic Islands to look around the labour market, the little girl stayed with her partner, who even accompanied her to Palma for a week.
But it can be concluded from the content of their messages that their love relationship broke and they separated.
In March 2008 she is alone in Menorca and writes: "Alberto is very strange and angry because I came here to work."
"When I told him that, he liked it, but now of course he realizes what it means to be alone with the boy all day long and not be free, do and let go of what he wants."
Later, she mentions a message she just received on her phone: "I want you to come back this month or send me an address to which I can send you the boy."
She complains, "If he doesn't like me leaving the boy with my mother, I'll pick him up when I get back."
In May, she says of the return to her village: “This week I’m going to go there, but I’m only going to stay there until the 19th, because I have to imagine a job on the 20th if I don’t want to lose it.”
She explains that she will take her firstborn with her if everything goes well.
"He'll be with the one he has to be with, that is, with me. Never in life will I leave him with anyone but my mother," a dubious intention, considering their bad relationship.
There is another mail in July.
When she writes this, it is assumed that the boy who came to the island on the 1st of the month and was allegedly murdered on the 10th is dead.
"On the one hand, César is satisfied, on the other hand, not."
"On the one hand, he's with me and the place likes him a bit, but on the other hand, he has to go to school every day."
She is talking about moving to Mallorca.
"There he (the boy) will attend a summer course, so I have less spending for the nanny."
On the 17th: Memories and complaints.
"A huge kiss from César asking me when you're coming."
"Alberto says he sent me some videos on the e-mail. See, if he wants, he finds me, such a mess."
On the 30th, one more thing: "The boy is doing well. He goes to a summer course to learn Catalan."
From V<0xC3><0xAD>ctor, her current partner, there's one: "He's shooting me money."
On the Internet, in anime and manga blogs, there are messages from her.
She even had her own blog in MySpace, which is now locked up, and in which she called herself "Muki, the jailer."
"Terror a la gallega (heading) ".
The last man who lived with her, a sworn hunter, declares to have remorse because he feels guilty.
He can’t believe everything happened because she hadn’t told him she was a single mother.
M<0xC3><0xB3>nica was transferred yesterday from the Center for Prisoners of Justice in Menorca to the Provincial Prison of Palma.
The mandatory defender, Carlos Maceda, stated that she could not remember the course of the matter, "and she had not intended to harm the little one."
However, she had previously confessed to drowning César in the bathtub and stowing his body in a suitcase.
The defense and prosecutor’s office requested a psychiatric report.
Partido Popular won 4 seats in Congress and PSC lost 9
With the results of 28 November, PP could play a decisive role in the cities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona
After the significant increase in votes and MPs in the last regional elections, the PP is already focusing its attention on the parliamentary elections - preferred or not. Their expectations are more than positive, because the number of votes that this party achieves in these elections is usually twice as high as those in the Catalan elections.
For example, the Catalan People's Party received 610.473 votes in the 2008 parliamentary elections, while this figure was only 316,222 in the 2006 regional elections.
Last Sunday, the PPC received 384,091 votes.
If this upward trend - the result of the PSC's vote redirection and the PP's voter retention - were to continue, the PP's analysts predict that in the parliamentary elections, the PPC could rise from 8 to 12 congressmen, while CiU would also win four (it now has 10) and the PSC would lose at least 9 MPs (out of 25).
These calculations prove the fundamental importance of Catalonia for PP and PSOE.
According to the People’s Party’s analysis, the ERC would lose one MP – currently it has three – while the ICV could hold or win one.
However, if the election calendar is maintained, the next meeting with the municipal elections will be held in May 2011, when the People’s Party (PP) can also be the tongue on the scales to put an end to socialist supremacy, in four provincial capitals and with its majority in the city council of Barcelona, one of the city councils with the largest budget: 661 million euros for 2011.
Both the Nationalists and the People's Party agree that the PSC will lose the cities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the Socialists will not be able to achieve a majority or resort to their traditional allies (ERC and ICV).
According to the Republican debacle, it is not inconceivable that this party will lose its representation in the municipal council of Barcelona, in which it would have to win 5% of the vote.
The PP, on the other hand, saw an increase in its share of votes in the four provincial capitals and could become the decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced that they can play the leading role in Tarragona's overthrow, where they had ruled in front of the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros, together with the PP.
En Lérida is the PP only 500 votes behind the PSC. The mayor, <0xC3><0x80>ngel Ros, maintains good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during the last election campaign they met several times.
In other important places, such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus, the People’s Party was also able to see a significant increase.
Currently, the PP is represented in 34 municipalities in Catalonia and aims to form lists in as many places as possible.
The Catalan cell provided Al Qaeda with thousands of passports
In addition to the seven arrests in Barcelona, there were three more in Thailand.
The seven Pakistanis arrested by the police of the Barcelona Police Department and the Nigerians formed the jihadist cell controlled by Thailand, the various Al Qaeda groups, including the "Movement to Liberation of Tamil Eelam" (LTTE) and "Laschkar e-Taiba" (Let) - the latter was the author of the assassinations in Bombay in 2008.
The Spanish Minister of the Interior attaches great importance to these investigations, which goes so far as to assure that the "Operation Kampai" has been "weakened" by Al Qaeda's falsification apparatus worldwide and "somit their ability to act".
The researchers assume that in the two years in which the cell was active in Catalonia, thousands of passports were sent to Thailand, where they were faked and then sent to the groups that made up the criminal galaxy Al Qaeda, so that their "fighters" could criminally cross the borders of European and other Western countries.
The uncovered cell is not the only one of the jihadist network that was active in Europe, which is why in addition to the Thai investigative bodies, other European police units have also been involved in the investigation. It cannot be ruled out that similar attacks will occur in the EU area in the next few days, such as those carried out in Barcelona last Tuesday.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistanis Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were arrested) another was carried out in Thailand, where the Pakistanis Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan were arrested.
They had led from Bangkok the cell established in Spain and other European countries.
The Catalan network - part of which had been destroyed in 2009 - stole tourist passports in particular according to the so-called "International Islamic Front".
This means that the documents were issued on the names of men aged 25 to 45 years and had to be valid for several years; they were not allowed to have a visa stamp.
It is pointed out in research circles that until now no links could be established between those arrested in Catalonia and the assassination in Bombay, although the author of this assassination, "Laschkar e-Taiba", was one of the recipient groups of passports stolen in Spain and subsequently forged in Thailand.
Nevertheless, it should be remembered that a few days before the Catalan assassination, several thousand dollars had been sent from a money transfer company, which was "invested" in the purchase of prepaid cards for mobile phones, which were later used by the members of the "commandos", which put an end to the lives of 106 people.
The police have confiscated extensive documentation.
PP calls on Mas to postpone the tax agreement
The chairman of the PPC, Alicia S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez-Camacho, took the opportunity yesterday to personally present to Artur Mas their conditions in support of his inauguration as Prime Minister of the Generalitat, which are not different from those already stated during the election campaign and can be summarized with the priority of the economic recovery and the abandonment of regionalist independence adventures, such as a financial compensation agreement, the regional leaders’
The chairman of the Catalan People's Party addressed Artur Mas, who gave her the 18 MPs she had won last Sunday - a figure that is more than enough to feel indispensable, because the candidate of the bourgeois-regionalist party CiU relies on at least one of the opposition parties to vote in his office.
The future alliances that the regionalists want to enter into in the upcoming parliamentary elections in Congress depend on a possible agreement with the PP, but the talks that Mas is currently holding with the other party leaders revolve around Catalonia.
As far as the PPC’s party presidents are concerned, it demands that, in support of the inauguration, “all discourses concerning the sovereignty and independence of Catalonia” as well as an agreement on the financial compensation between the state and the Autonomous Region – similar to the Basque Country – and which the party leader of CiU even wants to make a referendum on.
Both political leaders agree that they want to make the built-up political apparatus of the regional administration leaner and abolish inheritance and gift tax.
The details of the negotiations on the accession of Mas are discussed by the PPC Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who announced a hard opposition - and Joan Herrera (ICV) - and today he will meet with Joan Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The nursing home confirms that the deaths are not due to "missing measures"
The owners of the Old Home in Olot do not rule out that their caretaker killed over eleven elderly people
The leaders of the La Caritat nursing home in Olot (Gerona) yesterday gave a press conference in which they showed what damage the criminal acts of Joan Vila Dilmés - the caregiver who had killed at least eleven old people for whom he was responsible - had done to the facility during his work.
The head of the nursing home, Joan Sala, appeared in court with his lawyer, Joan Ca<0xC3><0xB1>ada, and announced that "La Caritat wants to accuse the person responsible (for the deaths)", but "the right and our liability force us to accept the process and civil liability".
The institution must not only accept a loss of social standing, because it had not determined the criminal acts of the caretaker in time, but now also pay a high compensation amount, which is calculated by the legal representatives of the family members of the victims.
Joan Vila Dilmé confessed that the first crime dates back to August 2009 and that he has since continued to murder.
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the nursing home - as he suspected that no doctor had personally examined the deceased, but the formalities were handled by telephone due to their age and illnesses.
The head of La Caritat denied this point all the way around, stating that "absence measures could not have been the reason for the incidents at any time."
La Caritat's lawyer added that "there was no evidence of negligent acts of any person other than the accused in the litigation."
The one who had already been baptized as a "angel of death" confessed to eleven murders yesterday and declared that he committed the first crime on August 29, 2009 and one and a half months later murdered the second old lady.
In this case, he killed with an overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime in which he had given a mixture of various tranquilizers.
The head of La Caritat stated that staff access to the drugs was difficult to control.
The insulin syringes and the sedative cocktail were used by the nurse in six out of nine crimes committed to free patients from their suffering with death.
But the results of the lab investigations will reveal whether Vila lies and actually chose a less cruel death for his first victims, or whether he burned them out from within by giving them bleaching liquor, as he had done according to confession in three women he murdered between 12 and 17 October.
In La Caritat, one does not believe the nurse’s statements, not even in terms of the number of confessed murders, which could be quite more. This attitude is justified by the fact that Vila had made very different statements in court and that it makes no sense to suddenly change his course of action after eight successful murders.
They say they made them available to the judiciary for this reason and to clarify the scope of these incidents.
Threats of the European Central Bank (ECB)
Investors reacted sharply yesterday to the threat posed by ECB President Trichet, who warned that “the markets should not underestimate our responsiveness.”
The risk premiums of euro-peripheral countries have increased dramatically and the shares of European banks have increased by more than 5%.
Nevertheless, we should not underestimate the possibility that the ECB can be fooled and that the euro has barely added points, which causes concern.
Yesterday’s events are typical of an illiquid market that recovers to the extent that it collapses, however, as a result of the closure of short and highly speculative positions.
The institutional investor will not lose his fear for a long time.
Today, a month ago, the European Central Bank called on us to reverse our liquidity measures, which the ECB will have to reverse tomorrow for the fourth time in two years, and probably several times in the future.
The Bundesbank called for the termination of the plan to purchase government debt, as these were ineffective, as well as the repeal of all exceptional temporary liquidity measures, which should only be maintained for one week of unlimited access.
Following the Irish crisis, we expect the current liquidity measures to be extended “at least by March” and quarterly tenders with unlimited access to the quarter-end to ensure liquidity by at least June.
We also expect the program to continue to buy bonds and issue a strengthening signal.
If the expectations created are not met, yesterday’s excellent response to the markets will be thrown back, and if stubbornly insisting that we take back our liquidity measures, only God can help us!
Just as at the ECB meeting in May, in which the bank reaffirmed that it did not consider the purchase of government debt securities and then the markets collapsed, this story could repeat itself tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May, she showed her teeth and on Wednesday, she said she had already bought a lot, causing a new collapse in the market.
Yesterday, the auction of one-year state titles in Portugal was quite weak.
State asset management only spent 500 million to 5.28%, compared with 750 million to 4.81% in the previous auction.
Nevertheless, interest rates in Portugal fell by 30 basis points throughout the curve, reflecting a change in market perception, according to Trichets.
In Ireland, the figures of the debt hole were published by Allied and Bank of Ireland.
The sum is estimated at around 10,000 million in the short term and possibly another 15,000. There is time until February to acquire private capital or these banks are nationalized.
Although Ireland has completely lost its credibility after failing to recognize the issue of stress tests in July, the figures under the rescue plan are acceptable and help reduce uncertainty.
However, the government will have to get parliamentary approval for its new budget next Tuesday, and because it still does not have enough support, Ireland remains a source of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has moderated her discourse on the summit of heads of state and government on 14 December, where political unity is needed to show that we play the same score together.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the other countries the ninth symphony of Beethoven.
The Spanish Prime Minister presented yesterday the action plan to be adopted by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in the autonomous regions such as the financial institutions, the reduction of the state deficit, liberalisation, privatisation and employment measures. Measures that sound like Vivaldi's Four Seasons in the ears of investors.
The double effect Zapatero and Trichet explain why the Spanish stock market has increased by 4.5 percent, twice as much as the rest of the European stock exchanges.
Compared to February, the response of the government and the Spanish central bank was quick and convincing, and we benefit from the surprise effect.
Today, there is a significant auction of a three-year government bond that will benefit from the trichet effect, which is why we rely on a strong demand that will eliminate all doubts about our re-debtability.
For Spain, applying for an aid plan would be a self-sacrifice.
We would receive liquidity that we do not need. The Treasury has 40 billion euros available, three times as much as in March. Interest rates are extremely expensive and access to the markets would be closed indefinitely.
Nevertheless, our strategy should correspond to Caesar’s wife’s motto: “Now counts not only being, but also appearances.”
Only courage, we can do it!
At the request of his children, Eulen’s Chairman of the Board of Directors shall address the shareholders’ meeting of Vega Sicilia
The storm in the open conflict of the <0xC3><0x81>lvarez family, owner of the companies Eulen and El Enebro, does not falter.
David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez, founder of the corporate group, will challenge the shareholders' meeting of El Enebro, which will take place on the 16th at the request of five of his seven children, as he considers them "absolutely void". His children will try to get a majority to control the administrative bodies of the company - the owner of the winery Bodegas Vega Sicilia -.
David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez and his children Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s David and Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a José are preparing the legal measures for a new chapter in their dispute over the control of part of the group of companies.
The founder of the largest corporate services holding does not appear to be willing to give in to his lawsuit for control of El Enebro’s organs.
He was expelled from the Board of Directors by five of his seven children, who were appointed as members of the Board of Directors at the Shareholders’ Meeting on 18 January this year, which is already registered in the Commercial Register.
The shareholders’ meeting of El Enebro, convened by the judge of Madrid’s Commercial Court No. 2 for the 16th, has triggered a new thunderstorm in the lap of the <0xC3><0x81>lvarez family.
Calling the judge to convene the meeting is the only legal way to ensure the convocation of the shareholders’ meeting.
The final strategy of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta y Elvira <0xC3><0x81>lvarez Mezquiriz is designed by David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez as a "desperate means of the applicants - his five children - to acknowledge, by means of legal subtleties, fraudulent machinations and legal abuse, the Assembly declared null and void on January 18," as official speakers explain.
This argument is the basis for the subsequent contestation of the assembly in order to declare it "absolutely void".
The same protagonists, shrouded in discreet silence, tried unsuccessfully to convene a meeting in June.
At El Enebro - asset company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets - David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez's seven children control 100 percent of the capital.
On the other hand, according to family protocols, the founder of the service group demands the right of use of more than 51% of the capital.
This is the real background of the case, on which the judge has to decide in the hearing to deal with the challenge for which no date has yet been set.
Red Bull wins in F1 with a secret weapon from Siemens
The cars are improved in real time with a software.
Since Red Bull entered the world of Formula One in 2004, its history in this exquisite universe has been marked by the speed of surprises and successes.
At first, no one paid attention to the newcomer, and despite his steeply rising career during the last seasons, at the final spurt last November, everyone put on the victory of Fernando Alonso’s Ferrari.
Without wanting to reduce the skills of German pilot and world champion Sebastian Vettel or the power of Renault’s engine, the “secret weapon” that the Multi Siemens Red Bull put into the hands, and thus created a winning team, has become a legend.
In reality, it is a powerful software for simulating processes that the German company launched in 2007 for purposes that are not related to car racing.
This computer science program, called PLM, was used for the development of assembly chains in factories around the world, power plants and high-precision instruments.
The aim is a faithful reproduction or simulation of a product or process before it is actually built in order to avoid errors and unnecessary costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi aircraft and Nissan’s most famous commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of Siemens’ industrial department, explains that using this software in the Formula 1 factory Red Bull “in a few hours, almost in real time” can design and execute the changes and improvements that are detected on the races and during the tests.
Russwurm reports that in 1992, on average, ten technicians worked at the racetracks, who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements in a season.
Today, 180 highly qualified young people are employed in Red Bull’s team. With powerful computer systems, they carry out analyses and all sorts of changes to the race car.
The Siemens manager stated that the PLM software is capable of analyzing and improving all components of Red Bull racing cars, except the engine for which Renault is solely responsible.
The materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are changed.
Thanks to advanced production facilities and high-tech autoclaves, the changes can be transferred from the virtual reality of the simulator to reality within less than 24 hours.
The only limit set by this crazy technical perfectionism is the $40 million that a Formula 1 team can spend on their races in a season.
Red Bull has built its high-tech factory for the development and manufacture of its racing cars in a location 50 kilometres from London.
These are two buildings where visits – especially by journalists – are severely restricted.
Everything that happens there is top secret.
The crew includes 580 people, including two pilots, World Champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
But Red Bull's true Formula 1 hero is undoubtedly the newest world champion Sebastian Vetell.
Behind the enormous technological resources that the energy-drink manufacturer places in the services of its participation on the racetracks, there are other protagonists, whose support is invaluable and whose fame is equal to zero.
The head of technology at the plant, Steve Nevey, emphasizes that five years ago it was still possible to say that the progress in R&D for racing cars contributed 50 percent to the victory and the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today, the share values have changed, with the technology accounting for 85 percent of the success, while the contribution of the pilots is estimated at 15 percent.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel and Webber can never be replaced by EDP because they are “unpredictable gladiators”.
HP to open 20 stores with local distributors in two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) inaugurated its first exclusive store in collaboration with its partner Ront Reyes in Barcelona yesterday.
It is the first of a 20-store sales network with 80 to 100 square meters each, which the Multi intends to open in Spain over the next two years.
The company has agreed on this initiative with the existing 16 multi-brand sales areas, such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The deputy chairman of HP Espa<0xC3><0xB1>a, Helena Herrero, cited as an example the converted store at Gran V<0xC3><0xAD>a in Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with whom HP has been cooperating for thirty years.
The North American Group intends to set up 200 sales outlets in Europe by 2010, including 20 branches in Spain.
The first was inaugurated last week in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia). Barcelona is the third business.
Herrera did not want to reveal the upcoming new openings, but did not rule out that Madrid could be the next destination.
The deputy chairman, who is also the head of HP Personal Systems, assured that the philosophy of shop opening is always the same, relying on a local distributor with experience and industry knowledge.
The North American group of companies advises on this and takes over the exclusive shop equipment (with interactive products to touch). In Europe, all stores will look the same.
HP is also responsible for training shop staff.
Helena Herrero said it was not a franchising system and highlighted that with the exclusive sales point network, it is intended to "optimize customer service and advice for small and small businesses when shopping and after, even packaging."
The store in Barcelona has a pioneer pilot program that solves the technical problems of HP devices with warranty.
An online service establishes a connection to the technical headquarters in Maastricht (Holland).
“This way, we can solve problems in ten minutes that sometimes take up to two days.”
"This system was developed especially for small and medium-sized enterprises and private customers, because the large enterprises already have their service contracts for technical after-sales service," Helena Herroro said yesterday.
Sabadell wants to steal one million customers from its rivals in three years
The executive board member of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, is more optimistic than any other manager. He believes that 2001 will be a tough year for the banks, but initially rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the debt war.
Nevertheless, it foresees a break in interest rates that banks are trying to offset with increases in fees and prices for loans.
Sabadell expects to capture one million private customers in three years – a subject that still exists.
Sabadell has found the way to take advantage of the next three years, thus surviving in a very complicated economic environment.
The bank will introduce a new three-year guidance plan in 2011.
The goal is not only to survive without taking advantage of the public assistance from the FROB, but also to increase the market share by one million private customers - 700 000 if you deduct the customers who will lose the bank - which is the big challenge facing this bank, because so far it has paid more attention to its business customers than to its private customers.
This year, it has added 250,000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
Their market share for private customers is 3.5 percent, while business customers account for more than 10 percent.
Another principle of the 2011-2013 business plan is to increase productivity, i.e. austerity, cost reduction. The challenges faced by the bank will be presented together with the annual financial report.
Few banks dare to set and publish targets in these difficult times, as the financial crisis has disrupted all plans of banks worldwide.
Sabadell will complete its Optima four-year guidance plan this year, initially designed to last for three years, but as a result of the market situation, it was extended by one financial year.
The customers who will leave the savings banks are the main goal of the bank.
At a breakfast organized by the APIE, Guardiola stressed that 2011 would be a "difficult" year "with great reach".
The manager assumes that Spain is only “slow” out of the crisis.
In addition, it would be "very difficult to create work" in two or three years - fundamental to the survival of the banks.
Even if he assumes that the war on liabilities - punishing the interest margins - will derail, the risk surcharges that banks and savings banks will have to pay for their emissions to receive liquidity will already be rolled over to the price of loans as compensation for declining profit margins.
“The issues of liquidity and financing are structural in nature and they will put pressure on the loans.”
“We didn’t turn off the tap, but the interest rate differentials are very high,” Guardiola admitted.
Banesto issued the order to its branch network on Thursday to restrict the granting of long-term loans and increase interest rate differentials (cf. Cinco D<0xC3><0xAD>as of 22 and 27 November).
The manager also admitted that the banks are currently pursuing the stategy of "increasing fees", but "within a framework shaped by competition".
Sabadell’s roadmap is based on organic growth, even if the group does not rule out corporate business, as always.
It is not for nothing that he assures that in Spain "larger companies are necessary."
“Everything will change next year,” he said.
He emphasises that the need for capital is currently "enormously increasing" and does not rule out the fact that some Spanish financial institutions will slip into red numbers.
He believes that the FROB can replace the money market in captita stocks.
Having assured that Sabadell could also survive a temporary closure of the markets, he refutes the argument of some bankers who are already prophesying a new liquidity crisis.
He stressed that nothing could be put into circulation, but unlike the incidents in June, short-term financing via repo transactions could be achieved and thus the crisis could be intercepted.
CECA excludes a second merger wave of savings banks
The Director General of CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday rejected the possibility that there could be a merger wave of the savings banks, stressing the speed with which the industry was restructured.
When the concentration process of the Spanish Sparkasses began, several Sparkasses insisted on not participating in the first phase, and they retained the second round.
On the other hand, the Director General of the Spanish Sparkassenverband (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured that this second round would not take place.
"I believe that most of the mergers have been completed. The inclusion of Cajasol in the Banca C<0xC3><0xAD>vica group cannot be considered as a second round, rather it was adaptations."
"Most of it is completed. We may have thirteen or fourteen instead of seven, but all important processes have already been completed. They have been controlled by Banco de Espa<0xC3><0xB1>a, who has strongly supported all operations."
In a breakfast organised by the Association of Managing Directors and Managers of Aragon (ADEA), Olavarrieta stated that the concentration process "was completed as quickly as possible and that we need to be satisfied with the timely process, which was established in earlier times, not now, as part of the business plans with Banco de Espa<0xC3><0xB1>a," he stressed.
“The transition from 45 savings banks with an average of 28,000 million assets to 17 with 75,500 million each is a historically incomparable process. The number of financial institutions has been reduced by 62 percent and they are now much larger, which means that we have fulfilled the Basel Agreement,” he stressed.
Olavarrieta stated that "there were a number of unrelenting opinions about the slowness of the process that revealed unsettlingness and nonsense", because "Banco de Espa<0xC3><0xB1>a urges us to conclude on time before the end of the year."
The Director General of CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, said yesterday that Spain has one of the most rigorous financing systems in Europe and “perhaps” the world over, and added that those who doubted it did so “without any deeper knowledge”.
The manager noted that in the current economic economy, we need to “do not worry” about the situation of financial institutions and savings banks that have undergone a “very significant” concentration process that will be carried out “as quickly as possible”.
He also recalled that the Spanish banks had passed the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July very well.
Zapatero and the Red Line of Germany
Berlin has opted for the preservation of the euro, but at the same time has set conditions for the whole of the European Union.
Tensions in the markets have triggered a double response from the government.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Zapatero has presented new adjustment measures, starting with tax reductions for small and medium-sized enterprises, the regulation of temporary employment companies or the lifting of the 426 euro support for unemployed people who do not receive unemployment benefit, up to the privatization of 49 percent of AENA, the administration of Barajas and El Prat airports and 30 percent of the state lottery.
On the other hand, the deputy head of government, Elena Salgado, with the help of former government president Felipe Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez, supports the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel as the person in charge of the current crisis.
How are these processes to be understood?
It should be presumed that Merkel’s position is not a mistake in her public relations work.
On the contrary, it is a new round in the difficult process of redefining the euro.
In doing so, Germany takes a fundamentally new perspective on shaping our future, which collides with the maintenance of the traditions of the great majority of its partners.
In view of the resistance in Europe, three possible ways out of the crisis are beginning to be speculated in Germany.
The first: a strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the south would have to leave the euro area.
The second: The re-introduction of the German Mark – although that sounds more like science fiction at the moment – is supported by a large part of the public opinion, about 50 percent of the population.
The third: a change in the euro in line with German proposals, which means more macroeconomic control; strict budgetary management; punishment of countries that breach the rules; possibly the suspension of payments of some countries and the expansion of the costs of potential adaptation measures to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been around for some time, which is why there are no excuses now.
It wasn’t until 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission created incentives for deficits and the German government pulled out of the sleeve a constitutional reform to prevent this from happening in 2016.
This was the first sign of the drift between what Germany considered necessary (strict tax plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France.
The second sign set the Central European country when Merkel painfully postponed the decision to save Greece.
But the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public and the published opinion were absolutely against a rescue of Greece.
Finally, in the last days of October, Merkel has come out again with a clear position, calling for a reform of the European Union's agreements in order to enable a country to be saved, while at the same time requiring private lenders to bear part of the costs.
This position was interpreted as anti-European, as it fueled the Irish crisis and all the following.
But its proposal, although somewhat sweet, has been adopted, and we will be participating in the reform of the European Union, which will enable these measures from 2013 onwards.
Germany has drawn a red line that it does not intend to cross.
It says to everyone that, although now unpopular measures must be taken, there will no longer be the old way of functioning of the euro from this date on.
2013 will be the birth year of a new currency area in which the opposing countries will be severely penalized, forced to declare themselves incapacitated and, in this case, the private sector will have to bear some of the costs.
Germany shows us that we need to start a tough growth course, with high savings and investment rates, moderation of consumption, improved productivity and competitiveness, and positive external balances.
The other alternative, which is based on debt and construction with huge holes in the balance of payments, as was pointed out by Spain in boom times, will simply not be accepted.
The offer is clear.
And we would do badly not to understand it.
It is not just about reducing the state deficit to 3% by 2013.
The demands are much harder.
And the worst thing we could do under these conditions is to deceive ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will go into more rest.
And that we will take advantage of the opportunities offered to us by spring 2013.
It seems that Zapatero understood this as well, and his double announcement (the promised reforms after the meeting with the big companies last Saturday and the announcement of new measures from yesterday) points out that despite Merkel’s criticism of creating order in her own house, the hypothesis has been prepared.
But the red line drawn by Germany is there, and it doesn’t look like anything would change about it.
Among the possibilities considered is the fact that we would not have to exclude the euro area, which is filled with little serious countries.
In this case, Germany could still tell us that it warned us.
Sports and Rules
Tricks like those of Alonso and Ramos in the game against Ajax show an inventive spirit, but not the will to circumvent a sanction.
The alleged exclusion of two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the November 23 match against Ajax in the Champions League led to a lot of ink being shed about whether it was an unsportsmanlike action or not and whether both players could be sanctioned by UEFA.
As is commonly known, the two players lost time a few minutes before the end of the game (their team had already clearly won) and played several fouls so that the referee showed them the second yellow card.
In this way, and as Real Madrid would lead its group, the two players will meet the prescribed penalty at the next league match against the Auxerre and thus enter the next stage without cards.
Finally, UEFA’s disciplinary committee punished the club’s coach, José Mourinho, with two games and the players involved with different amounts of money.
The provocation of a yellow card under such or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is more common in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos—the unwritten but in this sport-observed rules.
Part of the debate that emerged about the case is that a team of Real Madrid football club (who, in his hymn of nobility and honor and on other occasions, had punished his players for similar incidents) played the leading role in this, and the dramatization by Mourinho, who added an episode more to his long history as a theatrical and provocative technician.
In any case, the debate revolves around whether this behaviour, which is not expressly prohibited by the statutes, is contrary to the principles of sport, that is, whether these acts constitute a rule-by-rule circumvention. In fact, this approach adheres to the statutes of sport, but seems to circumvent its meaning.
In this case, the damage caused to the sports spirit should be investigated.
The sports spirit defends the physical integrity of the opponents, an aspect that was not jeopardized by these actions, because it was not an aggressive game.
Another aspect of a clean game is to avoid the offending players from taking an unjustified advantage from the opposing team, even if that didn’t happen.
The paradox of the action of the players of Real Madrid is that it does not correspond to what we usually understand by cheating or circumvention of rules, because the circumvention of the rule was not done secretly to avoid a sanction, but it should be as conspicuous as possible to punish it by the referee.
The players waited and gladly accepted the sanction.
Another question is what kind of advantage did the offenders draw from the intentional fouls.
It should be pointed out here that the rival was not put in a more unfavorable position nor were benefits for the played game raised, because the obvious result of this action was that the own team had to continue playing with fewer players.
It is also not a useful strategy for the next game, because the club then does not have these players.
The advantage is obviously that players start the next stage of the Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation in a future game.
But it’s a long-term, to a certain degree, unknown advantage, as the team could eventually be eliminated, and with this approach, players receive a penalty and move on to the second card cycle, where they do less than in the first cycle due to card accumulation.
It is not so clear whether this is really an advantage.
Ultimately, such practices are not directed against the sports spirit, which also includes strategic decisions to get the most benefit from the regulations.
In this case, players did not want to circumvent a penalty (that would actually be a clear case of rule circumvention), they preferred to choose when to submit to it.
They made a strategic decision without avoiding a penalty or fleeing from it.
Although the boundary between the invention and the regulatory environment is blurred, I believe that this matter is a clear case of invention.
I have the impression that polemics arose as a result of two factors: because it was about two self-exclusions and because of the nature of the provoked rule transmission.
The damage done to the principles of sport by these actions is less ethical than aesthetic.
Offer Offensive for Group Christmas Dinner in Barcelona
This year, the dictatorship of the calendar drops an avalanche of reservations to the days of 16 and 17 December.
The celebrations paid by employees themselves are expanding and they do not want to spend more than 20 to 30 euros.
Like Turr<0xC3><0xB3>n and the Christmas Lottery, in the pre-Christmas period, there are also group dinners that provide oxygen to Barcelona’s hospitality and leisure industry. But as a result of the economic crisis, they trigger a price offensive to capture the customer segment that represents the great crowd: almost everyone wants to spend between 20 and 30 euros for a lunch or dinner, the interviewed entrepreneurs and dinners confirm.
To make accounting even a bit more complicated, the calendar (Silvester falls on a Friday) dropped all orders into the week of December 13, with the result of an avalanche of reservations from dinner to two top picks (the 16th and 17th) and almost no orders in the week before.
Since 2008, when the bad times began, many companies have stopped group dinners for household reasons.
In order not to have to give up this tradition, many workers pay it out of their own pocket.
Whatever the economic situation, the lowest prices are demanded, confirms the chairman of the restaurant district of Barcelona, Gaiet<0xC3><0xA0> Farr<0xC3><0xA0>s.
So far, the representative of the umbrella association has not dared to predict what the holidays will look like this month.
"People think about it '90s before they make a reservation."
“They like to go out, but they pay a lot of attention to the prices,” he emphasizes.
The business will go well for those who offer “quality at good prices with good service,” he adds, reminding us that customers will save in times of crisis, which is why prices are most in demand by 25 euros.
In a survey in several centrally located restaurants, it turns out that the evening of 17 December the providers lead to a collapse.
The Soteras Group says that the demand for this Friday with the intention of spending less than 30 euros would boom. The Group has adapted its menus with complete offers between 25 and 35 euros to the economic situation.
At another leading group, Andilana, which has 16 restaurants in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of the calendar has led to preferred reservations, even from the beginning of November.
“We have made the impossible possible to maintain the previous year’s prices with menus for every taste from 19.95 to 30 euros,” he explains.
At AN Grup, which runs El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 locals, one does not lose optimism after the revenues have been flourishing again since the second quarter and good prospects for the Christmas business, even if focused on a few days.
Sources of the group highlight that the 18th will also be an overactive day with groups of friends celebrating Christmas.
The six group menus have been added to a Christmas menu for 30 euros or more than a price hit, with the impression that customers are willing to spend 10 percent more than in the previous year and in return want more details, such as Cava.
In some companies you can also see green sprouts sprouting, which is why the employees are invited again. This gives the impression that the group dinners are back in the upswing.
On the part of the Fecasarm umbrella association (with associations such as the pub, restaurant and leisure association of Barcelona), the deputy chairman, Enric Gom<0xC3><0xA0>, trusts to see the end of the tunnel and notes that the reservations overall are quite "lively" even though the customers "beat out a maximum".
However, the fun of the celebration did not go down, no matter who pays.
Pakistan's nuclear program is causing great concern in the US
Islamabad produces nuclear weapons “faster than any other country.”
Wikileaks revelations confirm relations between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the North American Embassy in Pakistan and the U.S. Department of State, revealed by the Wikileaks Internet portal, confirms the enormous concerns posed by the Pakistan nuclear program Washington.
On the edge of the clarifying and succinct details provided by the documents on the content of the talks and the mindset of accredited North American diplomats in Islamabad, these reveal that cooperation between the two countries in terms of nuclear security is not intensified, but, on the contrary, “reduces” and that the unstable Asian country “makes more nuclear weapons” to a faster rhythm than any other country.
In particular, the peculiarity of the Pakistani nuclear program — that the weapons are not assembled, but are stored their items to make their destruction more difficult in a possible attack — prepare Washington sleepless nights.
The following risks include the ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, in a report prior to the visit of the former head of the National Security Council, James Jones: "The proximity of some nuclear facilities to the Taliban-affected area, the alleged proliferation of nuclear material and the susceptibility to the transport of nuclear material".
The large number of people involved in the nuclear arsenals and missile programs is no longer only seen by the United States, but also by Russia as peripheral and reason to exercise caution.
"Pakistan needs to hire strictly-believing personnel to monitor nuclear facilities; due to the low level of education and culture, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who are involved in nuclear or missile programs," Russian Foreign Ministry expert Yuri Korolev said in a meeting with his North American counterparts.
New to the documentation revealed by Julian Assange’s Internet portal is that cooperation between the US and Pakistan is slowing down in terms of nuclear proliferation and the increased pace at which Pakistan produces nuclear weapons.
In May, an office of the embassy describing communication with Pakistan as "frustrating" is declared: "There is usually no transparency; on aid offers we receive no answers or they are rejected."
In another message, Peter Lavoy, official of the State Intelligence Service for South Asia, confirms that “despite the economic disaster Pakistan produces nuclear weapons as quickly as no other country.”
Ambassador Patterson asked Washington during a visit to the top army leader, General Ashfaq Kayani, to "clarify to the person responsible" that "Pakistan's army has to stop its tacit support of terrorist groups."
On the hunt for Wikileaks boss
Obama appoints a high-ranking anti-terrorist campaigner to prevent new revelations.
Interpol issued a red warning about Assange’s persecution and discovery.
Everything related to Wikileaks and its founder, Jullian Assange, forms a complicated maze in which things are difficult to explain.
Yesterday, Interpol issued a “red warning” about Assange’s “addiction and persecution.”
However, this is not a traditional order for arrest.
It's not new, it's from November 20.
It also has nothing to do with the recent disclosure of over four million diplomatic documents from the United States, but with the allegations of sexual abuse that the Australian has to face in Sweden.
The WikiLeaks founder's lawyer, Mark Stephens, also said that "the police knew where and how to contact Mr. Assange."
As early as the 20th, the international police authority based in Lyon (France) issued the order at the request of Sweden, but it was not announced until yesterday after receiving the authority from the Swedish authorities.
The 188 Interpol countries are required to identify Assange and find "to arrest and deliver him provisionally."
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red alert, many member states consider the red alert, according to the organization, to be a cover letter for a detention - which must be carried out by the national police - especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case with Sweden and England, where Assange is presumably staying.
Assange’s lawyers who published a letter to Gestes informing him that WikiLeaks’ 39-year-old founder is ready to answer the questions of the Swedish authorities via video conferencing.
They also recall that Assange applied for the exit from Sweden and was compared by the prosecutor, who received the appropriate approval from Stalin’s legendary Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, head of security.
"This is like a hunt, not a legal persecution," the letter said.
While the world is looking for him – and his mother from Australia insists on her son’s innocence – Assange is staying in an unknown place, but not silently.
On Monday, he interviewed Time magazine’s head of Skype from an undetermined location, requesting the resignation of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be proven that she was responsible for the ordering of North American diplomats to spy on the UN and thus violate international agreements signed by the US, she would have to resign," he said.
His opinion was condemned yesterday by White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, who described the request for resignation as “ridiculous and absurd.”
“I’m not sure why we should place value on the opinion of a guy with a website,” he told CNN.
Obama himself has commissioned a senior anti-terrorist campaigner, Rusell Travers, to prevent new document disclosures.
President Barack Obama’s attempt to pay less attention to Assange is in contrast to the opinions that conservative politicians and commentators are announcing these days.
Congressman Peter King, who will chair the National Security Committee of the House of Representatives from January, has called on the State Department to investigate the possibility of putting Wikileaks on the list of terrorist organizations "to seize their funds and prosecute anyone who supports them or makes a contribution."
Tom Flanagan, advisor to Canadian President Stephen Harper, had gone even further, and he had to revoke his statement that Assange must be "murdered."
"Obama would have to turn him into a target and use an unmanned aircraft or something."
Those who did not apologize were Mike Huckabee, a Baptist minister, a former governor of Arkansas, and a possible presidential candidate.
"Whoever was in the government who leaked information, he is guilty of treason and all that is not an execution is a too mild punishment," Fox said.
Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s seeks peace in the ERC with a blink of an eye
The Republican leader allows the party a secret vote on its continued existence in office.
Huguet proposes a more pluralistic government and the end of the Assembly principle.
Joan Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s seems to have found a recipe to get out of the way for the sixth time an internal riot in the ranks of the post-loss of 11 MPs and half of the voteless ERC.
The party chairman is aware that his threat of resignation is not enough for the close relatives of former party leader Josep Llu<0xC3><0xAD>s Carod-Rovira, but he also knows that the influence of this sector today is as weakened as its mentor himself and will not cause him the same headbreak as other former currents.
That is why the leader of Esquerra tries to win the new critics with a wink of an eye, which would secure his position until the next municipal elections.
For the beginning, yesterday announced that the more than 200 regional members of the ERC could make a secret statement about his stay in office.
With ballots, not with a raised hand.
If the Carodists wanted to miss a bill to the President, they could do so without having to fear reprisals.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid both the impression of division and that of submission to his person.
In several interviews, he confirmed that he would feel unconfirmed with half of the votes plus one, and he added without stating percentages, a result "in Bulgarian style" would not be good either.
Carod's close friends are demanding from the president more than just the party to make his office available. An inadequate gesture, as Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s controls the supreme body of Congress.
But since they do not have a sufficient majority to force withdrawals, they will agree on a plan of action with the Executive Board from now until May.
To this end, they expect to be able to participate in the drafting of the document on strategic reorientation, which will be presented to the Council on the 18th.
Their intention is to sponsor Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s, in turn, to promise to present to Congress in the fall of 2011, which the party's leader already believes is a fact.
The party chairman of the ERC believes that the "polyphony" harms stability and he strives once and for all to enable the organization to wash its dirty laundry behind closed doors.
In this sense, the article signed by current Conseller Josep Huguet in his blog is symptomatic.
Given that Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s is an ideologue, the owner of Innovaci<0xC3><0xB3> considered it a fact that the party chairman was supported "in exchange for different goals".
He listed five of them, two of which are in the foreground.
First, the "restructuring" of the board, so that it represents at least 90 percent of the party members, that is, the inclusion of new faces from Carod's environment.
The second could be the big news.
Huguet suggests that ERC should finally abandon the principle of the General Assembly as a way of functioning.
In doing so, he advocates a reform of the statutes, which should enable the congresses to be held with elected delegates.
Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s's team, who fought for it at the last two congresses, is obsessed with ending the Assembly model - an exception in the Spanish party system.
In fact, the party leadership was tasked with reviewing the principle of the general assembly at a Congress to deal with the reforming of the statutes at the 2008 assembly.
This date is still pending, as infogle was not advised of the internal turmoil of recent years in dealing with this matter.
Now, without the critical sectors on the horizon, the time may have come to take up this matter again and conclude it forever.
23 killed in November, 290 in 2010
According to the count of MILENIO, four cases were recorded in México less than in 2010.
In November, 23 people were murdered in México, according to MILENIO México’s count, which is four fewer than in the previous month.
Among the murdered are three women and the discovery of two amputated bodies in the valley of Mexico.
In the penultimate month of the year, we have a total of 390 deaths, which are probably related to organized crime.
Among the cases is a San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitl<0xC3><0xA1>n, a place in Toluca.

The emergency service was looking for the rest of the body parts, but it did not find them.
Residents of Tepotzotl<0xC3><0xA1>n notified of the discovery of a body they had discovered in the area of Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Colorada. The hands were tied back and the head was connected.
The man had a wound that came from the shot of a firearm in his neck.
In the middle of the month, it was reported that two men were killed, enveloped in blankets, and discovered in the trunk of a vehicle parked on the streets of Villas de la Hacienda of the municipality of Tizap<0xC3><0xA1>n de Zaragoza.
A day later, a human head was found in a cardboard box in the settlement of Valle de los Reyes in the village of Los Reyes La Paz.
In a nearby settlement, the rest of the body was found in a black plastic bag with a message signed by El Incorregible.
On the 17th, two dead women were discovered in the Zoquiapan settlement of the municipality of Ixtapaluca, and the next morning in Huixquilucan they found the body of a man wrapped in a yellow-blue blanket, probably named Mario R<0xC3><0xAD>os, according to the news left by his murderers next to him.
In the settlement of San Francisco Acuautla of Ixtapaluca, the lifeless body of a woman was found with shots of firearms in her neck.
On the skin of the woman, tattoos of Santa Muerte as well as chains with corresponding illustrations were discovered.
In the last half of the month, the body of a man with at least three entries and a message signed by a criminal group was found in the municipality of Zinacantepec next to a vehicle.
Two days later, the bodies were discovered by two men whose heads were covered with tape, and a message in the municipality of Puente de Piedra in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
Opposite the body was a message supposedly signed by a criminal organization that said, "This happens to those who don't participate."
In Ecatepec, two bodies tied to hands and feet with traces of torture were found inside a taxi stationed behind the San Agust<0xC3><0xAD>n judicial centre.
On the last day of the month, the bodies of two men were discovered in the communities of Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualc<0xC3><0xB3>yotl.
The first one had been cut in the settlement of Cuchilla Anc<0xC3><0xB3>n and tied in black plastic bags, next to it was a message. The second one had been tortured and was found in the streets of the settlement of Ju<0xC3><0xA1>rez in a plastic bag.
Next to him, the police found a dad with a message.
China maintains its greenhouse gas reduction targets
China’s representative said at COP16 that his country has made enormous efforts to reduce carbon footprints and that it would maintain its offer to mine 40 to 45 percent of its greenhouse gases by 2020.
China holds its offer to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, says Su Wei, the country’s representative at COP16.
At his first public appearance at the 16th United Nations Climate Summit (COP16), Su Wei assured that his country would have made enormous efforts to reduce carbon footprints and shift its industry.
He said his country has invested $245 million over the past four years to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
On the other hand, he stated that China would not change its goals, but would work together with the international community on this matter.
He explained that the Chinese strategy on climate change is divided into four aspects: dialogue, capacity building, institution building, and support for pilot programmes.
In all aspects, progress has been made, including the adoption of a new energy law last year, which includes the objectives of reducing the emission of gases, he explained.
On the other hand, he pointed out that in China, the authorities of the states had worked with those of the central state and the municipalities to achieve the goals of energy saving, efficient use of energy and reduction of emissions.
He also stated that some multi-year plans have already been initiated or completed, both those funded by the Chinese government and those that received funds from other countries.
For example, he referred to the effective use of energy programme introduced in the last five years, which had received investment from the United Nations (UNO), the government and private hands.
There is also a provincial-level project on climate change, another to exchange the traditional light bulbs with energy-saving bulbs, and another to mitigate and adapt, he explained.
Martin Krol, scientific government adviser on climate change in this country, confirmed that China’s efforts were far greater than commonly assumed.
He pointed out that the per capita emission of greenhouse gases in China is six tons per person, while in the United States it is 100 tons. China is responsible for a nine percent overall contribution to environmental pollution.
It is also making unprecedented progress in the field of energy use. The energy efficiency has been increased by twenty per cent in the last five years and by 2020 another is to be done, he explained.
Legal exclusion Espinos: César Nava
The national leader of the PAN stated that the former Panist Party chairman had the right to address the National Order Commission and to demand what the right granted him.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava V<0xC3><0xA1>zquez, assured that the exclusion Manuel Espino Barrientos was right and that the former PAN party chairman had the right to turn to the National Order Commission and demand what the right granted him.
In an interview that took place before Gabino Cué Monteagudos was appointed governor of the state, he explained that the exclusion of Espino was a decision that had been made at the local level.
"It is an independent decision of the Order Commission in Sonora."
"Mr Espino has the right to address the Comisi<0xC3><0xB3>n de Orden del Consejo Nacional in his case via the appeal procedure, so that a decision is taken by a competent body," he added.
On the other hand, he said it was not time to think about 2012 and that an alliance for presidential candidates had never sat at the negotiating table.
Nava V<0xC3><0xA1>zquez was convinced that Acci<0xC3><0xB3>n Nacional was strengthened by the internal vote on 4 and 5 December, in which his successor is elected.
"This (an alliance in 2012) is a topic that was never on the negotiating table, at least not until now. It was a proposal for the municipal election, it was successful and fulfilled its purpose," he explained.
The Panist leader explained that the PAN looks back on 71 years of dialogue, so "do not frighten us internal competition; on the contrary, we enjoy it and it strengthens us," he commented.
He said that the Council would undoubtedly select the best chairman, the Acci<0xC3><0xB3>n Nacional, for the next three years, and therefore surrender the staffs "to those whom the Council would determine."
"I am completely unconcerned and open, and I would be proud to delegate the office of party chairman to each of the five."
He predicted that the party's upsurge in the last elections of July 4 would be reflected in the next elections, although "it's not time to think about 2012."
"Now it's about supporting Governor Gabino Cué in his task."
In this context, he stressed that the three governments that emerged from alliances between Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa would bear the flag and observe it throughout the country, which is why "many hopes and aspirations are placed in it and I am sure Gabino is at the level of the demands."
When asked about the PRI’s criticism of President Felipe Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n for his discourse in the context of his four-year government, César Nava called on the PRI’s supporters to reflect on the six-year period of former Presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI believes that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n, they should start defending them should they finally come out of the closet," he said.
He believes that the owner of the federal government can make expressions like those he can make in his discourse in the Auditorio Nacional, because in this country there would be no ban on speech and even less censorship.
Obama is campaigning on Twitter for the law in favor of undocumented students
“If you’re in favor of passing the Dream Act, call your senators and push for passing this law,” the president of the United States tweeted on the popular social network.
President Barack Obama today supported the nationwide mobilization in support of the Dream Act – law to legalize undocumented students with a message on his personal blog on the social network Twitter.
“If you’re in favor of passing the Dream Act, call your senators and push for passing this law,” Obama tweeted.
Its short message contains a cyber link to a more comprehensive document that urges the public to contact their senators, as the vote of the law is imminent.
“With your voice we are waiting for, the time has come to listen to you,” he emphasizes.
The news was spread after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block all votes for any law, except the expansion of tax cuts from Bush’s era and the government’s funding would be expanded.
Such a blockade, announced on a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could have an impact on the voting of the Dream Act and other projects such as ratifying the new START agreement with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Asked about the blockage of Republicans in the Dream Act and other projects, presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs said he trusted that once the tax topic was resolved, a schedule could be drawn up for the rest of the projects.
"I think we still have a lot of time..."
"We all agree that tax matters must be settled before the end of the year..."
"I think we can make an agreement on this at any time and then we can plan the rest," he said.
The president of the Democratic majority in the Senate, Harry Reid, announced on Tuesday that "he would request the vote at the end of the debate" so that the Dream Act - law with which the initiative to legalize undocumented students could be voted in the Senate from next Thursday, although next week would be more likely.
The version of the Dream Act, or the law of the American Dream, would legalize about 800,000 young people who immigrated to the United States when they were not yet sixteen years old, have lived in that country for the last five years and are enrolled in a higher education institution or army.
But the advocates of the law need sixty votes to pass the initiative, which is why they depend on the votes of a handful of Republicans. At the moment, the organizations of the advocates of this project organize an intensive influence on the passing of the law.
Democrats, the majority of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would vote against it and only one Republican, Richard Lugar of Indiana, has announced his support of the law.
Therefore, the defenders of the Dream Act must get several Republicans on their side if other Democrats should decide to turn their backs on the initiative.
The most popular Republicans include Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as Florida Senator George Lemieux, who assumed the mandate of Senator Mel Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez.
Other Republicans who supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch from Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson from Texas, but they declared that they would no longer support it on another occasion.
Another Republican who had voted for the law, John McCain, has not yet determined his stance.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, the analysts agree that the Dream Act is facing the biggest obstacles in the Senate.
Put your finger in the wound with literature
The second round of 'The Pleasure of Language' was a walk in which the participants made themselves strong for the narrative
"I understand that with sex in the language, but... The finger in the wound? What is expected of me?" asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela, who was to open the second round of 'Los placeres de la lengua', a cycle that celebrated Spanish-language literature and on this occasion explained the subtitle of her question (at another event, the Round Table was dedicated to sex in the language).
The finger in the wound... "brings us into trouble", the Argentine writer sweetly spits in front of the audience, which was composed mainly of young people who came together at the International Book Fair in Guadalajara (FIL) to attend this round table moderated by Marisol Shultz, attended by Valenzuela, Sergio Ram<0xC3><0xAD>rez, Mayra Montero and Luis.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text that she dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio, and then characterized Shultz as a great story. Luisa tells in the first person and is the protagonist who is looking to learn what a "wound" is, and goes from doctor to doctor, of which she receives no answer but clues for the guide to her story.
She says, “Patience is not my strength, maybe it’s my wound.”
Finally, after a frustrating approach to the traumatologist who took her breath in the middle of the walk, but who explains to her that wound is not a scientific term, the psychoanalyst reveals the secret: "The wound is really open, the symbolic is the scar."
The main character of the story sighs relieved and concludes that she "only learned from the wound that it is really open and does not exist", but she is convinced that the desire for language and its traps mix.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ram<0xC3><0xAD>rez also presented a delightful tale, which he called "Lob der Invention", in which the finger in the wound is not mentioned, but is discovered.
With allusions to magical realism, he tells of a famous sorceress who touched the clouds, brought back well-traveled men, or restored the virtue lost by a girl. The story made a turning point and told of America, the great novel that was not missing from its own chronicles from the beginning, and he narrated Bernal D<0xC3><0xAD>az del Castillo, who narrated the stories of Bernal D<0xC3><0xAD>az del Castillo.
"Cervantes, who invited us all (the writers), mocked the deceived witnesses who appeared in the stories presented as true, but in other ways the history of America would never have been told - with imagination that even lost the sense of shame."
However, he points out that "it is the crazies and liars who imagine things best," and there reality and lies approach each other, where one no longer knows which side the narrative belongs to, where the fictional literature reaches the summit.
He calls it the “Tradition Cervantes.”
"From him we have inherited to be what is being told."
When Mayra Montero was on her way, the writer commented and praised the variety of interpretations to which the FIL’s invitation to the Round Table ‘The Finger in the Wound’ had contributed.
The Cuban and Puerto Rican dedicated their contribution to the great wound of social violence that afflicts their country – like all of Latin America – as a result of the struggles for drug trafficking.
"I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a tacit, unintended commitment," she explained after highlighting that literature is communication and commitment that builds up between the author and the readers as in a "chemical reaction."
The evening concluded by Spanish poet Luis Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a Montero, whose contribution also highlighted "this finger of the committed writer in the wound of the writer".
He noted that in a fast-paced world, intellectual habits and control of consciousness also run out on dogmatisms, forgetting that "behind every affirmation there is a little no and behind every denial there is a little yes."
"To be in possession of our thoughts and reality, we must nuance: and nuances often mean to put the finger in the wound and harass those who feel much more comfortable when they think in the form of caricatures, in black and white, in prefabricated ideas without nuances, and also to belittle the powerful who prefer to reintroduce the world into black and white.
Romano fights for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three defeats in finals, he has experienced Aufs and Abs in his career, but three times he played decisive games.
In the duel between Santos Laguna and Monterrey at the end of the match, two different styles, given by their respective coaches, face each other, and their encounter marked by opposites is reflected in the results.
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three defeats in finals, he has experienced Aufs and Abs in his career, but three times he has had decisive games, and so far he has kept well, which is why this opportunity is of particular importance to him.
The Argentinian has played up to the second champion with the medal, he has remained one step behind the winners and surprisingly he has played consecutive finals with the same team.
The Santist strategist reached the first final as a coach at the 'Torneo Apertura 2002', when del Morelia had the reins in his hand, with which he suffered a major defeat against Toluca with 4-2; later, at the 'Clausura 2003' he reached the decisive duel, which he also lost 3-1 to Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna on the 'Torneo Bicentenario 2010', in which they played against Los Diablos, Rubén had to put in a setback again, as the game went undecided with 2-2 against Los Choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but at the penalty point he came forward with 3-1 and got two ways to insert his title, but ultimately three of his players missed the eleven.
Rubén had already lost two finals with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his great rival, so he does not want to be chased again by the misfortune and free himself from the evil spell to be able to celebrate a title for the first time, although he affirms that the most important thing for him is the game itself.
“I want to be a champion, I don’t want to break statistics, that’s for a club, for my affection, and that’s why the title will come to me, but what happens before is the most important thing,” he said when asked about the lost end games.
"The only lesson that we can draw from it is that until the referee does not whistle the end, we cannot celebrate, we are prepared on the line, the players too, because the last time we were prepared with two eleven meters, we are already ready to leave, and I believe that this is not a lesson."
Not knowing that this series could be decided by penalty shootout, we didn't worry about him, because he trusts his players: "You never want to arrive at penalty shootout, you want to finish in regular playtime, but sometimes there is no alternative and you have to be prepared for it, in the previous tour we were prepared, but unfortunately, the title of the game prepared us for a bad game, sometimes because of Nevo, sometimes because of Never.
It is in Romanso’s power to no longer be just a second champion and to taste for the first time the glory that the titles bring.
The U.S. changes the rules for obtaining a visa
Persons must present themselves before their consultation with the consulate at the visa application service points; costs will be reduced in this way.
From 10 January 2011, the procedures for applying for a visa will change at the Embassy of the United States and at the consulates.
In the new procedure, most applicants must present themselves to the Visa Application Service Offices (ASC, the initial letters in English) before their consultation with the consulate.
The personnel of the ASC shall record the biometric data of the applicant, which are checked by the consulate prior to the interview.
The new method has certain advantages for the aspirant, including:
The total cost of processing the visa is reduced, because it is no longer necessary to pay separately the appointment, the processing of the visa application and the transport service with which the document is handed out.
The applicant shall only make a single payment covering the three services.
The current price remains unchanged: the equivalent of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for visas with application (including temporary workers visas) and $390 for hands and investors.
Those who just want to extend their visa do not have to have a conversation in the consulate, they only have to introduce themselves to the nearest ASC, where they submit their documents and take their fingerprints.
As the biometric data is collected in the ASC, applicants who need a second date for the conversation in the consulate remain there less time than before.
Those applying for the visa in the consulates of Ciudad Ju<0xC3><0xA1>rez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo no longer have to pay the service fee of $26.
Additional information on the new visa application procedure can be found at the following website: http://mexico.usembassy.gov/boletines/sp101201_Visas-FAQs.html
NASA announces discovery of extraterrestrial life
The North American Space Agency called a press conference to present a discovery tomorrow that will have an impact on the search for aliens in space.
The U.S. National Aviation and Space Agency (NASA) announced tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery that could confirm the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be presented by experts in astrobiology at a press conference at NASA headquarters in Washington tomorrow at 1 p.m. This is a science that examines the origin, development, distribution and future of life in the universe.
At the convocation of the press conference, NASA assured that it would present "a supervisory finding for the search for extraterrestrial life" which sparked speculation among experts from other countries.
The discovery could prove the theory that human-like creatures could exist in hostile environments that were previously thought to be uninhabitable, and the hypothesis was raised that they could transform into intelligent beings – like humans – if their living conditions improved.
Apparently, it is a microbe found on the bottom of Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, where it lives in an environment considered too toxic for all imaginable life forms, as the lake is highly arsenic-containing.
In some way, the microbie uses arsenic as a survival resource. Taking into account this ability, chances are that there could be similar life on other planets that do not have our protective atmosphere.
When these organisms metabolize the arsenic, it has been proven, according to the astrobiologists, that "there is actually another life form, a second life form that is different from the one we know."
The space agency will announce the actual reach of its discovery at the press conference tomorrow, Thursday.
At the conference, geobiologists Pamela Conrad will take part in the study of the possibility of life on Mars, and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who studies Titan (the largest moon of Saturn) under the question of whether its chemical composition resembles Earth’s.
Gesta PRD, PT, Convergencia and Patr<0xC3><0xB3>n form an opposition bloc
With the reform of the Organ Law on Congress, the two-party system will be introduced, they complain.
The 60th legislative period had just begun, and an opposition bloc, led by the MPs of the PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s Manuel Patr<0xC3><0xB3>n Montalvo, who imagined themselves as independent, had already been installed. The four questioned the following: the entry of the 'two-party system' into the chamber.
Before the start of the 60th legislative session, Felipe Manzanarez Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez of Convergencia, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo of PRD and Patr<0xC3><0xB3>n Montalvo opposed the reform of the organ law, as they were excluded.
With this reform, they reiterated, a 'two-party system' would be introduced, for now it would be two people, the same number as parties that controlled Congress.
These four deputies, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of the PRD, were the only ones to vote against the presidency headed by the Panist Salvador L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Brito and Luis Antonio C<0xC3><0xA1>rdenas Fonseca in his capacity as deputy chairman.
Corvera Quevedo stated that the parties PRI and PAN had institutionally introduced their political stances with these reforms.
He stated that in the next few days they would talk to the representatives of PAN and PRI to change the scheme, assuming their political will and if they did not have it, they would be subject again by both parties, putting an end to the opposition coalition.
"Until this point I come (the opposition coalition), that is what I see, because we are excluded from all decisions, which do not even take into account the opinion of the rest."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez of Convergencia explained that there were similarities with PRD, PT and Patr<0xC3><0xB3>n and that therefore a pluralistic group would be formed.
It cannot be allowed, he continued, that Congress, after being monopolistic, should now be "duopolitic."
"It is not the spirit of legislative reform that an eternal two-party system should prevail in Congress."
"For the start, this group starts with five MEPs and they talk to other colleagues to make them more," the Convergencia member said.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of PT, in allusion to PAN and PRI, stated that Congress had at present turned into a 'boutage' for two.
"Before it was only one party, now they split up into two."
Patr<0xC3><0xB3>n Montalvo requested that MEPs be respected and given their place at the negotiating table.
"It must not be left out because of top five decisions, which are likely to be nine MPs. The five, which are currently seen as split into different factions, have decided to unite to take our place at the negotiating table, because because because of it reform, which was carried out and agreed by the others, we have stayed outside and we do not agree with this reform."
200 000 peso more for "the supplier"
The City of Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n pays another check to the controversial owner of the company for electrical materials.
Another check on just over 200,000 peso in favor of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the city administration.
Thus, the sum paid to the owner of the company for electrical materials in the second half of the year amounts to 1 200 000 pesos.
According to the page for more transparency of the city administration, this check issued to an amount of 200,144.56 peso was issued with the number 9258447 last November 16 with the purpose of "accounting for open invoices".
The treasurer Luis Miguel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Moreno had already sent ahead that more money would go from the community to this supplier. She is observed by the Auditor<0xC3><0xAD>a Superior del Estado because she sells at excessive prices.
What has not been mentioned is the total amount still owed to her and as a result the number of checks still issued in favour of Camacho Palazuelos.
“Nothing was bought from her, just the debt is paid, just like the other suppliers,” he said in an interview.
The last checks "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: 24 September, two from 15 October, 19 October, 29 October and the last from 16 November.
Although the supplier has not yet been published in the Official Journal, as required by law, if a company is called into question by the ASE in order to avoid other administrations applying for their services, the treasurer assured that their services would not be used again.
After the Noroeste newspaper published the check of checks issued by the city administration to its suppliers on July 25, it became known that from March 2008 to July 9, 2010, during the three-year term of mayor Jorge Abel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez, the municipality had paid over 10 million pesos with 42 checks to Camacho Palazuelos.
There were also shops with Jumapam, where they took in checks worth over 3 million peso.
Touristic places need to be improved
Tourist companies regret the accident of foreign tourists due to the poor condition of the Glorieta S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Taboada in Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n.
After the fall of a foreign tourist into the collapse of the Glorieta S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Taboada, Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n's tourism industry requested special attention from the authorities to pay particular attention to the areas that are in poor condition and cast a bad image on the port city.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, chairman of the Zona Dorada dealer association, recalled that on various occasions it was required to maintain the destination and turn the bad conditions that tourists find into new employment opportunities or routes.
He said the poor condition of the streets and walkways would have had a negative effect, as the tourists came to stroll and see the disorder, whereupon they would turn their backs on the nearby shops.
“Politicians don’t know what it means to close a company one day and they don’t worry about how much money you lose, because otherwise they wouldn’t do the construction work in this way slowly and without planning.”
Hotel owner José Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Manguart S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez said the fall of the tourist would have drawn attention to the lack of prevention and the lack of maintenance work on the part of the city.
"The community has to take responsibility and avoid doing this again. How to do it? Now, through preventive maintenance instead of repairing everything afterwards," he explained.
"We are eagerly waiting to have a clean city. Because not only because it is a tourist area, it must be maintained, also we residents have a right to a clean habitat. The city administration must change their strategy to keep the city in good condition."
"There are other places that also look unkempt and unfinished," he said, "for example, el Escudo y el Venadito of Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n."
“Today, we need more than just advertising to attract tourists, a good product needs to be offered, a city that keeps its beaches and streets clean, and the tourist attractions constantly on fire,” he added.
"These precautions have not been given enough attention and these types of incidents merely represent what is obvious to everyone: maintenance is urgently needed."
Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l Llera Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez, Undersecretary of Promoci<0xC3><0xB3>n Tur<0xC3><0xAD>stica, expressed the importance of saving Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n’s touristic places, because they were not properly used and left a bad picture.
He mentioned a number of places that would have to be brought to the fore together with the city. To make the city clean, tidy and attractive for tourism should be priority.
“Luckily, Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n offers many historical and cultural sites, which first need to be cleaned and cleaned to make them attractive for tourism and to bring them to the inventory we advertise for this destination.
IP calls for results from Congress
Eduardo D<0xC3><0xA1>valos, chairman of the CCE, suggested that MEPs should take on the great responsibility of setting a model for a better Sinaloa, which faces many challenges.
Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n’s business sector calls for a dignified parliament, free of interlocutions between the parties and the government, because Sinaloa is upset and facing major problems.
Yesterday the 60th Parliament was inaugurated. It consists of seven political forces, 19 members of the PRI, 13 from PAN, three from Partido Nueva Alianza, two from PRD, one from PT, one from Convergencia and another from PVEM. This makes a total of 40 representatives of the people.
New members of the State Congress are expected to do a clean job, to feel committed to society and to the different social groups that rely on responsible parliamentary work, and not to repeat the same patterns of partisanship and paternalism.
Eduardo D<0xC3><0xA1>valos, Chairman of the CCE Business Coordination Council, suggested that the new MPs should take on the great responsibility of setting a model for a better Sinaloa, which faces many challenges.
"We hope that MPs really exercise their right to act freely between the parties, for it is customary for them to make agreements with which they represent their own interests, thereby transforming themselves into carnival comparses of the rulers and leaders of parliamentary factions."
He said that they should demonstrate their commitment to building the necessary bridges to support the current government.
"We take care that they do a trustworthy job and, above all, work for society and its groups, because it was the inhabitants of Sinaloa who expressed their confidence in them in the last elections."
José Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Manguart S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez, chairman of the hotel association Tres Islas, believes that one of the major challenges facing the 40 representatives of the people is the drive and joint work for the economic growth of the state, because today the economic situation is extremely complicated.
“The most important thing is that they drive economic growth, create investment incentives and infrastructure measures, which will in some way promote job creation.”
With regard to the tourism sector, he called on the new MEPs to allocate the necessary importance in the state budget to support the Ministry of Tourism.
"I understood that it is the Ministry with the second least resources, which is incompatible with an important economic activity that brings foreign exchange and investment to the country and is in direct competition with the agro-industry."
The tourist projects must be allocated funds, state security must be supported, and the alcohol law, which was not redefined in previous legislative periods, must be updated.
The Holy King is being sought
Dolls, cars, bicycles and other toys wish the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family yearning.
For the parents, it will be difficult to fulfill these wishes the next day, because the household is composed of no more and no less than twelve persons and a goat.
Nevertheless, Adelaida, Isabel, Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s, José Alfredo, Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Guadalupe, Isa<0xC3><0xAD>as, José Juan and Miguel do not give up hope that Melchior, Caspar and Balthasar will give them the toys and clothing they so long for.
The family inhabits a modest house in the Salvador Allende settlement. They live by hand in the mouth, because the father has no fixed work.
“Sometimes hard times are hot because my husband doesn’t have a job, but we’re selling mandarins and potatoes... Already in the afternoon I’m going out on the streets with the gore for sale,” said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
The four-year-old Adelaida likes to have a doll or a bicycle, while her three-year-old sister Isabel wants a Barbie doll.
Ten-year-old José Alfredo has long wanted to have a monster car, and for his eight-month-old brother Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s Cayetana, Cayetana suggests clothing in size for one-year-olds.
" (José Alfredo) told me, 'I'd like this monster so much,' but I answered him, 'let's wait, boy,' because it was very expensive," Cayetana recalled sadly.
For the older children who were in school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
The eleven-year-old Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Guadalupe has the size 12; the ten-year-old Isaias has the size 10, while the eight-year-old Miguel has the size 8.
The 14-year-old José Juan lacks tennis shoes. A couple in size 5 1/2 or 6 would be very helpful.
If you want to help realize the dreams of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family, you can participate in the 'Holy King is wanted' campaign by donating a toy or cash in the reception hall of the newspaper Noroeste.
14 suspected drug dealers arrested
On Wednesday, as part of the dismantling of a production and sales network of cannabis, around the ten house searches were carried out in the administrative region of Estrie.
Fourteen people were arrested and will face various charges.
The house searches took place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, where they were said to have served mainly in drug production.
"About 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of hashish, cash and equipment that have served production have been confiscated," Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesman for Quebec's security police, said in a statement.
A total of eleven men and three women were arrested, two of whom are considered the main wire-drivers of the drug ring, from Sherbrooke.
The arrested persons are said to have appeared hours after their arrest in front of the justice building in Sherbrooke.
They could be accused, among other things, of the production of cannabis, the possession of which is for sale, the plot and the service of crime.
These house searches had taken place as a result of a lengthy investigation, which went on for over a year.
“The information obtained from the public sector has allowed us to carry out these arrests,” Mr. Ruel said.
Around 70 police officers from the Estria Regional Investigation Unit of the Quebec Security Police, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphrémagog Police Department participated in this police operation.
Secret immigration could easily be pursued
The Conservatives’ bill, which the government says is intended to regulate the problem of ships laden with secret migrants, is expected to be tainted after the three opposition parties announced on Wednesday that they cannot endorse the proposal.
"I strongly oppose this charter."
"I hold with a party that has put shackles on your feet," said Michael Ignatieff, head of the Liberals, after the weekly Caucus session before the assembled MPs.
The Liberals claimed that the bill, which allows any person identified as illegal immigrants to travel by sea for up to a year, violates the Canadian Constitution of Law and Freedom, as proposed.
Gilles Duceppe, head of the Bloc Québécois, also indicated that he could not support the bill, as he turned against the wrong target group.
“We are against it and it seems that all opposition parties are against it, so we will wait for what the government is doing,” Duceppe said.
Criticism about the immigration issue of Olivia Chow, NDP, has dismissed critics who claim their party did not behave steadfastly enough to covert immigrants.
"The neo-democrats agree to take action against the blind passengers, and this is exactly what we are trying to enforce by means of another bill, the C-35," Chow said.
We therefore do not support the Conservative bill because it seeks the blame on the refugees and keeps children trapped for at least a year,” Chow said.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney accused the opposition parties of playing with politics and ignoring the will of Canadians.
"The Canadians are telling MPs that they do not tolerate this kind of clandestine immigration, these criminal acts that affect Canada and treat the country like a foothold."
"You expect Canada to take tough action," said Minister Kenney's response.
"The government has not announced any vote of confidence regarding its bill that could have led the country to elections that the government would have rejected.
A conservative, however, told the QMI agency that the government would convene a vote so that every opposing MP would immediately explain himself to his constituents.
The new unit finds no unanimity
Despite the announcement of the possible establishment of a new standing unit to fight corruption and collusion by Jean Charest, numerous observers continue to call for the formation of a public inquiry committee on this issue.
Robert Dutil, Minister of Public Security, claims that this idea did not originate from yesterday: Quebec had already consulted the New York Department of Investigation on this issue last January.
The metropolis has had a standing unity against corruption since 1870.
However, Wednesday’s announcement surprised more than just one.
It must be said that this measure was not discussed in the slightest on the occasion of the meeting of the Permanent Committee of the Quebec Police Service on 29 October last year, despite the presence of Robert Dutils.
It was also not lacking that Stéphane Bergeron, critic and member of the Québécois party, qualified this announcement in terms of public safety as a "canine spelled out of the hat" as well as "a solution that was rightfully made at the end of the table".
Minister Dutil, in turn, had turned to those who fear that political power had too much influence on the questionable future unity.
“You will see the result when we announce it,” he said.
“You are aware of this problem.”
According to Réjean Parent, the president of CSQ, nothing can replace the conduct of a public survey.
"The more M. Charest insists on wanting to prevent the formation of this committee of inquiry, the more people like you and I will think he has something to hide," he said.
"The only means to be able to form a committee of inquiry is the resignation of Jean Charest," said Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and political systems at the ENA (State University for the training of senior administrative officials).
In order to get out of this dead end, he proposes to Quebec to grant financial audit control a special mandate so that it can carry out appropriate investigations about corruption and secret agreements.
“You should be able to extend the mandate of audit control,” he said.
He also believes that the Quebec Audit Office could grant the same power as Commissioners, which would also allow it to oblige people to testify.
The formation of a standing unit is not the only project in the drawers of the government of Charest.
Quebec will also require Ottawa to amend the penal code to better address these types of crimes.
This demand comes from the chief prosecutor of Operation Marteau, who informed Justice Minister Jean-Marc Fournier that the case law in this type of prosecution is not clear.
Vic Toews, Minister of State for Public Security, confirmed that his colleague from the Justice Department, Rob Nicholson, is currently dealing with certain amendments concerning this dossier.
During Operation Printemps in 2001, which involved the groups of motorcycle policemen, 131 people had been arrested, although the criminal law had not been levelled.
As a result, Ottawa passed the law against gangsterism.
Rivers under strict surveillance
Several rivers remain under strict surveillance due to the high rainfall that has eroded in some regions of the province since Tuesday.
In Shawinigan, in the administrative region of Mauricie, there was a landslide on Wednesday afternoon.
Two houses were evacuated preventively.
In the evening another landslide occurred in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in the administrative region of Lanaudiere.
A road has collapsed into itself.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, heavy rains of 40 to 70 milliliters of precipitation have fallen on several regions.
Between 20 and 40 more millimeters of precipitation were expected here according to the regions until Thursday evening.
The areas north of the river and the valley of the Outaouais region were most affected.
Up to 100 millimeters of rain showers had fallen here.
Since the snow melt is still to be added to these precipitations, which has already accumulated in certain sub-areas, the crossing of several watercourses is feared.
On Wednesday evening, warnings were issued by the Quebec Security Service about the flood alarm regarding the rivers Ouareau and Achigan in the Lanaudiere region.
The rivers in the north, in Saint-Jér<0xC3><0xB4>me, in the Laurentine Mountains and the Ch<0xC3><0xAA>ne in Lotbini<0xC3><0xA8>re become the object of flood monitoring and remain under observation.
In the Lanaudi<0xC3><0xA8>re region, heavy rainfall has caused the crossing of some lakes in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, an escape bridge was torn down due to the heavy rainfall.
Ten residences had to be evacuated as a preventive measure.
In Outaouais, the crossing of certain lakes has caused the closure of several roads, especially in the commune of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The security service remains alert and closely monitors the situation, according to Security Councillor Annik Bouchard.
On Wednesday, the Quebec State High Water Centre issued warnings of the strong rise of several rivers, in particular of Maskinongé, Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont partially justified
Quebec broadcaster Stéphane Dupont has suffered a partial setback in front of the Canadian Broadcasting Standards Supervisory Board (CCNR) for his controversial statements about social welfare and Haitians as well as for his outspoken talk about radio.
The CCNR takes the view that M. Dupont and his CHOI 98.1 FM team have the right to express their own views, but certain statements would have contained "inaccurate information about social welfare and unjustified negative representations of Haitians as well as such an unbiased speech that is not appropriate for the broadcasts broadcast during the day."
The Supervisory Board also concluded that a discussion about suicide involving the dissemination of the names of two persons who committed suicide violates the code of broadcasting.
The CCNR had received several complaints regarding the comments made during the broadcasts during the period 2008 and 2010.
The first order was filed as a result of a complaint by the "Front commun des personnes assistées sociales du Québec".
The activist organisation had complained that the amounts mentioned in the broadcast were inaccurate.
Rather, the moderators should provide solid as misleading information.
On the subject of suicide, moderator Stéphane Dupont had expressed the view that suicide was an expression of cowardice.
The majority of the Supervisory Board members had come to the conclusion that the message conveyed here was that suicide should not be seen as a solution to life crises.
"The majority of the Supervisory Board takes into account that the consequences of the broadcast "Dupont le midi" in question would have addressed a sensitive issue in a family-friendly and appropriate manner."
Therefore, he was not charged with any guilt towards his person.
The last point of contention concerned statements relating to the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had come up with a media-effective argument that caused a lot of reactions.
The CHOI moderator had stated not to have donated in favor of Haiti aid, as one did not know for sure whether the needy would actually receive the money donations.
The Supervisory Board is of the opinion that these comments were not abusive in nature, but that their cumulative effect presents an unjustified negative representation of Haitians.
"I have already waived my three-day suspension penalty in this matter."
“My file has been virgin for a year and a half,” the moderator explained.
In all decisions, the Supervisory Board denounces the spread of an unbiased expression.
In all cases, the CHOI-FM broadcaster acted "beyond its obligations".
The consequences for the radio station, which, among other things, had to announce its decisions once during the main broadcast time within a period of three days, are minor.
A King of the Kung Fu in Montreal
Nacereddine Zemmal, of Montreal’s Algerian origin, has taken a very special course.
The athlete, who shines in "Sanda" (full contact Kung-Fu), in kickboxing and in Thai boxing, now rises in search of new challenges on the Tatami and in the boxing rings of the world.
"I started 12 years ago in Algeria with martial arts such as Kung-Fu and kickboxing," said Zemmal, who has been based in the metropolis since 2008 to further develop among the professionals.
I personally seek the fight everywhere, because for those who don't like the ground fight, as the mixed martial arts present it, competitions in North America are rare."
Recently, the security officer and UPS employee had given bad news to his rivals, in which he won two gold medals from the World Karate and the Kickboxing Association (WKA) at the World Amateur Championship held between 23 and 30 October in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I won the victory in the categories of full contact kickboxing and Thai boxing," he said.
“At the moment, I’m preparing for the World Cup in San Shou, China.”
“It was those fighters from each category who had placed in the last World Cup among the first four.”
"I babe fetched bronze in 2009 in Toronto."
"In 2005 I was behind in Vietnam."
"In 2007 I finished the tournament in fifth place in China, while in 2009 I finished third in Toronto," he added.
"It's worth noting that I've made progress in every competition."
"With this rhythm I will be first this time or next year!"
"San Shou" or "Sanda" are Chinese-born disciplines in which fist strokes and footsteps as well as floor throws are permitted.
The two fights usually take place on a platform, less often in a boxing ring.
The most renowned boxing fighter that emerged from this type of martial arts is the American Vietnamese-born Cung Le, who is well known in the world of martial arts.
Should Nacer Zemmal retain only one event in his career, he would certainly call his presence here at the Super Tournament "King of Sanda", the Super Bowl of Kung Fu.
“This competition is the highest ranking and most respected in China,” said the sympathetic pundskerl.
"It's a bit like the equivalent of Lumpinee Stadium (the biggest stadium in Thailand)."
“It was a super experience.”
Zemmal had won his first match in the semi-finals of his category (80kg) before losing in the final.
“The one who defeated me was a real professional,” he analyzed.
"There are four contenders per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 95 kg)."
"The winners of the semi-finals meet each other in the final of their category."
"Then the winners of each category will face each other to crown a single champion, the King of Kung Fu."
450 million in non-procurement contracts
Hydro-Québec has agreed to grant $450 million to project planning companies in contracts for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcell-Rupert hydropower project.
A consortium consisting of BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which has received the most important share, i.e. that of project management, to a sum of $295 million without a tender, is in the midst of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts.
This consortium, called "<0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance", was formed in 2004 as an accompaniment to Hydro-Québec's decision to transfer its responsibility to the private sector to this important, hydroelectric project amounting to a sum of $5 billion.
At the beginning of 2005, the consortium "<0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance" entered into the lucrative contract without a public tender.
For the Québécois party, recourse to corporate consortia is a serious ethical problem that raises the risk of distortion of competition and an increase in prices.
“This is a new way of playing a mapped game and de-energizing the competition.”
“This means that instead of playing cards, they are now being played in an open form in a secret way,” said Sylvain Simard, PQ’s deputy, at the press conference.
In the early morning, Simard had raised the question before the National Assembly, because it seems difficult for him to understand how the public’s interest can be served in this way.
Resource Minister Nathalie Normandeau had responded in the afternoon by vehemently disclosing the fact that this contract was a truncated game.
"I remain faithful to my line," she weathered, affirming that the PQ had been "unreasonable" and it "missed her hardness".
She said it's "be the minimum" that the PQ apologizes.
The model of the consortium is common practice worldwide.
It is usually a temporary alliance that allows two or more companies to pool their expertise on a bid to a tender for a complex project.
The project "Eastmain" has a high level of complexity with regard to its scale of work.
The construction process is in progress and is scheduled to be completed by 2012.
Nevertheless, the contract was awarded without a competitive battle having taken place; there had already been negotiations.
In addition, the consortium’s model in Quebec is no longer an exception even for relatively simple projects.
As the newspaper "Le Devoir" noted last week, the model of the consortium used in the field of civil engineering and consulting is the subject of government investigations.
A short overflight of the Quebec business register allows to name more than 200 consortia, some of which seem to be permanent.
In this way, for example, Dessau works in partnership with the majority of its core competitors, including CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin or Roche and Tecsult.
Any connection, and of which there are several dozen, leads back to one and the same legal entity, namely to Dessau.
As far as the consortium "<0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance" is concerned, Minister Normandeau stressed that "the territory of Baie James is subject to a special labour force dynamic and that Hydro-Québec has been paying special attention to this fact since the 1970s".
Réal Laporte, the great employer of the Société d'énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has made a statement that the nose about the fact that the project management contract was approved by agreement.
“If you make a tender and there are only a few applicants, your prices will go up.”
"So you have two options: either you take the people who are on this march and tell yourself: you will negotiate a satisfactory agreement at a good price."
“The idea, however, is that not the price is decisive, but the expertise of the people,” Laporte said.
This contract, approved by the consortium "<0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance", is part of a long list of contracts for more than 50,000 dollars received from the Parti Québécois.
The contracts were approved by either Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-sarcelle-rupert project.
After review, the newspaper "Le Devoir" counted more than 100 engineering and consulting contracts that were approved by companies or their branches, including resource laboratories, between 2002 and March 2010.
SNC-Lavalin had signed 22 contracts, Génivar had received 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without including their participation in "<0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance".
All these contracts have been negotiated.
They total $449,783,344, which includes the contract with "<0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance" for $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard had said that the four companies forming the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) of the "Parti libéral du Québec" were well known.
Minister Normandeau had sounded that the PQ was equally linked to the companies that “financed” it, before specifying that it was rather about its executives.
Barometer responsible consumption - The "green" label is not trusting
Greener, but unscrupulously skeptical.
The Quebec consumer has little confidence in the main actors of sustainable growth, but also little in the labelled brands or eco-labels to control his choice.
It is a pity, even though it bathes in a media-effective universe, where information abounds in favor of more responsible consumption: the barometer of responsible consumption has a lack of credible information to complain of, an inadequacy that is evident as a brake on his commitment, as the first reading that was held yesterday showed.
Although they promoted the consumption of so-called socially acceptable products in 2010, the Quebecers still seem to pay little credit to those trying to sell them.
Two-thirds of the Quebec population admits that in fact they do not believe in the environmental commitment of companies as much as green corporate advertising, according to the measuring instrument developed by the responsible consumer centre at Sherbrooke University.
Another finding: half of consumers doubt the trustworthiness of official certificates attached to supposedly fair products, but also the credibility of products and brands that declare themselves environmentally conscious, according to the barometer.
According to the same pattern, the discourse of politicians on this subject is taken seriously by only 14.6% of the Quebec population.
Nevertheless, information on responsible consumption seems important to stimulate this consumer segment, which is currently being revived by nearly a third of Quebec’s consumers.
In fact, the emptiness and dubious nature of the information dampened the zeal of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the barometer after the higher price of the products.
In addition, one-third of Quebecers are suspicious of the stated performance of green products and services that they are trying to provide.
According to another communication, more than half of consumers had already changed their habits in 2010 and mainly changed the brand of one or more products to express their convictions.
According to Barometer, they also favoured 61% purchases from retailers in their neighborhood and favoured the purchase of food grown in their region.
Greener and more responsible - the index of environmentally conscious consumption had reached a 64 of the maximum value of 100 this year - the gay consumer of Quebec loves to present himself as king of recycling, who tries to reduce his environmental footprint by taking care of animal welfare.
But the social and environmental awareness seems to stop in front of his car, according to the barometer: only 28% of Quebecers indicated that they had used public transport in 2010 or preferred the ride-sharing centre to demonstrate their ecological interest.
The addition and cycling were also supported by 39.1% of the participants in this comprehensive behavioral survey, which feeds the stereotypes.
Government bond for the acquisition of eXcentris
The Quebec government, which was asked by Société Angus and Parall<0xC3><0xA8>le to participate financially in the acquisition of the eXcentris cinema complex, agrees to cooperate, but only in the form of a competitive bond.
The developer company Angus and Parall<0xC3><0xA8>le, who had hoped for a donation of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to acquire the Daniel Langlois-owned cinema complex eXcentris on Boulevard Saint-Laurent in order to relinquish its actual cinematic function, apparently did not receive what they requested.
The government has accepted to be involved in this matter, but on its own terms.
Instead of the expected donation, the Quebec government offers a bond of less than the initially expected amount that could bring an viable solution to favorable conditions, at least in the opinion of the sources that can be extracted from the state-run rumor kitchen.
A first action plan as well as a request for 12.8 million had already been rejected by Quebec last spring, the petition has been recalculated since the resumption of the downturn.
A proposal, together with an action plan, have already been sent by the president of the Société de développement des entreprises culturalles (SODEC), Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Macerola, to Minister St-Pierre, who heads the eXcentris file.
Several days ago, he had sent her a final factual report.
However, the cabinet’s counter-proposal was submitted to the SODEC on Wednesday.
Parall<0xC3><0xA8>le and Angus now have until December 31 to respond to this.
In any case, the premise of the state donation really seems to have been pushed aside.
Let us recall that the Quebec-owned community of cinemas and cinema complexes had rebelled against a direct state investment in support of the acquisition of eXcentris, arguing that the Minister of Culture had no financial support for real estate projects there, which he did not also provide to other cinema halls.
However, in contrast, several other market participants in the segment complained of substantial economic aid.
Film director Daniel Langlois, after the self-financed design of the cinema, had presented the author cinema in the premises of his cinema complex for over ten years in great difficulty, which could justify the exceptional position on the part of the state treasury.
The lack of cinemas showing independent films is more than obvious in Montreal, and eXcentris knew how to keep his clients at the bar.
Société Angus and Parall<0xC3><0xA8>le, with Christian Yaccarini at the top, run a privately funded campaign, hoping to raise $700,000 to boost the acquisition.
Since the spring of 2009, only one screen continues to show films in eXcentris, namely Le Parall<0xC3><0xA8>le.
The aim of the future buyers is to reopen the three cinemas on February 27 next year with the screening of the very successful film of Xavier Beauvois "Des hommes et des dieux".
Christian Yaccarini, however, did not call off the newspaper "Le Devoir" and one ignores what he and his group think of the downward-corrected proposals that they have made.
Secret of complex shaken Canada ventilated
The new American diplomatic lines disseminated by WikiLeaks reveal the secret of what the United Nations considers to be Americans under the Canadians’ inferiority complex, but they also reveal the latter’s superiority over Canada with the same blow.
As a result, the American diplomats are surprised that the Canadian electorate does not have Canadian-American relations in mind at the ballot, and they believe that President Obama’s visit would have helped the Conservative government enforce its 2009 budget!
The four new communications between the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, which were publicized yesterday, offer even more piquant details than the mere substantial content you have to nibble on.
A connection dated 22 September 2008, i.e. during the period when the federal election campaign was in full swing, reports on the point from which the United Nations no longer participates in the operations discussed by its political leaders.
To the great surprise of David Wilkins, the American ambassador to Ottawa.
Mr Wilkins offers various explanations of this situation.
"Consequently, a Canadian-dominant inferiority complex may cause Canadian political leaders to talk much more about internal issues of everyday life than to push the United States to black Peter in this election (as in 1988 in the campaign on free trade)," he describes.
The United Nations, he concludes, is thus "the proverbial goliath of this election: omnipresent but potentially too threatening to speak of it."
The ambassador understands this "ear-stupid silence" all the less, as the two countries have intense political and economic relations.
“Logically,” he assesses, “it should be the ability of a candidate, a party, and much more of a party leader to lead such an essential relationship that the voter has in mind as a key factor in the urn process.”
The other expression of this sense of importance is read in the announcement sent on January 22, 2009 by Terry Breese, business owner in Ottawa, which President Barack Obama is to prepare for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Their journey will help ensure the government's continued existence in the vote of confidence over the federal budget at the beginning of February, when Canada will announce its first deficit after more than a decade, resulting from a $30 to $40 billion revitalization program," Breese said.
No one had mentioned that the government had had to postpone the parliamentary session before Christmas in order to prevent Parliament from being overthrown by the coalition and that the consequent continuation of the opposition parties would have an impact on the quality of the proposed revival programme.
Another communication, dated January 2008 and written by Ambassador Wilkins, informs Washington of the increasingly negative picture that the dramatic series broadcast via CBC are spreading from the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about broadcasts such as Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, where you can observe little subtle allusions to Maher Arar, the “no-fly list” or even abductions for the purpose of interrogations conducted by CIA muscle prots.
Another report details how Hillary Clinten asked her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner at her first bilateral meeting whether Europe was ready to take in certain prisoners from Guantanamo.
Mr Kouchner is said to have answered the question yes, but on the basis of an individual "case to case" decision.
At the end of the meeting, as described, "he handed over to the Secretary of State a paper in terms of Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
"The Secretary of State has promised to re-examine the file".
Finally, let’s note that the minds are warming up with regard to the WikiLeaks website.
Tom Flanagan, an old and Stephen Harper very close adviser, had stated via CBC that those responsible for this massive leak should be "killed."
He had referred here to Mike Huckabee from the United States.
Global Plan for the Renewal of Lighting
The UN has proposed a plan in Cancun yesterday to renew the lighting of households, trade and industry in 100 countries with a view to achieving a reduction in greenhouse gas (CFC) equivalent to nearly one-third of the additional reduction that needs to be realized to stabilise the Earth’s climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan takes its place in the steps taken by the UN in Cancun in order to compensate for the absence of mandatory reduction commitments by developed countries.
According to the plan submitted yesterday, the main problem would be avoided in the form of 1.8 billion tons (Gt) of the CFC emitted to Earth due to the lighting, if the white-hot bulbs, which so far still constitute a 50 to 70% monopoly on the market, would be replaced by fluorescent or better still, by light-emitting diodes (LEDs).
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This corresponds to an equivalent of 70% of the emissions of the global fleet.
In Copenhagen last year, major emissions emitters such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed themselves to voluntary reduction plans that should downturn global CFC emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, 5 Gt would have to be subtracted from this balance sheet to stabilise the 2 degrees Celsius increase from today to 2020 to prevent it from falling out of control.
In the white-hot bulbs, 95% of the energy escapes in the form of heat, and the remaining 5% produce the light.
With the compact fluorescent bulbs, energy consumption is reduced by 75%, with the new LED bulbs, this energy requirement is reduced once again by twice.
The compact fluorescent bulbs average between 6000 and 10,000 hours.
The new LED light bulbs, such as those introduced by manufacturer Philips this week - by the way, this company has participated in the UN study - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a white-hot bulb, which provides an indication of the savings potential of the exchange plan to be applied in 100 countries.
In addition to the fact that these completely novel light bulbs emit very little heat, they can also work with a regulating resistance.
They do not contain any mercury.
Several specialists have shown that compact fluorescent bulbs have reserves, as they contain mercury and that it is therefore necessary to dispose of them as special waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, unless producers provide a point of acceptance.
However, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet, according to the report, is not the compact fluorescent bulb, but rather the coal-fired power plants that emit significantly more mercury to generate the electricity wasted by the white-hot bulbs.
In the United States alone, these coal-fired power plants emit 25,000 tons of mercury annually.
The report details the profits that each country would generate thanks to this international programme.
Indonesia would, for example, save one billion dollars a year in the purchase of electricity and eight million tons of CO2, which means an equivalent of 3.5 coal-fired power plants whose construction would cost Indonesia 2.5 billion.
Ivory Coast excited to announce election results
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called for the "immediate" publication of the results of the Ivory Coast presidential election right after the deadline.
"The Secretary-General underlines the need for the independent electoral commission to maintain its work and to announce the provisional results without further delay," a UN chief press secretary said in a statement.
"He asks all parties and institutions of the Ivory Coast to prove their responsibility and to abstain from any initiative until the provisional results are announced."
Despite the pressure exerted by certain foreign governments, the Electoral Commission had passed the deadline set on Wednesday at midnight, three days after the election on Sunday, without publishing the results.
About forty minutes before the deadline, the president of the CEI had confirmed on television that the Commission would "continue to work" to announce the results.
On Wednesday, multiple calls from around the world have become loud, but the CEI may finally name the winner of the second round of elections under Laurent Gbagbo and his opponents Alassane Ouattara.
However, the Gbagbo camp expects the cancellation of "fraud" voting in the north by the Constitutional Council, which was achieved by the ex-rebel camp of the Forces nouvelles (UN) during the coup failed in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, head of the Ivory Coast presidential campaign, had confirmed that the UN-practiced maneuvers to intimidate voters in the north of the country had deterred the president's supporters from going to the election.
The entire election could be annulled if the actions brought by Gbagbo are taken into account by the Constitutional Council.
However, the Gbagbo counterparts are now more of the view that the country's highest court is not neutral, as it is headed by Paul Yao N'Dré, a politically closely associated with Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, man of the north who denies any connection to the former rebels, has assessed the delay in announcing the election results as "unacceptable" and asked Gbagbo to respect them, even if he has not gone so far as to claim victory.
His allies reaffirm that Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results because he knows he has lost; and filing a complaint before the Constitutional Court after preventing the Electoral Commission from publishing the results is illegal.
The second round of the presidential elections on Sunday was held for the coronation of the unification and reconciliation process of a country divided into two parts over years.
The United Nations warned the Ivory Coast politicians on Wednesday that they could be held responsible for them in the event of any riots.
Laurent Gbagbo had taken the first round of voting on October 31 with 38% of the vote against the 32% for Alassane Ouattara, who enjoyed the public support of former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round), as the top candidate.
Unemployment in France remained stable in the third quarter
The unemployment rate in France, according to the International Labour Office (IAA) in the metropolis, is stable at 9.3% (including the overseas departments at 9.7%), according to preliminary, seasonally adjusted data published by the Federal Statistical Office Insee on Thursday.
The unemployment rate in the metropolis is 2,631 million.
The figures for the second quarter amounted to 9.3% of the working population in the metropolis and 9.7% with the inclusion of overseas departments.
Over the year, the unemployment rate recorded an increase of 0.1 percentage points.
In more detail, 3.4 million French metropolis workers were not employed in the third quarter, but wanted to find a job, including whether or not they were able to work every two weeks, or whether or not they were looking for work.
The situation of young people on the labour market continued to deteriorate with an increase in the unemployment rate of 24.2% in the metropolis (+ 0.9 percentage points seen within three months, +0.5 percentage points over the year) and 25% with the inclusion of the overseas regions.
In the third quarter, 637,000 young people aged between 15 and 24 were unemployed, according to the IAA.
In turn, the elderly have a slight increase in the unemployment rate of 6.4% in the metropolitan area (+0.2 percentage points over three months and seen over the year), i.e. 482,000 of the over 50-year-olds, 6.6% with the inclusion of the overseas departments.
Only the 25-49 year-olds had benefited from the stability of unemployment in the third quarter; 8.3% in the metropolis (-0.1 percentage point over three months, +0.1 percentage point over one year) and 8.8% in France as a whole.
After a dispute over his calculation procedures, the Federal Statistical Office of Insee no longer publishes the monthly unemployment figures since 2006.
On the other hand, Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union, continues to use this method and on Tuesday announced a quota of 9.8% in France for October (including the overseas departments) compared with 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini charged and arrested
Alexandre Guérini, 53, head of a disposal company and brother of the President of the General Council of the Bouches-du-Rh<0xC3><0xB4>ne region (PS), was initiated an investigation and he was sent to prison in Luynes near Aix-en-Provence in the course of an investigation into the public and suspected markets.
Alexandre Guérini was charged with embezzlement of social assets, embezzlement of public property, guile, complicity in corruption, unlawful bribery and possession of weapons, according to his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini is ready to fight and intends to speak out on all the questions that the prosecutor will ask him, rather than spreading brainaches."
“It’s easy to put a number of criminal charges before him, another thing is to prove them,” said Florence Rault, an AFP (Agence France Presse) lawyer, before his client’s hearing.
Mr. Guérini, brother of Jean-No<0xC3><0xAB>l Guérini, the first man of the PS (Parti socialiste) in the department, had put emphasis on giving the judge a memorandum of justification before his hearing by means of his lawyers.
A relative of Guérinis, Philippe Rapezzi, was also charged and imprisoned on Wednesday evening.
According to lawyer Lucien Simon, her client had never done anything but keep his landfill running.
He would never have known about the business area of competence or the destination of the associated funds, according to Simon.
In this affair, Daniel Pinna, former Director General of the Public Service of the Aubagne metropolitan area, was also charged on Wednesday for embezzlement and complicity, but then, under the condition of remaining away from the protagonists of these acts under judicial supervision, was released.
"My client was able to provide explanations about the facts that were accused of him."
"The senior prosecutor has taken into account not to deprive him of his freedom," his lawyer Yann Arnoux said.
Four other people had been charged and released from prison on the night of Tuesday to Wednesday, including two of them under legal supervision, Deputy Attorney General Michel Raffin said.
Michel Karabadjakian, Deputy Managing Director of the Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM) disposal company, is prosecuted for "unauthorised influence and passive bribery".
Two state officials of the Aubagne metropolitan area, Mich<0xC3><0xA8>le Duval and Christophe Bringuier, were also arrested, one on the basis of the title "Intervention and Dissension of Public Goods by a Public Service Commissioner", the other on the grounds of "competence in the embezzlement of public funds".
The life partner of Alexandre Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, was also charged with "slaughtering and embezzlement of social assets".
Among the people who were confronted with Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently imprisoned for a similar affair of fraudulent public machinations that had affected Corsica.
The Fahnder suspect his company has contributed to washing money from "high" criminal circles.
The investigation against X for alleged fraud in the awarding of public contracts, in particular in the disposal sector, was carried out in April 2009 as a result of anonymous letters in the files of several open investigations.
It is clear from close sources that the investigation focuses in particular on the conditions of the surcharge and the operation of a landfill in La Ciotat, which also refers to waste from the Aubagne area, as well as from certain cities of the Marseille (MPM) urban catchment area.
Affaire Clotilde Reiss: The Elysée Palace exaggerates its intermediary function for Syria
Within more than six months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, a young French researcher detained in Iran for "espionage," kept the French public in breath, alerted diplomacy, and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All this under the attentive gaze of the diplomats of the United States.
The American documents obtained by WikiLeaks and reviewed by the newspaper Le Monde reveal some background of this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée had explained to the Americans its strategy, which went so far as to give this advice on how to deal with their own crisis of "carrying" in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They point out how the French officials have tried to convince Washington that the liberation of the young French woman does not have the benefit of the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian prisoner in France and sought by the American judiciary because of trade in material in favor of the Iranian nuclear program.
Finally, they put the way in which the French bureau has tried to manipulate the media for the purpose of making it credible the idea that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad played a central role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss, in a glaring light.
In fact, he had done nothing in this regard.
A diplomatic telegram, edited in Paris on 12 August 2009, bears the title "Iran: French Comments on the Way of Dealing with Hostages".
Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Richier, Elysée consultant on strategy issues, spoke with Patrice Paoli, director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explained to her the French method.
They advised Americans to do everything possible to bring back their own nationals who would be held violently in Iran.
"Power noise," they said, "articulates loudly and clearly and without ceasing" the words "principal human rights", "innocent", "immediate release" in the media.
This is necessary to embarrass the Iranian regime, which is very sensitive to its image.
"Do this all the more, especially since the Iranians are asking you not to do so".
Because "silent silence does not solve anything", past the discussions over inconspicuous ways, the Iranians are "masters in evasion maneuvers".
Mr Richier adds that the arrest of foreigners is a "common Iranian tactic": "accompaniment for the purpose of political blackmail".
He announced the release of Clotilde Reiss from prison (which was due to come into effect on August 16, the day she fled to the French embassy) "require the payment of a large sum of money to the Iranians" (230,000 euros bail).
And he lets it be said that Elysée is anticipating further hostage-taking, a phenomenon that "will sharpen itself".
The Iranians could “in the near future arrest another of the approximately 1,800 French citizens living in Iran,” he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss was released from prison twelve days ago, but is still being held in Iran.
An information has been circulated: Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition the United States demands to Iran due to illegal trade in sensitive electronic material, has been released from custody in Paris after a judge’s decision.
The American embassy, like many other observers, is asking questions about this disturbing coincidence.
For Washington, which pursues the illegal Iranian networks of the acquisition of the material provided for the nuclear program, the release of Majid Khakavand is a bad news.
Did France buy a cow trade?
The liberation of the Iranian against that of the French?
On the occasion of a renewed discussion with Kathleen Allegrone on 4 September, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Richier assures that this is not the case.
The Elysée, he says, was not only "totally surprised by the judge's decision", but also tried to oppose it.
"There has been a lively exchange between the French Bureau and the French Minister of Justice" (currently Mich<0xC3><0xA8>le Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot change the judicial decision," he explains.
Mr Richier would also like to point out that Majid Kakavand continues to be under the “strict” supervision of the French intelligence service.
The Elysée consultant picks a phone number, puts it up again, then informs the American diplomat, the Iranian "is currently in the buildings run by the Iranian embassy in Paris".
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysée does not spare its efforts to believe through announcements and media-organized "exploitation" that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad is playing an "important" and "influential middle role".
Americans do not observe this activity without irony and note that manipulation bears fruit, as several press articles reflect the official French version.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009 conjures up "the media flash of the French authorities".
What is the basis of so much “thank you” to Mr. Assad, the Paris embassy is asking itself.
"Despite their declarations of praise, the French authorities secretly admit that they only have a vague idea of what the Syrians actually did".
The document then deals with the reasons that led the Elysée to lapse this fiction.
The intensive communication effort “is aimed at confirming Sarkozy’s policy of opening up to Syria,” he analyses.
A policy launched in 2008 that was "earned and perceived as unearned by numerous voices of critics in France and abroad".
"Building up the Syrian role," Paris tries "to show Syria what promise can be achieved by playing a constructive role in the region".
The goal is also to sow “civility between Syria and Iran”.
The American Embassy knows this from a good source.
On August 11, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Richier had entrusted her: "Of course we do not know whether the Syrians have done anything".
"But we thank you in spite of everything."
"This should at least cause confusion among Iranians".
Clotilde Reiss returns to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives them in the Elysée.
In a communiqué, he thanked the President of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in favor of the release of our compatriot".
No online games for young Koreans after midnight
The South Korean government will pass a law called “the Cinderella,” which will ban young people from playing online games after midnight by blocking them from accessing, government officials said.
A bill to urge online gaming operators to deny access to these games to young people under 16 years of age after midnight will be presented to Parliament in December, described representatives of cult and family ministries.
"Many children play these games all night long and then have difficulty learning at school and also having a normal life during the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep," said Jo Rin, Ministerial Representative of the French Press Agency Agence France Presse.
The online games will be available again from 6 a.m.
The producer companies had a year to prepare for the application of the law, he specified.
The government is also keen to ask manufacturers to reduce the time limit allowed daily for access to these games to those young people whose parents ask for it, the responsible added.
He will also provide free programs to those who wish to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries, and the newspapers regularly report various events associated with intensive Internet use.
The country is also an undisputed champion in worldwide online game competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals in the World Cyber Games against 58 other nations.
World Cup 2018-2022: FIFA appoints the host country
On Thursday, the FIFA Executive Committee, in bright excitement due to corruption suspicion, will appoint the host countries of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, a highly political election in which squabbling for influence and lobbying threaten to push the technical criteria into the background.
However, one thing is certain: the 2018 edition of FIFA’s Royal Discipline will take place in Europe, its traditional stronghold (the 4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 edition will then be somewhat more exotic; the International Football Association hopes to be able to win new territories (Katar, Australia) for itself after its premiere on the African continent in 2010, or to continue to pursue its establishment in the United States or Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities belonging to the delegation (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch Head of Government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) sets out the level of economic and political commitment of a World Cup.
So the machinations behind the scenes threaten to stop until the last minute.
It is difficult to create a hierarchy of candidates.
According to FIFA’s evaluation report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) files offer better arguments than those of their competitors.
But these considerations will not be so important for the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the time of the election.
The Sunday Times, which was at the beginning of the revelations with the suspension of two members of the Executive Committee (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could as well have ruined the chances for their own country, the cradle of football, which was only allowed to hold the World Cup once, namely in 1966.
The BBC had re-emerged on Monday by broadcasting a documentary report that targeted three influential members of the committee, namely Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Reason enough to embarrass FIFA and embarrass the English leaders who had been lobbying intensively with David Cameron in recent weeks.
The head of government hopes for a reissue of the chess move, which his predecessor Tony Blair had succeeded in achieving for London in 2005 the organization of the 2012 Olympic Games.
Would this intense effort be enough to re-evaluate England’s image before the committee?
Nothing is less certain, because the duo Spain-Portugal does not lack trumps with its already finished stadiums, its expertise (World Cup 82 in Spain, Olympic Games 92 in Barcelona, 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
But the economic and financial downsides of the two countries could dampen their ambitions.
The possible reprisals against the English, as well as doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal, increase the chances of Russia, which, despite its shortcomings in the dossier (stadia, hotels, transport) has become a major outsider.
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, however, has decided to denounce the unwieldy suggestion of the accusations of the English press "an unfair competition in the preparation of the vote" by the committee members.
"They're being sued with dirt, they're trying to compromise," Putin said.
By 2022, the United States, strengthened by the 1994 experience, seems to be the logical favorites.
First economic world power, seat of FIFA’s main sponsors, the country seems to have a long list of advantages over Japan and South Korea, which have set up a very nice project separately.
But these new candidatures seem premature for two countries that had co-organized the competitions in 2002.
Another threat: FIFA’s highly-anticipated approval of the 2026 World Cup for China, which will make the Asian chances of 2022 obsolete.
With Australia and Qatar, which had drawn all records with the anticipation of futuristic stages, FIFA is pursuing its expansion towards new areas, but these two countries pose a greater risk than certainty.
Australia, like Japan and South Korea, may suffer from the weakness of television rights (due to the time shift) acquitted by European countries, the delicate nerve of FIFA.
Second mandate: openness
De Gaulle had really screwed up.
Midrand had made him think he was stuttering.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not show the slightest hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than this.
A mandate in the Elysée calls the next one.
The current head of state will be ergo candidate in 2012.
But the obvious side of the mystery attached to the presidential function is not well seen.
So one must act as if the doubt existed from now on.
On the one hand, as well as in the other sense.
In 2006, the supporters of Jacques Chirac stated that a third mandate was not excluded without even believing in it.
On 15 November, Nicolas Sarkozy, in a serious tone, pledged to make his decision "someday in the fall of 2011".
That on Tuesday evening in the Elysée, before the UMP parliamentarians, he would have sounded the perspective of "two mandates", had thus spread a little feverishness.
Was this the official announcement of his candidacy?
Far missing.
The President merely reminded that the 2008 constitutional amendment limited the number of five-year terms to only two.
He made a statement, not an announcement.
It is not the first time he has mentioned the presidential election on the occasion of such meetings in a humorous tone.
"You have seven and a half years with me at worst, or at best," he told them in July 2009.
On a new one in May 2010: "Don't think I'm not thinking about the phase after that."
His words from yesterday make him no more a candidate than the day before; but also no less.
If they make comments, then for a two-fold reason.
Accelerate the race for the candidacy with the PS on one side.
However, it is not the start of the competition with Ségol<0xC3><0xA8>ne Royal that drives Nicolas Sarkozy to reveal himself.
On the contrary, it is his obvious candidacy in 2012, which many members of the PS urge early than accepted to fight.
The bad polls on the other hand.
For the first time, right-wing voters would prefer Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Fillon’s candidacy to Nicolas Sarkozy’s (46% vs. 44%, according to the BVA-L’Express survey).
“We have a candidate, and there is no discussion with the UMP about it,” the Prime Minister’s environment responded immediately and cautiously.
"If he were to find a defeat as possible, he would not be a candidate," said Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
“He will always believe in being able to win,” Alain Juppé corrects, who has come to terms with openness.
Euro: the ECB is forced to keep its purchases of government documents
The last meeting of the ECB’s Central Bank Council last year should provide an opportunity to show how to get out of the crisis, or at least to announce the arrangement of a large number of unconventional monetary policy measures to be concluded at the end of the year.
The crisis of European public debt obliges the central bank in Frankfurt to make the current, more than tense situation on the European bond markets, in order not to exacerbate them.
The political costs would be far too high.
French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde welcomed the ECB’s active role in solving Europe’s national budget debt at a press conference yesterday.
She has not dared to say whether she believes that the central bank can do even more, for example by fuelling her program of purchases of government bonds.
"I reserve my considerations for my European trading partners (...)".
Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB, had not shown himself very well in Brussels on the occasion of his hearing by the Economic and Monetary Committee of the European Parliament in relation to his projects, but rather pleased to point out that the programme of purchases of government documents on the secondary market would "continue" and that at the meeting on Thursday "we will see how the decisions will be made".
The only certainty: the ECB will remain unchanged at 1%, the historically lowest level since May 2009.
In practice, the ECB’s Treasury’s bond purchases were doubled last week to approximately EUR 1.35 billion.
And according to the indiscretions of some traders, she reportedly made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese state papers yesterday.
Since May 2010, the Eurosystem’s central banks have made purchases of EUR 67 billion.
Among the traders, the anticipation of a follow-up of the purchase price is in no way doubted (see page 29).
Economists are no longer expecting a remarkable change in prices.
If the bond transactions of more than three months have already disappeared from the ECB’s arsenal, the latter will still make itself available to the unrestricted reserves of funds over a period of one week to three months.
The economists are already concerned today that this measure will continue to extend for a few months.
"I can't imagine that the ECB will substantially change its programme".
“Otherwise, it would take the risk of provoking new tensions in the short term,” said Michael Schubert, economist at Commerzbank.
"A progressive exit planned for the course of the first quarter of 2011 seems to me more likely," said Norbert Br<0xC3><0xA4>ms, economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In the area of their interventions in the public debt market, “the ECB should maintain such a volume of bonds that will revive the sluggish market,” adds Norbert Br<0xC3><0xA4>ms.
Given the relevance of the exposed position of European banks in the euro area sovereign debt markets, the central bank has no choice but to maintain its presence in the market.
"She must step on the market at any price to the destitute investors and act in such a way as to prevent the rapid enthusiasm for the returns paid to the weakest states," a major bondholder testified yesterday.
Because if interest rates set for the high-altitude flight, the states would be even more hindered from reducing their debt or even stabilizing it.
This is the price to protect the euro.
Berlusconi's Government Covers Italy
After a worrying start to the week for Italy, the situation was somewhat relaxed yesterday with the drop in corner interest rates to 10 years.
A return to the deceptive silence.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister of Economic Affairs, the regional presidents Giulio Tremonti had qualified the situation as "indecipherable" and had expected him to hear an "unpredictable" weekend, but the person concerned immediately denied it.
On Tuesday, at least, the German interest rate scissors would have reached their record of 210 basis points, and the prices of contracts to cover the bankruptcy risk had risen to 263 points, which had caused a certain headlessness in Rome.
Silvio Berlusconi had pointed out to his Council of Ministers that Spain’s discrepancy with German interest rates was 400 basis points.
However, his right hand, Gianni Letta, had expressed a "difficult concern" about the "market turbulence" and a possible risk of infection from Ireland.
“The good news is that Italy, the third eurozone economy, is not like Greece or Ireland.”
“The bad news is that Italy is like Portugal,” explains Irwin Stelzer, economist at the Hudson Institute.
In plain words, his problem is the absence of economic growth and the associated dizzying tax receipts that put the state at risk of no longer being able to meet its financing needs.
The last Brussels forecasts were a cold shower for the government.
In the future, Italian growth is expected to be 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... although the budget available to the Senate for review is expected to be 1.3% and 2% respectively.
Under these conditions, the EU Commission calculates, the budget deficit will still account for 4.3% of GDP next year (compared to the government forecast 3.9%) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
That is why there is also a stir around a new budgetary collective, which could be used after the holidays to a sum of EUR 7 billion.
“If necessary, new austerity measures need to be taken,” says auditor Olli Rehn.
Italy is currently receiving support from international institutions.
"The foundations of Italy's economy are in order and its accounts are regulated, which we have been repeating for a long time," said Arrigo Sadun, Italian trustee of the International Monetary Fund, who is entrusted with Italy at the IMF.
“At the moment, there are no problems, either in the short-term or in the long-term, as Italy, despite its high debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, A. d. R.), is calling for lower stabilisation progress than other countries,” observes Pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist of the OECD.
The question remains of political instability.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of no confidence from the Chamber of Deputies, as a result of which the preferred elections could already be organised at the end of March.
There is therefore a less favourable period for a decision-making on a serious crisis.
Europeans think about the expansion of anti-crisis measures
Christine Lagarde said in a press conference in Paris yesterday: “I think it was proven on Sunday afternoon and also in the evening: Europeans are clearly united, ready and committed to defending their currency and their currency area.”
Although completely relative - the deduction recorded yesterday at the interest rates of the European government bonds was water on the mills of governments and the ECB.
However, it is not yet possible to talk about a normalization start.
The rating agency Standard & Poor’s had announced that it could reduce Portugal’s debt note, arguably the most effective target of speculators today.
"As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political perceptibility, which is particularly burdensome on banking systems," said the economists of Exane BNP Paribas.
Above all, especially since “the political period is much slower than that of the markets”.
The European countries, which are well aware of both this gap and the danger inherent in it, are intensifying discussions to strengthen the existing anti-crisis measures.
The informal discussions between the most directly affected finance ministers and, in the wider sense, with their counterparts in the G20 are progressing well.
And this also in view of the meetings of Eurogroupe and Ecofin at the beginning of next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
The plan includes the lot of unconventional measures to strengthen the countries of the euro area in the cross-hairs of the markets (see below).
As far as the EU Stability Fund is concerned, its Executive Director Klaus Regling has already started his Asia tour in Singapore on Tuesday to inform investors in the Far East about developments regarding the crisis in Europe.
If the purpose of his visit is not explicit fundraising, he will certainly prepare the terrain for it.
The first draft paper expenditure by the EU Stability Fund is scheduled for next month.
Yesterday, an official U.S. representative from the Reuters agency had entrusted the United States to support a possible increase in funds mobilised through the IMF’s additional, direct involvement.
Portugal and Spain, the countries in the first place, are preparing to undertake structural reforms, particularly in the field of labour market organisation.
Reforms to be added to the austerity measures, however, should show effects in the near future.
Lisbon and Madrid take a different path than Greece and Ireland did.
Both one and the other is to avoid having to ask for international assistance at all costs before setting up their own budget corrections and deciding on inevitable structural reforms that will restore their confidence in the long run.
European investors, in turn, are talking about the options available to speed up the normalization process of the markets of government bonds.
Axel Weber, who was travelling through Paris on 24 November, had first produced the idea that if the €750 billion mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to re-engage in its own pocket.
The economists of Barclays Capital, with regard to the market of European public debt, are of the opinion that an extension of around EUR 100 billion would be sufficient, "preferably" in the form of a direct injection of liquidity.
This means: the European mechanism of doped financial stabilization, which currently amounts to 60 billion euros.
A advisory board that has every chance of being carefully investigated in the European capitals.
Especially when market conditions are increasing.
Snow and ice: 24 departments in Orange Alarm Level
The snow episodes still cause traffic difficulties, especially in the secondary transport networks of Brittany and threaten to affect various economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now in Orange due to the threat of snow and ice.
The regions of Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-S<0xC3><0xA8>vres and Vienne have been added to the 20 departments already in Orange alert stage; 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, then later in the night.
According to Météo France, the intense snow showers touch the north of the Gironde as well as the Charentes, it snows easily on the et Ile-de-France.
In the affected departments snow blankets of 2 to 5 cm, sometimes also expected of 7 to 10 cm, as well as 1 to 3 cm, even up to 5 cm in the Paris region.
Affected are the regions of Charente, Charente-Maritime, C<0xC3><0xB4>tes d'Armor, Finist<0xC3><0xA8>re, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and the regions of Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin.
The snowfalls are significant enough to cause traffic obstructions and affect certain economic activities, Météo France predicts.
In the C<0xC3><0xB4>tes d'Armor region, several regional roads are closed to heavy traffic of over 7.5 tonnes, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac traffic axes.
The traffic situation of the secondary transport networks in Brittany is very difficult, according to the traffic police, who advise against using their own vehicle only in an emergency, and the use of some TER coaches has been eliminated throughout the day.
In the Picardy, school traffic was lifted for Thursday.
No specific restrictive measures were planned for heavy transport on Wednesday evening.
The prefecture "demands drivers to take the utmost care on the roads and to adapt their driving behaviour accordingly."
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) called on airlines to cancel 25% of their flights from Roissy Paris Airport and 10% of Orly’s flights due to expected heavy snowfalls on Thursday.
The DGAB recommends that passengers contact their airline.
Gatwick airports in the south of London and Edinburgh, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Métro Grand Paris: first financial sketches
Since the debate on the modernisation of the transport industry on Ile-de-France has been in full swing, it has been raining billions.
At least in the discussions.
In particular, the 23 billion will be recalled for the Metro Grand Paris, which is to be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
In order to initiate the construction of the SGP, the state has declared a capital allocation of 4 billion euros.
In the theoretical scheme, this is the sum that would then allow the SGP to allocate a portion of the financial sum to its twofold in the markets.
Today, it finally came to the first high-calculations.
The 2010 supplementary budget, reviewed this morning by the National Assembly Finance Commission, contains the measures envisaged to raise the first part of these funds.
These are two measures: the creation of a special tax on development and higher taxation of offices at Ile-de France.
The first, according to Article 15 of the draft law, goes "for the sake of the public-law institution Société du Grand Paris".
This is stated: "The product of this tax amounts to 117 million euros per year".
The second is a reorganization of the existing corporate taxation: "to modernize it in order to increase the product resulting from it and to transfer this increase to the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would that bring?
A mystery.
This sum is not stated in the text.
Of the 4 billion, we are far away.
"It is stated that the tax resources will be added to the 4 billion euros of capital allocation raised by the state and the Société du Grand Paris will be gradually made available for the project," the statement reads.
The SGP does not find this system offensive at all.
“Since the moment you book revenue (the two taxes, i.e. R.), you can cover the project planning for three years and then only draw from the 4 billion,” it is explained.
"This is noted in the budget and gradually subtracted".
The SGP estimates that 2013 will begin listing the 4 billion for the 2014 budget.
This measure, the four billion promised to be sought for a long time, runs the risk of creating a rather moving, parliamentary discussion.
The first public meeting will take place on 7 December.
vengeful hackers and emsig spies
The WikiLeaks affair has two meanings.
On one hand, it has turned out to be an obvious scandal, a scandal that is merely a scandal in Sinner's hypocrisy that governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes at the international level, giving a foretaste of the future dominated by regression.
But let's go ahead in a row.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that every file created by an intelligence agency (an x-any nation) is composed exclusively of newspaper excerpts.
The "extraordinary" American revelations about Berlusconi's sexual habits cast off nothing more than what one got to read over months anyway in any x-any journal (except for those whose owner Berlusconi is), and the terrifyingly caricatured profile of Gaddafi's has been providing cabaret artists with fabric for their sketches for a long time.
The rule, according to which the secret files may consist only of already known news, is essential for the dynamics of the intelligence services, and not only this century.
When you go to a library dedicated to esoteric publications, you will realize that every work (about the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau, the Templars, or the Rosicrucians) repeats exactly what has already been written in previous works.
This is not only because the author of occult texts does not want to publish research (yet because he does not know where news about the non-existent would be found), but because those who devote themselves to occultism believe in nothing other than what they already know and confirm what they have already learned.
This is also Dan Brown’s success mechanism.
The secret acts as well.
The informant is lazy, and lazy (or limited mind) is also the head of the intelligence service (otherwise he could be anything, for example editor at Libération), who only considers what he recognizes to be true.
The top-secret information about Berlusconi that the American embassy in Rome had sent to the State Department was the same as those that Newsweek had published the week before.
Why, then, was such a lifting of the disclosures of these dossiers made?
On one side, these say what every educated person already knows, namely that the embassies - at least since the end of World War II and since then also the heads of government can call each other or take an airplane to meet for dinner - have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of some small representational tasks, have turned into espionage centers.
Any spectator of investigative films knows this very well, and it does not happen out of hypocrisy that you do so to ignore it.
Still, the fact of repeating it publicly violates the task of hypocrisy and serves to put American diplomacy in a bad light.
Second, the idea that an x-any hacker can tap into the most secret secrets of the most powerful country in the world holds the significant blow against the prestige of the state’s dezernate.
In addition, the scandal puts the victims in less trouble than the "sharp judges".
But let us devote ourselves to the profound nature of what has happened.
Once, in Orwell’s time, one could bundle all power like a Big Brother, who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
Orwell’s prophecy could have turned out to be perfectly correct since then, where you can control every movement thanks to the phone, every transaction made, the hotel visited, the chosen highway and so on; the citizen would become the total victim of the eye of power.
But if one realizes what is happening today, that even the secret crypts of power can no longer escape the control of a hacker, then the control process ceases to be one-sided and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - elected as the citizen's avenger - can discover the secrets of power.
But how can a power which is no longer able to keep its own secrets?
It is true, Georg Simmel already said that a real secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that any knowledge of the character of Berlusconis or Merkel is basically a secret free of secrecy as it exposes the public sphere; but in the style of WikiLeaks, it means to reveal that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets.
WikiLeaks has not wronged either Sarkozy or Merkel, but Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this abuse inflicted on such a powerful power?
It is obvious that in the future, the states will no longer put any reserved information online - this would be equivalent to a hanging on the street corner.
But it is equally obvious that it is in vain with the current technologies to hope to keep confidential reports over the phone secret.
Nothing is easier than finding out if and when a head of state moved on an airplane and contacted one of his colleagues.
How could private and only for certain ears relationships be maintained in the future?
I know very well that my prediction at the moment sounds like science fiction and romantic, but I see myself compelled to introduce the government agents, moving in a secret way emphatically on uncontrollable marching routes, carrying their messages nowhere but in mere memory with them, and, moreover, concealing the few written information they have received in the Schuhabset.
The information would be stored in a single copy in locked drawers: basically, Watergate’s spying effort had less success than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that the technology is moving forward today like a cancer, namely backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communication, the Internet reconstructs a telegraph with (telephone) wire.
The (analog) video cassettes had allowed the film researchers to explore a film band for band by flushing from the back to the front and venting all the secrets of assembly, while the (numeric) CDs nowadays allow nothing more than jumping from chapter to chapter, i.e. in macroportions.
The high-speed trains take you from Rome to Milan within three hours, while this requires three and a half hours by plane, including the changeover.
It is therefore not unusual for politics and communication technology to return to the car and horse.
One last observation.
In earlier times, the press tried to understand what secrets were forged between the messages.
At present, it is the messages that demand confidential information from the press.
Climate: how France is appreciating its financial promises
One year after the Copenhagen Treaty, it is time to examine compliance with the rapidly-resolved financing promises (also known as “Fast Start” or early financing) implemented by the developing countries.
And already the rough French fairs have been uncovered.
With the Copenhagen Treaty, developing countries have committed to providing $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The EU has promised 7.2 billion euros over three years, France 1.26 billion euros (i.e. 420 million per year).
On the occasion of the opening of COP16, the EU has drawn all the registers to convince its partners of their commitment to fast-start financing: detailed progress report of their Member States, press conference, major side events, brochure distribution.
Operation transparency is remarkable and highly valued for its true value: developing countries and civil society like to see it when all developed countries did the same at the same level of precision.
The EU announced that it had released €2.2 billion in 2010, putting it on the right track to respect its 7.2 billion commitment in 2012.
But when you look at the details, things are a little more complicated.
According to the Copenhagen Treaty, this money should be "new and additional" to ensure that an additional effort has been made without compromising public development aid.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what “new and additional” means.
While the EU Commission had proposed harmonisation, certain member states, including France, blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the benchmark he considers best.
For example, the European Commission has set itself the benchmark for those in 2009: international funding will be maintained and 150 million will be added over three years as part of the "Fast-Start" funding.
Other countries have chosen similar guidelines, either with regard to the year or with regard to conditions at the level of public development aid.
In return, France felt that the financing of "all new projects" in 2010 was "new and additional".
In other words, there are no benchmarks in the expenditure of the previous year or at the global level of public development aid.
In concrete terms, the total amount of French support for developing countries can remain stable (or decrease) - France is proposing to comply with its commitment to "new and additional" financing.
Another crucial element is the breakdown in donations and loans.
There is no rule yet, and everyone chooses their calculation mode.
Some, such as France, find 1 borrowed € as equivalent with 1 donated €.
Obviously, this is difficult to explain: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans for certain profitable investments (often linked to emission reduction projects based on the most effective technology) can be justified, it is deceptive to present the euro, which is taken as the equivalent for a donated euro... In addition, only the cost of the loan for the capitalisation country should be counted as the commitment (i.e. the equivalent of an interest rate).
But France has nothing but the following consideration: it "respects" its commitment of 420 million euros by borrowing 91.5% (389.8 million euros) and donating 8.5% (36.1 million euros) - see also the EU document to convince itself of this.
France is the only country in the EU that uses loans to a large extent.
Germany demands 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (among other things) are making 100% of their commitments with donations.
In other words, if the vast majority of the European Union spends €1 to fulfil its obligations, France only spends 10 cents and understands a similar commitment.
Beautiful Hokuspocus!
All in all, France is operating in its fast-start financing with a double swindle: partly with a further development of the action over time and partly with the reality of financial commitment.
France succeeds in making it believe that it has spent 420 million "new and additional" million in line with its promises, saving 36.1 million euros.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (since it seems that it was Bercy who carried out the arbitrage) could have a double negative effect; once inside the EU (why do the other member states continue to donate, if it is enough to borrow?) and then in the negotiations, since the developing countries do not let themselves be completely fooled...
The chapter of early funding is only a small question in a relatively short period of time compared to the totality of discussions about the climate.
But it could be the drop too much in the immense machinery of the UNFCCC.
Let us hope that this will not be the case.
Whatever it is, it is essential to learn his lesson from this first year of early funding.
In the first place, France could announce a change in its type of booking for 2011 and 2012, in the spirit of respect for its obligations and equal justice with the other countries of the European Union.
Above all, France could bring forward the discussions on the issue of long-term financing (another, crucial and currently discussed topic): one does not escape the question of "predictability" or the type of borrowing of its loans.
France could change its position to be as progressive as it is with other issues.
So the hope is based on the new environment minister Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprising announcement about France's fast-start and its vision of "responsibility" as well as the use of loans would naturally raise the international basis of trust necessary for further discussions.
Alarm - Pesticides taken by children
A 10-year-old child takes 81 different chemical substances over the day, according to a study published this Wednesday by the Association of Générations Futures (former movement to protect the rights and respect of coming generations).
The association, which states that its results "do not reflect a statistically significant value given the small number of samples analysed, but represent the illustration character of the problem being treated," had purchased food from a 10-year-old child at meals and a snack at supermarkets in Oise and Paris between July and September.
These typical meals – including the official recommendations of five fresh fruit and fruit parts, three dairy products and 1.5 liters of water a day – were examined, as well as purging laboratories in search of chemical substances, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The plate balance is debilitating: 81 chemical substances, including 42 classified as possibly or probably carcinogenic, and five classified as safe carcinogens, as well as 37 substances with endocrine disruptors, according to studies by several institutions such as the International Cancer Research Center.
"Even if the legal limits for each chemical, individually consumed substance are not exceeded in the approximate totality of the cases, it is very well taken from this survey that the reality in which the consumer is exposed to potentially carcinogenic substances or substances with endocrine disrupting factor is alarming," the association notes.
Already at breakfast, the butter and tea with milk alone already contain more than ten of the potentially carcinogenic residues and three proven to be carcinogenic, as well as more than twenty residues that can affect the hormonal system.
The apple imported from Brazil, intended as a snack for the study, has traces of six chemical substances, including a fungicide banned in France.
The same applies to the green beans from Kenya, included in lunch, where the study found traces of an insecticide strictly prohibited in the EU.
In addition, the chop steak, the tuna from the can, even the baguette and gum of pesticides and other chemical substances were spiced.
In tap water, the analyses revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
At dinner, the salmon steak with 34 determined chemical residues was "richest", and even the plastic plate used to warm up the meal in the microwave was not unloaded.
The final risk of this “pollutant cocktail” to the consumer is “probably undervalued,” the study said.
The Alliance Europe Ecology-Les Verts (EE-LV) has proposed, for its part, "in view of the urgency of the situation", to introduce a moratorium on the use of pesticides to stop the "increase in civilizational diseases".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) identified the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruits and vegetables consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
