It's like they're looking like idiots.
There are several MPs who have been accused of having changed their title to a member of the Welsh Parliament.
It was decided to change the name of the Assembly in the Welsh Parliament.
The members of the public, who are on the political spectrum, are in a position to express their views.
A member of the Labour Party was concerned that it would be on Twp and PwP.
For readers outside of Wales: On Welsh means twp dom and pwp kaka.
A deputy of the plaid party said the group as a whole was "not happy" and suggested alternative.
A Welsh Conservative said his group was open about changing the name, but stated that MWP and Muppet would not be far from one.
In this context, the Welsh letter "w" is pronounced the same as the letter "u" in Yorkshire English.
The Commission of the Assembly, which is currently drafting laws to introduce the amendment of the name, said: "The final decision on the appointment of the deputies is, of course, to the deputies themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change the name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public meeting on the proposal, which received much support.
The Commission favoured "Members of the Welsh Parliament" or "WMPs", but the MWP option received more support in a public meeting around the question about the title of MPs.
The MPs seem to be proposing other options, but the fight to reach a consensus may cause headaches for the presiding officer, Elin Jones, who is expected to sign the bill on the amendments within two weeks.
The legislation on the reforms includes other amendments, for example, as well as the assembly works, also rules on the disqualification of the deputies and the design of the committee system.
Members of the public will be given the last word on the question of how they should be called when they discuss the legislation.
Macedonians are often in favour of the referendum on the changes to the name of the country.
The voters will choose a Sunday whether the country's name will be changed to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote was put up in a proposal to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province, called Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that the name of its northern neighbour represents a reference to its territory and has repeatedly voted against its accession to the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the vote on the change of name, said he did not want to recognize the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claimed that the change of name is the price to be paid to allow the EU to intervene in NATO.
St. Martin's Church's claws are as quiet as the churches during the Harlem fight
"In the past, the elders said that there was a café and a church on every corner," said Lord Adams.
"There's nothing left today."
He said that the coffee shop's disappearance was understandable.
"People are socializing differently," he said.
"They don't want to go to places where people are going to go on a regular basis."
As for the churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of asset values will not last as long as it imagines the responsiblity, "and sooner or later they will return to where they started."
He added that he could be replaced by landlords with property and be filled with people who do not help the remaining protective areas in the neighborhood.
"The overwhelming majority of people who buy property in these buildings are white," he said, "and want to close these churches quickly because it is unlikely that most of these people will become members of these churches.
Both churches were built by white communities before Harlem became a black capital – Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist community was moved in the 1930s.
A black community of not far away has overtaken the building.
St. Martin's has been overtaken by a black community under Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of traders on 125th Street, a main avenue for trading in Harlem that no blacks wanted to hire.
By a fire in 1939, the building was severely damaged, but when the members of Father Johnson's community made plans for the reconstruction, they ordered the paintwork.
Rev. David Johnson, the father of Johnson's bow and successor to St. Martin's, called the game "the claws of the poor."
The expert who played the game in July called it differently: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument"
The expert Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the world's first clapping game played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who spent 18 years on the larger clapping game at Riverside Church.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin's did not replace him.
What happened in St. Martin in the last few months was a complicated history of architects and entrepreneurs, some were introduced by lay officials, others by the Bishops' Diocese.
The sacristy – the Por's governing body, with lay-responsibles – entered the diocese in July, with the concern that the dioceses "would try to pass on the costs to the sacristy", although the sacristy did not involve the appointing of the architects and entrepreneurs, who were involved in the establishment of the diocesan churches.
Some pastors have complained about a lack of transparency of pages of the diocese.
Shark injured 13-year-old during lobster diving in California.
A shark attacked and blessed a 13-year-old son on Saturday when he was diving after lobster in California, which was on the day of the opening of the lobster season, according to officials.
The attack occurred shortly before 7 o'clock in the morning, not far from Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been on a Saturday the moose since half an hour with friends on the dock, when he heard the boy call for help and you were paddling with a group of people to pull him out of the water.
Hammel said he had thought at first that it was simply the joy of catching a lobster, but then "realized that he was being bashed!"
I'm going to be pissed!"
"He's got the whole thing under control," he said as he approached his son.
"I told everyone to come out of the water, 'There's a shark in the water,'" he added.
The boy was transferred to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was delivered in critical condition.
The species of shark that has been attacked is unknown.
Spongemaster Capt. Larry Giles said at a press conference that a shark was seen a few weeks earlier, but this one was considered non-hazardous.
Giles also said that the victim was suffering from traumatic injuries to the worker.
Officials closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach to Casabland to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for mediation and security purposes.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are considered non-hazardous.
Sainsbury's climbs into the beauty market of Britain.
Sainsbury’s picks up boots, superdrugs and Debenhams, with beauty departments in the coffeehouse style with specialized assistants.
As part of a substantial stipulation in the British beauty market of <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion, which continues to grow, while the mother and the household return, these larger beauty departments will be in 11 stores across the country, and next year and further stores if they succeed.
The supermarkets invest in beauty because they want to fill the shelves that were otherwise reserved for the tents, microwaves and other household goods.
Sainsbury's said they would be the size of his beauty offering up to 3,000 products including for the first time with brand Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The assortments of L <0xCC><0x81>Oreal, Maybelline and Burt <0xCC><0x81>s Bees, which already exist, will also be given more space with exclusive brand areas, similar to those in the boat shops.
Supermarché also relaunchs its boutique make-up collection, so that the majority of the products are vegan-friendly, which is increasingly demanded by young consumers.
The Fragrance Shop will test concessions in two Sainsbury's stores, where the first opened last week in Croydon, in southern London, and the second opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Buying online in a small amount of everyday food and small shops means that super markets need to make more effort so that people come to buy from them.
Mike Coupe, the manager of Sainsbury's, said that the outlets were becoming more and more like department stores because the supermarket chain is trying to fight more services and non-food products against the discounter Aldi and Lidl.
Ainsbury's opened Argos-Oulettes in hundreds of aftershocks and also bought some Habitats stores since the Supermarch both chain two years ago. This increased the sales of the food and made the acquisitions more profitable.
Supermarché's previous attempt to overhaul the cosmetics and pharmacy department has been felt.
In the early 2000s, Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with boats, but the co-operation was soon over after a dispute over the share of revenues from the drugstores and the supermarines.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its 281 drugs to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy Chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million, three years ago.
Llodys should play a role in the plan, by selling an enlarged range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, and four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial Dirketer of Sainsbury's, said: "We have changed the look and feel of our beauty areas to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained employees who can ask the customer for advice.
Our range of brands has been adapted to every need. Through a friendly environment and advantageous locations, we are now an attractive beauty destination, which puts the old ways of shopping in the spotlight."
Peter Jones "swivels" over a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal, by Holly Willoughby.
Peter Jones, the star from Dragons Den, has become "swivel" after television presenter Holly Willoughby signed a contract of over <0xC2><0xA3>11 million with her lifestyle brand business to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for her homewear and accessories brand Truly.
The group's business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Mark Goop.
This morning's moderator, 37 years old, announced on her Instagram account that she was going.
Holly Willoughby pushed Peter Jones, the star from Dragons Den, out of her lucrative Lifetsyle brand business in the last minute, to focus on her new contract Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say that Jones was "swivel" as the TV star during a scheduled meeting a Tuesday in the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, admitted that their new contracts – worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million – mean they no longer have time for their homewear and accessories.
The company was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Mark Goop and doubled Willpughby's estimated wealth of <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she would be leaving Truly, Jones fled the UK and went to one of his vacation homes.
A source said: "Truly was by far Holly's main priority.
It would have been her long-term future that she would accompany over the next century.
Her decision to leave was surprising to all the people involved.
No one could believe what happened at the beginning.
In Marlow's headquarters, there is a warehouse with goods ready for sale.
Experts believe that the abandonment of this morining moderator, who is one of the bankable stars from Great Britain, could cost the company millions, as they invested a lot in products, from cushions and candles to clothes and homewear, and there are now potentially delays for the launch.
And it could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, mother of three, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby brought Truly to the Bee with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, was sworn in as president in March.
The couple's journey together into the holiday season and Jones is 40 percent involved in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby is a brand ambassador for M&S and replaces Ant McPartlin as moderator of I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
A source with information about Jones said last night, "We will not comment on his business affairs."
We're going to talk and then we're going to fall in love.
He joked about the criticism he would get from the media because of a comment that some people would consider "non-presidential" and because he is so positive about the North Korean president.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in his "television" voice.
"I didn't give up anything."
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting after the first meeting in Singapore in June was welcomed by Trump as a major step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
However, negotiations on denuclearization do not take place.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told leading politicians during the UN General Assembly that the North did not see a "corresponding response" from the U.S. to North Korea's former disarmament efforts.
The U.S. will continue with sanctions to continue to pressure.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech.
"I'm good with North Korea," he said.
"We went to war with North Korea.
Millions of people were killed.
Now we have this great relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim had led to positive results – no more rocket tests, helping to free hostages, and the rapatrilation of American soldiers who fell in the fight from deadly overt rocket tests, rescued free hostages, and helped rescue civilians from free hostages.
And he defended his unusual manner in how he spoke about the relationships with Kim.
It's so easy to be president, but instead of 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded arena, we would only have 200 people here," Trump said, pointing out to the people right in front of him.
A tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastated an island, hundreds of people died.
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign NGOs were told they would not be needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population has been delocalized, no national disaster has been declared, a prerequisite for the catalyzing of international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, they have made it very difficult for them not to seek international help, so it is a challenge," Ms. Sumbung said.
While Save the Children assembles a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet safe to work on foreign personnel on the spot.
Mr Sutopo, the spokesman for the National Disaster Protection Administration, said Indonesian officials would assess the situation in Palau to see if international agencies can participate in the emergency response.
With regard to the constant earthquakes in Indonesia, unfortunately, the country is not sufficiently prepared for the will of nature.
Although tsunami shelters were built in Aceh, there are no such shelters anywhere on the coast.
The apparent lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, although there was a warning, probably cost a lot of lives.
The journey between the various Indonesian islands is often a challenge.
Natural disasters make the logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims sets off on its way to Palu, but needs at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has made improving the foothills of Indonesian infrastructure the main theme of his election campaign and donated money to the streets and railways.
Mr. Joko's reign was also plagued by a lack of funding, where he will be set up again next year.
Mr. Joko is also exposed to the pressure of partisan tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority represent a more conservative form of belief.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were driven out of their homes, as Christian and Muslim groups fought on the streets with knives, bows and arrows and other brutal weapons.
Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge compares the party to a match against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool with a goal in the 89th minute a Samsden at Stamford Bridge in London against a defeat against Chelsea in the Premier League.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri, when he was about 30 meters ahead of Chelsea's goal and left his team 1-0 behind.
He took the ball with his left foot and shot in the direction of Gol.
The test is high above the box, and towards the right corner of the net.
The ball has turned over a jumping arrizabalaga and then into the net.
"It was just going to get into this position to get the ball and play like the Shaq always played as much as possible before, so I tried to create as much time as possible," Sturridge said on LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw the edge come and touched it once, and didn't think about it and just shot."
Chelsea were 1-0 after the break ahead by a goal in the 25th minute of Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The Blues-Stermer made a pass back to the Mateo Kovacic in this game before moving in half-way to Liverpool.
Kovavic made a quick double pass in the middle field.
He then shot through a beautiful ball that sent the Hazard to the box.
The Hazard runs along the defense and ends at the long podium with a Lénksfouss shot around Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool play against Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play against Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia is 832.
The death toll in Indonesia by earthquakes and tsunami rose to 832, as the country's disaster agency said on Sunday.
According to the agency's spokesman, Mr. Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, many people were trapped in the rubble of buildings, which had been destroyed by the earthquakes of a strength of 7.5 and caused waves of up to 20 feet high.
The city of Palu, with over 380,000 inhabitants, was surrounded by stones from the collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a man, 32, on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death.
A murder investigation was launched after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old woman was found dead at 7:55 with stab wounds at Mews on John Street. A 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
People from the area who have seen or heard something should get in touch with the police.
Police Inspector Brian O'Hagen said: 'The investigation is still in its initial stages, but anyone who has seen or heard anything suspicious in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead should contact us.
I also get to contact all other people, especially taxi drivers, who have recorded something on Dashcam footage, because they may have information that may be important to our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that a woman whose body was found had been wounded in Birkenhead and was found in a house.
These afternoons are friends who think they know the woman coming to the scene to ask questions about where she was found.
According to the police, the reports continue and they inform other members of the victim's family.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews now just wanted to go back and his apartment, but police explained to him that at the moment no one would be able to rob or leave the building.
He was speechless when he discovered what had happened.
People are now told that it may take some time for them to return home.
A police officer told a man that the whole area is currently being considered as a crime scene.
A woman came to the scene in tears.
They always say, "It's terrible."
At 2:00 p.m., two police camionnets were inside the lockout and another was outside the lockout.
Some police officers were standing inside the lockdown and were monitoring the residential area.
Anyone who has any information should contact @MerPolCC, the 101 call or anonymous crimestoppers at 0800 555 111 Protocol 247 of September 30.
The Cromwell statue of Parliament will be the new memorial to the series "Rewriting History."
His exile would be a poetic justice for the destruction of so many cultural and religious artifacts in England by the fanatics and Puritan adherents of the Taliban.
But the Cromwell Society describes Mr. Crick's suggestion as "a sin" and "an attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldmsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "At the discussion on the eve of statues, it was inevitable that the statue at Oliver Cromwell was aimed at the palace of Westminster.
The symbol of the English Civil Wars was ordered down by Cromwell and not executed.
Perhaps the false Cromwell would have been sacrificed for the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the last century.
Sir William Hama Thorneycroft's magnificent representation of Cromwell is proof of the opinion of the 19th century and is part of the history of a figure, many of whom still believe it is worth celebrating.
Mr. Goldsmith said in the Sunday Telegraph: "The Cromwell is seen by many, perhaps first in the late 19th century as today, as a defender of Parliament against external pressure, and in his case, of course, the monarchy.
Whether it's an accurate representation is still an issue.
What is certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century shaped the development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individually recognizable figure representing a side of this division.
His works as Lord Protector are worthy of being celebrated and remembered.
The swine flu kills the farmer.
According to local media, a farmer from a pig in a market in southwestern China was attacked and killed.
The man, identified only with his family name "Yuan", was found dead with a severe artery near a stall on the market in Liupanshui in Guizhou Province, South China Morning Post reported a probe.
On May 30, 2005, a swine squire in Xining, Qinghai Province, China, is preparing for an injection of vaccines for swine in a hoofry.
According to reports, he was on a Wednesday with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next day, his cousin found him dead, and discovered an open door to a nearby hospital.
He said that in the stable there was a large male pig with blood on the cut.
A forensic investigation confirmed that 550 pounds of heavy pigs killed the farmer, according to reports.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and bandaged," said the cousin with family name "Wu" as quoted by the Guiyang Evening News.
The images of surveillance cameras show the Yuan Thunder Moon going to the market at 4:40 am to feed the pigs.
His body was removed an hour later.
The animal that killed the man is not a pig from Yuan or his cousin.
A manager of the market explained to the Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking other people while the police gathered evidence at the scene.
According to reports, Yuan's family and the authorities of the market are likely to negotiate decisions for his death.
Even if it was a human being, it was a human being who was attacked by a human being.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their port in Massachusetts. The man was severely injured.
In 2006, a 650 pound heavy pig pushed a Welsh farmer against his tractor until his wife was able to keep the animal away.
After a farmer was eaten by his pig in Oregon in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told the CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as "triggers."
They're just playable.
They're just trying to make you feel good, they don't want to make you feel bad.
"You just have to be respectful," he said.
Rainfall in the Southwest of the United States by Hurricane Rosa
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa weakens while moving across the killing waters of the north coast of Mexico.
However, the rose will bring floods to the north of Mexico and the southwest of the United States in the next few days.
The rose has been at 85 mph, a Category 1 hurricane since 5:00 easterly time a Sunday, and was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugeni, in Mexico.
It is expected that the rose will draw a sun to the north.
Meanwhile, a canal is beginning to form over the Pacific Ocean, and towards the west coast of the United States, and the 'Rosa' is increasingly approaching the peninsula of Baja California as a tropical storm, it will begin to push deep tropical humidity from the north and southwest of the U.S.
The rose will bring up to 10 inches of rain in parts of Mexico.
Then, tropical moisture, which interacts with the nearest channel, will form widely distributed heavy locks in the southwest over the next few days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain causes dangerous flooding, mudflats, and possible landslides in the desert.
Thief tropical humidity causes slugs from 2 to 3 inches per hour at various locations, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
As many as 2 to 4 tons of rain are expected in parts in the southwest, especially much of Arizona.
Floods are possible, with reconditions that are becoming more and more bad due to the destructive nature of tropical rain.
It would be extremely light-headed to walk in the desert with the risk of tropical slugs.
This can cause canyons that quickly become in rivers and thunderstorms will bring local rough air and dust with them.
The more upcoming channel will bring your local route and the parts of the southern California coast.
Slices of over half an inch are possible, which can lead to small mudflats and smooth roads.
This was the first race in the season.
Some distributed tropical voyages begin to come closer to Arizona, in late suns and early afternoons, before the voyage continues to spread, in late afternoons and afternoons.
The four corners of the building are divided into four corners and one side of the building.
In October, there may be some intense temperature fluctuations throughout the U.S. as the Arctic becomes colder, but the troughs remain quite warm.
Heinando leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
A good example of dramatic temperature fluctuations is a probe in the center of the United States.
There is almost a temperature difference of 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, the summer heat will try to build up and expand.
In many central and eastern United States, a warm start is expected to be seen in October with widely spread 80 degrees from the southern plains to parts of the northwest.
New York City was able to reach an average of 80 degrees, which is about 10 degrees higher than the average.
Our long-term climate forecast gives high chances for over-average temperatures for the east of the United States through the first half of October.
Over 20 million people have watched Brett Kavanaugh's trial.
Over 20 million people have watched a thunderous statement on the Supreme Court by Brett Kavanaugh and the woman, Christine Blasey Ford, who he accused of sexual rape, which was supposed to have happened in the 1980s, on six television stations.
In the meantime, the political saga continues, and the broadcasters have interrupted the regular broadcasts for the last-minute twist of a friar: an agreement that Arizona Senator Jeff Flake had agreed with the FBI to make inquiries during a week of the foreclosure.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she is 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh was completely upset and tried to outdo her at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in a pathetic statement, said he's 100% sure that didn't happen.
According to Nielsen, more than 20.4 million people have watched the trial.
The company has calculated an average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Numbers of other networks that passed the process, including PBS, C-Span and Fox Business Network, were not directly available.
In Nielsen, there are often some difficulties in accounting for people who look into offices.
To illustrate the whole thing: The attendance is derived from a playoff football match or the Oscar review.
Fox News Channel, whose moderators supported Kavanaugh's appointment, led all the networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the trial over the day, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS has 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million viewers, Nielsen said.
The interest remains high in the process.
Flake was the central figure in the drama of free speech.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that it would choose the Kavanaugh, he was offered a peace the moie of demonstrators while attempting a lift for a trial at the Judiciary Committee.
He stood for a few minutes with looking down eyes while he was being invited and was live on CNN.
"I'm right here in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you think he is telling the truth to the country?
He said, "You have power, while so many women have no power."
Flake announced that his office had given up a position and, before the elevator went up, that he would have to say more after the hearing of the committee.
The cable and radio networks all reported later live stone longs, as the Judiciary Committee should vote to bring Kavanaugh's nomination to the Senate for the vote.
But the Flake said that he will only do so with the understanding that the FBI is investigating the Uklons against the nominees for the next week, which the Democrats wanted minority.
De Flake was partially convinced by the conversations with his friend, Democratic Sen. Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and a few Senators later, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice had power, because it was obvious that the Republicans would not have the choice to vote the Kavanaugh without the mediation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "playing the politics" of Brexit.
Prime Minister Theresa May accuses critics of abandoning their plans to “play politics” with the British future and national integrity, in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May will attend the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, alongside her on the headline of the newspaper, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson stressed his attack on her so-called Chequers push for Brexit, saying that a suggestion that Britain and the EU should raise their taxes on the other side would be "quite ridiculous."
Wayde-Sims shooting: Police arrested suspect Dyteon Simpson for the death of LSU player.
Police arrested a suspect in connection with the murder of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested for second-degree murder and taken to prison, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials released a video of the confrontation between the Sims and the Simpsons, and police said the Sims lost his badge in the fight.
Police found the pill on the spot and said they found Simpson's DNA there, CBS partner WAFB reported.
After Simpson was heard, police said he had admitted to having shot Wayde.
His bail was fixed at $350,000, the lawyer reported.
East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's office has released a provisional report, where it means that the cause of death is a shock wound to the head and neck.
The department serves the refugee officers of the Louisian State Police, the State Poice Crime Lab, the Southern University Police, and the residents of the area for assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU sports director Joe Alleva thanked the local police for their "flesh and search for justice."
The Sims were 20 years old.
The 2.01 metre tall was raised in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He has a score of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game in the last season.
The LSU basketball coach said his team was "destroyed" and "shocked" after Wayde's death.
"That's what's always been a concern," Wade said.
Volcano spawns ash in Mexico City
The popocatepetl volcano has reached southern neighboring areas of the Mexican capital.
The National Center for Disaster Protection has warned Mexicans of a Saturday, staying away from the volcano after it became active in the crater, and has registered 183 gas and ash emissions in the last 24 hours.
The center has a few thunderstorms and waves.
Images on social networks show thin layers of ash on cars in neighborhoods of Mexico City like Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noted an increase in volcanic activity that has shaken 45 miles (72 kilometers) south of the capital since a 7.1-strong earthquake struck Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" is active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists before the independence elections.
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with police, and as thousands joined the rival demonstrations for the first anniversary of the Catalan polarizing election for the separation.
A group of masked pro-separatists were detained in rioting against the police with their own and powder paint, which formed dark clouds in the streets that are usually filled with tourists.
They also broke out later in the day and police took out their ankles to control the fighting.
Over a few hours, pro-independence group called "Don't forget, don't forgive" against unionists who called "long-lived Spain."
Fourteen people have been hospitalized for injuries to the protesters, according to the local press.
Tensions remain high in the independence region one year after the October 1 referendum considered illegal from Madrid, but celebrated by Catalan separatists.
Voters have chosen majorities to become independent, yet the result was low against the separation by the boycotts of the election.
Catalan authorities, according to their nearly 1,000 people, were blessed last year after the police tried to stop the election in the electoral offices through the region of violent conflicts.
Pro-independence groups camped outside on Friday night to prevent a demonstration on the support of the national police.
The demonstration continued, but had to take a different path.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who took part in the separatist protest with his wife, says he has no hope as to the prospects of an independent Catalonia.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying out for joy, because they could go on, but now I'm stuck," he said.
Despite a decisive, albeit narrow victory in the December regional elections last year, the Catalan independence parties had difficulty staying in swing this year. Most of the best-known leaders were in exile or in prising and have been waiting for their role in the organization of the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protester on the phone as support for the police, said the conflict was being heated by politicians from the two sides.
"It's getting more and more exciting," he said.
Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in the Préventioungsprisong since the end of last year, announced at Samsiden that he will participate in the European elections next year.
“To stand as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to condemn the regression and democratic values and repression that we have seen from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Men Arrested After Car Runs to Home
Three men, 33, 34 and 39 years old, were arrested after a car always runs back into a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent and thunderstorms at 19:30 BST.
Insp Bob Blemmings said there was damage to the couple and the building itself.
It's also possible that the car was hit with a slingshot.
Livingston wins 1-0 against Rangers through Menga's Gol.
Dolly Menga's first goal secured the win.
Promoted Livingston picks out the Rangers for Steven Gerrard's only second victory in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox Club.
Dolly Menga's storm proved the difference when Gary Holt switched sides with Hibernian in the second half.
Gerrard's side remain undefeated in the Premiership this season and play against the Leaders Hearts on Sunday, which are eight points ahead of them.
Previously, the Rangers Rapid Vienna received a thunderstorm in the Europa League.
Livingston, meanwhile, are extending their course in the division to six players, with coach Holt still holding the victory since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston's appeal is against open-ended visitors.
His team would have had to wait a long time before hitting the nose, because their directness caused the ranger problems.
Scott Robinson has penetrated but has carried his effort to the front of the gol, then Alan Lithgow was only able to score his effort before hitting Craig Halkett ahead of the gol.
The hosts were pleased to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could cause misery to the visitors.
And that's how the gold fell.
The Rangers were given a freestyle and Livingston stood up, combining Declan Gallagher and Robinson to play the menga, which once touched and hit the center of the box.
At that time, the Rangers dominated the possession but found the home defense impenetrable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was mostly quiet.
The pattern continued in the second half, but Alfredo Morelos forced a parade of Kelly.
Scott Pittman was denied by the feet of Rangers Golkipp Allen McGregor and Lithgow shot wide from yet another game draw by Livingston.
Crusaders always came back to Livingston's box and were always cleared, while two yards were demanded - after Halkett challenged the replacement Glenn Middleton, and one for handball - were waived.
"Wonderful" by Livingston - Analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena.
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
To a man, they were excellent, continuing to exceed expectations on this high road.
Their style of play and staff was hardly changed since returning to the top flight, but big credit had to go to the hole to make sure he refreshed the team since his arrival.
He has so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was huge, leading a super organized defense, while Menga held Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall by on their toes.
The Rangers had a lot of inspiration.
As good as they were at the time under Gerrard, they fell short of the standards.
The last pass fell – just as they picked up the home page – and it is something like an awakening for the <0xCC><0x81>Rangers who settled in the middle field.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an receives a reception in Cologne.
There were laughter and blue skies on Saturday (September 29th) when the chief of Turkey and Germany saw themselves drinking coffee in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visits to Germany - planned to improve relations between NATO allies.
They talked about problems including human rights, freedom of the press in Turkey, their access to the EU.
Erdogan set out on his way to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police have proposed security measures to block a strong crowd of 25,000 people from meeting in front of the mosque, but many supporters have stepped up to see their president.
Hundreds of Erdogan opponents - many of them Kurdish - also heard their voices, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
Only two protesters reflect the divisions of a visitor who is greeted as a hero by various German Turks and as a monarch by others.

Long Lartin Prison: Six Officers Brought to You
Six hostages are injured in an injunction and a high-security award for men, said the prison officer.
Unordering broke out at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire at about 9:30 a.m. BST a Sunday and it continues.
Specialist "Tornado" officers were hired to take care of the order, which involved eight prisoners in a plane.
The officers were placed on the spot for small wounds in the face.
A press spokesman for the prison said: Special trained prison personnel were tasked to deal with the incident in HMP Long Lartin.
Six members of staff were treated for injuries.
We don't tolerate violence in our prisons, and are clear that the police's responsibility is being proven and could spend longer behind bars."
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous perpetrators.
In June, it was reported that the director of the prison was treated at the clinic after being attacked by a prisoner.
In October of last year, offensive officers were called to prison to deal with a serious disorder in which the staff were attacked with billiards balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with floods (dry areas can benefit)
It's rare to meet a tropical depression in Arizona, but that's what's likely to happen at the beginning of next week as Hurricane Rosa's latest energy sinks through the southwest desert and brings flood risks.
The national renaissance has already swept floods for men and women four out of four for western Arizona towards southern and eastern Nevada, southwestern California and Utah, including the Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City stadiums.
Rosa is expected to take the direct route across Phoenix to the Densch and get closer to it sooner rather than later with rain.
The national memorial in Phoenix wrote in a Twitter post that only "ten tropical cyclones could maintain the status of a tropical storm or depression within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the AZ border.
The latest national hurricane center models predict 2 to 4 tons of rain, with isolated summers up to 6 tons in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
Other areas of the southwestern desert including the Central Rockies and the Great Basin can reach 1 to 2 tons, with insulated logs up to 4 tons.
For the unsurpassed risks, Rosa's rain is a blessing because the region of a drought is affected.
Although the flooding is a very serious concern, a little of the rain will probably be good because in the southwest are currently dry conditions.
The United States after Just over 40 percent of Arizona experienced at least an extreme drought, the second-highest category," said Weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa leads its way to the land over the Baja California Peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, still with hurricane power a sunny moose with maximum wall speed of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moves north by 12 miles per hour.
The storm hit more water in the Pacific and lost strength.
So, there is expected land to be razed in Mexico with tropical storm strength on Mondays in the afternoon or evening.
Driving across parts of Mexico could be difficult, putting a significant flood risk.
"The precipitation of 3 to 6 tons is expected from Baja California and northwestern Sonora, with up to 10 tons possible," says weather.com.
Rosa will then travel north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching Arizona's border and early morning hours Tuesday as a tropical depression, where she will then climb up through Arizona and southern Utah later that night.
The main threat expected by Rosa or its remnants is heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwest Sonora, and the United States' southwestern desert," said the National Hurricane Center.
It is expected that these rains will produce life-threatening floods and mudflats in the desert, and landslides in the mountains.
Midsomer Norton assaulted four convicted killers
Three youths and a 20-year-old man were arrested for presumptuous murder after a 16-year-old man with stab wounds was found in Somerset.
The juvenile was found injured in the vicinity of the Excelsior terraces in Midsomer Norton, around 04h00 a Samsden.
When he was brought to the hospital, his health was stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and 20-year-old man were arrested at night in the vicinity of Radstock, Avon's police said.
The police have called for witnesses who may have taken something with their cell phone to report.
Trump says Kavanaugh is suffering from the anger of the Democratic Party.
"The election of Judge Kavanaugh as an election against the reckless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at an election party in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had suffered through the very recklessness and anger of the Democratic Party throughout the election process.
Kavanaugh has publicly and emotionally denounced the portrayal of Christine Blasey Ford before Congress that he should have sexually harassed her when they were teenagers.
Ford has also said that it's a good thing.
The president told Samsden that "the American people have seen the splendor and quality and courage" of Kavanaugh.
"A voice to confirm Judge Kavanaugh as a voice for one of the best lawyers of our time, a lawyer with a confirmed number of deaths for the public.
The president recently presented his nomination to the Kavanaugh during his speech on the importance of Republican voter turnout in the half of the election period.
Five weeks before one of the most important elections in our lifetime.
"I'm not running, I'm running," he said.
"That's why I've gone everywhere to fight for great candidates."
Trump argued that he was on a mission to "beware and slow down."
The first decisive election at Senate level for Kavanaugh's nomination should already take place a Friday, a senior Matt worker told CNN.
Hundreds of dead in the earthquake in Indonesia, the number continues to rise
At least 384 people have died, many have been swept away as huge waves have hit the coast, as a larger bend and a tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Samsden.
Hundreds of people took part in a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Fridays as 6 meters of high waves struck in the semi-deserts across the coast, which many fell to death and destroyed everything in their way.
The tsunami as a result of an earthquake with a strength of 7.5.
"As the tsunami became threatening yesterday, people were still on the beach pursuing their activities and were not directly leaving," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesian disaster protection in a press conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, it was full of cars, huts, elevators, everything got to land at a distance," Nugroho said, citing that the tsunami at sea speeds of 800 km/h had hit it on the coast.
Some people have climbed on trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people have been evacuated in 24 centres in Palu.
Air intake made public by disaster protection shows many buildings and buttresses that have been destroyed, bridges that have been ripped away and collapsed into a mosque that surrounds all of the water.
The Samsdens were in the coastal town.
The earthquakes have been tracked in a region of 2.4 million people.
The agency for the evaluation and use of the technology said in a statement that the energy di was released in the wake of its release the force of 200 times the atomic bomb di fell to Hiroshima in the Second World War.
The geographical situation of the city at the end of a long-tended bay may have increased the size of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as "extreme" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, academies and hotels have been destroyed.
Bodies were found under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, plus 540 injured and 29 missing.
Nugroho said that the injuries and damage could be great on the 300 km long coast north of Palu, in a neighborhood called di Doggola and daat me near the epicenter.
The communication "has completely collapsed and we are without information" from Donggola, so-called Nugroho.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," said the Red Cross in a statement, and that their staff and volunteers are involved in the affected areas.
"It's kind of a tragedy," he said.
The agency, like Samsden, has been heavily criticized for not seeing him hit tsunami palu, officials said the waves came out at the same time as the warning came out.
Amateur images on social media show a man on a higher stack who warns by yelling at the bottom of the street before the tsunami.
Within minutes, a water wall meets the coast, and travels buildings and cars mat.
Reuters was only able to directly confirm the images.
The boom in the tsunami caused massive power outages and the communication around Palu slowed down while the authorities were hard pressed to coordinate the rescue efforts.
The army has sent first transport planes with aid supplies from Jakarta and other cities, so the authorities say, but those evacuated still need urgent food and things for the most important needs.
The local airport was just opened for rescue teams and remains closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is expected to visit the evacuation centers in Palu.
The number of victims of the tsunami in Indonesia is 800.
It's like a curse.
While the staff of World Vision of Donggola certainly arrived in Palu City when the employees and tent-sites were interrupted on the grounds of this bureau, they had to face scenes of destruction, according to Lord Doseba.
"They have taught me that many have been destroyed," he said.
It's like a curse.
Even as the aid teams began to recognize the extent of the destruction, some complained that foreign aid teams with great experience only allowed the areas in Palu to grow.
According to the Indonesian laws, matérial and personnel are only allowed to enter the country if you consider the area to be a national disaster zone.
But it's only happened after a while.
"It's still a regional disaster," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"Soubally the government says, 'OK, it's a national disaster', but we can open up for international aid as yet nothing happens."
As the second night in Palu comes after the earthquake and tsunami of his friars, friends and families hope that missing ones here are among the wonders that always arise after such disasters.
To save Samsden as a small bow from a channel.
A sun saver rescued a woman who had been buried under a coup d'état, right next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian paragliding team, has trained two of the missing paragliders who were fired for the Asian players,
The other students from the Roa Roa Hotel were seven students, according to the Lord Monday.
"As an alumnus in the paragliding, I have to bear my own emotional burden," he said.
Lord Gendon as he was, in the hours following the news where the rooms of the Collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel and the Paragliding group went around, WhatsApp news was sent to the team that participated in the Beach Festival.
Unfortunately, only two of them were in the same position, and only two of them were in the same position.
"I don't think I'm going to be the only one," he said.
Raiber stole $26,750 while filling a vending machine in Newport/Levee.
The robbers had stolen him peacefully from a Brink's security man who had gone to fill in Bancomat, stealing $26,750 in Newport/Levee, which is in a letter from the Newport Police Department.
The driver was about to make the bancomat empty in an entertainment complex and should just fill the money, police officer Dennis McCarthy wrote.
While he was employed, another man came "from behind the Brink's employee" and stole money from him.
The suspects were more likely to leave the scene, but the police only saw how many there were.
Everyone with information about the identity should contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
The rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
On Twitter, he wrote: "The official known as Kanye West.
West, 41, has been named Ye since a time and has used the nickname as the title of song's eighth album, which came out in June.
The album will be released on Saturday Night Live, where the release of a new album will be announced.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande di for "emotional reasons" can only be on the show, according to the founder of the show.
Although there is a decline in the number of professional names, the West has already predicted that the word also has a religious significance for him.
"I believe 'ye' as a daat most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," said the West me early in the year, at a presentation of his new album on Radio Big Boy.
"I am you, I am the sea, I am the sea.
It comes from Kanye, Daat means the only one, to only Ye - the mirror of our good, our evil, our wrongdoer, everything.
The album is like a mirror of who we are."
He's one of many famous rappers to change his name.
Sean Combs has been named Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he decided to go for Love and Brother Love.
A former mat singer from the West, the Jay-Z, has always played with small and large letters.
Mexico's Amlo and Mexico have vowed to stop the military from attacking civilians
In the run-up to the 50-year celebration of the bloody assassination of students, Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador vowed to never employ the military against the civilians.
Lopez Obrador promised Samsden "never use the military to suppress the Mexican people."
During a frivolous demonstration at the Plaza on October 2, 1968, the troops fired on the people and 300 were ambushed at a time when they left to go through Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has announced that young Mexicans will be supported by monthly grants to students and by the opening of more free universities.
He said he was trying to get rid of the bullying and the abuses of the school's criminal gangs.
The U.S. would be forced to pay the K.I.'s
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount of research in the field of artificial intelligence, says the investor and friends of AI Kai-Fu Lee, who has already worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These statements come after hearing more and more from circles of the U.S. government than that the U.S. does not have a proper strategy in research around the AI.
Meanwhile, China has presented its plan for the final year: the first in the AI research will be done by 2030.
"The doubling of the research budget of artificial intelligence as a good start, considering that all other nations are far behind the United States, and we are working on the next breakthrough in artificial intelligence," Lee said.
The doubling of funding can double the chances that the next leap will be measured in the U.S., Lee CNN said in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" came out this month at Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, as Director General at Sinovation Ventures, who invested in one of the most famous companies for AI in China, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that beat the highest ranked American Othello player, later becoming Director General at Microsoft Research and President of Google China.
Lee knew about the previous technology competitions in the U.S. such as Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge and was asked when you would be next to help your next visionaries find gear.
U.S. officials often have to work hard to get state aid, according to Lee.
"It's only China that is the leader of the Acadian people; it's the socialities," Lee said.
Facebook, Google, and other tech companies have engaged the lumiairs and the slow-moving joars of universities to work on AI.
In addition, Lee's immigration law could also improve the U.S. immigration law.
"I think the Green Card should be offered automatically to professors in AI," he said.
In July 2017, China's government announced its next-generation artificial intelligence development plan.
The Chinese National Natural Science Foundation funds people at academic institutions as well as the National Science Foundation and other governmental organizations are for U.S. researchers to do, but the quality of academic work as well as in China is just as good, according to the LEE.
Earlier this year in the U.S., the Department of Defense set up joint AI centers to bring together partners from industry and educational institutions, and the White House announced the establishment of a Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced a $2 trillion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, which is currently investing over $100 million in the AI.
Meanwhile, the U.S. government's National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has been operating for months.
Macedonia's decision to hold a referendum to change the name of the country
The people of Macedonia are in a referendum on whether to change the name to "Republic of North Macedonia", a step for them to face up to an ongoing dispute with Greece, which hinders the accession and membership of the European Union and the NATO.
Greece, which has a province named Macedonia, claimed that the name of Noopesland was trying to disapprove of the province and vetoed it against it and the NATO and the EU.
The two governments negotiated a proposal on the new name in June, but nationalist opponents argue that the switch undermines the ethnic identity of the majority slave population in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would only vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign showed that it would be difficult for them to reach 50 percent in order for the elections to be valid.
The referendum said: "You are in favour of a NATO and EU membership with acceptance of the agreement with Greece."
Supporters of the name Wissel, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the price would be to be paid for a recording in organizations such as the EU and the NATO of Macedonia, one of the countries that originated from the collapse of former Yugoslavia.
"I have come today to choose for the future of Macedonia so that young people live freely under the spell of the European Union because it means more secure lives for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
In fact, there are a lot of members of parliament who have been accused of failing to comply with the law.
A majority of the majority is required in the House of Representatives.
As a result, the state's election committee would not be allowed to hold elections until 13 o'clock.
Nevertheless, the election polling rate was only 16 percent, compared to the 2016 parliamentary elections where 66 percent of the voters were elected.
"I am proud of my children, our place as in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a widower in the capital, Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko have been known in the referendum in Macedonia for changing the country's name for the way to NATO and the European Union on 30 September 2018 in Strumica, Macedonia.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardakov, 54, took a small stage and quietly erected in front of the tents of those who boycotted the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to get up high, only through the hands," Kavadarkov said.
"We are poor country, but we have our pride.
If they only want us as Macedonia, we can turn to each other as China and Russia and be part of the Euro-Asia integration."
Prime Minister Zaev's so-called NATO membership would bring our major investors to Macedonia, wat he has Chomagetaux of over 20 percent.
"I believe that the majority of the population, as a result, is more than 80 percent of the population for NATO and the EU," said Zaev after leaving the polling station.
He said that the "yes" result would be "confirmation for our future."
A final poll by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research said 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum - less than required.
According to a recent survey by Telma TV, 57 percent of the respondents said they had planned to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent of the population are obese.
In order for the referendum to be valid as, 50 percent plus one must choose one.
It would be the first election round in the campaign of the pro-Western government, but it would be the end of Jo<0xC3><0xAB>r.
See: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero breaks all of Brighton's defenses and makes a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling break through ‘Defense from Brighton in Manchester City and win 2–0 on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero lowered the ball with lightness in the 65th minute.
The Argentinian star bought a pass in the middle field at the beginning of the race.
He ran as the top three defenders of Brighton and had an open field.
The Aguero then rose to 4 opponents.
He's got a man who's got a gun in his head and he's got a gun in his ass.
Then he went to the top of the hill where the silver was found.
The Englishman, as with the first ball touching in the field, fell forward and went back to the Aguero, who sat with the right foot to the goalkeeper of Brighton the ball in the right corner.
"The Aquero is currently experiencing minor problems in the feet," City Pep Guardiola's manager told reporters.
"I've been playing for 55, 60 minutes.
It's happened as a daat.
We're happy that he scored a goal at the time."
But it was Sterling who hated the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
The Aquero caught the ball far away in the middle of Brighton.
He has a wonderful pass over the left flank at Leroy Sane.
Sane had a bit of a trip before and had a long pass with Sterling.
The Sky Blues shot the ball straight into the net before it would have gone out.

The man who played the game against the Rockies
With the exception of the Nationals in the playoff, as a reason to force a new start.
But the always-at-a-risk joker hopes to keep the upper hand against the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies are still in the playoffs that are one game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies clinch a wild card with a 5-2 win against the Nationals a Friday night, but still struggle to secure their title in the first division.
"And if we don't play for nothing, at least we can do a great game, knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the audience and the other teams who are likely to play at the highest level I'll be experiencing this year.
Why shouldn't I do this?"
Nationals have to tell them how to start a Sunday, but are sure to advise the joker to pitch in that situation.
The scorer, who will play his 34th start, threw a thunderbolt session and will play a Sunday on his break day.

Trump on Election Day in West Virginia
The president pointed to the situation around his choice of Brett Kavanaugh for the European House while pointing to the importance of a Republican victory in these interim elections.
"I'm all set for November.
Five weeks before the most important elections in our lives.
This as one of the big, big — I'm just running but I'm actually running for real that's why I'm fighting for good candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "The door sees these terrible, terribly radical groups of Democrats, you see how it is happening now.
And they are determined to take the power under all circumstances, you see the sinlessness, the commonwealth.
Those who don't care who they hurt, who they have to agree to for their power and control, death as it wats them, power and control, we won't be able to control them."
Democrats, he said, are on a mission of "resisting and blocking."
"And you see Daat in the last four days," he said, referring to Democrats as "roses and sinless and gnawed and lost."
He mentioned the Judiciary Senate Committee with Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein's name, which was most widely used.
"Do you remember the answer here?"
Have you read the document?
Uh, uh, waat.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
The work no longer belongs to God.
It's as intolerant to those who are so wat they think.
When I was in a state of emergency, I was a little surprised.
In the end, I'm the only one who's got a job that I'd like to work for, just because I think we're going to be able to do it.
My party colleague Joan Ryan is treated as being similar because she resolutely opposes antisemitism.
In my case, when the censorship criticized me because I wasn't right Jeremy Corbyn.
Matt's view of the importance of a responsible approach to the economy, national security, and Europe, ironically similar concerns in regards to which Jeremy has been implicated in previous leaders.
The note for Nottingham East workers meeting on Friday says that "we want our meeting to be inclusive and productive."
In most of my eight years as a local employee representative, the Friday evening meetings were exactly date.
Today, unfortunately, when Daat just heard the sound at many meetings and the promises of "my friendly, my fine" policy as long as it has been forgotten, it has ever been so.
It is more and more surprising that other opinions are not tolerated in the working party and any opinion is held whether they are acceptable than for the party's participation.
This was shortly after Jeremy took over the leadership, as colleagues with whom I had previously suggested we would have had similar political views on even assuming that I was taking the lead in a position that I had never accepted before - in the national security as well as in the EU Bannemort.
Every time I have publicly swathed - and it's not really important waat I say - then I get a tirade of remarks on social media against the policy of the middle, and which I say I just had my place in the workers' party.
It's just my experience.
Nevertheless, I know that I'm doing better than any of my colleagues because the comments I get are political in nature.
I admire the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who are exposed to sexist or racist remarks every day and hardly look away.
One of the saddest aspects in these political times is that the level of abuse is becoming more and more normal.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn demanded that the Labor Party adhere to a culture of tolerance.
The truth is that we are no longer of God and with all the "non-trust" movement or change of selection rules the party will become increasingly sound.
In the last two years, I have had a lot of trouble keeping myself calm, not being too hard, and then I was "on the line."
But that's not why I came to politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student, caught up with a reluctance by the Thatcher government during which my classroom was almost collapsing, I tried to improve the public services for those who need it most – whether as a local politician or as a government minister.
I've never tried to hide my politics, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could doubt my political position and the points where I am not in favour of the current leadership.
For those who approve of the movement of freedom, all I want to say is if the country meets a Brexit, that this will harm the state, trade and public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy in my loyalty to the Labour Party.
But the only message I have concerns the Nottingham Momentum, it is for my voters, whether Labour members or not: I am proud to serve and I promise that no threats or political statements will deter me from acting accordingly, to what I believe is best for you all.

Ayr 38 – 17 Melrose Ayr unscathed
Two attempts in recent times have carved up the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserves the triumph in this spectacular Tennt's Premiership match of the day.
They are now on the pitch, the only unbeaten of 10.
Finally, it was a better defense, just as the improved grasp of chances, which the home team and coach Peter Murchie were able to enjoy.
"We have been asked in our matches so far and we are still unbeaten, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "Good for Ayr, they've captured the odds better than we have."
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, as portrayed by Frazier Climbo, brought Ayr near, but a yellow card for Scottish Rory Hughes, which he got in a game of the Warriors, weakened Melrose and Jason Baggot was able to launch an unaltered attempt.
Climo was able to convert a penalty kick for Ayr, just before half-time, he then converted an attempt alone to solve Ayr's 17:5.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's lap, surrounded by the Baggot, was able to reduce the difference to five points.
After a break-up due to a violation of the Ruaridh knot, which was swept into a new pit, Ayr was able to restart through a run by Stafford McDowall, surrounded by Climo.
Ayr's captain, Blair Macpherson, then got a yellow card, and again, Melrose was able to take advantage of the advantage with a run by Bruce Colvine, after heavy pressure.
The home team came back, however, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card, because he tied the climb without a ball on the line, Macpherson was able to achieve a touchdown in the back of the roughing Ayr.
Climo was able to convert as he did from the beginning, after Kyle Rowe was able to start David Armstrong's kickoff and lead flanker Gregor Henry to a fifth lap.

The actor Ford Kieran is looking forward to switching to hotel business after finding out that he was nominated director of a restaurant chain.
The 56-year-old Jack Jarvis plays in the well-known BBC broadcast, which he writes and in which he plays as a co-star with long-time comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the next 9 episodes are the last of the show, and the Kiernan plans to do something new after Craiglang.
According to official reports, he is a director at Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor lends all commentary on the story, although a source of the "Scottish Sun" has revealed that the Kiernan has gone on to come to "the thriving restoration industry" of Glasgow.
The sea belongs to us: Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen the way to the Pacific
Matrouse patrolled under a tack in the main square of La Paz.
The building has an ocean-blue flag.
The naval bases from Titicaca Sea to the Amazon run under the motto: "The sea belongs to us rightly.
It's our duty to take it back."
Through the entire land of Bolivia, the memory of a coast lost in a conflict in the 19th century in Chile is still alive – insists the will to sail back to the Pacific Ocean.
At the moment, the hope is great as never before, because Bolivia is waiting for a decision of the International Court of Justice on 1 October, after five years of negotiations.
"Bolivia has the elan, the spirit of unity and unity and, of course, hopes for a positive decision," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians follow the decision of the International Court of Justice on large screens in the hope that The Hague will decide favorably on Bolivia and – after decades of sporadic talks – Chile will be forced to negotiate with Bolivia over sovereign access to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic president of Bolivia – who is in favor of a controversial fight for new elections next year – puts a lot of emphasis on the promises of a Monday.
"We're moving back to the Pacific," he said in August.
But some analysts believe that the court will not decide favorably on Bolivia – and that not much would change if it did.
The UN agency, which has its headquarters in the Netherlands, has no power over Chile and has announced that it will not be involved in any talks.
According to Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean expert on international law, the court's decision has been discussed six months after the final hearings, indicating that the case was "not complicated."
In the past four years, the Bolivian population has been in decline.
"The question of access to the sea has been torpedoed by the current Bolivian administration," Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
Morales's fighting rhetoric weakened all Chilean wills, clarified.
Bolivia and Chile continue to speak at some point, but it is very difficult to predict the talks after that.
In 1962, the two countries no longer had any ambassadors.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, a Bolivian representative in The Hague, has pointed out that the decision of the court was particularly quickly taken.
On the other hand, Bolivia offers "an exceptional opportunity for a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "end a 139-year-old dispute with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla has also pointed out that Morales – still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America – uses the maritime exit as a political spring breeze.
"Bolivia never stops claiming its right to access the Pacific," he said.
"The decision is an opportunity to try to get our past behind us."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't happen before it can be trusted by the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never be the first to disarm if it can't trust Washington.
He spoke at a meeting of the UN General Assembly.
He appealed to the United States to abide by their promises, which have become the presidents of the rivals at the summit in Singapore.
His comments came as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo attempted to revive nuclear negotiations of diplomacy more than three months after Singapore with North Korean Kim Jong Un.
The Ri says it is "a dream" that further sanctions in the U.S.'s appeal against a declaration for the Korean War would end Korea ever to be forced into the knees.
Washington is careful to agree to the declaration, without Pyongyang making first steps in the direction of a massive disarmament.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is a general skepticism that Pyongyang believes it is with the disarmament of an arsenal that the country sees as the only guarantee for its security.
Pompeo is planning a visit to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim Trump summit.
The Parisian fashion shows show a massive rise in headgear on the streets.
If you want to expand your hat collection or completely block the sun, then look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne reveal a dash of oversized headgear at Catwalk for their SS19 collection, which puts the style on the Parisian fashion weeks in the spotlight.
Absolutely impractical heat has flooded Instagram this summer and these designers have sent their eye-catching creations to the catwalk.
The highlight of Valentino was an oversized beige hat with something resembling a feather and flooding the model's head.
Other oversized accessories with beautiful watermelons, a mixture of hat and pineapple – but they are not meant to keep their heads warm.
Thom Browne has also released some weird mask - just right for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks have closed lips and are more similar to the Hannibal Lecter than the Haute Couture.
One creation resembles a diving costume complete with snorkeling and glasses, while another looks like a melted glacecornet.
If you want to see more, don't be disappointed.
In the meantime, you'll be able to see that the giants are on their way to you.
The oversized heat strongly resembles the celebration of "La Bomba", the straw hat with a 60 cm wide board, which one has already seen at Rihanna until Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the highly impractical heat that has flooded the social media is sending yet another great creation to the catwalk – a beach town as big as the model it imagines.
The deep orangutan bascule, with bass wings in a white song grip, was the main focus of Jacquemus' La-Riviera-SS19 collection on the Parisian Fashion Weeks.
Starstylist Luke Armitage said: "I expect to see big heat and beach pitch on our streets next summer - because designers have achieved such a big impact, it will be difficult to ignore the demand for oversized accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are indispensable for world citizens
Scotland's independent schools hold the record for academic achievement and this has continued in 2018 with new outstanding exam results, which could only be strengthened by individual and collective achievements in sports, art, music and other social endeavors.
With over 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS), want to strive for the best level of service for their students and parents.
Independent schools work to prepare their students for further and higher schools, for their chosen career and their place as world citizens.
As an educational institution with an agreed and discussed curriculum, we consider modern languages to be popular and desirable subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "When you talk to a man in a language he understands, it goes in his head.
If you speak to him in a language of your own, it goes into your heart."
This is a strong reminder that we don't just want to rely on English, if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
Since these exams, we can see that languages are very at the top, with the best results within the independent schools.
68% of students who have studied foreign languages have graduated with an A+.
The data collected from the 74 SCIS schools show that 72 percent of students have an A+ in Mandarin, while 72 percent in German, 69 percent in French, and 63 percent in Spanish have also achieved an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that students and young people need without a doubt in the future.
Languages as electives are now considered the same as major subjects (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) in the curriculum of independent schools, but also occasionally different.
A 2014 survey by the English Commission on Occupations and Skills found that patrons stated that it is difficult to occupy free positions, 17 percent due to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, more and more language skills are becoming more and more important for preparing young people for their future tasks.
With more future job opportunities requiring languages, these skills are becoming increasingly important in a global world.
Regardless of the career that one chooses, if one has learned a second language, one has a real lead in the future.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically puts a multilingual person at the top of the competition.
According to a YouGov survey with more than 4,000 adults in England from 2013, 75 percent are unable to speak a foreign language well enough to lead a conversation, with French still coming into the two-place area as a single language with 15 percent.
Therefore, it is so important to invest in the learning of languages in the children of today.
In addition to the fact that children are more likely to be able to work in a healthy environment, the children are more likely to be able to work in a healthy way.
In Scotland, all schools offer different languages.
A variety of schools focus on the more classically modern languages, while other languages learn that could be more important for England after 2020 than Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter what your child is interested in, there is always a Russian language in the independent schools to choose from, with teachers specializing in this area.
Scottish independent schools are eager to provide a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need to achieve something, no matter what the future looks like.
It cannot be disputed in a global business environment that languages are vital to the future of the country and that must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages must be regarded as "international communication skills."
Independent schools offer these whales, diversity and outstanding performance for the young people of Scotland.
I'll faut bien le faire.
John Edward is the head of the Scottish Red for independent schools.
LeBron makes his debut for the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for the fans who are waiting for LeBron James to start for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play a Sunday in the preseason game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
It only takes a few minutes to figure out how long he'll be playing.
"It's more than one in less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Laker reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
As a winner, James was asked earlier this week about his plans for the Lakers' six-player preseason program.
"I don't need a pre-season player at this point of my career to be ready," he said.
Trump's election tour in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump will start the evening in Wheeling, West Virginia, a plethora of election campaigns.
It's Trump's first of five tours in the next week, with stations on him kindly sunk places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote in the wake of his election for the post of Supreme Court judge, Trump is targeting the support for the upcoming mid-term elections, from which Republicans risk losing control of Congress when the elections are held in November.
At what time is Trump's West Virginia election today and how do you watch it online?
Trump's election event for West Virginia is scheduled for today's evening, Samsden, September 29, 2018, 19:00 ET time.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia election online via livestream on YouTube.
Trump would mention this week's announcement for the upcoming Brett Kavanaugh, whose whale was put on ice for a week due to the allegations of sexual abuse with a former senator while the FBI is investigating the case.
But the first goal is to help Republicans grow their faces at the polls in November and gain new momentum.
President Trump's campaign, therefore, said the five events next week have the goal of "giving free and supportive new energy, while Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Congress control is so critical to its agenda that the president travels as much as possible during the important time of the campaign and as many states," a spokesman for Trump's campaign, who did not want to be named, told Reuters.
Planned for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the election event can bring supporters from "Ohio in Pennsylvania and be treated by the media of Pittsburg," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Samsdeg is the second time in the last month that Trump visited West Virginia, the state where he won in 2016 with more than 40 percentage points.
Trump is trying to help the Republican senatorial candidate for West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who is retiring in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president must come to help him get a job in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a West Virginia University political scientist.
Ryder Cup 2018 The U.S. team demonstrates the courage to fight for the hopes of keeping the individual's struggles alive on Sunday
After three one-sided sessions, the four-fight can be a co-gnome just what this Ryder Cup needs.
The swinging swing is a very invented sport concept, but one that the players believe in, and never more than in such competitions as these.
Where are they going to tell you that it's a slingshot?
"They had a lead of six points and now there are still four, so we now see this as a small swing," said Jordan Spieth, as he concluded for today.
Europe has the advantage; of course, four points ahead of the game with twelve.
The Americans, as Spieth says, felt a little wind in their sails and they had a lot to be assembled, not in the end the shape of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together every day, and all both gave them three of four points.
Spieth was delicious from tea to the green and is an example.
The happy keel vessel became tougher as his round advanced, an important pit lowered to raise the match to itself and where Thomas is two of two behind him.
His putt, through which they won the match to 15, was acquitted with a similar crunch, of the sort that a saying that he believes the American team is not out there.
"You just have to be strong enough and take care of your own game," Spieth said.
That's all that's left of all these games.
18 points to score.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed legends of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's old, but beloved couples are four out of four before and can't do anything wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only group that didn't shoot a samshnegn<0xC3><0xA4>tty Bogey, but they also avoided the samshnegm<0xC3><0xA4>rgen, Freidegnom<0xC3><0xA4>tty and the nine back a fridegm<0xC3><0xA4>rgen Bogeye.
On this run, and as their energy seems to flow at and away from the spectators, they argue that they are the players who make it a Sunday to beat, and there will be no more popular players to watch a potential European victory when the sun goes down over the Le Golf National, such as the Fleetwood and the Molinari.
The two of them were on the same page at the same time.
It's a European victory, but it's still a win-win.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson had a brief trial with Sergio Garcia, the hero of Moien in Fourball, when he was in a relationship with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the first nine buried the Spaniard in the sweat and a laugh from which they could not get out so quickly.
No one is there to help you out of laughter.
The four-balls and four-players are so fascinating because of the interactions between the group formations; the stimuli they give; the stimuli they don't give in the way a strategy can change in a glance.
Europe has so far played better as a team and has gone well and lead for the last day, but this four-player session has also shown that the team USA has the will to fight for what has been doubted, especially the stateside.
Europe will go 10-6 on Ryder Cup Final Day
Europe had a healthy advantage on the final day of the Ryder Cup after the fourth ball of a Samsden and the fourth match against the United States with 10-6.
The inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the game with two victories over a swinging Tiger Woods to loan their lead to four points at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn on the European side, who lost the trophy to Hazeltine two years ago, dominates a poorly stocked American side in the four-balls, sitting the series at 3-1.
The US offers more resistance in the fours, wins two matches, but they do not receive the deficit.
Jim Furyk's side needs eight points out of 12 individual matches to get the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European starter to win the four points in the series while in the Molinari, together "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend are only the second few to make the four points since the first four matches in Ryders Cup history.
Against the Woods and Patrick Reed won in the quarter-finals, they harmonize well against an audacious Woods and the American beginner Bryson Dechambeau at a sympathetic 5&4.
The Woods, who went on their own through two matches at Samsden, showed a brilliant break in the four-balls and fours and sevens in a row.
Justin Rose came back to play with Henrik Stenson in the fours, beating Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - the first and third picks in the world.
Europe doesn't just have it on a beautiful, lazy day in southwestern Paris.
The three-time winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas put the lead for the Americans with two points on Samsden.
They recounted a grave 2&1 victory over the players Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-ball and later came back to win against the Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the fours regardless of whether they lost the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup, a team has a come back from a four point deficit to join the singles, whether the Furyk's side just needs to keep track of the trophy.
After they were second-best for two days, as always, a counterattack on Sunday looked like they didn't want to.
North Korea Says 'Nowhere' They Would Be Disappointed Without Confidence
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Samsden that further sanctions would undermine confidence against the United States and there is no way that North Korea would unilaterally arm its nuclear weapons under such conditions.
Ri Yong Ho said at the annual General Assembly that North Korea has shown many "good wills" in past years, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the Nuclear Test Site, and adding nuclear weapons and nuclear technology no further to enlarge.
"We don't see an equal response from the United States," he said.
"Without trust in the United States there is no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances there is no way that we unilaterally disarm ourselves.
While the Ri is rewarded with the well-known complaints about Washington's resistance to a phased approach to a denuclearization in which North Korea is resented for the single step, he stresses his statement in which he does not expressly lend an unilateral denuclearization as Pyongyang has always done in the past.
Ri refers to a joint letter from Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump on the first summit of a incumbent U.S. President and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, where Kim negotiated a "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula" while Trump guarantees North Korea's security.
North Korea was looking for a formal end to the Korean War 1950-53, but the United States so-called Pyongyang had to first abandon its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also appealed to appeals for international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insists on "denuclearization-first" and increases pressure by sanctions to enforce itself in a compulsive manner, and raises objections to "declaration of the end of war," Ri said.
"The perception that the sanctions could force us to the knees is a dream of the people who don't know us.
But the problem is that the ongoing sanctions are our mistrust."
Ri said nothing of plans for a second round of talks with Kim and Trump, who had a U.S. leader first the week before the United Nations.
In a statement, South Korea's Prime Minister Kim and South Korea's leader Moon Jae-in said, "If the party for denuclearization were South Korea and not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be in such a matter of fact."
As such, the tone of Ri's singing speech was dramatically different from that of last year's, as one saw before the UN General Assembly that the targets on the U.S. mainland of the North Korean missiles were triggered by the "Lord Devil President" Trump as he called Kim a "rocket man" on a suicide mission.
This year on the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, vowed Kim's courage to undertake the first step to disarm, but said that still much work remains and sanctions must persist until North Korea's denuclearization.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no timetable for this, "If it takes two years, three years or five months - it's not important."
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its progress.
But U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council: "The enforcement of sanctions by the Security Council must continue to be sustained and, in any case, enforced until we have fully, finally and proven denuclearization has re-aligned."
Since 2006, the Security Council has strengthened unanimous sanctions against North Korea, hoping that through the efforts of funds, they could abolish Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile program.
Pompeo met Ri behind the scenes assemblée generale of the UN and said that the next month would go back to Pyongyan to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his recent visit is not well-deserved.
In July, he left Pyongyang and said that Prog<0xC3><0xA8>s had been fed, but during hours North Korea denounced for its "gangster demands."
In a meeting with the Moon dese Mount, North Korea committed to dismantle a missile site and also a nuclear complex if Americans were to undertake "demonstrating measures."
He said that Kim would crowd with "demonstrating measures" that he is looking for security guarantees that Trump has secured in Singapore and rapprochement to normal relations with Washington.
Harvard students are willing to take the course to speed up enough.
A new course at Harvard University allows all of its students to get more sleep and thus try to fight the growing macho culture, in which one goes through the night with coffee in blood.
One academic has found that college students, the number one in the world, often have no idea what it means to look after themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham's Fraespidol, has compiled the course, which is the first in the field in America.
He was then inspired to start the course, after a four-pronged approach to the effects of lack of sleep on the teachers.
"At the end of the fourth release, a girl came to me and said, 'Why am I going to get this first, in my last year?'
He said that until now, no one has told him about the importance of sleep - which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, which is offered for the first time this year, explains the essentials of how good sleep habits can help academics and sports performance, as well as how a general well-being can bring with it.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and business leaders of the University's health services, said that the university decided to offer the course after they realized that students had a real lack of sleep during the week.
The course, which lasts an hour, offers a range of interactive tasks.
In one part, an image of a dorm is shown, where students can click on coffee bars, rides, sports shoes and books and then learn about the effect of caffeine and lute, but also how sports performance of sleep is affected and the importance of a sleep routine.
In another part, they learn that long-term lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart attacks, a stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the university area, with interactive icons, then encourages students to think about their daily routine.
"We don't know if it's worth changing the behavior of the students directly.
But we believe that they have a right to know that – just how one has a right to know what health problems the smoking of cigarettes brings with them,” added Prof Czeisler.
The culture of breaking up all night learning still exists, according to the professor, and the modern technology and pressure on the students, who are getting bigger and bigger, as a consequence lack of sleep and is a problem that is getting bigger and bigger.
He said that the assurance of adequate quality sleep should be a kind of "secret weapon" against stress, overexertion and fear - even to prevent one from contributing, want to shift the danger and hunger, and one's feeling always hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studied chemistry and physics biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, even after choosing one of his courses last year in his first year at Harvard.
He said that the court had opened his eyes and inspired him to offer the course to the entire university.
He hopes, in a next step, to bring all doctoral students to complete a similar study program before joining the competitive institution.
Prof Czeisler recommends that students set themselves an alarm for when to go to bed, but also to get up, and pay attention to the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lights and which over the course of the day can be kept out of the hallway and thus lead to sleep problems.
Livingston 1 – 0 Rangers: Menga's goal hits Gerrard's team
The Rangers had a further defeat due to the Dolly Menga's goal, which degraded Steven Gerrard's little cohesive side to a 1-0 defeat.
Ibrox's side have tried to secure their first match since the 4-1 triumph at St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team has brought Gerrard's second defeat and 18 players as a coach with them and left behind eight points behind Ladbrokes Premiership leaders, the Hearts.
Menga scored the goal seven minutes before halftime, and the line-up of the Rangers team took inspiration from it and couldn't keep up.
While the Rangers are now slipping to the sixth place, Livingston climbs to the third, behind Hiberian by the difference in goals.
And there could still be further problems coming to the ranks after the Abiter Calum Spence for a head win had to be borne, and this was due to an object that appeared to have been shot at the end of the game.
Gerrard changed his mind eight times, which gave him the opportunity to leave Ayr behind and get to the semi-finals of Betfred Cup.
The hole, on the other hand, chose the same Livi 11, which cost the hearts that last week a point and would be thrilled to see his well-drilled team here working opponents all the time.
The Rangers had the ball more often, but Livingston had more with the ball they had.
They had already been able to score a goal for two minutes in the game, when Menga's first pass brought Scott Pittman to the goal of Allan McGregor, but the midfielder had gone too far.
In the wake of Keaghon Jacobs's death on Captain Craig Halkett, Alan Lithglow and the Defensive have only been given the opportunity to shoot at the posts from far away.
The Rangers were able to gain control, but it looked more like hope than faith and their game in the last third of the game.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that an eleven-metre mark would have been appropriated after a quarter-point as had been agreed upon by Steven Lawless, but abiter Steven Thomsen ignored the Colombian's complaints.
The Rangers have only scored twice in the first half on the goal, but former Ibrox goal-kipp Liam Kelly has almost no problem with Lassana Coulibaly throwing off his head shot and Oviedo Ejaria's harmless shot.
While Livi's 34-minute lead could be considered a run against the game, no one can claim they didn't deserve it for their efforts alone.
In the end, the Rangers agreed to a standard situation of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher shot the ball between Scott Robinson, who kept a cool head and selected the menga for a simple goal shot.
Gerrard resigned in the break and outscored the Coulibaly against Ryan Kent, which practically had a direct impact as the striker overthrew the Morelos, but the impressive Kelly came up from the side to block.
But Livingston continued to provide visitors with exactly the genre of games they love, with Lithgow and Halkett adopting one long ball after another.
Holt's side could have continued to take advantage of this lead in those awkward moments, but McGregor kept Jacobs de Bass before shooting the Lithgow from far a corner.
The Rangers here traded Glenn Middleton had a further later right to an elf meter as he went along with Jacobs each other, but Thomsen looked away again.
Almanac, the inventor of the violinist
And now a page from our "Sunday Morning" Almanac: September 30th, 1882, 136 years ago on the day exactly, and still further VISITED... the spy physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
The violinist developed a method by which one can detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that later became known as the violinist.
The violinist, since a major support of science, has also become a pillar of pop culture, in 1950 the film "Bells of Colorado" came out with actor Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, who had more cowboys smiling than scientists:
Man: "What is it then?"
Rogers: "This is a geyser that is used to localize radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you're on the other side of the headphones, you can hear the effects of the atoms emitted by the radioactivity and the minerals."
He said, "Well, it's going to be cool!"
The "Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But his invention, which is named after him, is still alive.
A new cancer vaccine can help the immune system detect additional cells
New cancer vaccine can help the immune system detect and kill additional cells
Vaccination contributes to the immune system, as it can detect malignant cells as part of the treatment
In the method, immune cells are taken from a patient and then converted into a lab
They can then recognize a protein that is in many cancer cells and then re-injected
A test vaccination shows promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
In a woman who has been treated with the vaccine that contributes to the immune system to recognize malignant cells, the cancer of the ovaries has disappeared after more than 18 months.
In the method, immunity cells are removed from a patient, then converted into a lab, so that they recognize a protein from many cancer types, called HER2, and then re-spray the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "triggers the growth of various types of cancer," including breast, implant, lung and bowel cancer, as explained by Prof Berzofsky.
A similar approach to taking immunity cells from patients and "adding" them, as one cancer cell has already worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West has started a pro-Trump tirade, with a MAGA cap, following his appearance at SNL.
It's not going well
Kanye West has been featured in the studio during the broadcast Saturday Night Live, following a wide-ranging performance, in which U.S. President Donald Trump praised and said he would be a presidential candidate for 2020.
After singing his third song of the evening, which is called Ghost Town, he wore a cape with the headline Make America Great, shoved against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"I often talk to white people and they say, 'How can you love Trump, is he a racist?'"
"If I were to deal with racism, I would have been out of America for a long time," he said.
SNL began the broadcast with a sketch with Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavaunagh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on charges of sexual harassment by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not transmitted, West's tirade was uploaded by the social media of comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if the rock has been trying to get along with those posts across the West.
The West also complained to the public that going backstage had problems due to its cape.
"They've bullied me backstage.
They said, "Don't go out with the cape."
They've bullied me!
And then they said I was sick," said the Washington Examiner.
The West continued, "Do you want to see the sunken place?", followed by a statement that "he would be down his Superman costume, no one would be able to tell me what I could do. You want the world to go ahead?
"Try the lion."
His comments at least twice brought bows to the audience and the SNL cast looked like it was embarrassing to them, as Variety writes, and one person said the publication: "Over the whole studio it was completely quiet."
The West replaced singer Ariana Grande in a blasphemous minute, whose colleague, rapper Mac Miller, had died two days earlier.
The West irritated others with the performance of the song I love it, wanting to go as a perrier's bottle was done.
The West has received support from four-year-old conservative group TPUSA, the Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the courageous heads: Thank you, you're holding the seat."
But the talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that the West is just "as who is going and that's absolutely wonderful."
"I choose to reward someone (whether I buy his music or clothes or his "art") in which I believe that a harmful ideology that could spread to my community could be like that.
He's free.
But we are, too," she said.
Prior to the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, and while now he would be called "the artist who used to be known as Kanye West."
He is not the first to change his name and so follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, was named Snoop Lion and, of course, the later museum-clad Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and called himself "the artist previously known as Prince."
Morduklo on knifepicking in a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man is charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed to death in a restaurant in eastern Belfast.
The incident happened in Ballyhackamore, according to police.
The accused is sentenced to death before Belfast Magistrates’ Court.
The points of the complaint are examined by the Public Prosecution Service.
The Game of Thrones Star Kit Harington Attacks Malicious Masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his heavy-duty role as Jon Snow in HBO's brutal fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31 years old, attacked the stereotype of the Macho hero and said that such roles on screen young men often give the feeling that they must mime the strong man to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, the kit said that it was "something went wrong" and backfired on how to tackle the problem of harmful masculinity in the #MeToo era.
The kit, which recently married its Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, also 31 years old, is believed to be "very sturdy" on the subject.
"I feel personally, quite stubborn, at the moment - where did we go with the masculinity shift?"
"What did we do when we were growing up, according to the terms of the problem we see today?"
The kit believes that television is partly to blame for the house of harmful masculinity, just because of its extremely masculine characters.
He said, "What is teaching and what is teaching?"
What is being taught on television and in the streets that young men are supposed to be the particular side of man?
I think it's one of the biggest challenges of our time - how do we change that?
There's definitely something wrong with young men."
In the interview, it is also said that he doesn't want to do a four or a story of Game of Thrones when the series comes to an end next summer, and says that he has enough of "fight fields and horses".
From November to November, the kit is worth seeing in a revival of Sam Shepard's True West, a story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor has said that the details of his wife Rose find the best thing that came from Game of Thrones.
"I have met my wife in this series, so in that sense they have become my future family, and my life from now on," he said.
In the Emmy-winning fantasy series, Rose played the Ygrid, the lover of the kit's character Jon Snow.
The couple married in June 2018 on instructions from the family of Leslie in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China announces 14% of new cases
China has announced that the number of citizens living with HIV or AIDS has reached 14%.
Health experts say that more than 820,000 people are affected in the country.
The 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
The majority of the new cases were transmitted through sexual contacts, which marks a difference.
Traditionally, HIV quickly spread through various parts of China through infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people infected with HIV that way would have reduced to almost zero, as the Chinese health experts said at a conference in Yunnan province.
From one year to the next, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is widespread.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men end up marrying women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases come from inadequate protection in their relationships.
Since 2003, China has promised universal access to HIV medicine as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters argues that Matoarbechter leaked data from GOP senators, talking about "dangerous lies" and "distortion theories"
U.S. Republican Maxine Waters has denounced the same rumors, according to which a member of this House of Representatives had published personal information from three Republican U.S. senators on the legislatures here on Wikipedia page.
The Democrat from Los Angeles insisted that the claims of "extremely right" figures and websites were celebrated.
"Legends, leagues and even more disgusting leagues," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
Among the published information was apparently also private addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsay Graham from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information has surfaced online, uploaded by an anonymous person on Capitol Hill during a Senate hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The three senators asked Kavanaugh.
Conservative sides such as Gateway Pundit and RedState have reported that the IP address, which identifies the source of the perimeter line, had a line to the Water's office, and they have released information about a member of the Water's Matuarchs, according to the lawmakers to The Hill.
"These unfounded claims are completely false and an absolute lie," says the Waters.
"The member of my partner's – to whom his identity, personal information, and security and risk are the result of the dishonest and false claims – has absolutely nothing to do with leaking this information.
This kind of self-righteousness is completely false and absolutely false."
Waters' statements quickly found criticism online, as did the former White House press spokesman, Ari Fleischer.
"It's a mess," the writer wrote.
"It suggests that she doesn't have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
If someone is accused of having something that they didn't eat, then they shouldn't be roses.
You don't have to defy it.
You don't have to ask the friends of the one who's complaining and asking questions.
There has to be a calmness and a calmness."
De Fleischer has manifested himself to compare Waters' reaction to the criticism of the Democrats by Judge Kavanaugh, who had been accused by critics of rosing during the secession to be the darkest.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is worth fighting against the water and the waves, also posted his opinion on Twitter.
"Greetings," he said.
In this statement, Water said that this agency "has informed the appropriate authorities and the responsible authorities of the application of the law about these false claims."
"We are confident that the blame will come to the sound of the day," she continued, "and that they will be held accountable for here actions that are destructive and dangerous to everyone in every memo of my office."
Johnny English Strikes Again Criticism – Little Intoxicating Rowan Atkinson Parody
There has been a tradition to look for Brexit releases now in all new British films, which in the revival of the Johnny English action comedy-parody franchise does not work properly. This started in 2003 and was re-launched in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Is this ironic self-sacrifice that clearly represents us as a stupid, this nation's export opportunity?
No matter what, the gloomy and incompetent Johnny English with a plastic face has his letter for a second time to flush everything – the name of him already says enough, and although that is a wide-ranging comedy cry that is meant for non-English-language cinemagoers on other territories.
He is, of course, a stupid secret agent who, although he has a funny talk for idiots-glamour, has a bit of Clouseau, a stroke of Mr Bean, and a knock of that type, who has a single note on the "Chariots of Fire" lead at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games in London.
He is also actually based on the traveler and international man of the mysterious, who once played Atkinson in the long-forgotten Barclaycart television riots, and who left chaos everywhere.
There are one or two good moments in the current Johnny English movie.
I was thrilled by the scene where Johnny English arrives at a helicopter, wearing a medieval armor, while the rotating helicopter leaves briefly flapping against his helmet.
Atkinson's Don for Physical Comedy is to be seen, but the humor feels "understated" and comically superfluous, especially wanting to offer the "serious" movie brands like 007 and Mission Impossible even now with more convincing comedy as an ingredient.
The humor feels like it was meant for children and not for adults, and for me, Johnny English's stupid misadventures just aren't as original and focused as Atkinson's daf-stumm sketcher in the person of the bean.
The current state of affairs is that the United Kingdom is facing serious difficulties.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated the super-secret Internet network of spies in Britain, revealing the identities of all agents in the Azatz – unfortunately a small role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the tedious drops that make the barrel stand out for the Prime Minister, a pompous and combative figure who already has a total breakdown of political discontent: Emma Thompson makes her best with this quasi Theresa May character, but there's not much in the script there could do with that one.
Here, they inform secretaries, each individual spy and danger is that they must return one from the retirement.
And that means the murmuring Johnny English in person, now employed as a school director by a distinguished establishment, who gives secret courses like one becomes a spy: some lovely jokers here, English wants to set up an Art School of Rock-sized spy school.
English has been returned to Whitehall for a brief briefing in Urgence and reunited with his old co-star Sidekick Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
The Bough is now married, with a submarine commander, a sober role in which the Vicki Pepperdine is a little wasted.
Thus, Batman and Robin, who are all wrong in the name of the majesty of this secret service, are back in action and make the acquaintance of Olga Kurylenko's wife Fatale, Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is ousting a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he could solve Britain's computer problems: the gloomy Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
The English and the Bough begin odyssey of farce-exchange maneuvers here: dressed as waiters, they set up a French restaurant and flames; they care for chaos on the verge of Volta's luxury yacht; and the English leaves behind some anarchy as they attempt to establish a virtual reality headset to familiarise themselves with the house of Volta.
All of the kits are certainly taken out for the last sequence, but as friendly and burschikos everything is, there's already something of children's television in the big.
It's quite a mid-range.
And how about the other Johnny English films I couldn't relate to: can the British film industry not give Rowan Atkinson a role that is fair to his talent?
Labour denies that they are developing a plan for Britain to pay off a four-day week, which will be paid for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a radical plan in which the British work four days a week, but are paid for five days.
The party seems to want the heads of companies to return the resources they have gained through the revolution of artificial intelligence to the worker through an extra-free day.
This would mean that employees would have a three-day weekend - but the same is true.
Sources say that the idea would align with the parties here's economic agenda and would also include plans to list the country and the employer's preferences.
Moving on to a four-day craft week is supported by the Trades Union Congress, as a way for workers to become the beneficiaries of the changing economy.
A senior source from the Labour Party told the Sunday Times: "A review of politics is expected to be announced by the end of the year.
It's not worth it overnight, but a four-day week of work is an aspiration to rebalance with the party's approach, the economy and faveur of the employee, and the party's overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party was not the first to put itself behind such an idea, which Green had already spoken out in the 2017 election campaign for a four-day week.
However, this is not currently supported by the entire Labour Party.
A Labour party spokesman said: "A four-day week is not a general party policy and it is not decided by the party."
Treasurer John McDonnell used the Labour conference of last week to celebrate his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said that he was determined to reclaim the power of "faceless dictators" and "profits" of distressed companies.
The treasurer also plans that current shareholders and water companies could not attract investors here, if a Labour government could claim certain "deductions" on the basis of false practices.
He also confirmed plans that four-year-olds should be placed in the fourth tier of companies and the so-called "Inclusive Ownership" fund should yield 10% of the profits of private sector companies to employees, who could then receive annual dividends of up to 500 pounds.
Lindsay Graham, who told John Kennedy "60 Minutes" whether Kavanaugh's investigation could change opinions here
The FBI investigation into allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a low vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court at least about a week, which raises the question of whether the Bureau (FBI)'s findings could convince Republican senators to give their support.
In an interview with a Sunday morning, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could find out anything new that would encourage them to change their minds here.
Kennedy was more active than his South Carolina counterpart.
"Of course," Kennedy said.
"As I entered the audience, I said that I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called out after this happened, this statement came out, and really said, "Did you get that?"
He was determined, determined, and determined."
But Graham's words are written in stone.
"My opinion about Brett Kavanaugh is firmly established and there has already been a particularly tough announcement to change those," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know the following: The board fought it vehemently," Graham said in the context of Christine Blasey Ford.
"Everyone who calls them can't get anything.
It's 36 years here.
I don't see anything that could change the situation."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and what does it mean to reduce poverty?
These gatherings are worth taking place in New York again at the Global Citizen Festival, an annual museum event that has an immensely impressive line-up of stars who have performed, but have an equally impressive mission: to end poverty all over the world.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival is worth attracting thousands of people to Central Park's "Great Lawn," not only to see such museum acts as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to attract people to the real goal of the event, i.e. to highlight the end of extremes in 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which was launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international NGO that fights poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting against it.
To get a free ticket (unless you want to buy a VIP ticket), people who attend the concert have to perform a series of tasks, or "actions", such as volunteering, writing an email to a leader in the world, calling for one or other tasks that help the goal of ending poverty.
But how many successful global citizens, with only 12 years left to achieve their goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert, an honest way for people to demand that they become active or once again a further case of “clicktivism” – people who crowd them would make a real change by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Global Citizen says that since 2011, they have registered more than 11 million "actions" from these supporters, which are aligned on different goals.
They say the actions have helped them bring global leaders to the news that they are announcing engagements and releasing policies of more than $37 billion, which more than 2.25 billion people value by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group cited 390 engagements and reports coming from these actions, of which at least $10 billion have already been distributed or collected.
The group estimates that the collected money has so far had an impact on nearly 649 million people in the world.
One of the main engagements is, among others, The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and employees committed to "helping the children achieve their full potential," and promise – after they have received more than 4700 tweets from Global Citizen – to give Rwanda $35 million to the global citizen.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can face social injustice from malnutrition at a foothold in history," said Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman to the audience of the live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that more than 5,000 actions in the UK have been addressed to improve nutrition for mothers and children, and that the government has announced the financial support of a project, The Power of Nutrition, which is worth more than 5 million women and children with nutritional support.
In response to an FAQ on the website, which asks "Why do you think you can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen responded: "It's worth a long and hard way - sometimes I fall and fail.
However, as all major civil rights and anti-apartheid movements in front of us, we value success, we want to be stronger together."
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are just a few of the artists who will be performing in New York this year, with Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman as moderators.
U.S. could use a Navy blockade to curb Russian energy exports – Interior Minister
Washington said "if necessary" they would deploy Navy here to stop Russian energy from coming to the Marches, including in the Middle East, as U.S. Interior Minister Ryan Zinke told reporters.
Zinke asserts that Russia's involvement in Syria - where they operate on the invitation to the legitimate government - would be all but a pretext for exploring new energy marques.
"I believe that they want to be in the Middle East, just like in Eastern Europe and there in southern Europe, want to mediate energy," he said.
And if anyone can believe him, there is always a way to go about it.
"The American states of America have the opportunity to go safely with our Navy that sea routes are on, and, if necessary, to block to go safely that energy is not coming to the market here," he said.
Zinke addressed the participants of the event, organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance – an American NGO that sees itself as "the voice of the energy consumer."
He compared the appropriations of Washington vis-<0xC3><0xA0>-vis Russia and Iran and noted that they are in the end the same.
"The economic options for Iran and Russia are turning, more or less, to exert pressure and replenish fuel," he said, while in context, Russia is viewed as an economy totally dependent on fossil energy.
The claim comes while the Trump administration is on a mission to increase exports of natural liquid gas to Europe, to re-produce Russia, which is a significantly more blatant option for the European consumer.
To this effect, employees of the Trump administration, and the Trump himself, try to convince Germany of this to step out of the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which – if anyone listens to Trump – would be Berlin to capture Moscow.
Moscow has often claimed that the 11-billion-dollar Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is expected to double the current pipeline capacity of 110 billion cubic meters, is a few economic projects.
The Kremlin claims that the vehement opposition to the Washington project is simply driven by economic reasons and that this would be an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the belief that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that it should be possible for the consumer to decide on these providers," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said in a meeting with U.S. Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. government has repeatedly criticized Germany, which has once again rehabilitated its asath for the project.
The Danish main organization for industry, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on America to stay out of EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state is involved in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren is worth "checking out" if she will be a presidential candidate for 2020, Massachusetts Senator said.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren told Samsteen that she would "look good" if she went to the race for the presidency after the midterms.
At a meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, the wardens confirmed that they had decided to contest.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and patch our footy government and that means a woman at the top," she said, according to The Hill.
"On the 6th of November, I'd like to see if I'm going to run for president."
The warden criticized President Donald Trump during the event, saying that "the country would lead to a wrong direction."
"I'm worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
So far, the war has been open with criticism of Trump in his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet, the Freedmen said, "Of course, we need an FBI investigation before we get elected."
A study has come out to show that Warren's own voters do not want them to step down in 2020.
According to a survey by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe, eight-quarters of "probable" Massachusetts voters believe they should not step down.
Twenty-two percent found it to be a good idea.
The study showed that there is more support for the governor of vidrun, Deval Patrick, with eighty-eight percent who are therefore stepping up and eighty-four percent who are opposed.
Other Democratic nominees of high profile mentioned in the context of the 2020 presidential election are former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator from Vermont, Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide to move forward until January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentions the track Palin's PTSD at a Donald Trump event
The track Palin, 26, was a year in Iraq after signing up in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
"What my boss is going through, what's going through since he's back home, I can sympathize with other families struggling with PTSD ramifications, and with the injuries that our soldiers are coming back with," she told an audience at an event for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his name "the elephant in the room" and said that her son and other veterans "are coming back a little differently, they are more heartbroken, they come back and wonder if there is respect for what the other soldiers and pilots, and every other member of the military, have joined."
He was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic bodily injury against a woman, and that together in the report on general domestic violence and the possession of a gun in an alcoholic state, according to Dan Bennett, spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C., support the Defiance of New Asylum Policy
Ten states in the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that prohibits victims of gang violence or domestic violence asylum.
Representatives from 18 states and the district have filed a memoir "amicus curiae" ("ami de la cour") in Washington to support asylum seekers and challenge politics, according to NBC News.
The entire name of the requerant in the Grace vs. Sessions Klo, which the American Civil Liberties Union filed against federal politics in August, has not been publicized.
She said her partner "and his violent builds, which are gang-brained," would have mistreated them, but U.S. officials here had denied requests for asylum on July 20.
She is based in Texas.
The states here describe lawyers who support the Grace, El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of demands for U.S. asylum come, as nations that constantly have problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy has amended a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals, which has given undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence the opportunity to apply for asylum.
Karl Racine, avocat general of the District of Columbia, said Friday in a statement that the new policy "would ignore state law, federal law, and international law."
"State law requires all asylum seekers to be addressed the facts and circumstances of the request, and such a court goes against the principle," says the "ami de la cour".
Affectors continue to argue in the Mémoire that policies would not allow immigrants to enter what would harm the U.S. economy, they would probably want to become entrepreneurs, and a "major offer of workers."
Avocat General Jeff Sessions, in June, called for judges to give up their asylum to victims who want to escape domestic violence and gang violence.
"Asyl is possible for those who leave their country because of persuasion or fear based on their race, religion, nationality or wish to be members of a particular social group or political opinion," the sessions said in a statement.
Asylum was never meant to solve all the problems – even all the serious problems – that people have to deal with all over the world every day.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu while the number of dead is doubled compared to the survivors
For the sake of survival, the situation has become more and more predictable.
"It feels all right," said the 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, while trying to calm down her small, fiery bee in the evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute an ambulance arrives.
There's hardly any water."
People were seen returning to homes destroyed here by looking through nested properties to save no matter what.
Hundreds of people were injured and the hospitals, damaged by the earthquake of 7.5 on the judge's scale, were overpowered.
Some of the injured, including the Dwi Haris, who has a broken back and shoulders, have been outside the Palu's Army Hospital, where patients were carried outside due to the persistent novices.
As reported by the feeling, when it was on the 5th floor in the hotel room, which shared a brutal earthquake with his wife and his girl, he got tears in his eyes.
"There was no time to save us.
I've been bullied into the ruins of the walls, I'm crowding," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I've heard my wife say something, but it's been quiet.
I don't know what's going on here or my child.
I hope they are safe."
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of “bullying” with “propaganda crackdown”
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement that praised the benefices of mutual U.S.-China trade, in a U.S. daily newspaper, the U.S. Ambassador to China Beijing accused Beijing of using the U.S. press for propaganda purposes.
U.S. President Donald Trump has made the latest announcement to China's paid advertising in the Des Moines Register - Iowa State's best-selling newspaper - after a China indictment has accused China of trying to get involved in the November 6 congressional elections, which China is contesting.
Trump's accusation that Beijing would try to interfere in U.S. elections is a new phase of Washington's escalation campaign to pressure China, according to a U.S. official.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to publish advertisements for commerce, Beijing and Washington are in a de-escalating trade war, which has led to higher tariffs being charged on the other's imports.
China's retaliatory tariffs at the beginning of the trade war were intended to meet exporters of states such as Iowa - which support Trump's Republican Party - such as Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former long-time governor of Iowa – an important export state of agriculture to China – says Beijing wants American workers, farmers and businesses to be like that.
China, as Branstad wrote in an article in Sunday's Des Moines Register, "is now adding a few more ships to it, by now switching propaganda slogans into our free press."
Through the spread of propaganda, the government of China opposes the long and lenient tradition of freedom of speech in the free press by placing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register," the Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, on the newspaper stand down on the street of Beijing, one finds little opposition votes and does not value finding a proper reflection of various opinions that the Chinese could have against the economic development of their country, the media wants to be controlled by the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He also said that "None of the most famous Chinese newspapers want to print their article," while not knowing how to print it.
The Republicans are eloping from women's voters in front of debacle in Kavanaugh, warning analysts
While many top-ranking Republicans behind the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh stand and defend against various allegations of sexual violence, analysts have warned of a backlash in the interim, especially by women.
The emotions around this subject were extremely high and most Republicans said they would like to go ahead with voting.
"These things cannot be rolled back," said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, who spoke to The Hill for an article that published a probe.
The owner said that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s last-minute pressure for an FBI investigation was only worth bringing with him rose voters.
"Women don't value forgetting what happened yesterday - they don't forget it tomorrow and not even in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a high-ranking consultant and national porte parole for the progressive group MoveOn, the friars, when one can believe a Washington D.C. newspaper.
The Free Democracies chanted protesters as they walked off the Senate floor, "November is coming!", while the Republicans, who control the Judiciary Committee, decided to proceed with Kavanaugh's nomination, despite the statement of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, according to a Mic report.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are extremely important," said Stu Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst.
"The people said it was already high; that's true.
But it could go even higher, especially among so-called female "swing voters", and the fourth and young voters, 18-29-year-olds who - although they don't like the president - often don't want to.
Even before Ford's public testimony, in which they submit a detailed description of the sexual assault against Supreme Court nominees, analysts suggest that it could be reversed if Republicans continue to ratify.
"This is a conundrum for the GOP," said Micheal Steele, former Republican four-year-old from the National Committee, starting a bad week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just the committee vote or the last vote or whether the Kavanaugh judge will be elected, it's also a question of how the Republicans handled the whole thing and how they treated them," said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps Democrats be elected, a television broadcaster.
But Americans seem to be somewhat divisive about what they should believe from Ford's and Kavanaugh's statements, although there is a tendency to believe the slander more.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or perhaps believe Ford's statement, while 35 percent say they definitely believe Kavanaugh.
A plus, 38 percent say they believed that Kavanaugh probably or definitely won during his statement, while only 30 percent said the same about the Ford.
According to Flake, the FBI is now investigating the allegations of Ford and, at least, another prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, as The Guardian wrote.
The Ford said last week before the Judiciary Committee of the Senate under oath that Kavanaugh had abused them in the drunken state at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court has exposed nominees at a party's genitals.
The World Wide Web is planning a new Internet to attack Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, has started a startup that is supposed to be a competitor of Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The technology legend's last project, Inrupt, is a company built on Berners-Lee's open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to decide where data is stored and who has access to water information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee laughed that his intention behind Inrupt was "the world domination."
"We've got to do it now," said the start-up.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid's technology to enable people to record their own "personal online data stores" or a POD.
It can bring together contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, museum library and other personal and professional instruments.
It's like when Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all appear together on a browser, and that's ongoing.
What is unique about "personal online data stores" is that it is completely dependent on the user, who can have access to what information.
The company calls it "personal emancipation through data."
The idea for Inrupt, such as the company's CEO John Bruce, is to bring resources, earn qualifications, and appropriate themselves to be so solidly accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of the Berners-Lee, the Bruce, a security platform acquired by IBM, some computer owners who work as developers on the project in a community of volunteer coders.
From that week on, technology developers around the world could create their own decentralized app here with the tools that can be found on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team don't talk to Facebook or Google, whether they or they shouldn't make a complete change, where all of these business models are turned on overnight.
"We're not asking permission here."
In a post published on Medium, Samsteen, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission is to deliver commercial energy and an eco-system, which is worth protecting the integrity and quality of the new web on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet as the World Wide Web Consortium established at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the last few months, Berners-Lee was an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Although an inruption has been established, Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm extremely optimistic about the new era of the web," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: World War I passports celebrated with "Victoria cross"
The only clergy from the Church of England who ever received a Victoria cross during World War I as a fighter was celebrated in his hometown after 100 years.
Lt Col The Reverend Bernard Vann was awarded the Order on 29 September 1918 in the attack in Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But he was admitted by a sniper four days ago and never admitted that he was awarded the highest British military honor.
A commemorative stone was unveiled a sample of his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "genially symbolic" that the stone was revealed exactly 100 years after the action of his bop, which he had taken the medal.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lt Col Vann launched his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through thick nebula and under attack in the field and by machine guns."
He later ran to the infantry line and rejoined the battalion, before taking a field weapon with one hand and enlisting three of the military unit.
Lt Col Vann was brought up on 4 October 1918 by a German sniper – just over a month before the war was over.
Michael Vann, 72, said that going through the actions of his grandfather "could not be justified but it would be a deplorable experience."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also took a wreath after the parade, on which the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band was based.
Michael Vann said that he "felt very honored to be a part of the parade" and also said that "the courage of a real hero is demonstrated by the support of many people."
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch the Bellator 206 and instead got Peppa Pig
Imagine: You stayed up all night to watch a packaged Bellator 206, only to get the kicks of the main series then refused.
There were 13 fights from San Jose, including six on the main map and they were shown live on Channel 5 throughout the night in the United Kingdom.
At 6 o'clock in the morning, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to compete against each other, viewers in the United Kingdom were stunned when the coverage was switched to Peppa Pig.
Some were undefeated, having remained vigilant for the fight until the early moestons.
One fan described the switch to the children's cartoon on Twitter as "a kind of sick joke."
"It's a government proposal that at 6 a.m. that content wasn't appropriate, so they had to switch to a children's program," said David Schwartz, senior vice president of Bellator for marketing and communication, as he was talking about the transfer.
"Peppa the pig, Jo."
Bellator Scott Coker's company president said they would like to revise their appointments to include viewers from the United Kingdom in the future.
"I think when I think about the replay, I think we can probably do it," said the coker.
"But it's 6:00 a.m. Sunday there and we're not able to keep up with this until Sunday, most of our time.
But we're going to get on it.
Believe me, when it was turned around, many messages were sent in here, and they were not all friendly.
We tried to do this, we thought it was a technical disorder.
But it wasn't, it was a real problem.
I can assure you, it won't happen again.
We reduce the fight to 5 instead of 6 – as we always do – and we have tried to deliver the fans more, but we have blocked it.
It's a sad situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley has been "satisfied" with sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley said he had grown up feeling like he was being disrespectful to everyone because of his sexuality – but that gave him the motivation to become successful.
The 24-year-old said he hadn't realized until he came to the secondary that "not everyone like me is."
In conversation with the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs, presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he had talked about the gay rights to give others "hope."
He also said that becoming a parent led to him becoming less involved in winning the Olympics.
The regular presenter of the long-running show, Kirsty Young, has taken a break from a few months due to a disease.
When she appeared as an outcast in the first program of Laverne, Daley said that he felt that when he grew up, he "would be less" than anyone else, because "socially, it was not accepted to love boys and girls".
He said, "To this day, the feelings of being less and feeling different, the only things that have given us the power and endurance to be successful."
He wanted to prove that he was "worth something," he said, so that he would not disappoint anyone if they eventually found out his sexual preferences.
The two-time bronze winner at the Olympic Games is one of the most famous LGBT advocates and he has used his performance at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year to call for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he was talking about it because he felt happy, able to be open and without consequences to live and want to do other "hope."
The three-time world champion said that to leave a man – the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he learned in 2013 – was “surprised”.
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older, last year, but he said the age difference was never a problem.
"If someone so young, so much through" - he took part in his first Olympics at the age of 1 year and his father died three years later on cancer - he said it was difficult to find someone as old as he had gone through the same heights and depths.
The couple became the parents of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley in June, and Daley said his "whole perspective" had changed.
"If you asked me last year, everything was going to be about 'I need to win a gold medal'," he said.
"You know what, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
"My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His wife is the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40.
Daley said his father did not accept that he would die and one of the last things he asked was whether they already had their tickets for London 2012 – because he wanted to sit in the first row.
"I couldn't say to him, 'You're not here to sit in the first row,'" he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped with ootmen and it was only when he stopped with ootmen and was dead that I finally admitted that he was not invisible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympic Games and won bronze.
"I only knew that it was the one I dreamed of my whole life - diving at home in front of a crowd of people at the Olympics, there is no better feeling," he said.
This also inspired the choice of his first song – the pride of Heather Small – that he played in the background, as he prepared for the Olympic games and still caused a hangover with him.
Desert Island Discs will air on BBC Radio 4 at 11:15 a.m.
Mickelson at the Ryder Cup on the bench
American Phil Mickelson sets a record Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he has to regain his form to avoid an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who plays for a 12th record at the event, which takes place every 2 years, was sent to the bench by Captain Jim Furyk for four-balls and four-sevenths.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as he has done so often for the United States, the five-fold main winner of his day spent playing cheerleaders and working on the ranks at his game, hoping to improve what he plots.
Not even at the peak of his career, he was the fastest driver, and therefore the 48-year-old player is not the ideal cast for the narrow bottoms of Le Golf National, where the long rough routinely felt shot was stolen.
And if the ties to themselves aren't daunting enough, in the ninth game, Mickelson meets a Sunday at the British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who joins the starting Tommy Fleetwood to form a team to win all four of their matches this week.
When the Americans start with four points back, the 12 individual players have a difficult start, then the match of Mickelson could prove to be absolutely important.
He told his wife that he had no faith in him, and that he could not do anything else.
"He fully understood his role for today, knocked me on the back, put his arm around me and said that he was ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has a strong self-confidence.
He is on the roster and he has contributed so much to these teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn't think he would play two games.
I thought it would work, but that's how it worked, and how we thought we'd have to do it.
He wants to be like everyone else out there."
Mickelson broke a Sunday's record for Nick Faldo's most played Ryder Cup match.
It could be the end of a Ryder Cup career that never really reached the highlights of his personal record.
Mickelson had 18 victories, 20 lost players and seven halves, but Furyk said his presence brought the team far more tangible benefits.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's lazy, he loves other funny people and he's a wonderful man who loves someone in the team room," he explained.
"I think the younger players had fun as they were going along with him, and also this week, which was fun watching.
He's more than just playing."
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a major advance can quickly disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knew from experience that a fairly large lead for the singles of the last day in the Ryder Cup could change very quickly and an uncomfortable ride.
The Dane made his debut in the 1997 game in Valderrama, where a side with Captain Seve Ballesteros had a lead of five points over the Americans, but it won just yet around the nose length with 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2:131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"You always remember that we had a big lead in Valderrama; we had a big lead in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but also just barely," said Bjorn, squandered, after he saw the class of 2018 both a freestyle and yesterday with 5:3 win for the national team.
The story will show me and everyone in this team that this is not over yet.
Give it all tomorrow.
Go out there and do everything right.
This isn't over until you see points on the bridge.
We have a goal and that is to try to win this trophy, and we need to continue to focus on that.
I've said it all the time, I'm focusing on the 12 players that are on our side, but we're also aware of what's on the other side - the best players in the world."
When he got to the top of the golf course he said, "I'm never going to be in the first place.
Tomorrow, we'll have another one in front of us.
It's one of those things that will come out tomorrow, and that's another.
It's great to be out with a partner when things are running well, but if one is out alone, then one is tested as a golfer to the blood.
That's the message the player needs to convey: get your hands on tomorrow.
Now let your partner go back and he has to go his way and be his best."
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent, Jim Furyk, wants his players to beat each other better than they did as a partner, the exception being Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who took three out of four points.
Furyk himself knows both sides of those big turns because he was part of the winning team in Brookline before they went on to lose the place because Europe played out the "wonder of Medinah."
"I remember every damn word of it," he said in response to the question, as Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, gathered his games before the last day.
"We have 12 major games tomorrow, but you'd like to celebrate the quick start you've seen in Brookline, which you've seen in Medinah.
When the pendulum swings in one direction, then a lot of pressure exerts on the middle players.
"We've made a lot of progress and we've made people feel like we're going to be able to do it tomorrow."
Thomas was given the task of trying to tackle the problems and is facing Rory McIlroy in the main game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans at the other half of the line-up.
"I've decided to do this because I think it covers everything," Bjorn said about his unique choices.
Germany's new warship has been re-launched
The latest frigate of the German Navy was commissioned in 2014 to replace the aging warships from the time of the Cold War, but it is, according to local media, due to terrible systems and ever-greater costs not completed before at least next year.
The order of the "Rhineland Palatinate," the main ship of the frigate class Baden Württemberg has now been delayed, according to the newspaper "Die Zeit", which quotes a military spokesman, until the first half of 2019.
The ship was scheduled to sail the Navy in 2014, but the troubling problems after the delivery saw the fate of the ambitious project at home.
The four ships of the Baden-Württemberg class, which the Navy had already ordered in 2007, were thought to be the replacement of the aging frigates of the Bremen class.
They have a powerful gun, a jet of aircraft and naval missiles, as well as camouflage technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and battery-powered signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods – it should be possible that the newest frigates do not leave the home sea for up to two years.
But the constant delays for the innovative warships – which are supposed to prove to Germany its strength and superiority – mean that they are already outdated before they reach the service at all, noting "Time".
The F125 frigate, which was followed by the accident, made headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and sent it back to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had sent a ship back to a shipbuilder after delivery.
About the friends of the return was little known, but the German media called a number of critical "software and hardware defects" through which the ship would have rendered useless in a combat mission.
The software shortages were particularly important, as the ships of the Baden-Württemberg-class were operated by a team of almost 120 sailors – just about half of the staff of the old frigate of the Bremen-class.
It also turned out that the ship has too much weight, reducing its performance and increasing the ability of the Navy to make future improvements.
The 7,000 ton heavy "Rhineland Palatinate" is said to be twice as heavy as ships of a similar class, which German entered in World War II.
In addition to the sad hardware, the price tag of the entire project – including the training of the team – also becomes a problem.
It is estimated that an already amazing €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) has reached – from the original €2.2 billion.
The problems with the latest frigates are mainly due to recent warnings that the German naval force is leaving behind.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, admitted that the Navy "issuing the accessible vessels."
The officials said that the problem has worsened over time, because old ships were stolen, but no new ships were prepared.
He stated that none of the frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class were able to join the Navy.
The National Trust listens to the secret life of bats
A new research, which has been launched on a plot in the Scottish Highlands, aims to reveal how Flanders use the landscape on their hunt for food.
It is hoped that the results will bring a new light to the stories of the unique flight mammals and will help to develop guidelines for future protective activities.
The study is conducted by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland and is usually followed by soft-flavoured maize, but also brown-flavoured Laangour and Daubenton-Flantermais in Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders are placed on important locations around the ground floor to monitor the bat activities throughout the season.
The NHS staff and volunteers also perform mobile recording with the help of hand detectors.
Based on expert analysis of all records, determine the frequency of bat crushes and what kind of thing does.
A map and a report of the habitat are produced there to create a detailed picture of their behavior on a landscape scale.
Rob Dewar, advisor for nature conservation for NTS, hopes that the results will reveal how an area of habitat for the bat is most important and how they are used by everyone.
This information helps to determine the benefits of living space management work, as well as, for example, the creation of wisdom and how forest pastures for bats and other similar species are best managed.
The population of the bat has declined significantly in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom in the last century.
They are driven by buildings and development work that affect sleeping places and a loss of living space.
Wandriders and lightning can also pose a risk, just like plasticized and chemical treatments of building materials, but also impact of house cheeses.
The bats aren't really white.
But because of their nighttime youths, their ears are more useful than their eyes, when it comes to the traps of predators.
They use a highly developed echolocation technique to eliminate insects and obstacles on their way to flight.
The NTS, which is responsible for the flight of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important yards and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes the bat very seriously.
They have ten trained experts who regularly perform recordings, sleep placement inspections, and heinous rescues.
The organization even established Scotland's first and only designated bat sanctuary in Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, which provides a living space for eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
David Thompson says that the plot is the ideal landscape for them.
"We have a wonderful area for bats in Threave," he said.
"We have the old buildings, the old trees and the wonderful living space.
But there are many things we still don't know about bats; here the work we do here and on other foundations helps us better understand what they need to be able to unfold."
He preferred the importance of looking for bats before carrying out maintenance on land plots, as an unwitting destruction of a single uplift room can kill up to 400 females and young bats, potentially eliminating a very local population.
They are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass, or disrupt them or destroy their habitat.
Elizabeth Ferrell, the Scottish responsible for the Bat Conservation Trust, called on the public to step in to help.
She said, "We still have to learn a lot about bats and for many of our species we just don't know how it affects their populations."
Ronaldo fights rape allegations and his lawyers want to explain to the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the rape charge against him a "false report" by saying that people "want to make themselves known" by using his name.
His lawyers want to explain the German news magazine "Der Spiegel" which published the wrong claims.
Portugal and Juventus were accused of raping an American named Kathryn Mayorga in 2009 in a hotel room in Las Vegas.
It is claimed that he would have paid $375,000 to not bring the incident to the public, the "The Mirror" reported a frivolous.
When he was hours after reporting on the charges, in an Instagram live video he spoke to his 142 million followers, Ronaldo, 33, denied the reports as "false reports."
"No, no, no, no, no, no.
What they say today is false reports," said the five-time winner of the Ballon d'Or and the camera.
"She wanted to advertise herself by using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be known by calling my name, but that's part of the job.
"I'm a very good and happy man," the player added with a laugh.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to explain the "mirror" to the false accusations they call "unacceptable reporting of suspicions in the private sphere," according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Schertz said that the player wants to demand a decision for "moral arbitration with a sum equal to the sword of offense, which will be one of the most severe violations of personal rights in recent years."
The incident was reported to have occurred in June 2009 in a suite of Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After a meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly returned to the room of the player where he had, according to documents from the files of Clark County District Court in Nevada allegedly raped anal.
Mayorga claims Ronaldo had fallen to the knee after the alleged incident and had told him that he was "99 percent" a "good guy" apart from that "one percent".
The documents claimed Ronaldo had confirmed that the two had had had sex, but that it had taken place with mutual consent.
Mayorga also claimed that he had gone to the police, and that he had photos of his injuries being shot in the hospital, but had later agreed to resolve the case <0xC3><0xA0> l'amiable, because he had "great fear of retaliation" and was afraid of being "disappointed publicly."
The 34-year-old woman said she would now try to lift the unit because she was still traumatized by the incident.
Ronaldo was to switch from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged transfer and this summer he was traded with a 100-million deal at the Italian Juve.
Brexit: The United Kingdom 'would like it to be forever' to lose the automakers
The United Kingdom "will forever enrich it" if it loses its status as a world-leading carmaker, said Minister of Economic Affairs Greg Clark.
He added that "disturbing" would be that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, they would temporarily suspend production in their factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said that the effects of delays on the border in the case of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
The factory in Burnaston – where the Toyota Auris and Avensis are produced – produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if Britain falls out of the EU, production in our factory will be stopped," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's Managing Director at Burnaston.
Other car manufacturers from the United Kingdom have also voiced concerns about leaving the EU without agreement on how to operate cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says they are closing their mini factory in Oxford after Brexit for a month.
The main concerns hang together, which according to automaker supply chain risks are in the case of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line is run "completely synchronously", with parts arriving on order every 37 minutes from zoo suppliers both in the United Kingdom and from the EU for cars.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU on the 29th March without a deal, then there could be a break at the border, which, according to the industry, could lead to delays and tightness in parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep a stock of more than a day at the factory in Derbyshire, the company said, and as a result, production would stop.
Mr. Clark told Theresa May her Chequers pledge for future relations with the EU is "precisely calibrated to avoid the revisions to the border."
"We need a deal, we want the best deal that allows us, as I say, not only to enjoy the success now, but also to tackle this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"The statement not only from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers is that we need to be in a position to advance what was an extremely successful batch of supply chain."
Toyota was unable to say how long production would be stopped, but in the long run they warned that the additional costs would reduce the factory's competitiveness and ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who worked 24 years in Burnaston and is the union boss of Unite in the factory, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "From experience, I can say that if these jobs are lost, they will never return.
A government spokesman said: "We have drawn up a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
The meeting between Trump and Rosenstein will be postponed, according to the White House.
Donald Trump's meeting with Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein could "be postponed for a further week" because the fight for candidate Brett Kavanaugh is still under way for the Supreme Court, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of the Sun Rapist Robert Mueller, who, in the event of a possible involvement of the Russians in whales, is investigating connections between Trump supporters in Russia and a potential obstruction of justice by the President.
Whether Trump is the deputy justice minister out or not, and therefore putting Mueller's independence on the line, has long been the number one topic of conversation in Washington.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had spoken about being betrayed, to record talks with Trump, and about the possibility of dismissing the president over the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein rejected the report.
But last night he went to the White House and, according to reports, he was able to get there.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was at that time with the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would rather not "exterminate" Rosenstein, but you were denied the meeting, in order to avoid an overlap with the impeachment of the Senate's Justice Committee, in which Kavanaugh and one of the women, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of intimate sexual misconduct, have both ruled out.
Trump has called for an FBI investigation of a week of allegations against Kavanaugh, further delaying an entire Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
On the question about the Rosenstein meetings, she replied: "There has not yet been a date set for this, it could be this week, it could also be that I have to give it back a week later, with all the other things left at the Eastern Federal Court.
But I'm always on the lookout for that, and I'm always on the lookout for it."
Some reporters have questioned the claim: Sanders has not held a press briefing round of the White House since September 10.
The host Chris Wallace was asked.
Sanders believed that the lack of information was not caused by an aversion to television reporters who are out on "effect hacking," even though she admitted, "I don't dispute the fact that they are operating effect hacking."
She suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would be more likely.
"The president holds more R&D meetings than any president before him," she said, adding unprovenly: "We've looked at the numbers."
Information polls are still taking place, Sanders said, but "but if the press has the opportunity to ask the president directly, then it's definitely better than talking to me.
We're trying to do a lot and you've seen that we've done a lot in the last few weeks, and that replaces a press release in the future if you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open meetings or with speakers attending press conferences.
Press conferences alone are soulful.
In New York City this week, the president may have proved why, by hosting a labbing and sometimes bizarre appearance in front of the assembled reporters.
The Minister of Health calls on EU workers to join NHS Scotland for Brexit fears
The Minister of Health has written to the EU staff of Scottish NHS (State Health Service) to express the country's gratitude and wishes that it will also remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, Member of the Scottish Parliament, has sent a letter to the United Kingdom less than six months before the United Kingdom leaves the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed itself to the cost of accepting an application for a regulated status for EU citizens who work in its delegated public services.
In her letter, Mrs. Freeman wrote: "The summer over the negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU over the withdrawal are proceeding and it is heading towards expected decisions for this fall.
But the government of the United Kingdom has also increased its preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this has to be an exciting time for you.
That's why I now want to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of each member of staff, regardless of their nationality.
Members from all over the EU, and beyond, bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services, from which patients and the crowd that we care about benefit.
Scotland is truly your home and we really want you to stay."
The death of Christion Abercrombie
The linebacker of Tennessee State Tigers Christion Abercrombie had a no-stop operation following a head injury at the 31:27 defeat of the Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, the Mike Organ of the Tennesseas reported.
Tennessee State Rod Reed's head coach told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before half-time.
"He came to the sidelines and collapsed there," said Reed.
The trainers and the medical staff have sacrificed oxygen to the Abercrombie on the sidelines and placed him on a beer and brought him back for further evaluation.
An official from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had left the surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there is "no details about the nature/excess of the injury" and that Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the injury happened.
This is Abercrombie, a second-year college athlete, his first season at Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
He had a total of five tackles before he left the game, bringing his season to a total of 18 tackles.
Foreign buyers must pay higher stamp tax if they buy a land plot in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp costs if they buy a plot in the United Kingdom, while the additional tax is used under the Tory spell to help the homeless.
The move neutralizes the success of Corbyn's action to attract young voters
The tax collector will be the one who does not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
Finance Ministry experts expect them to climb to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year – to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp costs if they buy a land plot in the United Kingdom, while the additional tax is used under the Tory spell to help the homeless, Theresa May can join today.
The move is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's action, attracting young voters with promises, preparing more affordable housing, and aiming for well-earned ones.
The stamp tax hike is imposed on individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, while the additional money strengthens the government's fight against sleep on the street.
The additional tax – which is in addition to the current stamp tax, including the higher levels that two years ago were applied to two-hundred-seaters and coffee-for-reward homes – could amount to up to three percent.
The finance ministry experts expect the move to reach <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year.
An estimated 13 percent of newly built properties in London are bought by non-United Kingdom citizens, which drives prices into the air and makes it difficult for first-time buyers to fasten foothold in residential construction.
Many rich areas in the country – especially in the capital – have become "hospital" due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new guideline comes just weeks after Boris Johnson demanded a stamp tax to help younger people own their first home.
He has accused large construction companies of keeping land prices high, by buying land, but not using it, and he has urged Mme. May to give up quotas on eligible homes to maintain "housing" of Great Britain.
Mr. Corbyn has announced a striking crackdown on housing reform proposals, including Loyer controls and an end to forced evictions "without charge."
He also wants to give more power to build new homes.
Mme May said: "Last year I said that I would use my tenure as Prime Minister to revive the British dream - that life should be better for every new generation.
And that means repairing the dirt.
The UK is always open to people who want to live here, work and build a life.
It cannot be true that it is for people who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as for foreign companies, to buy housing as British citizens.
For too many people, the dream of home is too far away and the deprivation of sleep on the street remains too real."
Jack Ross: "My biggest ambition is to manage Scotland."
Sunderland's chief executive Jack Ross said his "great ambition" was to become manager of Scotland at some point.
Schott, 42, enjoys the challenge of reviving the North-East club, which is just in third place in League One, three points away from the top.
He joined the Stadium of Light this summer after returning St Mirren to the Scottish Premiership (1st League of Scotland) last season.
"I want to play for my country.
I got a B-cap and that was all," Ross told the Scottish BBC Sportssound.
"But I grew up watching a lot of players from Scotland as a child with my father in Hampden and that's something that always attracted me back.
"I'm just going to have a chance if I'm in the club."
Ross' predecessor as Sunderland manager included Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Alloa Athletic says he was not afraid to follow such established names at such a large club, while he previously diverted offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Successfully, I'm faced with the following question: 'Can I return this club to the Premier League?'
Due to the structure and equipment at this club, it belongs without a doubt to the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task to get there, but I would only consider myself successful if I could return to the club there."
Ross has only three years of experience as a manager, after a time as assistant chief in Dumbarton and 15 months with coaching staff of Hearts.
Then he helped Alloa to recover from the top of the league and turn St Mirren from the top candidate into the championship title winner in the following season.
Ross says he now feels more comfortable than ever during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It's probably a good idea," he recalls, as he was trying to get away with it.
"I really felt that the administration was right for me to play even more than playing.
It sounds weird, but I got hit well, was able to live well and enjoyed some good highlights.
But playing can make sense.
There are a lot of things that need to be done every week.
I still do this as a stress and pressure through the work, but the management just feels right.
I always wanted to manage and now that I'm doing it, it feels like the best thing I've done in my entire life as an adult."

The perfect time for a pint is, according to a study probe at 5:30 a.m.
The heat wave of the summer increased the receptions of British pubs fighting for survival, but increased the pressure on restaurant chains.
The pub and bar groups experienced an increase of 2.7 percent in July – but the receipts and restaurants returned 4.8 percent, as the figures show.
Peter Martin of the advisory firm CGA, which brought together the numbers, said: "Unsustainable sunshine and the longer than expected participation of England in the World Cup have resulted in July following a similar pattern as June, when the pubs had grown 2.8 percent more crowded, except that the pubs had a 2.8% increase in attendance.
The decline of 1.8% in the restoration in June continued to worsen in July.
The pubs and bars in which they are drunk were much more heavily cut off than the restaurants had abominable.
There are also people who eat and drink in the sun, although not as dramatic as the rest of the world.
It's like people just want to drink.
In all managed pubs and bars, the beverage sales went up by 6.6 percent in that month, with the food being three percent lower."
Paul Newman of the leisure and hospitality analyst RSM said: "The results continue the trend that we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and the effects of major social or sports events remain the most important factors when it comes to sales on the outside house market.
It's not surprising that restaurant groups continue to fight, but a sales gap of 4.8 percent per year is in addition to the persistent cost reduction, especially as.
The long extremely hot summer couldn't come a worse time for operators in the food industry and the time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we had in August, which so urgently expected, bring tempus."
In July, sales to all pubs and restaurants, including new releases, rose by 2.7 percent, reflecting the slowdown in brand releases.

One in five children has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents
One out of five children - part of whom is just 11 - has secret social media accounts, according to a survey, which they hide from their parents and schoolmasters
The survey of 20,000 school children from the secondary school district revealed a spike in "false insta" pages
The message prompted the fear that sexual content would be posted
Twenty percent of students said they had a "main account" that they showed to their parents
One out of five children – part of which is just 11 – create social media accounts that keep them secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed a rapid spike in "false insta" accounts - an application on Instagram's photo page.
The message prompted the fear that sexual content would be posted.
Twenty percent of students said they would run a restricted "main account" that they would show to their parents while also having a private one.
A mother who appeared on the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who called out to her, "rape me."
Research conducted by Digital Awareness UK in the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) of independent schools found that 40 percent of 11 to 18-year-olds had two profiles, half of which admitted to running private accounts.
HMC Mike Buchanan's songs said, "It's amazing that so many teenagers are trying to create online areas where parents and schoolmasters can't find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be "speakers of the athletes" on Scottish Athletics
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the annual General Assembly of the Board of Supervisors as a member of the Board of Supervisors and the Scottish Athletics Committee.
The Doyle is the most decorated light athlete in Scotland and the chairman Ian Beattie has seen the move as a significant opportunity for those who start the sport to benefit from their wide-ranging experience at the international level in the last decade.
"Eilidh enjoys immense respect in the light athletic community of all Scotland, the United Kingdom all over the world and we are sure that light athletics in Scotland would greatly benefit if we had to take the shot," says Beattie.
Doyle said, "I'm happy to act as a speaker for the athletes and I hope that I can really contribute and help to start the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200- and 400-meter race at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics and owns a total of 4 Olympic gold medals, and is now a regular BBC expert, can no longer go after he has a transitory ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "I've had a blast on a mountain.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said, only with time it turns out whether and to what degree I am taking.
It was hard work, but I fully recovered, learned to go again and today I am doing mobility exercises!

A company for milk pumps has reached the mothers online with an advertisement that compares nursing mothers with cows that are stung.
For the introduction of the so-called "first worldwide unobtrusive portable milk pump", the company for consumer technology Elvie has published a non-essential music video-inspired advertisement, in order to promote the freedom that mothers – who pump milk – enjoy with the new pump.
Four real moms dance in a hot filled coustall to a music that contains the following lyrics: "Yes, I strike myself, but you don't see a tail" and "For the case that you didn't notice it, these are not eagles, that are my bristles."
The chorus continues: "Pompel off, poppel off, I'm feeding my babies, poppel off, poppel off, I'm cleaning my ladies."
The report, which was published on the company's Facebook page, triggered a controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video sparked mixed reactions among viewers, many of whom said that it highlighted the "horror" of the dairy industry.
"It's a bad decision to use this product.
Just like we have to get pregnant and give birth to them to produce milk, except that their clothes are removed a few days after birth," one wrote.
The milk pump Elvie fits discreetly in the sweets (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: "Understanding traumatizing both for the mother as well as for the baby.
"But why don't they use them to promote a milk pump for mothers who provide their babies?"
Another said, "That's a good idea."
Others defended the crime, while a mother admitted that she had found the song "immensely strange."
"I think this is a great idea.
I would have bought one if I still had to.
I felt like a cow through the bushes.
It's a bit crazy, but I've figured it out exactly how it's supposed to be.
This is a great product," he wrote.
Another commented: "This is a fun advertising that relies on moms, who pump up (often at their work or the toilets) and feel like "Kee."
This is not an advertisement that the dairy industry praises or condemns."
At the end of the video, the women showed that they all danced with the discreet pompoms that were placed in their sutures.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the view that many women who pump up milk say they feel like cows.
However, Elvie's doll is very inconspicuous, has no draughts or slums and fits discreetly in a stuffed bag and asks women to move around, keep their babies and even go out during the pumping.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at "Mother" commented on this: "Elvie's poplar is a revolutionary product that has earned a powerful and provocative introduction.
By drawing a parallel, between pumping mothers and milk cows, we wanted to highlight the challenges of milk and the associated challenges and at the same time demonstrate in an entertaining and tangible way.
This isn't the first time Ellie's story has been published.
During London Fashion Week, a two-time mom for designer Marta Jakubowski walked over the catwalk while wearing the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly camped in a tent camp on the border of Texas
The number of detained migrant children has reached a peak, although the monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, partly because the sharp rhetoric of the Trump administration and the guidelines adopted by them have made it difficult to accommodate children at sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors themselves were undocumented immigrants and were afraid to remain their own opportunity in the country, to play by calling themselves to adopt a child.
The risk rose in June, when federal agencies announced that potential sponsors and other grown-up members of their state would have to give up fingerprints, and that the dates would be shared with the immigration agencies.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, announced before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of children from people who were advertising to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had not been pre-empted.
"Nearly 80 percent of people who are either sponsors or supporters of sponsors are illegal here in the country and a large part of them are criminal aliens.
"We will continue to follow these people," said Lord Albence.
In attempting to work out children more quickly, officials, according to subcontractors, have adopted new rules, whereby some of them must appear within a month after the ceremony, instead of after 60 days (the previous standard), before trial.
Many appear via video conferencing instead of personal, in order to present their case to a legal status of an immigration judge.
Those who do not qualify for the aid will be quickly identified.
What the children remain in custody for longer, what is more likely to be feared and depressed, which, according to subcontractors and reports known from the system in recent months, can lead to violent outbreaks or escape attempts.
Lawyers have stated that these concerns are still being exacerbated in a larger facility than Tornillo, where it is more likely that the signs will be due to the facility size, although a child is struggling with them.
They added that allowing children to travel to the tent city without enough time to emotionally prepare them or tell friends to duck, could make the trauma with which they are struggling even worse.
Syria demands that the United States, France and Turkey immediately withdraw their "occupation"
Before the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called for the Syrian refugees to return home, although the war in the country has been raging for eight years.
Al-Moualem, who is also the deputy prime minister, said that the foreign forces illegally stop on Syrian soil with the pretext of counter-terrorism and are "accepted with them."
"They have to go back straight and without conditions," he told the assembly.
Al-Moualem insisted that the "war on terror in Syria is as good as it is past," where more than 360 000 people have died since 2011 and millions of others have lost their homes.
He said that Damascus "continues its holy struggle until we have cleansed all the Syrian territories" by terrorist groups as well as "illegal foreign presences."
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs, who are fighting against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground of the war-torn country.
As for the refugees, al-Moualem said that the conditions for them to return were in line and he accused "some Western countries" of spreading "irrational fears" that refugees had urged them to stay away.
"We have dedicated ourselves to the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian problem."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no build-up aid for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey for a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib has created an opportunity to advance political talks.
The Russian-Turkish deal has prevented a large-scale attack by the Syrian forces supported by Russia on the province, where three million people live.
Al-Moualem, however, admitted that the deal had "clear deadlines" and he expressed the hope that the jihadists' military action, including fighters of the Nusra front linked to Al-Qaeda, would be "excluded".
The UN General Staffan de Mistura hopes that the first meeting of a new committee of government and opposition members will soon come together to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and to establish the way for elections.
Al-Moualem put conditions for the participation of the Syrian government on the committee, saying that the work of the Council should be restricted to "checking the articles of the current constitution", and warned against any interference.
Why Trump won a second term
According to this logic, Mr. Trump would win the New Waves in 2020, except how many liberal viewers are likely to hope to end an official win or scandal his presidency in advance.
It's like "the most dramatic end to a presidency that's ever happened!"
But so far, there are no signs of intimidation among the spectators.
Since 2014, the quota has doubled to 1.05 million more than at CNN's main end times and nearly tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News had an average of 2.4 million main broadcast viewers, four years ago it was still 1.7 million, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" topped the cable ratio with no less than 3.5 million viewers at main night.
"This is a celebration that attracts people because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, head of the ABC drama "Designated Survivor" about a government secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a mainstream comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneakering Into the Hollywood Boys' Club," has another theory.
He was a taxi driver in Boston before the whale in 2016.
The driver told him that he would choose Mr. Trump.
"Why?" he asked.
He replied, "Because he's taking me to bed," the mother told me.
In the chaos, it's a mess.
Of course, unlike everything else on television, the actions from the White House could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families would come together again and determine the health of the global economy.
This is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can afford.
And at the same time, it surpasses the understanding of an informed citizen, when one himself was caught up in the storm for six hours, to watch a panel discussion of experts discussing the Bob Woodward's use of "deep-grip background" that provided the source for his book "Fear" by Mr. Trump, which included Paul Manafort's $15,000 worth of money.
For example, I'll never see Super Mario again with the same eye as before.
"Some of what he's doing is filling it up as if a reality show is that he's giving something to everyone at night," said Brent Montgomery, director-general of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of "Pawn Stars" about Trump's show with rotating cast and accompanying unexpected conspiracies (when he joins the N.F.

<0xE2><0x86><0x90> Back to the House of the Dead and the Dead by the Sea
It is not surprising that the 17th District of Pennsylvania sees a cash flow, thanks to the reorientation of the congressional districts, which two officials have received in a race around the same seat.
This recent new suburban district of Pittsburg is the disadvantage of Democrat representative Conor Lamb – who won his seat in a solar roller last spring in another district.
The Lamb opposes another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who represents the Ament the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which intersects with the new 17th.
The cards were re-signed after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were constitutionally manipulated in favor of Republicans.
The race for the new 17th has resulted in an exchange for campaign funding between the main funding arm, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb has become a well-known name after a narrow victory in a much-observed solar whale in March for the 18th congressional district of Pennsylvania.
The seat was held for over a decade by a Republican and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts have given the Democrats a clear lead.
The U.S. has decided to punish El Salvador for supporting China, but has resigned.
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama Peking had already recognized, with no major resistance from the United States.
In June 2017, Mr. Trump met with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama and he had a hotel in Panama until the partners threw out the management team of the Trump Organization.
Officials from the State Department have decided to revoke the U.S. leaders of their diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to the "recent decision Taiwan no longer recognizes," Heater Nauert, spokesman for the ministry, said in a statement beginning with the month.
However, it was only confirmed that El Salvador received about $140 million in US aid in 2017, including for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed measures, which cut financial aid payments and target visa restrictions, were painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
With progress in internal meetings, North and Central America's founding fathers have lowered a high-level conference with emphasis on security and economic prosperity to join a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step forward in the efforts to bring migrants back to their countries.
But by mid-September, leading functionaries had made it clear that they wanted the conference to be celebrated and thus effectively ended all convictions for record-setting for El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence will now have to address the conference scheduled for mid-October as a signal for the import, which will put the administration in charge of the meeting, the diplomats said.
And the three American missionaries returned very quietly to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic, with no new messages or strikes from Washington.
A representative speaker of the White House for Mr. Bolton has refused to comment on the details of the debate, which are of the three American Houses, including two diplomats who have agreed to discuss the internal considerations about the conditions of anonymity.
Their reports have been confirmed by an external analyst who works closely with the administration and who has also talked about the conditions of anonymity.
The History of Learning
Your next job message could be to special investigator Robert Mueller's report on Mr. Trump's possible legal impediment, on which there are now available evidence in the public records.
Mr. Mueller, as reported, also wants to find out with his inquiry on Mr. Trump's campaign with Russia in attack on our elections.
If Congress is to be reassessed, then Mr. Trump will have to show responsibility for the new composition, shortly before he has to re-advise the electorate, and perhaps even a jury of his colleagues.
That's a lot of conditions, and I don't want to suggest that Mr. Trump's demise is inevitable - or that of his European equivalents.
We all need to make decisions on the two sides of the Atlantic that will have an impact on the length of this dispute.
In 1938, German officers were ready to launch a coup against Hitler, if the West had only resisted him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We have failed and have not seized the opportunity to avoid the years of massacres that have arisen from it.
The course of history revolves around such turning points, in which democracy's relentless march is accelerated or delayed.
The Americans are currently facing some of these turning points.
What do we do when Mr. Trump dismisses Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's inquiry?
Rosenstein has been in a delicate situation since this newspaper reported that he suggested last year that he secretly admitted to the president and speculated that he was not for his post.
Mr. Rosenstein said the Times report is flawed.
"What will our reaction be if the new F.B.I. inquiry by Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair - or if he is sworn in to the Supreme Court, even if there are credible accusations of sexual misconduct and dishonest statements against him?
And, above all, are we going to choose a Congress that will hold the responsibility of Mr. Trump?
If we don't take the lead, then we're going to have a bad time with democracy.
But I don't think we're going to fail because of a lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czecho-Slovak Jew who was deported by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my diplomatic home in Auschwitz.
She survived, emigrated to America, and, 60 years later, she sent me forward to start Sabbath candles on the table with the swastika afterwards.
With that in my heritage, how can I not be an optimist about our future?"

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers optimistic ahead of Rapid Vienna fight
Rangers host Rapid Vienna a thunderstorm is aware that the victory against the Austrians, after initially playing this month in Spain impressively equal to Villarreal, brings them into a strong position to qualify for Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury caused midfielder Graham Dorrans to retire from his first game of the season since playing 2-2 match with Villarreal, but he believes that the Rangers can use this result as a spring break to achieve better things.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal is a good side," said the 31-year-old.
"We went into the game with the belief that we knew something and they went home with one point.
Perhaps we should have known it in the end, but, in general, a similarity is likely to be a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we were in the second half the better side.
It's a great European night again.
Hopefully we can get three points but this will be a difficult match because they had a good result in their last match but, with the spectators on our side, I'm sure we can continue and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely difficult, with everything that happened with my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now it feels like there is.
The squad is good and the boys all have a lot of fun; the training is good.
Hopefully, we will be able to move forward and be successful in the last season."
Women can't sleep because of this fear of retirement
Although participants of the survey had a clear idea of how they wanted to be provided, few people talk to members of their family about it.
About half of the individuals in this nationwide study said they were talking to their partner about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they were talking about it with their children.
"People want to be cared for by a member of their family, but they don't take the steps to have that conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide's life insurance company.
That's how one starts.
Talk to your partner and children: You can't prepare your family for this if you don't know your wishes early enough.
Work with your counselor and family to discuss where and how to get counseling, as the choices play an important role in calculating the costs.
Involve your financial advisors: Your advisors can also help you find an opportunity to pay the costs.
Your choices to pay for your long-term care include a traditional insurance for long-term care, a hybrid cash life insurance to help cover the costs, or a self-insurance with your own wealth – as long as the money has.
Let's take a look at your legal documents: Conflicts of Interest
Establish a health insurance proxy so that a person who trusts your pet can monitor your health insurance and ensure that professionals remember your wishes in case they are unable to communicate.
You'll also need to have a license for your finances.

A man was stabbed with a gun while on his way home after a while.
The victim, in her 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when she was shot in the chest, abdomen, and hand.
Gendarmensen described the shooting that occurred at around 2:30 BST as a "successful act."
The victim didn't see his attacker.

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died during a strong earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian state of Palu the peacekeepers, according to the Houses, with the expectation that the number of the dead will continue to rise.
Because the communication possibilities have collapsed, the official assistance could not obtain the possibility of information from the Donggala Regency, an area in the north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake with a power of 7.5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster occurred.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, which is at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was on the verge of celebrating its 40th birthday when the earthquakes struck in the tsunami.
Donggala is a regency stretching more than 300km (180 miles) from the coast in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The county, an administrative region under the province, has an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the foundation of the economy of the Central Sulawesi Province, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Mining is also important in the province, but it is mainly concentrated in Morovali, on the opposite laid coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have often been hit by tsunamis in the last 100 years, according to the information provided by the Indonesian Disaster Compensation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami in Donggalamiya killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
A tsunami also hit the west of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is on the verge of a seismic fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis of the last year:
2004: A large quake on the western coast of the Indonesian Aceh province in northern Sumatra on 26 Dec. triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong buoys hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds have died on Nias Island, on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: E 6.8 Strengthened the south of Java, the most populous island of Indonesia, hit and caused a tsunami that sank into the south coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 strong quake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of Western Sumatra province.
About 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-strong quake struck one of the Menawai islands, after Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A superficial quake struck the Pidie Jaya regency in Aceh and triggered destruction and panic as people remembered the devastation of the deadly quake in tsunami.
There was no tsunami at the time, but more than 100 people were killed by failing buildings.
2018: The Indonesian tourist island of Lombok met and killed more than 500 people, mainly on the northern side of the island.
The building destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily detained thousands of tourists on the island.

Indonesia Earthquake Tsunami: Hundreds dead
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
The 7.5-strong earthquake triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electrical and communication networks are out and it is expected that the number of dead will rise in the next few days.

It circulates videos on social networks that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami struck the shore.
U.S. Attorneys Want Rare Death Penalty for NYC Terror Attack Suspects
Federal prosecutors in New York want the death penalty for the Sayfullo Saipov, the suspects in the New York City terror attack that killed eight people — a strange act that has not been carried out in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a rented home depot truck to carry out the attack on a dirt road along the West Side Highway and Lower Manhattan, and had pedestrians and cyclists who were overrun in his way in Oct.
To justify a death penalty, prosecutors must prove that the Saipov "wanted" to kill eight people and "wanted" to cause serious physical harm, following the declaration of intent to claim the death penalty, according to the Southern District of New York.
The two can lead to a death penalty, according to a court order.
A week after the attack, a federal grand jury sued Saipov's charge of 22 charges, which included eight homicide charges in order to help protect money extortion, which is usually used by federal prosecutors in cases of organized crime, and a charge due to violence and destruction of motorized vehicles.
The attack used "substantial planning and preconceived," the prosecutors said, describing the nature and manner in which Saipov executed it as "grey, fearful, and destitute."
"The Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injuries, pain, and loss to families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan DIego Mendoza and Damian Pagnucco," the statement said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been a decade since the Southern District of New York for the last time following a death penalty case.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted because a two-drug dealer killed but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after being convicted of treason for two years before espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
The two Rosenbergs were killed on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, showed a lack of justice in the days and months after the attack, according to court files.
He told the police that he felt good about what he was doing, the police said.
Saipov told the agency that he was inspired to carry out the attack after an ISIS watch videos on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also asked for the removal of the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He was not well known for his 22-year-old record.
David Patton, one of the federal duty defenders representing Saipov, said they were "obviously disappointed" with the decision to pursue the crime.
"We think that the decision to dismiss the death penalty, instead of a confession of guilt and a life in prison without the possibility of being released, will prolong the trauma of these events for everyone," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked not to dismiss the death penalty.
Tory MP Says Nigel Farage Should Suffer Brexit Negotiations
Nigel Farage vowed today during a protest at a Tory conference that a "people's army will mobilize."
The former Ukip leader said politicians must "speak the heat" of the Eurosceptics - while one of Theresa May's own MPs suggested that he should lead the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told the march in Birmingham that the UK would already be "out" if Mr Farage was Brexit secretary.
However, the challenge that Mrs May has been facing to bring the deeply separate ranks back together has been compounded by pro-Remain Tories, who have joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister has had problems keeping their Chequers compromise plan around attacks by Brexiteers, Remainers in the EU on track.
Allies have insisted that they should continue to fight to get a deal with Brussels, despite the backlash – and force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose either their package or ‘chaos’.
The Lord Bone told the Leave Means Leave Rally in Solihull that he was pulling out the Chequers."
He suggested that the Lord Farage should be given a peer and be given responsibility for the negotiations in Brussels.
"If he was going to die, we'd be out now," he said.
Wellingborough Member of Parliament added: "I stand up for Brexit but we have to put out the cheques."
To clarify his opposition to the EU, he said: "We have not fought in world wars to be subdued.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
The Lord Bone suggested that the public opinion has changed since the 2016 election: The idea that the British people have changed their opinion and want to remain is completely false."
In the words of Andrea Jenkyns, "I'm just saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people."
"Chequers is not popular with the public, the opposition will not choose for it, it is not popular with our party and our activists who are really going through the street and lead to us being elected at all.
When I'm done, I'm going to start listening to Chequers."
In a dedicated message to Madame May, it added: "The premiers keep their job when they keep their promises."
Mr. Farage told the rally that politicians must ‘get the heat’ when they went after the decision of the 2016 referendum.
"Now there is confidence between us - the people - in our political class," he said.
"They're trying to reverse Brexit and we're here today to tell them 'we won't let you get away with it'."
In a message to an enthusiastic public, one added: I think that because our political class, which is shortly before Brexit, leaves the heat to shine.
"We are mobilizing the people of this country who have given us the victory with Brexit and will never rest until we are an independent, self-governing, proudly united kingdom."
Meanwhile, the remnants marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the centre of the city.
A small group of activists knew about the founding of the group this weekend Tories Against Brexit banners around.
Labour peer Lord Adonis has the gecko with the Conservatives due to the security issues they had with a party app as the conference began.
"These are the people who tell us that they know the IT systems and install all the technology for Canada plus, for a smooth border, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
It's a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
Warren is planning to become a presidential candidate.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said it was "seriously looking forward to becoming a presidential candidate" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that Massachusetts Democrat Samsden spoke about her future during a speech at the Stadhal in western Massachusetts.
The Warren, a regular critic of President Donald Trump, ran in November to be re-elected against the GOP State Rep. Geoff Diehl, who was the co-chairman of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
It was the center of speculation that went against Trump in 2020.
The Samschen Nam<0xC3><0xA4>tten event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with the Stadhal-format cycling community since Trump took his post.
A member of the board of directors asked if he was going to be a candidate for the presidency.
The Warren responded that it was time "for the women to go to Washington to flee our futile government, and that also means that a woman must be at the forefront."
It came to a feast after the death of LSU Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, LA, have announced a samsung that a suspect has been arrested in relation to the deadly shooting against the basketball player Wayde Sims.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the firm of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11 a.m. ET press conference.
They released a video of the shooting, and asked for help to identify the man seen in the video.
The Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus early on Friday.
"The Wayde Sims suffered a shot in the head and died there," Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told the media, according to 247sports.
Wayde took action to help his colleague and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted that he was on the spot, with a gun, and admitted that he shot the Wayde Sims.
Simpson was detained without a four-year warrant and was arrested in the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
The Sims, a 6.6ft junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, played last season 32 games with 10 starts and had a score of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton knows the world title more after the team's success gives him the victory over Sebastian Vettel.
It is clear that Merced's team success will play a major role in the course as Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton.
From Poland, Bottas got a good start and almost took Hamilton out while defending his position in the first two tiers and inviting Vettel to attack his fellow player.
Vettel first went to the pits and led Hamilton to the Trafic to the end of the pack, which should have been crucial.
Mercedes has gone on a tour afterwards and the pits have been behind the vettel as it came out, but Hamilton has become the first after a wheel-to-wheel action, because the Ferrari driver unintentionally needs to release the tire and risk waiting to defend the third corner after a double maneuver.
Max Verstappen started in the second row of the grid and was seventh at the end of the first tour on his 21st birthday.
He was then for a majority of the course the first while keeping his tires to a quick conclusion and to overtake the Kimi Raikkonen for being fourth.
He finally went on the 44th tour and the pits but he was unable to raise his rhythm in the last eight animals while the Raikkonen got the fourth place.
It's a tough day because Valtteri has been doing a fantastic job all weekend and he was a real gentleman to let me along.
The team had such an exceptional job of having a one-two, Hamilton said.
It was a very bad body language.
President Donald Trump made a slump at a rally with Senator Dianne Feinstein because he insisted that Christine Blasey Ford's letter, which the Supreme Court nominated Brett Kavanaugh for a sexual assault, did not leak.
While speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly about Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead commented that what the Senate has said shows that people are "evil and honest and dishonest."
"The one thing that could happen and the beautiful thing that has been going on in the Senate during the last few days, when one sees the rosary, when one sees the roses and evil and honest and dishonest," he said.
"If you look at what's being made public and leaked and then say, 'Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember you?
Dianne Feinstein, did you play?
Do you remember the answer to the question, "Did you read the document?" 2.
- Oh, no.
I didn't lick.
Wait a minute.
"No, we didn't," he said to the Senator.
Feinstein received the letter detailing the allegations against Ford's Kavanaugh in July, and it was leaked in early September - but Feinstein argued that the leak from his office knew.
"I didn't hide from Dr. Ford's claims, I didn't read his story," said Feinstein to the committee, reports The Hill.
"He asked me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential as he asked."
My denial didn't come well with the president, who commented during the rally a samshad: "I tell you, that was very bad body language.
Maybe it wasn't, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The president, who continued to nominate his defense of the Supreme Court, who was accused by three women of sexual misconduct, further suggested that Democrats would use the allegations for their own purposes.
"They want the power to be restored with all the necessary means.
It sees one's evil, the awkwardness, it's up to them no matter who they are, how they have to run over to get power and control," reports Mediaite as what the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars have beaten for the loss in the Elite League the frees against the Belfast Giants by winning the 5-3 draw in Dundee a match.
The Giants were early on with two goals through strikes by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the home team the balance before the Giants were again ahead of the Dwyer.
Francois Bouchard scored for Dundee before two Lukas Lundvald Nielsen Goaler secured the victory.
It was a third Elite League defeat of the season for Adam Keefe's men, who came from behind to defeat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on a Friday night.
It was a fourth meeting of the season between the two sides, and the Giants won the previous three matches.
Dwyer's opening was in the fourth minute at 3:35 from a Kendall McFaull Assist, with David Rutherford becoming the assistant while Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In an early season, Sullivan returned home at 13:10 and brought the game before Matt Marquardt taught Cownie's balance at 15:16.
The Dwyer made sure that the Giants were given a lead and the first break as he scored the second goal of the evening at the end of the first half.
The home side regrouped and Bouchard brought them back to an equal level with a power play goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran have teamed up to help Nielsen to give Dundee the lead for the first time in the game late in the second half and have ensured that they won with his team their fifth in half of the last half.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five matches, are home for Milton Keynes in their next match.
It's hard to believe that hundreds of people can escape from an earthquake in the middle of the night.
A plane pilot in Indonesia is recognized as a hero after he died while he wanted to make sure that a plane carrying hundreds of people would be safe from the ground.
More than 800 people have died and many more are still missing after a major earthquake hit the Sulawesi island, triggering a tsunami.
The city is full of people and many of them are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
However, despite his work colleagues fleeing to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung has refused to leave his post in the wild rocking control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu airports.
He stayed to make sure that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the piste at that time, was able to safely escape.
He then jumped into the traffic control tower as he thought it would collapse.
He then died in the hospital.
The spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said the decision probably saved hundreds of lives, the Australian ABC News reported.
Seas have prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to bring it to a large hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before reaching the helicopter Palu.
"Our hearts are broken when we hear this," he said.
Meanwhile, the agencies said that the number of dead could go as far as the thousands, while the country's disaster recovery agenda states that the acc<0xC3><0xA8>s is limited to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
"It is expected that the number will continue to rise in the air, because many bodies still lie under the threshold while others cannot be reached," said the spokesman of the agency, Sutop Purvo Nugroho.
The waves that were up to 6 meters high destroyed Palu, where a sun was held in a mass condition.
The military and traffic pilots are helping and providing.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother told Sky News: "Every minute brings an ambulance bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
Mines are everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is quick to help the survivors, but we don't know what we're going to find there.
It's already a tragedy, but it could be a lot worse."
Indonesia's president, Joko Widodo, arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military, "I ask you to work all day and night to complete your duties in the framework of the evacuation.
"Are you ready?" said CNN.
Indonesia was initially hit this year by earthquakes in Lombok, in which more than 550 people died.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini says a man has disappeared after plane crash in lagoon
The airline that carried out a flight crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia has now said that one man has disappeared, after it was previously said that all 47 passengers and crew safely evacuated from the plane that was about to sink.
Air Niugini said in a public statement that they can't stand up for a male passenger since the Sami afternoon.
The airline said they are working with local agency, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not respond directly to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane got up on water as was attempted to land at Chuuk Island airport.
The agency said a peace that seven people were brought to the hospital.
The airline said that six passengers will still remain in the hospital, and that all are in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact loss of faith remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both said the plane was landed in the lagoon, not far from the piste.
Some of the evidence suggests that the plane had gone over the track.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was engaged very deeply.
"That's a very good thing," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that he and others were able to bring it through the waters that went up to the heights, until the safety exits on the plane that was going down with
He said he had panicked and yelled that he had suffered a small gain on his head.
The U.S. Navy said that seamen who worked closely to improve a yard also helped in the rescue by using inflatable boats to bring people to land before the plane was submerged in about 30 meters (100 feet) of deep water.
Data from the airline's air safety network have reported that in the last two decades 111 people have died in accidents involving PNG-registered airlines, but none of them were related to Air Niugini.
An analyst retraces the time span of the night and an expensive woman was burned alive.
The prosecution concluded a Samshen's statement of her case in a second survey of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. analyst Paul Rowlett, of the Department of Justice, has long been hailed as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He retracted for the jury as a cell phone donor used to sit together for the movement of 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night it died.
Rowlett said he received location data from many cell phone operators, who showed that the Tellis was with the Chambers at the evening of his death, contradicting his statements from one another, reports The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers's at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, police went to talk to Sandford.
Sandford picked up a samsung, and he claimed that the roof was not in the city.
When the investigators asked if Tellis was going to tell the truth when he said that he would have been in Sandford's truck that night, Sandford said he was going "to lie because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconvenience was that Tellis said that he had known the Chambers for about two weeks when it died.
Cell phones showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that after a time after Chambers' death, Tellis would have texted, called and contacted the Chambers of his cell phone.
"He's lost his life," he said.
It is planned that the defense of a probe will begin to give its final arguments.
The judge said he was expecting the trial to take place at the jury.
The High Breed: What is Hip Hop?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling their music with positive message.
The High Breed, of Bristol, claimed that the hip hop of its origins has gone from political messages to the solution of social problems.
They want to go back to the roots and make conscious hip hop again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common are recently re-populated in the UK due to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
After a black one?!
N.Y.'s mother-in-law has been arrested for "dismissing" a police officer
A New York children's girl sued a couple for a discriminatory release after receiving a misaddressed text from the mother, who complained that it was "after a black one."
The couple contends that they are racist, and compares the complaints with "extortion"
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed horror as it found out that the new childcare, Maurice, was black as it came for its first day of work in 2016.
"NOTEEEEEEEEEEEE after a black," Mother Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
But instead of sending it to his husband, he sent it to Madame Maurice, two times.
After she noticed the faux pas, an "unbelievable" Plasco-Flaxman dismissed Madame Maurice, explaining that the little girl who had just gone to school had been an African-American, poor job and that she was expecting instead a Filipino, the New York Post.
Ms. Maurice was paid for her one day of work and was sent home with an Uber.
Now, the Maurice accused the couple of getting a compensation from the release, and expected a compensation of about $350 per roof for the job of 6 months, for which it would have lived in the house for which it was initially hired, but without contract.
"I want to show them, look, something doesn't do," said a friend of the post, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple retaliated against the allegations that they were racist, saying that it was the reasonable decision to cancel Maurice's position, fearing that they could not trust him after they insulted him.
"My wife sent him something she didn't want to.
He's not a racist.
We are not racist people," said the man, Joel Plasco, the post.
Do you want your children to be able to walk with you, even if it's a bad idea?
Your newborn baby?
Dajee."
Plasco said while comparing the records to "extortion" that his wife had only had a baby two months ago and was in a "very difficult situation."
Is there a way to get rid of a person in the back?
That's not a good way to act," said the investment banker.
While the trial is still ongoing, the court of public opinion quickly denounced the couple on social media, and scrapped them for their behavior and their logic.
The Paddington publishers were afraid that the readers could not relate to a beer that speaks, according to a new letter.
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It's hard to resist the law of someone who celebrates the first reading before it is published.
It's very exciting to know what we know about Paddington's success."
It said that his father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before one of a small teddy beer was inspired to write the children's book, would have been rose if his work had not been accepted, and said that the 60th birthday of the books was "battery" after his death last year.
About Paddington, who describes it as "very important family member," it says that his father was quietly proud of his later success.
"He was a very quiet man, and he wasn't a person who broke up," he said.
"Because Paddington was so real to him, it was a bit like having a friend achieve something: it's one really proud of them even if it's not one's own work.
I think he saw Paddington's success a little bit in that direction.
Although it was his creation and his imagination, he always attributed the merits to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to talk to her on the phone.
After landing, his daughter and the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital were brought to Nice, where the doctors tried to save his life without success.
"Nad has often called for saying that it looks very bad that it won't be expected to take it," said Mrs Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I was told by Nad that it would die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye.
And that's what I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, my love.
I'm like that.
I'll go with the sense.
The drugs that the doctors gave him to keep his heart shut down had worked slowly and slowly and left his system.
It was a short time ago and that was just the end.
I just sit there and wait, knowing that all of this is happening.
I couldn't bear or cry because I was in a situation with families and people.
I'm really trying to catch up."
Finally, Madame Ednan-Laperouse, who is currently mourning the loss of her daughter, has to climb the plane with the other passengers – without knowing what they are going through.
"I didn't know anything," she said.
"I cut my head, and the tears fell all the time.
It's hard to explain, but by flight I had a huge sympathy for Nad.
He needs my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved.
Women in mourning cards to prevent suicides
Two women who loved them lost because of suicide work to keep others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have sent cards with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call to get support, both a Welsh bridge.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and died at the age of 18.
"I don't want my parents to feel what I'm doing," he said.
Madame Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising cook with a striking grin.
"Everybody knew it because of his grin.
"They've always said they don't care about the room."
But, he left his job before he died, because it was "in a dark place."
In 2014, it was Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old at the time, who found his sister after taking his own life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I'm constantly worried that this will have consequences."
Mrs Davis made the cards, "to let people know that there are people out there who can go and talk to one, even if it's a friend.
Don't sit down, you have to talk."
Madame Humphreys, who has been friends with Madame Davies for years, has lost Mark, her 15-year-old partner, not long after her mother's death.
"He didn't say he was depressed or depressed," he said.
"A few days before Christmas, we realized that there was something different going on.
On Christmas Day, he was finally - when the children opened their gifts, he didn't look at them in the eyes or anything."
He said that his death was a great trauma for them, but that they had to be one of them: "It rips a smile through the whole family.
It's going to rip us off.
We all have to fight and fight.

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in an unstable balance while the FBI begins its investigation
"I thought if we could really get something like what he asked - a time-limited survey, with limited scope - then maybe we could reach a little unity," said the Lord Flake a fellow, adding that he was afraid that the committee would "get out of hand."
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to intervene?
Your thoughts are completely up to date.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away, November 6th - if, as expected, the Republicans get bad results, then they will be severely weakened in their attempt to get the man they want and the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush took the phone and called the senators to lobby them for the high Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and met through him his wife, Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What's going on with the FBI's report?
There will be a election in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It's still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get in at least 50 elections in the Senate, which will allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to pass a balance and enlist him in the Supreme Court.
North Korea's 'failure' under Kim
The number of survivors from North Korea and toward South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean lawmaker.
Park Byeong-seug cited data from the union ministry in the south and said it had survived 1,127 last year – compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that strict border controls between North Korea and China and large amounts of human trafficking played a major role.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
The majority of the survivors from the North are ultimately offered a South Korean statehood.
Seoul says that since the Korean War in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border.
Most refugees across China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily defended demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China sees survivors as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often sends them violently back to their country.
Relations between North and South Korea – which are still technically facing war against each other – have improved sharply in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to conduct talks about the stopped denuclearization negotiations.
This is after the historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they generally agree that they should work for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Yong-ho, has been blamed for the lack of progr<0xC3><0xA8>s since then.
"Without confidence in the U.S.A., there will be no confidence in our national security and under these conditions, it will be impossible for us to disarm unilaterally for the first time," Mr. Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he is not suitable for serving in the Supreme Court.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called the nominee for Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said that in his temperament, he was not suitable for serving in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi gave the commentary to Samshen in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't think otherwise than that if a woman had ever acted like this, they would be saying 'hysterical'," Pelosi said about his response to Kavanaugh's statement before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Kavanaugh claimed that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were all emotionally challenged by both youths.
While his avid statement was the Kavanaugh was very emotional, partly he yelled or devoured while his family and his high school years had been discussed.
He also explicitly denounced the Democrats on the committee and called the allegations against him a "grotesque and coordinated call-for-murder campaign" organized by liberals who rose to the fact that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that he believed Kavanaugh's statements proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court, because it shows that he has voted against the Democrats.
"I think he disagreed with these statements in his way as he rushed against the Clintons and the Democrats themselves," he said.
Pelosi expressed concern as to whether it was going to try to sue Kavanaugh if a move was made, and whether the Democrats won the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'm just saying that here — if he doesn't tell Congress or the FBI the truth, then he's not only suitable for being in the Supreme Court, but also for being in the court where there's a right to do so," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, he was concerned about Kavanaugh's potential decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade because he is seen as a conservative justice.
In his briefing, Kavanaugh raised questions about the possibility that he would die certain Supreme Court decisions went out of the way.
"It's not the time to take a hysterical, partisan person to court and then expect us to say 'it's not wonderful,'" Pelosi said.
The woman has to exercise.
It's a fair courtship, months and years of anger that overwhelms, and has not been able to get it out without crying.
"We're going to get married," I said to my mother, 45 years ago.
"I don't think that's unusual, do you?"
She continued, "I got a lot of help from a woman who was a leadership force somewhere, where she said that she was also going to cry when she rose, but that she was developing a technique, which means that if she rose and began to cry, she would be able to talk to the person she is talking to, "So I want to say that I want to.
I'm going to rosy."
And then it just continued.
And I found that to be brilliant."
It's a good idea to use it as a ventilator because it's basically wrong.
One of my sharpest memories of a previous job, in a mostly male office, where I scratched close with indescribable anger, was that an elderly woman took me to work – a cold manager before whom I was always a bit afraid – and pulled me into a trap.
"Don't let them see you crying," he said.
"You don't know that the rose is.
They think you're sad and they'll be glad they got you."
Patricia Schroeder, a Colorado Democrat congresswoman, worked with Gary Hart as a presidential candidate.
In 1987, when the Lord Hart was caught up in an extraordinary affair on a boat called Monkey Business and left the course, Madame Schroeder, with great frustration, thought that it should not be further about the idea of becoming a presidential candidate herself.
"It wasn't a good decision," I said with a laugh 30 years later.
"There were seven other candidates in the course, and the last thing they needed was another one.
He called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Since it was already late in the campaign, it was behind the donation collection, so it swore that it wouldn't go into the course, unless it collected $2 million.
It was a battle that was lost.
He found out that some of his supporters, who gave men $1000, gave him just $250.
Do you think I'm going to get a refund?" he asked.
When it held its speech and announced that there was no formal campaign going on, it was so overrun by feelings – gratitude to the people who had been supporting it, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to collect money and to target voters and non-delegates, and anger against sexism - that it left him alone.
"Someone may think that I have a nervous breakdown," recalls Mrs. Schroeder about the press' reaction.
"I've been told that Cleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they going to write on my grave?

The U.S.-China trade war could be good for Beijing.
The first salvos of the trade war between the US and China have made one mistake, and even if the fight is not over for a long time, a break between the countries could be long-term beneficial to Beijing, experts say.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, launched the first warnings early this year by providing important Chinese exports, such as solar cells, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation this week was with new tariffs hitting objects worth $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), so that in the end half of the funds coming from China and the US were spent.
Beijing has rebuffed every time, putting recent tariffs at five to ten percent on American girders at a value of $60 billion.
China has vowed that it will join the United States' shot-by-shot, and the world's second largest economy won't pull in so fast.
If they wanted to stop Washington, they would have to go to demands, but publicly doing small things in front of the United States would be too big a blow for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing makes the right decisions, the pressure of the United States in the trade war in China could support long-term positive because it will make the interdependence of the two economies smaller.
"The fact that a quick political decision either in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions that could trigger an economic strudel in the two countries is ultimately much more dangerous than the speculators have recognized so far," said Abigail Grace, a scientific associate at the Think Tank Center of New American that focuses on Asia.
"Syria is ready for refugees to return," the foreign minister said.
Syria says it would be ready for the refugees who want to return and ask for help to rebuild the country that was destroyed by a more than seven-year war.
In a speech to the General Assembly of the United Nations, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the conditions in the country would be improved.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to the progrés in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to build up the areas that were destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
All the conditions have now been met so that the refugees who want to return to the country and the most needed refugees can return because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily lives and their lives.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
There are six million people living in the country who need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government would be happy to help rebuild the devastated country.
However, he stressed that they did not accept any conditional help or assistance from countries that sponsored the uprising.
Europe to win the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup when they defeated Team USA with a result of 16.5 to 10.5 in Le Golf National outside of Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six times behind on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe took back the crown as the Danish captain's team scored the 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who has the majority of the tournament's problems, shot his tea shot and the water shot at par-3 of the 16th laugh, thus losing his match against Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari was excellent in all of his rounds, and has been one of the 4 players who have ever had a 5-0-0 since the 1979 tournament got the hot form.
American Jordan Spieth was ranked 5&4th by the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The best-placed player in the world, Dustin Johnson, has fallen 2 in 1 against Ian Poulter from England, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
Spain's Sergio Garcia, a veteran of eight Ryder Cups, has become the Europeans with the most victories of all time with 25.5 as a career point.
"I don't usually cry today, I can't do anything else.
It was a tough year.
I'm so grateful to Thomas that he took me and believed in me.
I'm so happy to be back on the team again.
It's the team, and I'm glad I was able to help," said the emotional Garcia after the European victory.
John Ram, who defeated U.S. legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in the singles game, is the winner of the game.
"The incredible pride I felt in defeating Tiger Woods, I watched him grow up as I grew up," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his matches to France and now has a career record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
A strange statistic for one of the best players of all time, which won 14 major titles as the second after Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA has had problems finding fairways throughout the weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played the entire tournament over golf at a high level.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk spoke after the disappointing performance for his squad, "I'm proud of the boys they've been fighting.
There was a time when we were celebrating Europe.
We fought.
Chapeau for Thomas.
He's a very good captain.
All 12 of his players have played very well.
We're going to get back together, I'm going to talk to the PGA of America in our Ryder Cup committee and we're going to continue.
I love the 12 boys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You've got to get rid of one of his hats.
We've been caught."
