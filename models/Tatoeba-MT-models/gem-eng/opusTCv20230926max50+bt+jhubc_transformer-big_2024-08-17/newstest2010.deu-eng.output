Barack Obama is the fourth U.S. president to win the Nobel Peace Prize
US President Barack Obama comes to Oslo, Norway, for 26 hours, to receive the Nobel Peace Prize as the fourth US president in history.
In addition, he receives the diploma as well as the medal and a cheque of $1.4 million for his extraordinary efforts to intensify world diplomacy and cooperation among peoples.
The head of the White House arrives tomorrow with his wife Michelle in the north-west of the city and will be busy all the time.
First, he visits the Nobel Institute, where he meets for the first time with the five committee members who elected him in October from 172 people and 33 organizations.
The Presidential couple then planned a meeting with Norwegian King Harald V and Queen Sonja.
In the afternoon, the visit reaches its peak with the ceremony in which Obama takes over the prestige prize.
He is the fourth President of the United States, but only the third to receive the prize directly in office.
The White House has already announced that Obama will talk about the Afghanistan war when he takes over the prize.
The president does not want to avoid this issue because he knows that he is taking the prize as a president who is currently waging war in two countries.
A few days ago, he reinforced the war effort by sending more troops to Afghanistan, which none of his critics forget to highlight.
At the ceremony, Obama also received the gold medal, diploma and cheque for ten million Swedish crowns (about 24 million Czech crowns).
He intends to donate the money for charitable purposes, but he has not yet decided on a concrete charitable work.
The event programme then provides for a banquet with the President and his wife, in which, apart from Norway’s King and Queen, the Prime Minister and a further 250 invited guests will be present.
Obama was very cautious from the start.
For example, he stated that he felt that he did not fully deserve the prize.
He also repeated several times that it is not only for him, but for all those who aspire to the same values as him.
Immediately after the announcement, he stated that this is for him "invitation of action".
Nature conservationists are accused of blackmail
Leitmeritz police accused the chairman of the citizens' association "Naturschutzgemeinschaft Leitmeritz" of blackmail.
In several cases, he filed appeals against some construction procedures last year, for the withdrawal of his appeals he demanded money from the investors in his favor, said the Leitmeritz police spokeswoman, Alena Romova.
Chairman of the Leitmeritz nature conservation community Lubomir Studnicka.
Now he's in jail and he's facing a prison sentence of up to three years.
The sorting waste containers in Brno do not smell good
In Prague, people can sort the beverage packaging, in the southern Moravian villages you can find the sorting waste containers again and again.
What about Brno?
There you would have to reserve a few minutes to find the suitable garbage cans.
I do not want to claim that the waste separation in Brno would not work at all.
But it seems to me whether the Councillors are taking care of this problem insufficiently, even if we are the second largest city in the Republic.
Brno is located in the waste separation in the Urwaldliga, not only because we as citizens here in the sorting containers are always allowed to dispose of only paper, glass and plastics, but especially because of the garbage ton number for such waste.
Have you ever tried to dispose of the PET bottles in a collection basket, for example?
This is art, and above all, it takes time and strong nerves.
The only place I have found so far by chance is the morgue square opposite the goose affected.
Mr Onderka, let us not upset his colleagues, but I do not see much of that.
Apart from the fact that the waste separation is not a honey slur in other parts as well.
All my friends prefer not to sort out the waste.
From laziness.
They are too far from the rubbish bins.
I'm not surprised.
I even offered to dispose of a few glass and plastic bottles after the celebration.
But on the Konicova street, I have not seen any colour bins in sight.
Fortunately, I came to the right place when I was on the tram.
The trash almost ran over.
This is still the center of Brno, which represents the whole city, isn’t it?!
However, ecology and some kind of aesthetics probably leaves the Brünner Socialists cold.
They prefer to buy the city an ice hockey league that shames us all over the Republic instead of buying a few more garbage cans and offering the sorting of other raw materials for a cleaner tan.
I am glad that I was able to confirm my acceptance with official statistics after I searched the internet for a while.
According to the data of the company EKO-KOM, Brno is really the worst in the whole district of South Moravia.
The "paroubek" budget has withdrawn the money for pensions and sick pay
After the left-wing party gave more money to farmers and officials despite the government’s view, there is no more money in the budget for pensions, sick leave and construction savings business.
But also not for public debt interest or for international court disputes.
This will cause even more problems to those who will be in the government in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists enforced the wage increase for some groups, they calculated that the government will additionally pay the money for the sensitive expenses, old-age pensions or for the sick pay.
Credits are paying ever higher interest rates, and you have to refund the money at some point.
Too much to choose from, the Treasury is empty.
If the social benefits or costs for the state operation are not reduced, the tax will be increased.
For all those to whom the Left Party now gave more money: the fire brigade, the teachers, the farmers.
And later on for their children too.
In order for the pensions or sickness benefit, from whose account 1.8 billion have disappeared, people don’t have to be afraid, they get that money.
But at the price that the state is even more indebted – next year the Treasury will not only lack 163 billion, but much more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, the debt will rise faster and faster, and together with this, the costs and interest rates will also increase.
The state will need the money for compensation, then it will no longer be enough to increase the VAT only slightly or to cut the maternity money, as the government did in its district deficit package.
Due to the money-laundering in favour of some electoral groups, five billion will also be missing next year for the expansion of motorways and railways.
These are mainly the sections won in the competition, which can no longer be re-projected and possibly reduced.
Mostly get, which is also not free.
This means delay or cessation of thirty large buildings, Europe's money creation is also at risk, warns the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka.
The CSSD has proposed that it solves the drain of money Solomonically - it attacks the CEZ stock dividends, where the state is the owner of the majority, and from these the money is then distributed into the transport funds.
The problem is that the amount of the dividend is never secure and it is by no means an infinite source.
Last year, CEZ spent 18 billion dollars on the budget.
Annually, the dividends pay the environmental damage liquidation, the pension account is filled up and this money also serves as a reserve for the planned pension reform.
This trick also increases the actual budget deficit to the level of 5.7 percent GDP, according to EU rules.
However, this does not end the carnival of revolutions.
Nearly three billion dollars went down the budget for various compensations for victims of communism and crimes, or for expenses for the litigation, even for building savings.
Whether the state can do without this money is not certain.
This is pure gambling.
If we lose an international court battle, then we have to pay it anyway, Janota makes clear.
The minister must then save the money internally or, in the worst case, attack the government budget reserve.
Hundreds of millions are also missing for the two-billion project "Staatskasse", which has already begun, which is intended to enable on-line monitoring of what the individual authorities are spending the money on.
The first stage starts in January.
If the finance minister does not find the money elsewhere, the project would have to be stopped and in this case there would be sanctions, Janota warned.
Your next smartphone will master two operating systems
For the future, Americans expect a mobile phone on which the user can switch between different operating systems by pressing a single button.
The submitted plans look promising.
It is enough to press just one button, and Windows Mobile will change to Android within a few seconds.
This is exactly what the American company wants to introduce VMware, which focuses primarily on the development of virtual software for computers.
We allow you to run two user profiles on your mobile phone at the same time.
You can switch between these, you can separate them into two home and work profiles.
Both will work in parallel, Srinivas Krishnamurti from VMware suggested during the interview for Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November last year and presented for the first time a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
Virtualization of smart phones is not fiction.
VMware already successfully introduced the smartphone test pattern with two operating systems to journalists.
One was a modified Nokia N800 with a RAM memory of 128 MB, on which simultaneously the mentioned systems Windows Mobile and Android ran.
The development of the new technology for mobile phones is in full swing.
VMware is now working together with the European and American operators on smartphone virtualization, and the devices are expected to arrive to the customer within 2012.
Lack of snow in the mountains torments hotel owners
Snowless slopes don’t just worry about the Giant Mountains residents.
The lack of snow also deters people from ordering ski stays in hotels and guesthouses.
That is why you can still get free rooms in Giant Mountains for all winter dates including Christmas and New Year's Eve.
Our pages are frequently visited.
People go through the offers, set the prices, but now they are afraid to order legally.
And when they call us, they immediately ask if we think this year's Christmas will be on snow or "on mud", the operator of the information portal Spindl.Info, Martin Jandura, stated.
If you want the New Year’s Eve stay in the spindle mill exactly according to his ideas, you should no longer hesitate with the order.
If you prefer saving and the quality of your stay comes second, you can try to wait a few more days.
The Spindelmühle hotel owners now offer mostly only weekly stays for New Year’s Day.
I think they'll be trying to sell them for a while, but then they'll have to give up, too, and move on to shorter times.
And then the free rooms will disappear quickly, appreciated Jandura.
The travel agency Ingtours in Vrchlabi always offers free beds on all winter dates.
Now we are most interested in the Christmas week, which is not yet sold out.
In our offer, about half of the seats are still free.
That’s why we’ve already prepared some cheaper Christmas stays for the last moment, said the director of the travel agency Ingtours, Petr Schiefert.
The Vrchlabi Travel Office can also offer the New Year's Day in the Giant Mountains, but there are less free places here.
Good sales also find the first fourteen days in February, the remaining winter dates are sold on average.
This year, interest in winter stays is also negatively affected by the fact that there is always no snow in the Giant Mountains.
People wait to see if snow falls.
No one wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
If the slopes are snowed within a week, Christmas will also be sold out, says Schiefert.
Conversely, and a little better than last year, the rooms at Hotel Horizont in Pecpod Snezkou manage to occupy.
We are about 5 percent better than last year.
On New Year's Day and Christmas we only have a few free rooms.
There is great interest in the Polish holiday in Janua, and in February the business will also run well, informed the director of the best Pec hotel, Karel Rada.
The Hotel Omnia is also occupied by 80 percent for New Year's Eve stays at Janske Lazne's central parking lot.
On the other hand, half of the beds remain free at the latest hotel in Janske Lazne for Christmas.
We were pleasantly surprised this year of January, for which we are already occupying about 60 percent.
A little weaker is now February, but the moment the snow comes, the interest in staying in the Giant Mountains will certainly also increase, said the director of the Hotel Omnia, Erik Sporysch.
The Giant Mountains hotel owners are now waiting for a greater snow cover.
On Thursday it should cool down and in case of precipitation, it should be snow on the mountains.
Jiri Jakubsky, from the site of the Czech Weather Office in Hradec Kralove, said: “But after that, a warming is expected to come again.
U.S.: Repetition is Mother of Wisdom
It’s almost weird with what student-mindedness Barack Obama, the president with his call of the smartest, repeats his predecessor’s strategy in the Afghanistan issue, which he himself considered the dumbest.
When he finally sweated out his long-awaited Afghanistan doctrine, it turned out that he wrote it off via the copy paper from the Bush-Iraq scenario three years ago.
Not only does he use the phrase "as in Iraq" several times in the text himself, he has even used the name of the Bush Declaration of January 2007 as the name of his own declaration: "New way forward" without hesitation.
Three years ago, he himself criticized the Bush idea of sending fresh contingents of troops into Iraq, which was plagued by the civil war, as "an irresponsible and, in its aftermath, a carastrophic decision."
The following months showed, however, that the Bush strategy, based on recommendations from the military, was the only possible and, to this extent, very successful, one no longer speaks in the news about Iraq at all.
Bush’s reputation was not improved, for objectively he left his successor with a much more grateful starting situation than was expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle will repeat itself.
In order to increase the contingent of troops, he again asked the military, especially the commander-in-chief of the Afghanistan operation General Stanley McCristal, who, despite the subordination habits, harshly criticized the White House's taming gunmen.
He called for 40,000 soldiers to be able to reverse the situation for the better.
The president hesitated for three months, but did not come up with a better idea and so he cheated on the general by 10,000 soldiers.
From Europe, he has pressed the pledge for another 5,000, even though he himself originally calculated at least 10,000.
His plan to withdraw troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and complete this process within three years, leaving the entire Obama doctrine with more questions than answers.
Some doubt that the halved increase will have the same effect as the measure in Iraq.
Even in spite of the fraternal war of recent years, the Iraqi society is relatively well structured, its leaders honor the values.
The Afghan situation is characterized by the contraindications - no one can be trusted and no agreements are held.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces who are used to changing their minds every day.
The political institutions, even if formally founded correctly, remain only sham buildings, behind which patriarchal tribal relations will continue to grow.
The balance of interests between the various ethnic groups is unusually complicated, especially because of the intransigence of the conditions that further complicate the influences of Pakistan and Iran.
The creation of a “capable state”, which is the minimalist goal of the entire operation, is also very unrealistic.
Time horizon of Obama’s strategy alienated by his voluntarism
Over the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only deteriorated further and now it is on the verge of the explosion.
It believes that the little soldiers who broke out in the cry of war over the "early return" can create a miracle here, only a truly romantic soul that cannot be impressed by facts.
From a political point of view, the date set for the withdrawal of troops is a mere irresponsibility, because the Taliban will accept this as the indirect confession of American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that the willingness of Europeans to participate in the fighting in Afghanistan is declining.
Europe’s politicians cannot and do not want to explain to their voters how the security of Germany or Italy is connected with the war in the Hindu Kush Mountains.
Another possible factor that can radically affect the situation is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the increased sanctions do not affect the Iranians, there is a very serious question for the United States whether the problem cannot be solved with troops.
This question needs to be answered in the period when America moves to Obama to withdraw from Afghanistan.
But any solution will also mean a dramatic reversal of the Afghan situation.
The only comfort patch for Barack Obama is the fact that three more years remain until the presidential election, and so there is still enough time for him to resort to another strategy if it turns out to be a total failure.
Bank Goldman Sachs managers no longer receive cash rewards
The senior executives of the American bank Goldman Sachs will no longer receive award bonuses in cash this year.
This is what the company has announced, responding to the sharp criticism of its wage practices.
A group of 30 top managers receive shares instead of the money, which can only be sold in five years.
In addition, the shares may be withdrawn from the managers in the event that they act excessively risky.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs is at the forefront of efforts to combine Wall Street’s premium bonuses with long-term performance.
I believe Wall Street is aware of the further direction in which it has to go, the former banker of JPMorgan, Douglas Elliott, said.
The problem lies in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs set itself the target of criticism after putting aside nearly $17 billion for premium bonuses for the first three quarters of this year.
The total amount of premium bonuses over the course of this year is likely to exceed $20 billion, according to Reuters, despite the measure announced today.
The high premium bonuses in the banking sector have become the hottest political issue in a number of countries with the onset of the financial crisis.
Britain reported on Wednesday that it intends to charge the bankers’ bonuses, which exceed <0xC2><0xA3>25,000, once with a 50 percent tax.
Similar steps are also being taken by France.
This year, women have won the Nobel Prize in all fields, except in physics.
Five record women have today taken over this year’s Nobel Prizes in the subject categories and literature from the hands of the King of Sweden Carl XVI Gustaf.
In addition to the four female scientists, the German writer of Romanian descent, Herta Müller, was among them.
The Nobel Prize in Medicine has been awarded to two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, along with her compatriot Jack Szostak for research in the chromosomal field.
The Israeli Ada Jonah, along with the Americans, Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz, has been awarded the Prize for Chemistry for the Enlightenment of the Ribosome Structure and Function.
The last laureate awarded the Nobel Prize for Economics, which American Elinor Ostrom and her compatriot Oliver Williamson received for analyses of the economic report.
The only category in which no woman received a Nobel Prize this year was Physics.
Today, scientists Charles Kao and George Smith, together with Willard Boyl, have taken away this award for the CCD chip invention, which is the basis of all digital cameras, fax machines or astronomical telescopes.
Each of these laureates has received the diploma, the Nobel Medal and the certificate of the acquisition of the prize.
This amounts to ten million Swedish crowns in each category.
If there are multiple prize winners in each category, the money price will be divided among them.
Traditionally, the American President, Barack Obama, has already received the most anticipated Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo this afternoon.
He acknowledged in his speech the contravenes of his appointment, because he is only at the beginning of his path, and is also at the head of the country that is waging two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
In keeping with his policies, however, he added that wars are necessary in certain situations for the attainment of world peace, even if the price for it is high.
Minister Janota is considering his resignation. Klaus invited him to the castle
President Vaclav Klaus received early on Friday the finance minister, Eduard Janota, who thinks about his stay in the government because he disagrees with the execution of the state budget for the next year in the form that was released by the Assembly of Deputies on Wednesday.
It is believed that the budget and perhaps the stay of Janota in the cabinet will be the topics of the Friday meeting.
The budget is also criticized by Klaus.
According to him, the budget deficit is too high, which further deepens the crisis of public finances.
The Presidential Speaker, Radim Ochvat, informed about the meeting.
Janota wants to negotiate with Prime Minister Jan Fischer on Monday about his continued stay in office.
According to the Budget Act, which now receives Klaus as its signature, the Czech Republic should operate with a deficit of 163 billion kroner.
On Wednesday, however, Parliament voted on the Left Party’s proposals for money-removal and increased the money for civil servants’ salaries, for the maintenance of social benefits and direct wages of farmers.
The government has countered the proposals of Social Democracy that they covertly increase the budget deficit.
Between the left party on the one hand and the government, Klaus and the right party, on the other hand, a sharp internal political dispute has arisen, for which reason the question mark arises about the further work of the Fischer civil servant cabinet, on which the ODS, CSSD and the Green Party agreed in spring.
Critics claim that the budget, as adopted by Parliament, virtually liquidates the package of austerity measures enforced by the Fischer government in the autumn, and that, according to their understanding, it is intended to end public debt.
Klaus, who can sign the law on the state budget but doesn’t have to, explained today at the discussion breakfast with the entrepreneurs that politicians have neglected for a long time the “serious problem” that constitutes “the unsustainable deficit” of public finances.
In his opinion, there is no good solution anymore.
An improvement could only bring a strong government that could build on a broader consensus of the political parties.
The ODS chairman, Mirek Topolanek, stated that the budget is horrendous, and the government should weigh its continued existence.
The ODS chairperson, Petr Necas, told the CTK that the concept of the official cabinet with the support of the CSSD, ODS and Green Party obviously no longer works.
Prime Minister Fischer described similar words in the editorial as "strong expressions".
The CSSD chief, Jiri Paroubek, responded to the Topolanek words that the budget deficit was horrendous, that Topolanek’s former government had prepared for this year, exceeding 200 billion kroner.
Already on Wednesday, the CSSD assessed the approval of the state budget for the next year as a success.
The People's Party was also pleased.
Mandela was played in the new film by Clint Eastwood by Morgan Freeman.
The South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film "Invictus: The Unbeaten" shows the world much of the country, whose struggle and victories despite some criticisms that the lead role was occupied by an American actor.
The story tells of sport, racial relations and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless fighter against the racist apartheid regime in the South African Republic and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, portrays in his life story the American Oscar actor, Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said he was asked by the ninety-one-year-old Mandela if he could portray him in the Eastwood film.
Matt Damon takes on another significant role.
I told him, "If I'm going to play you, I have to meet you.
The seventy-two-year-old actor, who had received the award for his role in the Eastwood drama from the boxing area "Million Dollar Baby", already represented the leader of the movement to abolish slavery, from which he eventually became a slave-holder, a fictional U.S. president, and also God in "Evan Almighty", but rarely someone who is still alive and important to many people is as important as Mandela.
The former South African statesman was in prison for 27 years for his active activities in ending apartheid in the South African Republic.
He was freed in 1990 and for four years became president of the country.
In 1993, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
"Invictus" is the Latin word for "unbeaten", and at the same time it is the name of a poem by the English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The requirement was how to speak.
The film portrays a true event in which Nelson Mandela joined forces with the captain of the South African rugby team, Francois Pienaar, to agree the country. The new President Mandela knows that his people will still remain racially and economically divided even after apartheid.
He believes that he can agree with his people through the sport, so he decides to agree with the rugby players who belong to the outsiders worldwide.
Finally, the South African team rises to the 1995 World Cup.
Freeman worked for several years to bring the Mandela story to the cinema screen.
He had no other goal than to play this role as closely as possible to bring it closer to reality, Freeman said.
The biggest challenge, of course, was to speak as he did.
The actor said if he and the world politician were in the same country, he would try to meet with Mandela, have dinner with him and be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing for him was to shake Mandela’s hand.
I found that when I shake your hand, I take over your energy, it is transmitted, and I felt that I know what you are feeling, he said.
For me, it’s important to be a different person.
Matt Damon is portrayed in the film Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Pienaar, captain of the national rugby team, in which the white players have considered.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for the role in the tough rugby world.
It was a big surprise for him when he met Pienaar for the first time in his house.
I remember ringing the doorbell and the first thing I said to Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Pienaar in my life was, 'I look much bigger in the movie.'
Despite the obvious differences in the actor's stature compared to their actual role models, he has received positive reviews under the direction of director Eastwood "Invictus: Unbeaten" and one also speaks of prospects for an Oscar.
The film critic of the Daily Variety magazine, Todd McCarthy, summarized his evaluation in the following words: "This was very good story, very well-executed film."
In the film reviews on the website rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received 76 percent positive evaluations.
Light Secret Dissolved About Norway: The Russians Have Tested a Rocket
A special light effect of unknown origin was observed over Norway.
The Russian Ministry of Defence has only admitted yesterday that an intercontinental ballistic missile has been tested near the Norwegian border.
The launch, however, was not successful again and the rocket, which was originally to be the pride of the Russian army, will slowly become the nightmare of the Russian generality as well as the prime minister, Vladimir Putin.
Also, his repeated presence on site at the missile test did not have a positive effect on the success of the test flights.
Bulava is usually not started at all or has been damaged in the air.
In the Russian newspapers it is already written about "Bulava" as about a "missile that does not fly".
A rocket that does not fly but shines
This already 13th attempt, went normal in the beginning.
It was only at the end of the flight that technical damage to the rocket occurred.
The engine probably exploded in the third rocket stage.
This time, "Bulava" launched from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donsky, which sailed under the waters of the White Sea.
This type of missile allows the launch from the submarine.
Therefore, it is likely that the mysterious light caused by an indefinite flying object over northern roads was actually the damaged "bulava".
The Norwegians have not doubted since the first moment that it is a Russian missile.
The generality has been wary of this time, claiming that one cannot clearly speak of a failure.
The first two stages of the rocket did not fail and only the third stage was affected by the accident.
In the previous cases, the engines were immediately damaged in the first stage.
Even if there was no test start without error, the head of the Ministry of Defence considers only six out of thirteen to be unsuccessful.
The almost fifty percent success therefore fills the generality with optimism and is still claimed that the "bulava" will fly once without problems and will carry up to ten hypersonic nuclear warheads with a total weight of up to 1.15 tons.
The legendary Fetisov signed an annual contract with CSKA Moscow at the age of 51
At the age of 51, legendary defensive player Vjaceslav Fetisov once again introduces himself in a professional ice hockey game.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and Stanley Cup owner helps out his team CSKA Moscow in need, and is likely to compete against Petersburg in the Friday duel KHL.
Fetisov, who completed his career at the age of forty, in 1998, is currently president of CSKA.
After Denis Kuljas injured himself, we urgently need another defensive player.
Fetisov has regularly trained and agreed that he will support the team.
We just need to clarify some remaining formalities, the agency AP quoted the coach of the Moscow club of Sergei Nemcinov.
In the meantime, it is not clear whether the comeback of the famous hockey player will only affect one game.
I mean that Fetisov is one of those who can raise the morale of other players, Nemcinov performed.
When Fetisov returns to the ice surface, he becomes the oldest Russian professional ice hockey game after AP.
In the NHL, legendary striker Gordie Howe played an entire season for Hartford at the age of fifty-one and was able to score 15 hits and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous five, Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful ice hockey players in history.
He has won two Olympic gold medals, seven world championships in the Soviet Union and has also triumphed in the Canada Cup as well as in the Junior World Cup.
In the second part of his career, he also collected successes in the NHL, where he twice lifted the Stanley Cup over the head in the Detroit-Dress.
Since 2001, he has been a member of the Ice Hockey Star Room.
Hyundai gave in to the unions. All overtime is cancelled
The management of the Nosovice-Automobilfabrik Hyundai agreed with the union to cancel all overtime.
Due to frequent overtime, the union announced its readiness to strike on Monday.
This was confirmed by the spokesman of the Hyundai automobile factory, Petr Vanek.
However, the management wants to agree with the trade unionists on a Saturday layer this week.
We are not allowed to give up our production plan, which is a principle, so on Saturday, December 19, voluntary overtime was proposed for the reason that two work layers would be worked, Vanek said.
The website Sedmicka.cz wrote that the company offered a bonus of 400 CZK to the employees who would work the Saturday shift.
The employees also receive them in retrospect for the Saturday layer of 28 November.
According to Vanek, the company has decided to change the motivation of the employees for the proposed overtime.
Either they can pay the overtime surcharge or they can take a replacement holiday on December 28 and thus extend the Christmas holidays, Vanek said.
In addition, all employees of the Saturday team will be paid the fare and lunch.
In view of the fact that the overtime was the most urgent and burning point with regard to the demands and complaints of trade unionists who had ceased production last week, the management decided yesterday afternoon with immediate effect on the lifting of all overtime hours for the month of December, Van<0xC4><0x9B>k stated.
The employees of the automobile factory had until last week been forced to work 2 hours of overtime virtually every day after the eight-hour shift.
Following the signing of the agreement, the willingness to strike will be revoked by the trade unions.
Further negotiations between the management of the automobile factory and the trade unionists are scheduled to take place on Friday afternoon.
The union leader, Petr Kuchar, said on Wednesday that if they can agree to meet the demands and sign a joint document, they are ready to lift the readiness to strike.
The situation in the automobile factory has intensified last week, on Wednesday, when about 400 employees spontaneously strike because of constant overtime.
They also protested against the bad payment conditions and alleged harassment.
The management held against the fact that the employees have to do the overtime to meet the automotive delivery needs.
The trade unionists also demanded in their Monday's call for strikes that the employees who had interrupted production last Wednesday should not be sanctioned.
In the area of overtime, trade unions are calling for the reduction of overtime to a minimum.
In addition, this year they are demanding the payment of 5000 kroner.
The Nosovice automobile factory Hyundai now employs 2,000 people.
Serial production started in the company in November last year.
By this September, around 80,000 vehicles were produced here, the current production capacity is 200,000 vehicles per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that also works in ‘stitched’ HIV viruses
The team of Czech and German scientists is testing new compounds to prevent the spread of HIV viruses in the organism.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also works in the viruses that are already resistant to drugs.
This fact prevails against the disadvantage that the compound does not act as strongly on common virus variants as one of the already existing drugs.
The disease AIDS can not yet be cured.
However, the patient can prolong the drug composition and prevent the proliferation of HIV viruses in the body.
However, your intake is accompanied by a number of side effects.
In addition, incomplete suppression of viral proliferation results in the development of resistant viruses, against which drugs are no longer effective.
The work of the experts from three institutes of the Academy of Sciences CR, from VSCHT (Chemical-Technological University) Prague and from the University of Heidelberg opens the way to dealing with virus resistance.
They have shown that the substances referred to as metalocarborane act on the protein that is responsible for the multiplication of the HIV virus.
The metalocarboranes are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block viral proliferation in a different way than all drugs used today, so they can overcome the resistance problem.
In their work, the scientists arrive at new ‘improved’ compounds prepared on the basis of knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding to the viral protein.
The metalocarboranes have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multi-variate cages consisting of boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms coupled by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
Homethick and persistent virus
HIV protease is the protein of the HIV virus, which is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without the HIV virus cleavage caused by the HIV protease, there would be no mature infectious virus particles.
When we turn off the HIV protease, we also turn off the proliferation of the virus in the patient’s body, the scientists explain in the press report published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences CR.
In the paper published in the Journal of Medical Chemistry, the scientists describe whole series of compounds in which two pairs of cages (see table) are coupled by a short organic chain, which is then systematically further changed.
A little weaker, but more reliable
The effect of this series of substances against HIV protease was tested in the test tube, also against their resistant (resistant) variants obtained by HIV-infected patients.
The effect of the metalocarborane on the usual enzyme variant is not as strong as in the medicinal products used clinically, but it does not lose its effect on the resistance variants against which the medicinal products used are often ineffective.
The unique mechanism of action as well as its other properties, such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of further chemical designs, makes the metalocarboranes interesting compounds for further research on the development of effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlina Rezacova, head of the Laboratory of Structural Biology of the Institutes of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Academy.
Dispute over budget. ODS went to Fischer, who resists
The chairman of the ODS, Mirek Topolanek, described the approved budget for the next year as "grayful" and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should, in his opinion, consider its continued existence.
The statement of the ODS described the Prime Minister as "strong statements".
It is supposed to take time for analysis.
Deputy ODS chairman, Petr Necas, said that the concept of the official cabinet with the support of the CSSD, ODS and Green Party obviously no longer works.
According to Necas, the Prime Minister must decide whether he intends to base himself on the minority in Parliament when it comes to the fight against the increasing deficit, or whether he is about to remain in office with the help of the parliamentary left.
The approach of the ODS and the Social Democrats to the problem of public deficits is diametrically different, Necas pointed out.
Parliament adopted the 2010 budget on Wednesday, albeit with link party amendments of more than 12 billion kroner.
Parliament has increased the money for civil servants' salaries, for the maintenance of social benefits and for direct payments to farmers.
In doing so, the government has stopped the proposals of the Social Democracy that they covertly increase the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic was to operate with a deficit of 163 billion kroner.
The ODS has left the Chamber before the vote, so it has complied with the wishes of the government, because even the modified budget is only a less bad variant of the budget provisional.
Disappointment and senselessness
The Finance Minister, Eduard Janota, has spoken about his disappointment and a sense of insensibility, while Prime Minister Jan Fischer has argued that the government is still assessing the current situation.
Necas is convinced that if Janota had seriously threatened his resignation in the event that the proposed amendments were adopted, the situation would look different.
According to Czech television, Janota signed up for the Prime Minister for Monday after the government deal.
He indicated that he was considering his further stay in office.
The reason for this is his disappointment with the sale of the budget.
According to Necas, the Social Democracy (CSSD) nominees who had enforced the changes in the budget have nothing to do with the government.
The Prime Minister should also clearly say that he will resign if Parliament continues to adopt deficit-increasing laws, such as those relating to sickness benefits and pensions or the service bill.
Topolanek: The ministers nominated by ODS were not mistaken
This is the case of Prime Minister Fischer and the entire government.
The ministers nominated by the ODS have made no mistakes, Topolanek highlighted in a text message from the US.
It has mentioned that in some ministries in deputy function are people who profess to be TOP 09 who voted against the budget.
Necas stressed that if Fischer decides to renounce the fight against the deficit-highness of public finances, "it is perfectly logical and correct that he relies on the left-wing majority that is currently in parliament".
Then he allegedly cannot count on the support and tolerance of the bourgeois democrats.
I have not thought about it, and if this is going to be up to date, then I will deal with it, defence minister Martin Bartak, nominated by the bourgeois democrats, told the journalists in Parliament.
Prime Minister Fischer flew to Brussels at the European Council in the afternoon.
The ODS resigned at the request of the Prime Minister
At the same time, Necas stressed that the ODS would probably vote against the amended budget in Parliament on Wednesday if the Prime Minister expressly asked the MPs of the bourgeois Democrats to allow the adoption of the budget.
We do not see ourselves as orphans, we are not small children, so he then responded to the question of whether the ODS was not pushed back in the political debate on the budget by the absence of the party chairman in Parliament and in the Czech Republic.
I didn’t realize my voice was missing.
Even when I renounced the mandate, I knew that in the next few months everything positive would be about Bolshevism of Parliament and destruction, Topolanek himself responded.
According to the new timetable of the CD (Czech Railway), fewer trains will run for about the same fare.
From 13 December, the Czech Railway will terminate or limit some less-used express and local trains, while other links will be strengthened.
The total volume of traffic will be reduced by two percent from the date of validity of the new timetable compared with today.
Most fares including basic and customer fares are not changed.
Several connections to the capital receive, for example, the inhabitants of the Ostrava area, the railway uses trains of the Pendolino type for this route.
The express train will no longer go to Bratislava (Pressburg).
Less express trains will also travel on the route Prague - Pisek - Budweis, in principle the direct connections from Prague to Letohrad will be reduced.
The largest reduction is planned for the railway in the Hradec Kralove district, a total of 8%, while Prague and the surrounding area can look forward to an increase.
Two night trains will also be lifted on the Prague - Tabor - Budweis route and on a few days a week the operation of some express trains on the Prague - Pisek - Budweis route will be reduced.
One of the biggest changes is the introduction of the new direct transport route from Milovice to Prague, currently the inhabitants of Milovice have to switch to Lysa nad Labem.
It is the fifteenth traffic route of the Esko suburban transport system, the opening of which is possible thanks to the railway electrification from Lysa nad Labem to Milovice.
The long-distance routes to the capital will end at the destination station Prague - Central Station.
The CD introduces more connecting lines SC Pendolino between Prague and Ostrava and the trains to Supperk/Jesenik will run at a time distance of two hours.
With the Pendolino, passengers have not been able to travel to Bratislava since 13 December.
This year's bill for regional railways: increase of 200 million
The express trains are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport, in total the railway receives four billion kroner in the next year to compensate for the so-called loss of liquidity, as well as this year. The local trains supply the districts, in total they pay eight billion kroner next year, with the state shooting at three billion kroner.
This year, the regional trains are 200 million Czech crowns more expensive.
For the local trains as well as the express trains, the railway has concluded a ten-year contract, until now the contract has always only been concluded for one year.
The railway praises the system, and perhaps that is why it did not take to increase the price of the vast majority of tickets.
Changes are only available for one-day CD Net tickets and for cheap eLiska tickets.
For passengers without the customer card, the price CD Net is increased from 450 kroner to 600 kroner.
The price eLiska will then depend on the driven plug, until now it was uniform for travel between any district cities and cost 160 kroner.
Philippine billionaires arrest more than 50 people, the children were released.
Millitante kidnapped 75 people in the south of the Philippines today, including some elementary school students and their teachers.
This was stated by the AFP agency, which originally informed only over 65 kidnapped people.
All 17 detained children were released after eight hours, including one teacher.
The kidnapping took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
About 19 million people allegedly used the hostages as a living shield while fleeing from the police.
The local negotiators are now trying to release the remaining hostages.
According to the agency AFP, the millionaires belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is the arms faction of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AP, the police pursued the kidnappers because of the violence that demanded revenge between the two local family clans.
In the south of the Philippines, in the province of Maguindanao, due to the recent massacre in which 57 people were killed, the right to stand was imposed.
Among the victims of the November 23 massacre, which coincided with the election to the governor's office, were 30 journalists.
On suspicion of participating in the massacre, the governor of this South Philippine province and his father Andal Ampatuan, Patriarch of the influential Ampatuan clan, were arrested.
Muslim separatists are also active on the island of Mindanao.
But they resumed the peace talks with the Philippine government on Tuesday.
South Africa’s history affects everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Nelson Mandela
In the next few days, the new Hollywood film Clint Eastwoods will appear in American cinemas "Invictus: the Unbeaten", which includes part of the life story of the former president of South Africa, Nelsona Mandela.
The role of the world-famous anti-apartheid fighter has been retained by Morgan Freeman, who had already been allegedly selected by Mandela himself a few years ago.
The supporting role of the legendary South African champion in rugby, Francois Pienaar, has been given to Matt Damon.
With the film’s cinema launch, reactions from critics as well as the public will also become loud.
Nelson Mandela
His full name is Nelson Rolihlaha Mandela, born on July 18, 1918 in South African Mvez.
In 1988 he was awarded the Sakhar Prize, in 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize together with de Klerk.
He was elected President of the Republic of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
Great expectations are set in the film because it comes to cinemas at a time when South Africa on the one hand culminates in preparations for the World Cup, but at the same time the media shakes the world public with frightening news about the rising racial hatred and the discrimination of the inhabitants by the black ruling majority.
According to the AP news agency, the reactions to the new film in South Africa are consistently positive for the time being, despite numerous reservations about the cast of the lead roles with American Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman is proud of the new film.
I’ve been doing this for many years and I’ve been well prepared for it.
Several times I also met Nelson Mandela personally, so that I can receive his energy, as they say, he performed in the interview after the film’s festival premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it’s good to be able to relate this film to the personality of Mandela and his message.
This is a history of South Africa, but it affects every person, he added.
In the dress of the rugby national team
The film is based on the book template of British writer John Carlin, freely translated ‘In the Role of the Enemy’: Nelson Mandela and the game that has united the people portrays the South African defender of human rights during his first presidential term.
Morgan Freeman strives over the course of the film to bring together two racial and demarcated groups of people, and like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he also enters the world cup field in his role in the South African national rugby dress, which then won South Africa.
For entering the grass in the dress, which is considered almost like a sacred act in South Africa, Mandela reaped great ovations fourteen years ago, mostly from the white audience and thus won the recognition of the white population.
The Rugby Championship may have succeeded in reuniting the people into a single people, leading rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only "black" in the national team in 1995.
Whether the tense situation in South Africa is improving will only show up.
However, the white South Africans are skeptical, as revealed in recent interviews for LN Rugby fan Christopher Dawson, who fled the country to Britain.
The championship starts on June 11, 2010.
In the Louny region, transformers burn for several 10 million crowns
The fire broke out in the morning at the transformer of the company Ceps in the switching plant near the municipality of Vyskov in the Louny area.
According to the spokesman of the district fire brigade Usti nad Labem, Lukas Marvan, six units intervened during the fire.
Originally, the fire brigade wanted to burn out the transformers, but later it changed the view and now the fire is extinguished with a mixture of water - foam and special extinguishers.
The cause was a technical defect, a transformer inner short circuit.
No one was injured, the accident did not endanger the safety operation of the management system, according to the company spokesperson, Pavla Mandatova.
The damage was estimated at several 10 million crowns, more precisely the damage will be counted only after the fire.
The destroyed transformer must be replaced by a new one according to Mandatova.
For over 10 years, nothing like this has happened in the company of Ceps, mistakes of this kind are rare, she added.
According to the spokesperson of the company CEZ for North Bohemia, Sona Holingerova, the power supply was not interrupted, due to the fire of the transformer station the functionality of households, authorities and companies was not affected.
A.G. Ceps is the sole operator of the cable system, of electrical lines of 400 kV and 220 kV in the Czech Republic.
It maintains, renovates and develops 39 switchgear systems with 67 transformers that transmit electrical energy in the distribution system and line line with a length of 4339 kilometers.
Jancura has filed a criminal complaint for defamation against three heads of the CSSD.
The owner of the student agency, Radim Jancura, is filing a criminal complaint today for slander against three social democratic leaders.
Against Michal Hasek from the district of South Moravia, Radko Martinek from the district of Pardubice and the head of the district of Olomouc, Martin Tesarik.
Jancura said this in a 20-minute interview in the radio journal.
The lawsuit is related to the company’s efforts to operate regional train services in some districts.
However, all regions have ultimately signed long-term contracts with the Czech Railway.
All three leaders attack us and say that we take the raisins out, while we only made the offer on the scale that was agreed with them.
They claim that we are more expensive than the Czech Railway because we would know the prices of the Czech Railway, which were closed last week.
We have nothing left but to defend ourselves.
Because of this slander of the company Student Agency, Jancura told the radio journal.
At the same time, he stated that he has evidence from all districts that they have taken their steps in accordance with European law.
That is why we are preparing an indictment for the European Commission.
Hasek considers the criminal complaint to be the continuation of Jancura’s medial show, which serves him as a free advertisement for his company as well as for his own person.
I am of course ready to defend my good name and the good reputation of my district, and I also ask for further leaders.
I assume that even in this matter it will become clear that it is Jancura who manipulates the public in the matter of regional railway traffic and uses lying and false arguments, Hasek said.
Jancura already reported last week that he has invested several million kroner in advertising, which will point to the disadvantageous step of the districts.
He told the radio journal that he is interrupting the campaign after Christmas and wants to continue it after New Year.
He specified that he will run the campaign against corruption as such.
The campaign started Jancura after the districts agreed to operate regional rail services with the Czech Railways and had not tendered for the order in a high of 150 billion kroner.
According to Vancura, such conduct is unlawful and contrary to the requirements of the European Court of Justice.
Because of the criticism of train traffic in the districts, Jancura said he was already threatened by a member of the CSSD.
The only threat was if we didn’t give up that we could lose the bus licenses as well.
He introduced himself as a member of the CSSD, I know who it is, I don’t say his name, Jancura told the radio journal today.
Vaccination against pneumococcal free and voluntary
Vaccination against pneumococcal disease will change the usual from January.
It is the first to be free and voluntary for families.
But already, voices are reporting that the mandatory vaccination would be more effective.
The preparations for the introduction of the free vaccination against pneumococcal disease culminate.
The Institute of Medicine has already set the maximum prices of the vaccines that health insurance must pay.
The experts are also clear about the vaccination procedure.
New vaccination
Vaccines free for August children
From January, children can be vaccinated for free against pneumococcal disease, which was born on August 2 last year and later.
The condition is that they have not yet received a vaccine dose.
Anyone who has already started the vaccination in the past year or earlier must also pay for further repeat vaccination themselves.
The first vaccination dose must be given between the 3rd and 5th months of the child’s life.
Last year, a quarter of families had their children vaccinated against pneumococcal disease.
The parents paid 1,600 kroner and more for a dose.
Four doses are required for the vaccination of the youngest children.
Overall, the experts estimate that health insurance companies spend 300,000 to 450,000 kroner per year on vaccine doses.
However, you will save on the treatment that the children would need without vaccination.
So far, the state has spent about 500,000 per year on all children’s land vaccinations.
The mandatory vaccination was introduced with the so-called Janota package.
Pneumococci cause middle ear inflammation, but also severe infections including brain inflammation and blood poisoning.
Pneumococcal infections cause up to 28 children up to 10 years of age after being examined in hospitals per year.
Outside the Czech Republic, the compulsory vaccination of children against pneumococcal disease was introduced in about 40 countries.
Will the vaccination be mandatory?
At the same time, it is said that this vaccination could be mandatory in the future.
As of January, it is to be paid by the insurance companies and voluntary.
That the mandatory vaccination would be better, mentioned, for example, the head of the citizens' association Nahlas, Rudolf Kalovsky.
His association has long been promoting pneumococcal vaccination.
The experts at the international conference in which our association was involved were not very satisfied that we had voluntary vaccination.
That's not quite ideal.
On the other hand, we are glad that we have managed to achieve at least that.
I think that's the way we have to go now, Kalovsky said.
However, the Ministry of Health does not want to change the vaccination procedure against pneumococcal cancer.
At this moment we are not considering this at all, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sesen.
The voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks, doctors claim.
Hana Cabrnochova, the chairman of the medical community of practical pediatricians, admits that a voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks.
If all children were vaccinated, then one might think about reducing the number of repeat vaccinations "In a situation where the vaccine is so expensive, we understand the political decision that this vaccination was started as a voluntary one," says Cabrnochova.
Experts expect more than 80 percent of parents to vaccinate their infants against pneumococcal disease from next year.
Vaccination against pneumococcal disease is also ground-breaking in that it is the first area vaccination paid by health insurance companies and not by the state.
The insurance companies should spend the money on prevention, thus saving them for further treatment, explains Cabrnochova.
Doctors have to buy the vaccines themselves.
However, this involves a concern of the practical pediatricians, which concerns the purchase of the vaccines.
According to the original plan, the vaccines should be purchased by the insurance companies and the doctors then receive them on the same route as other vaccines issued by the state to them.
Some MPs, however, feared that the insurance companies could "execute the money from health insurance".
That is why doctors will have to buy the vaccines themselves and wait for the insurance companies to pay them.
According to estimates, the individual practical doctors will have to invest 40,000 kroner per month, which is a significant sum.
That won’t be easy, says Cabrnochova.
U.S. Artist's Son Participates in "Museum Theft"
The son of famed American fantasy artist Frank Frazetta was accused of trying to steal $20 million worth of paintings from his father’s museum.
According to the Pennsylvania police, Alfonso Frank Frazetta was caught in his vehicle with a trailer while inviting 90 paintings.
It is said that Frank Frazetta junior and another man had used a excavator to penetrate the museum into the Pocono Mountains.
The 81-year-old Frank Frazetta Senior is famous for his portrayal of figures such as Conan the Barbarian and Tarzan.
As reported by the Associated Press, the artist stayed in Florida at the time of the incident.
AP quoted an unnamed police officer who said Frank Frazetta Junior might have been motivated by a family feud.
The agency reported, according to a police affidavit, Frazetta Junior claimed, he was instructed by his father, "that he should penetrate the museum by all means to bring all the paintings into a camp."
The agency said Frank Frazetta Senior denied permission.
Labour defends budget and tax increases
Ministers have defended the tax increases and spending stops announced in the preliminary report against criticism of the opposition, the economy and the trade unions.
The Conservatives said Alistair Darling had left an opportunity to show that he was serious about reducing the deficit by pushing the decisions out until after the election.
The Chancellor was also under fire for targeting low- and middle-income workers.
Its main proposals include a 0.5% increase in social security and a 1% cut in public payroll for 2011.
Social Security
The unions have protested that low-wage recipients are being punished for a recession they did not cause and warned of impending "problems".
The rise in social security — to about <0xC2><0xA3>3 billion a year — has upset the private sector, which says this is a tax on jobs, although the focus should be on the economic upswing.
The increase, which is limited to those who earn more than <0xC2><0xA3>20,000 per year, will affect about 10 million workers.
DIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL
Increase in social security by an additional 0.5% from April 2011
This year, the economy is shrinking by more than the expected 4.75%
New 50% Tax on Banker Bonuses
1 percent increase in corporate tax for small businesses rejected
Tax discounts for electric vehicles and wind turbines
Increase in government pensions by 2.5%
According to estimates by the Treasury, someone with an annual income of <0xC2><0xA3>30,000 will be poorer by <0xC2><0xA3>90 per year and someone with <0xC2><0xA3>40,000 per year will be poorer by <0xC2><0xA3>190, while a person with <0xC2><0xA3>10,000 annual income will be richer by <0xC2><0xA3>110.
The ministers said their target of deficit halving by 2013 meant "difficult decisions", but they also said that 60% of the additional taxes would account for the 5% of top earners.
Finance Minister Stephen Timms denied that the outlined tax increases and spending stops would be "a drop on the hot stone" compared to the necessary measures.
"These are big numbers, they will bring us the deficit halving and this is absolutely necessary over the next four years," he told the BBC.
Timms said he was confident that the economy would return to growth by the end of the year.
The Labour Party’s forecasts of future economic growth – affecting the extent of re-debt and the speed of deficit reduction – were called into question after the Treasury Chancellor was forced to revise previous figures.
He said in his statement that the economy is likely to shrink by 4.75% this year — far more than the 3.5% drop predicted in April — while debt would be <0xC2><0xA3>3 billion higher than previously estimated.
"Lost opportunity"
The Conservatives, who want to launch a new advertising campaign on Thursday to warn of Labour’s “debt crisis,” said the planned <0xC2><0xA3>789 billion debt over the next six years was unsustainable.
They added that ministers have failed to present a credible plan on how to repay this and press "cynically" ahead of difficult decisions until after the election - which must take place by June 2010 at the latest.
“They didn’t say anything of importance about what they’re going to do,” shadow finance minister Philip Hammond said, “they had their opportunity to do this, and they let them pass by.”
"The important announcements will only be made after the election, whoever wins them".
Deloitte Roger Bootle
Labour insists that schools, hospitals and the police are protected from future cuts, unlike in the Conservatives’ proposals, which see the deficit cap coming faster and faster.
But the Liberal Democrats said that the money won by the tax increases and spending stops is used to cover spending for next year, not to reduce the deficit, and therefore argue that the plans are “built on sand.”
The BBC’s political editor, Nick Robinson, said that at the time of the announcements – such as the above inflation adjustment on some disability pensions next April – the Chancellor would expose the Treasury to the charge of voting, as the money could simply be recovered next year.
Labour insists on providing extra assistance when people need it most and that the situation will be re-examined in September 2010.
"Hohler Etat"
Although the ministers have not disclosed any budget details beyond 2011, economists say that the pressure on public spending will only come to bear in the medium term.
The recognized Institute for Tax Investigations said the Treasurer’s figures would mean strong cuts in many areas, possibly also in the fields of transport, higher education, science and defense.
“It only shifts the pain to later,” said his director Robert Chote.
"The important announcements will only be made after the election, whoever wins them," said Roger Bootle, business consultant at Deloitte.
"This was just the hollow pre-emptive budget report. The markets recognize that."
FBI investigates arrests of U.S. citizens in Pakistan
The FBI is investigating the arrest of five reported U.S. citizens for suspected extremist connections in Pakistan.
The men were arrested in a raid on a house in Sarghoda, eastern Panjab province, the U.S. embassy in Pakistan told the BBC.
The FBI said it is investigating whether these are the same men who were reported missing last month in the U.S. state of Virginia.
The U.S. State Department said they are also looking for information about the men.
Three of them are said to be Pakistani, one is of Egyptian origin and the other has a Yemeni background.
"If they are American citizens, we are of course very interested in the charges they are being accused of and under what circumstances they are being held," Kelly said.
FBI spokeswoman Katherine Schweit said the agency was informed about the arrests and was in touch with the families of the missing students.
“We are working with Pakistani authorities to find out their identities and the purpose of their stay there if they are actually the missing students,” she said.
The Pakistani embassy in Washington said the men were arrested in a house belonging to one of the students’ uncles.
He said the local police had been interested in the house before and that no charges had been filed against the arrested men.
According to Reuters, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton refused to comment on the arrests, but she said the U.S. "must work more closely with Afghanistan and Pakistan to eradicate the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train people."
The five students were reported missing by their families in Northern Virginia at the end of November.
Amnesty International condemns “abuses” in Iran
According to a report by the human rights organization Amnesty International, it is still as bad about human rights in Iran as it has been in the past 20 years.
The report details "abuse patterns" by the regime, both before and after the contested presidential elections in June.
One man quoted in the report stated that he was beaten and burned with cigarettes, and another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran rejected previous criticism of its human rights record.
Officials said such criticism was politically motivated.
After the contested election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, thousands of people were arrested in Iran and dozens killed, leading to the biggest street protests since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Dozens received prison sentences and prosecutors said at least five people were sentenced to death.
BBC Teheran correspondent Jon Leyne, now based in London, said that at the beginning of the protests the highest leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, acknowledged some of the abuse allegations and ordered the closure of the Kahrizak prison.
But since then, there has been no tolerance on the part of the authorities for criticism, our correspondent said.
"False confession"
Amnesty International cited the report of 26-year-old computer science student Ebrahim Mehtari, who said he was charged with “working with Facebook networks” and protesting the election results.
"They often hit me in the face," he was quoted as saying.
"I was burned with cigarettes under my eyes, in my neck, on my head ... they threatened me with death and they humiliated me".
After five days, he signed a false confession and, still bleeding and half unconscious, was released on the street, Amnesty said.
The defeated presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi said some protesters who had been arrested after the election were tortured to death in August in prison and others raped.
The Iranian authorities denied the rape allegations, but admitted that abuses took place.
Amnesty also called the case of a former prisoner, who said he had been detained with 75 others for more than eight weeks in a container in a prison in Kahrizak.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian Parliament and the judicial authorities had set up a committee to investigate the unrest after the election and the government’s reactions to it, but Amnesty said the mandates and power of these bodies would be unclear and the results obtained by the parliamentary committees had not been published.
The group said at least 90 people have been arrested in the last three weeks to prevent further demonstrations.
Skihang was set up in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow were used to turn a landmark in Bristol into a competitive slope.
The ski slope of this park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders who fought for cash prizes.
At the top of the slope at Brandon Hill Park there was a short jump chance at the beginning of a 100-meter-long slope.
Student John Hickman, who studied medicine in the fourth year, said there was a beautiful view from the top of the slope, but it was also quite intimidating.
It is a great view with all the lights of the city that glitter below.
He added, "There are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the country here - some real talents."
Prizes were awarded for the best pieces of art performed on the slope - or tricks.
After the event on Thursday evening, the snow is left to melt.
Still you and me
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters voted for a building ban on minarets and the concern about the alleged Islamization of Europe is widespread, John Bowen, an American academic, has written a well-founded and well-thought-out report on whether Muslims can be integrated into one of Europe’s most professed secular societies — and integrated.
Some readers will read this new book out of admiration for the author's last work: "Why the French don't love headscarves" (2006), an elegant and densely argumentative study of a dispute that the country shared and occupied over a decade and a half and whose effects can still be perceived today.
Bowen’s latest book offers a broader and bolder spectrum.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what the politicians and the media say about Islam in France, but what is really happening in the field.
He has spent months in mosques, schools and institutes that now offer the 5 to 6 million Muslims in France, as Bowen calls "Islamic Freedoms".
He is a good listener, he gives back debates between teachers and students about the questions they most worry about.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or town hall (or both)?
Should young Muslims be taught about the evolution and rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it permissible for a Muslim to use an interest-based banking system to get a mortgage?
It is these seemingly profane matters, he claims, which make up daily life, quite unlike the political dramas that the media engages in.
The author recognizes a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, none of them with a known name, possibly with the exception of Tarik Ramadan, a Swiss-born Arab-Muslim scholar and academic.
This new generation is trying to open the debate about how it is possible to be a good Muslim on the one hand and a good citizen in a modern secular society on the other.
You don’t have all the arguments on your side.
The conservatives are suspicious of the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists who interviewed Bowen are mostly at odds with their Salafi counterparts – advocates of purist Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia – who today show a small but influential presence among Europe’s Muslims.
Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But an agreement requires giving and taking on both sides.
He questions the extent to which French political decision-makers (and the intellectual elite, so passionately guarding the separation of church and state) really feel committed to pluralism.
He suggests that Muslims may experience harsher treatment than Catholics, Protestants, and Jews, who in turn had to make their historical compromises with secular republicanism.
He recognizes a "growing of value screws" rather than a growing pragmatism.
After reading this book, one is inclined to say "Yes, but not yet".
The world's most desolate view
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other environmental region on Earth.
The ice that characterizes it melts at alarming speed and takes life with it that can't survive anywhere else.
Oil, gas, shipping and fishing interests have gone into the recently open water, with diplomats, lawyers and now also authors in their keel water.
Richard Ellis, an author and illustrator, draws in "On Thin Ice" (original title: "On Thin Ice") a natural history of the icon of the North, the polar bear.
Wandered in the complicated history and politics of whaling, he describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers who have proven themselves in hunting the polar bears.
Admiral Nelson's encounter with an polar bear as a brave 14-year-old ensign to the lake, who fought only with his musket's gun, is certainly a legend, but others are true.
Young bears caught swimming behind the bodies of their recently killed mothers were taken to zoos and circuses.
A circus performance at the beginning of the 20th century showed 75 polar bears at a performance.
Even today, zoos still typically own one millionth of the habitat of a wild animal. The climate is rarely suitable: the polar bear in Singapore became quite green from the algae that grow in the hollow hairs of its fur.

Ellis refers to the accounts of other authors and historians and often returns to the threat posed by hunters for the survival of the species.
Although banned in Norway, America and Russia, the killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where hunters in helicopters and motor sled-driving Inuit use powerful assault rifles to track down their prey.
Ironically, in the waters in the north of these two hunting nations, the ice will last the longest.
In his new book "After the Ice", Alun Anderson, a former editor of the science magazine "New Scientist", offers a clear and disturbing description of the science of the Arctic and a gripping insight into how the future could develop.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can adequately explain the speed of change.
However, this is not due to a lack of explanations.
The pioneering trips of Fridtjof Nansen at the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries for the first time showed the confusion of the pack ice.
In the Cold War, submarines measured the shifting ridges as they drifted.
A useful addition are satellite measurements and the large-scale deployment of measurement probes on icebergs, but still much is achieved by fearless people camping outside in the cold.
Anderson takes a look at the peculiar, tiny world of the inflow system within the Arctic ice, formed by saltwater channels compressed during freezing.
But, from the bear on the ice to the microscopic wonders in the ice, all of them are threatened by the passing of summer ice, which is expected between 2013 and 2050.
“In a few months, it could be us.”
Marine infantry were among the 6,000 who laid wreaths in Arlington
De'Angello Robinson travelled by bus for seven hours to lay a single wreath on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who took the journey from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, North Carolina, to Arlington National Cemetery to decorate graves, the day was a tribute to the men and women in whose footsteps they walked.
In a few months, from wherever we are brought back, we could be that, Robinson said about the fallen soldiers.
If we were, I would wish someone would do the same for me, so I try to show my respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who gathered on Saturday morning to lay wreaths on the graves of veterans in several sections of the Arlington Cemetery.
Morrill Worcester, owner of the Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, founded this tradition in 1992 when he and some others decided to decorate several hundred graves at Arlington Cemetery.
It is now an 18-year-old tradition and Morrill and his wife Karen, who take this journey every year, continue in different cities along the way to carry out events dedicated to people in the military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit organization, Wreaths Across America, which extended the event to other states.
This year, volunteers laid more than 16,000 wreaths on the graves at Arlington Cemetery, in areas at the Pentagon, on graves at Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, in Battery Park in New York, and at the memorial site for United Airlines Flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second time, the Walmart Foundation donated more than $150,000 to purchase and transport the wreaths.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster said she made the trip to Arlington in memory of her husband, a deceased professional soldier.
Although her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said, this is her way of giving back to those who brought the victims.
She said this is a small contribution on how we civilians can support our soldiers.
It’s like visiting a family cemetery.
Packed in layers of warm clothing, the volunteers wandered across the vast lawns and hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers had older graves from the 1st and 2nd World War and the Vietnam War as their target, as these are not visited as often as the newer graves, according to the organizers.
The mood was cheerful, children were playing and couples were holding hands while carrying the fresh pine branches to the greying tombstones.
Each round wreath was dark green with a small red bow attached to the upper part.
The section 60, which is located nearby and where mainly veterans of the wars are buried in Iraq and Afghanistan, remained almost calm.
The United Service Organizations donated 1,000 wreaths to decorate this section, but the gloomy mood of the current wars filled this area.
Some wept openly, others prayed, and families and friends held each other together in the icy air.
Some read the names carved in stone, while others bowed down to small black-and-white place cards that had been put into the damp mud for those whose tombstones had not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who shed bitter tears before her son’s grave.
She drove 8 hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the tomb of Marine Infranterie sub-officer David Shane Spicer, who fell in combat in July.
No one should ever forget why we are free... my son paid for it, she said.
“If I haven’t been around for a long time, I want someone to remember him.”
U.S. government contractor arrested by Cuban authorities
The Cuban government has arrested a U.S. government contractor selling mobile phones and notebook computers in the country, officials said Saturday.
The contractor, which has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc., based in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for customers, such as USAID, the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular officers from the U.S. Department of State in Havana are trying to gain access to the prisoner arrested on December 5.
The special charges have not yet been published, although under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or foreign visitor can be arrested for almost anything, under the accusation of “danger”.
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, which include light protests and critical writings, pose a risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and statements are considered a serious crime.
Cuba has a growing blogger community led by popular reporter Yoani S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez, who often describes how she and her husband are being persecuted and attacked by government officials.
S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez has repeatedly asked for permission to leave the country to accept prizes, but this has always been rejected.
The arrest of an American contractor is likely to increase tensions between the Castro brother’s Communist government in Cuba and the Obama administration, which had sought a “slow” approach to improving relations with the island.
The news of the arrest was first reported by the New York Times on Friday night.
The new U.S. policy emphasizes that the United States will provide a return if the Cuban government takes concrete steps in this direction, such as releasing political prisoners and creating more room for opposition.
Mobile phones and notebooks are legal in Cuba, although they are new and sought-after products in a country where the average salary of a government employee is $15 a month.
The Cuban government has only allowed ordinary citizens to buy a mobile phone since this year, they are used mainly for sending text messages, as a 15-minute phone call would cost a daily wage.
Internet usage is extremely limited on the island.
It is accessible in expensive hotels and there for foreign visitors and at some government agencies, such as universities.
Cubans who want to log in often have to report their names to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
In Cuba, the arrest of an American is rare.
Most of the few U.S. citizens who are in prison in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug smuggling, said Gloria Berbena, the press secretary of the U.S. Department of Interest in Havana.
Berbena said she could not give any further information on the arrest.
The arrest and detention are clearly wrong.
An activity that would be legal in any other free society - the release of free mobile phones - is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, head of the American section of the group "Human Rights Watch", which recently released a hard report on freedom in Cuba entitled "New Castro, equal Cuba", a reference to the inauguration of Raul Castro as the leader of the country, who recently replaced the sick brother.
Vivanco said the defendants would be arrested, convicted and imprisoned very often within a day.
He said that probably any solution would be political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, especially at the time when both countries are moving towards more dialogue.
Pakistani government officials reveal plan to send men to Afghanistan
Pakistani authorities discovered on Saturday a supposedly leading head of a conspiracy aimed at sending five men from northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill U.S. soldiers, saying they hope this case could help uncover an extensive network of terrorist applicants who are searching the Internet for radicalized young men.
Investigators said they had been looking for an opaque insurgent, known as Saifullah, who had invited the men to Pakistan after he had found them because one of them had submitted comments on terror attacks on the YouTube website.
After their arrival in Pakistan, Saifullah became the leader of these men and tried to help them reach the remote area in Pakistan’s tribal belt, which is home to Al Kaida and his terrorist training camp.
But a representative of Pakistan’s intelligence agency who was informed about the matter said on Saturday that Saifullah could not convince the al-Qaeda leaders that the men are not part of a CIA conspiracy to undermine the terrorist network.
As a result, they were held for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far away from the inhospitable mountains of the northwest, which have become a terrorist refuge.
They were seen as part of a covert operation.
Therefore, they were rejected, said the government official, who wanted to remain anonymous due to the sensitivity of the matter.
The government official said the men were by no means discouraged and continued to seek the right recommendations to gain access to the al-Qaeda camps when they were arrested by Pakistani law enforcement agencies.
The case of the five men - who are still in Pakistan and being questioned by the FBI - underscores the crucial role of applicants in identifying future terrorists and possibly more importantly, in deciding who is trustworthy.
Since the September 11, 2001 attacks, U.S. intelligence has made it a matter of utmost urgency to accommodate human assets within Al-Qaeda.
The applicants of the organization act as gatekeepers who do not let in those whose commitment to the Holy War is not serious enough and those who could be spies.
American would-be recruits are being subjected to a special test by A Kaida, analysts said.
However, due to their potential access to U.S. targets and their propaganda value, they are also considered extremely attractive to the group.
Evan Kohlmann, senior analyst at the NEFA Foundation based in the United States, said that terrorist groups have also become much more cautious in recent years in terms of who they allow access to, as U.S. intelligence services have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you try to introduce someone into these groups, what better way to go than to follow the recruitment model that so many have already followed?, Kohlmann said.
The model is now based much more on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of protesters call for climate action in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of protesters marched through the streets on Saturday and demanded more bold action by the negotiators in the city’s Bella Congress Centre on climate protection.
Protesters said 100,000 people had joined the event, while police estimates were more likely to be around 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a handful of masked activists lit small explosives near some government buildings in the city centre.
One day, when little happened at the UN-sponsored climate negotiations, thousands of activists with transparency wandered through the city, where in English they said "There is no planet B" and one in Spanish, which explained "The Earth says "Enough".
Some stars joined the protest, for example the Danish model, photographer Helena Christensen, who said that the trips to Peru, her mother’s birthplace, make her aware of what heartbreaking problems the country is facing due to the already noticeable effects of climate change.
That’s part of the reasons why I decided to participate in the big demonstration – to pass on the word and appeal to the world leaders, to bring about a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
It’s not an easy task, but it needs to be done now and there’s no way around it anymore.
Police stopped the protesters from getting too close to the Bella Center and said they had arrested 19 people, mainly due to the fact that they were either masked or carried pocket knives.
According to Danish law, these actions are prohibited during demonstrations.
According to a spectator who did not want to be mentioned because he was involved in the climate negotiations, masked demonstrators in black clothing lit several explosive devices near the Copenhagen main channel, near which there are several ministries.
They threw them near the buildings, he said, adding that they began as light rockets, but were followed by “a few large explosions.”
Inside the convention center, people gathered in front of television screens to watch the demonstration all afternoon.
But the protest has apparently not reached the consciousness of the main officials, such as Su Wie, China’s chief climate negotiator.
When asked if he thinks the demonstration would have a constructive effect on international considerations, he replied in English: "That's something I wasn't aware of at all."
He then continued in Mandarin and said, “Because the venue is big, I can’t hear what’s happening outside.”
He noted that it depends on the individual’s perspective whether the demonstration would harm or help.
It shows the concentration of the general public and various sectors on the topic of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "one can also say that they interfere with the negotiations or the freedom of other people."
Test data show persistent race gap
The testimonials on mathematics performance were welcome good news for public schools in Washington D.C. last week.
Although Washington’s district is still far behind the country’s high-performance schools, the testimonies show that the fourth and eighth graders have made faster progress in the past two years than cities that include Atlanta, Chicago, and New York.
But what is included in the latest figures of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) is the persistent power gap between African-American and white students, both at the local, as well as at the national level.
The average score of white fourth graders from Washington D.C. rose from 262 to 270 in the last two years (on a scale of 500), but that of their African-American peers rose only by three points from 209 to 212.
The power gap actually rose from 53 to 58 points between 2007 and 2009.
The progress of the African-American eight-graders remained essentially the same, falling by a statistically negligible point from 245 to 244.
The average score of white students was not included in the test data, as the sample size was not large enough.
The picture over a six-year period is also not more encouraging.
The gap that separated white and black fourth graders in 2003 when the first NAEP was recorded in this district was 60 scale points (262 to 202).
And although the score that children of both groups have reached has grown during this period, the difference with now 58 points has hardly decreased.
Some of the district's education advocates expressed their concern last week that the results, which were celebrated by school chancellor Michelle A. Rhee and Democratic Mayor Adrian M. Fenty, were largely driven by white students who are already powerful children anyway.
This suggests that we have raised the overall score by treating those at the top of the scale, which is problematic and difficult, said Jeff Smith, a board member of D.C. Voice, a non-profit group that advocates for education equality in Washington D.C..
I’m not jumping up and down for a span of two or three points, said Democratic Washington City Council member Kwame R. Brown, who has a daughter in the fourth grade of Eaton primary school.
Brown, a frequent critic of Rhee’s management style, said the message of the exam score is that the city’s middle schools urgently need attention.
Of course, you always want to see the positive signs, I respect that.
What scares me, however, is that we don’t spend nearly the time and energy we need to use for our middle school.
Rhee said the district must continue to find better ways to meet the needs of low-performance students.
This fall, for example, some teachers will be trained to use a new reading curriculum, the Wilson Reading System, which aims at students in the upper classes of primary and middle school, who have not mastered the basic skills of reading at the beginning of their school career and who are significantly behind their peers.
Daily mathematics, a curriculum that takes the spotlight from kindergarten to sixth grade games and lifelike experiences, was brought to Washington under former senior school inspector Clifford Janey and this curriculum is ascribed to some of the NAEP progresses reported last week.
I mean, we need to continue to work on getting the best measures to benefit students who are below the grade level, Rhee said.
Others say that the NAEP results highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to improve the overall performance of the system while continuing to provide the additional money and resources needed for the low-performance schools to reduce the gap.
This is a serious dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, professor of education at the University of California in Berkeley, who is investigating urban exam results.
The conventional remedy is to focus its resources and management reforms on the schools located in the poorest areas of Washington, D.C.
The objective could bring about political repercussions that are working against this important agenda item.
The weak point, of course, as with other urban school inspectors, is that they are trying to keep the white and black middle class.
Our focus is to ensure that we build a system of great schools.
We need to strengthen our schools in the neighborhoods so that all families, regardless of where they live, can be sure that their children can receive excellent public schooling.
Janey, who is now a school inspector in Newark, said this week in an interview that one of the most important elements to closing the power gap is to extend the traditional public school year, which is currently 180 days in Washington, to compete with charter schools.
One has to increase the school year to about 200 days to have the power to change, said Janey, who came to an agreement with his teacher union last year over 185 days a year, which he considers "one milestone" on the way to a greater increase in the next contract.
Higher education for more people than prospects for the future
The coach arrives at the Gettysburg College with a loud whistle.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, rises out and blinks for a moment at the sight of the white columns, the brick facades and the emerald green lawn.
Graciela’s parents have hardly completed high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela, who was rescued in Silver Spring and now lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a college campus.
Her attitude and that of the group’s other eight-year-olds who explore Gettysburg, where tuition costs $38,690 a year, was more that of an awe-inspiring visitor than that of an enthusiastic future student.
"Yes! Here I will soon be!" cried Graciela, who would like to study medicine, when the guide announced that they had now entered the building for natural sciences.
"Wow, really?" she said thoughtfully, as she was told the low professor-to-student ratio of the school.
The College in Pennsylvania was the seventh to have visited the children on their three-day tour and now they have fully embraced the intended message: the question is not whether to go to college.
The question is where.
On the one hand, there is growing concern about the large number of children born to Hispanic immigrants in the United States, who do not finish high school or become pregnant as a teenager, but on the other hand, there are hundreds of thousands who receive the college education needed to get into the middle class.
In fact, one in five of this “second generation” of Hispanics completes college—which is a remarkable achievement as many of their immigrant parents, mostly from Mexico or Central America, came to the United States without graduating high school.
Their success stories are important, researchers say, because they show the way forward for a generation that will play a huge role in the country’s workforce.
Those who study powerful children say they often have a natural affinity for school and a drive to succeed.
Many of them also have parents who set high goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But counseling programs also play a major role in helping Graciela and millions of children like them get to college, especially if these efforts persist for a long time.
If you look at low-income children whose parents don’t have the experience and skills to help them find their way through the system, then a single measure at some point won’t solve the problem either, said Patricia G<0xC3><0xA1>ndara, a researcher at the University of California in Davis who studied Hispanic students.
We need to think about providing these children with a supportive network from preschool to high school.
The federal program that had funded Graciela’s college tour is a useful example.
It is known as GEAR UP – one-time switching up – and provides more than $300 million a year for local school systems to start college preparation programs that start when low-income students are in middle school and continue to run until they graduate from high school.
According to the U.S. Department of Education, since 1999, the program has helped more than 10 million students, more than 60% of whom have gone to college.
Iraqi Ministry of Oil signs contracts with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns over violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has been able to get larger oil companies to rebuild their damaged infrastructure at two auctions completed on Saturday.
The 10 contracts signed with foreign oil companies by the Iraqi Ministry of Oil suggest that China, Russia and European oil companies are ready to play an important role in the renovation of the Iraqi oil industry, which has been paralyzed by war and economic sanctions for decades.
American companies were only able to book shares in two of the 10 auctioned fields for themselves.
Seven American companies had paid for participating in the second auction, which began on Friday.
The only company that made a bid drew the shortfall.
Two American companies were able to conclude contracts for field auctions in June.
The thinly sown representatives of American oil giants at the opening of the Iraqi oil industry surprised the analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors after 6 years of war, and instead of US companies, Asian and European are paving the way, said Ruba Husari, the editor of Iraq Oil Forum, an online news service.
There will be no more offers in Iraq for a long time.
Security concerns, which were still highlighted by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday and political instability due to the withdrawal of the U.S. military, likely prevented American oil companies from engaging more strongly in Iraq, which has the world’s third largest proven crude reserves.
In some cases, U.S. companies were disadvantaged because competitors, especially the Chinese and other state-controlled energy companies, have significantly lower wage costs and are more likely to take risks because they do not have to hold shareholders accountable.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies that were able to conclude contracts with the Ministry.
Larger U.S. companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, who have maintained close ties with the Iraqi Ministry of Oil and have supported technical advice in recent years, have gone out of business.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main players in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation has offered more contracts than any other company and was able to go home with large packages of contracts for two larger fields.
We all know, said the oil ministry spokesman, Assam Jihad, that China is on its way to becoming one of the greats of the world economy as well as a technology power.
We are convinced that the Chinese company will be able to compete with its competitors and fulfil its obligations to Iraq.
Pre-selected companies submitted bids, which were then compared with the fee per barrel of oil that the ministry was willing to pay to increase the emissions of each field beyond the current level.
Al Kaida's top planner reportedly killed in Pakistan
An apparent US missile strike along the Pakistani border with Afghanistan is said to have killed a top al-Qaeda deployment planner this week, U.S. counter-terrorism officials said on Friday.
This would, if confirmed, be the second deadly attack on a high-ranking terrorist organization this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arabs who, according to U.S. sources and Pakistani officials, were reportedly killed by a number of rockets that hit their vehicle near the city of Miran Shah in the province of North Waziristan on Tuesday.
Local authorities reported that the missiles were fired from a drone type used by the CIA in Pakistan’s lawless tribal belt.
They drove in a white vehicle towards the Afghan border when the car was hit, an official of a Pakistani civil intelligence agency from Miran Shah said by phone.
Locals suspected of belonging to the militants ran to the scene and quickly took in everything left of the "completely destroyed bodies".
The local authorities could not confirm the identity of the victims, but two representatives of the U.S. counter-terrorism led to undetermined evidence that Somali was among the dead.
Somali was described as the leading military planner of Al Kaida, who led operations of terrorist groups outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He was involved in conspiracies around the world, noted a senior official who wanted to remain anonymous, and pointed to the delicate nature of the US airstrikes on Pakistani soil.
If one assumes his central role as a given, this also included planning attacks against the US and Europe.
He took strategic instructions from Al Kaida’s top leaders and turned them into operational plans for possible terrorist attacks.
The second U.S. official said that Somali had quickly risen to the Al Qaeda hierarchy and maintained best links with other extremist groups in the region.
He may not be known to some Americans, said the second official, but this in no way reduces the danger he posed to us and our allies.
If his death were confirmed, Somalia would be the second leading al-Qaeda or Taliban leader killed since September when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant faction in the tribal area and three other top activists.
The pace of attacks by drones by the CIA has declined from an average of six operations per month to two since the summer, according to a summary of the Long War Journal, a website maintained by a non-profit organization.
The decline may be based on improved tactics by terrorist groups that have taken steps to reduce their vulnerability while brutally killing suspected informants, the site reported.
UN Ambassador to Kabul to Resign
The leading UN envoy in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would resign from his office in March, ending a stormy term that was clouded by allegations of widespread corruption in the UN-backed Afghan presidential election.
The Obama administration has decided to send another 30,000 U.S. soldiers to Afghanistan.
The U.N. envoy said he supports the troop increase, but he also expressed his concerns that the U.S. military withdrawal schedule, which is scheduled to begin in 18 months, could cause other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the build-up of Afghan security forces and thereby send the right signal to the Afghans that they can trust the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
Commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civilian helpers to help in the political transition of Afghanistan.
The increase in troops on the military side must correspond to an increase on the civilian side, he said.
Eide said that he did not resign his office, but only fulfilled an agreement made in March 2008 against his family to stay in Kabul for only two years.
He said he wanted the notification to the UN-
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon is now forwarding so that he has time to provide a replacement.
What I said is that he's better off starting to look for a successor, Eide said.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
According to UN officials, Ban has begun the search for a replacement.
The UN officials say he has considered the Swedish-Italian-born Staffan di Mistura, who recently led the UN mission in Baghdad and the French Jean-Marie Guéhenno, who previously led UN peacekeeping operations.
Eid's position in Afghanistan was put to the test after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, accused him in September of preferring President Hamid Karzai in the country's presidential election and concealing evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide has rejected all allegations, but he also said that Galbraith's allegations - which were fired - have undoubtedly harmed the mission because there was already a great deal of skepticism regarding international interference in the election.
Eide said he recommended the appointment of a leading civilian representative to coordinate the relief efforts of US-led forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged the UN leadership to allow its successor to hire more personnel from the United States and other Western countries who donate to the Afghan mission, saying that this would strengthen their confidence in the proper use of their money.
Eide expressed his disappointment at restricting his forces in Afghanistan and said that the cumbersome UN attitudes have undermined his ability to bring in capable people.
The UN rules are designed in such a way that I have been able to hire only one person since May, he said.
This is catastrophic and should not continue that way.
US Secretary of Defense Gates: Iran must expect additional sanctions
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said Friday that the world powers will soon impose “significant additional sanctions” on Iran because he has not participated in talks about his nuclear plans.
Gates spoke to a group of about 300 U.S. soldiers in northern Iraq during a 7-day journey through the war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq and played down the prospect of a military action against the Islamic Republic of Iran.
In Iran, there are no good options for choice, he said in response to a soldier’s question about the likelihood of such a development.
"One of the things that lies on my mind is if we have learned something from Iraq in the last six years, that war has its own unpredictability."
The Obama administration is considering a sanctions package aimed at Iran’s military and political elite, but Gates has announced that some sanctions could also affect the average Syrian.
He said that a "package of positive and negative incentives" is needed "to convince the Iranian government that it is actually less protected with nuclear weapons" because "their people will suffer tremendously" from the sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement from White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the U.S. government has joined European top politicians in warning that Iran must expect “credible” consequences if its nuclear program fails to meet the demands of the UN Security Council and its nuclear monitoring organization, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran continues to claim that knowledge of nuclear technology should only be gained for peaceful purposes.
During talks in Geneva on 1 October, Iran said it would resume talks to restrict its nuclear program and relinquish a substantial portion of its stock of enriched uranium in exchange for much-needed nuclear fuel for its medical research reactor.
The U.S. government has pushed for this kind of agreement to build trust between the two parties and gain time for negotiations.
Iran, however, seems to have left negotiations on the provisional agreements since then -- in part, experts say, because the Iranian leadership disagrees on whether to commit to the United States.
That Iran has simply left the international community with respect to some of the proposals they had already agreed to in early October, frankly, has brought the international community, including the Russians and Chinese, together in a way that they have never been in conjunction with important additional sanctions for Iran, Gates said.
President Obama has set Dec. 31 as a deadline for Iran to respond to these proposals before pursuing other options, including those that Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called “suppressive sanctions.”
In a statement issued in New York City, Iran’s representation at the United Nations condemned what it called “basic and unfounded allegations” by some Security Council members of Iran’s nuclear activities on Thursday, saying they are ready to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers “to achieve an appropriate long-term solution.”
Gates, who was scheduled to return to Washington last Friday, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki in the morning before flying to the oil-rich Kurdish region of Iraq to meet with the soldiers in Kirkuk and with Kurdish officials in Irbil.
Tensions between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq remain high, particularly in terms of borders, property rights and because of the distribution of public revenue.
Gates urged both sides to lower conflict potential to prevent US plans from slowing down U.S. troop strength by the end of August from 115,000 to 50,000.
Gates also attempted to disperse Kurdish concerns about the impending withdrawal of troops, quoting Gates, who told Masud Barzani, president of the Kurdish regional government, "We will preserve your security, your prosperity and your autonomy within a united Iraq.
We will not leave you.”
A change in the price of older China
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters that gave them lectures that "Mother Earth is too tired to entertain other children" and "A baby more means a grave more".
These lessons have taught them so well that when government officials in Shanghai, who, through the low birth rate and the aging population, suddenly began to change course this summer and encouraged young couples to have more than one child, their response was immediate and definitive: "No way."
We have already invested all our time and energy in a child.
There is nothing left for a second child, said Wang, 31, a staff manager with an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the one-child policy in China, which has produced two generations of notoriously fat, disfigured single children, affectionately called “little emperors,” a population crisis in the country is mounting.
The average birth rate has fallen to 1.8 children per couple compared to 6 at the time this policy came into force, the UN says.
The Population Division is set to increase from 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 percent by 2050, well above the global average of about 20 percent.
The imbalance is stronger in rich coastal cities with educated populations, such as Shanghai.
Last year, 60-year-olds and older people accounted for nearly 22 percent of Shanghai’s reported population, while the birth rate was below one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, head of the Shanghai City Population and Family Planning Commission, said that couples of childbearing age must have babies to "help reduce the ratio of the ageing population and alleviate the workforce shortage of the future".
Shanghai will soon be "as old -- but not as rich -- as the industrialized countries, like Japan and Sweden," she said.
A step-by-step relaxation
Anchored in the country’s constitution in 1978, China’s one-child policy may well be the most controversial provision introduced by the ruling Communist Party to this day.
Couples who violate this policy must expect huge fines -- up to their triple annual salary in some regions -- and discrimination at their workplace.
Chinese state officials have attributed it to this policy that the critical use of natural land resources could be avoided, whereas human rights defenders have condemned abuses in the enforcement of the policy.
In rural areas, some officials have forced pregnant women who had already had a child to drive off.
Many couples had also had sex-selective abortions performed, creating an unnaturally high relationship between men and women.
In recent years, government representatives for the population have gradually weakened their stance on one-child policies.
In 2004, they approved more exceptions to the rule -- including city dwellers, members of ethnic minorities, and cases where both husband and wife were single children -- and in 2007 the tone of many hard slogans was softened.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute of Population Research at the University of Beijing, said government officials have recently even discussed more radical changes, for example, allowing couples to have two children, where a partner is a single child.
Shanghai became the first Chinese city in July to launch an aggressive campaign to promote more births.
Posters that taught families to have only one child were replaced almost overnight by guidelines that describe in detail who is eligible for a second child and how to apply for approval.
The city administration has sent out city employees and volunteers for family planning to visit couples at home and slide information sheets under the doors.
She also asked to provide psychological and financial advice for those who have more than one child.
The response was not exactly encouraging, family planning representatives said.
Disappointing reaction
Although officials from a rural small town in the outskirts of Shanghai said that an upswing in the applications of couples who want a second child after the start of the campaign can be seen, the urban districts do not report any change.
In the municipality of Huinan with a population of 115,000, as an example, only four to five applications are received per month.
Disappointed Shanghai officials say the expected number of births in the city in 2010 despite the campaign will still be about 165,000 -- slightly higher than in 2009, but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee of the Shanghai municipality of Caolu, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people don’t want to have children anymore.
They want to give their first best, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would like to have two children and this is also legally allowed.
But, like many Chinese, they only have a minor health and life insurance policy of the government.
Without a social network, they say, this decision would be irresponsible.
People in the West mistakenly rate one-child politics as a human rights issue, Yang said, a civil engineer whose wife is pregnant with her first child in the seventh month.
Yes, you rob us of the opportunity to have more than one child.
But the problem is not just politics.
The problem is money.
Other couples indicate psychological reasons for their hesitation.
Wang, the HR manager, said she only wants a child because she was also a single child. "We were the center of the family and used to everyone taking care of us.
We’re not used to caring for others and we don’t really want to.”
Chen Zijian, a 42-year-old to which a translation company belongs, said it more bluntly.
For middle-aged parents with a dual career, through which the birth rate drops, he said, it’s about being successful and for that you have to be selfish.
The age group of today’s 20- to 39-year-olds grew up watching their parents fight during the early days of the Chinese capitalism experiment and they don’t want a life like that for themselves, he said.
Even a single child, he said, places huge demands on the time of the parents.
A mother must give up her social life for at least two years.
Then there is the space question -- "You have to rebuild your apartment" -- and the life planning -- "If the child is 9 months old, you must already have a CV for the best preschools."
Most of his friends are willing to go through this once, Chen said, but not twice.
Our generation is the first to achieve a higher standard of living, he said.
We don’t want to make too many sacrifices.
UN Group Designs Emission Reduction Plan
The UN-sponsored climate conference, which has so far been characterised by wild posing and mutual accusations, has again set a focus on Friday with the publication of a document that records an ambitious reduction in greenhouse gases for the next 40 years, with the industrial nations having to shoulder the greatest burdens in the near future.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement on the regulation of greenhouse gases, has shown both the remaining obstacles and the way forward.
But he has been seen as an important step forward in a negotiation that is running out of time as more than 100 top politicians from all over the world will arrive in Copenhagen next week.
The text, formulated by a specially created UN working group, is silent about the amount of money that rich countries should give to poor countries so that they can cope with global warming in the short and long term.
It also offers a range of options for key issues, including how industrial and large emerging markets can limit their carbon emissions and how high the upper limit of the global temperature rise that policymakers would be contributing to.
The process is given a great deal of flexibility, according to John Coequyt, senior representative of the Sierra Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who designed the six-page document, has put together a 180-page negotiating text to put the focus on what the UN’s leading climate protection representative, Yvo de Boer, has called “the big deal.”
It shows the outline of a possible agreement in which industrial nations would jointly reduce their emissions by 25 to 45 percent by 2020, compared to the 1990 limit values, while larger developing countries would reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 percent over the same period.
Together, countries could reduce emissions by 50 to 95 percent by 2050.
The European Community has also given the talks on Friday a boost through its pledge to provide $3.6 billion a year over the next three years to help poorer countries adapt to the effects of climate change – from mastering floods and droughts to avoiding deforestation.
Friday, however, brought the same verbal fireworks that the talks had scheduled for the last week.
U.S. climate commissioner Todd Stern has rejected formulations that call for binding reductions in greenhouse gas emissions for industrialized countries, compared with voluntary reductions for larger emerging economies, if these are not funded by the industrial nations.
This move announced that the Obama administration is moving a harder line with China than the Bush administration’s representatives not even two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without larger emerging countries getting up and taking action, Stern said, who also complained that the text does not go far enough to ensure that the reductions could also be confirmed by outsiders.
Stern gave his statement an hour after Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister He Yafei's statement, saying that there was a lack of "reason" for the leading American climate negotiator or that it was "highly irresponsible" for him to say at the beginning of the week that the United States would not financially help China cope with global warming.
As the future economic march direction of the great world powers is at stake, both within the industrial nations and between the industrial nations and the emerging countries have opened up breaking lines.
The current struggle relates equally to the saving of individual economies, as well as to the saving of the planet, with China and the United States abetting their corresponding commitments, while poorer countries claim that the two dozen most influential countries would ignore the scientific need to take bolder measures.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said it is not surprising that the major powers are fighting for who should bear the cost of curbing greenhouse gas emissions, as even affected countries have moved to take more aggressive action to hold the countries with very high greenhouse gas taxes accountable for their actions.
This is clearly a game from which a new economic dominance will develop, according to Ulate, who also works as a regional climate change consultant for Conservation International in Mexico and Central America.
Some of the countries most exposed to the effects of climate change said they would continue to fight for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although the leading participants say the talks will at best lead to a political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States with 43 members presented a 24-page draft treaty early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who heads the international climate negotiations for the European Commission, said that the small island states’ offensive exerts “political pressure on the entire political process,” partly because they are now united and demand action from emerging countries, such as China and India.
The talks received a new urgency as delegates focused on the fact that most open questions still need to be clarified before the leaders arrive to reach an agreement.
High-ranking representatives, such as Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and Chinese Vice Minister, disembarked their planes and rushed through the corridors of the Bella Center to meetings behind closed doors and press conferences to stake claims negotiated over the next week.
The sheer scale of the gathering -- 13,000 people enter and leave the convention center every day, guitar-playing activists hold nightly shows in which they make fun of the countries that they think betrayed and sold, and draft contracts are passed on by hand rather than by email -- is already a challenge.
The intensity is just starting to build up: almost all the important ministers are now here and from Wednesday 60 will be leaders in Copenhagen.
We come to the Oberliga, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Vice President of Global Politics of the Organization Conservation International.
The heavyweights are coming.
UK’s first 225 km/h fast train redefines Monday feeling
Monday morning at 5 a.m., a pipe will penetrate the darkness to announce a train departure that represents a revolution in traffic in the UK.
The first high-speed commuter train in the country will reach 225 km/h on its lightning ride from Ashfort, Kent, to London St. Pancras and travel 93 km in 38 minutes.
As Lord Adonis, the Transport Minister, Dame Kelly Holmes will then board the first Javelin commuter service from London.
He hopes that the new service will eventually connect Britain to an international rail network with faster, more reliable trains and connect the large metropolitan areas of the Midlands, the North and Scotland to London.
The neglected province could become vibrant commuter cities, working hours would be radically reduced, and changing aircraft and car to rail would reduce national carbon emissions and traffic congestion.
In theory, the three major parties believe in this vision.
But the many billions of British pounds needed to build a new national rail network, the inevitable planning battle and fears of environmental damage could still slow down the British high-speed rails.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company founded in January to present a feasibility study to the government, Lord Adonis will submit the report on 30 December, according to the Times.
As a result, it receives a detailed route map of the next planned stage of the high-speed rail network.
The new rail line, which will connect London to the West Midlands, will pass by urban areas and places where the impact on the environment is controversial, with a five-metre leeway.
In the open ground, the plan will show the concept within a distance of 25 meters from the final track.
HS2 will also create three options for a larger, north-facing high-speed rail network.
Lord Adonis will respond to this in spring.
The preferred proposed option is a Y-shaped route in which a single high-speed route would lead to the West Midlands.
The route would split into or near Birmingham and one branch would lead west of the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and another to the northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would lead to Scotland.
“It seems to be the best working option,” said a railroad insider.
After completion, the journey time between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first section, which would not be opened before 2025, would allow travellers to travel the London-Birmingham route in 49 minutes, compared to today just over an hour.
The designs offer trains the opportunity to drive at a speed of 400 km/h, making the UK rail network the fastest in Europe.
The first route was planned in such a way that 400 meters long trains with a maximum capacity of 1,100 people can drive on it.
Up to 18 trains could be in operation per hour on the London-Birmingham route.
This, in turn, would mean that London would require a terminal station on which 20,000 passengers per hour could be handled.
Given the spatial constraints in the capital, it is expected that an existing station would be expanded to accommodate the high-speed network.
Rail experts say that only St. Pancras International or Euston have this potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not this plan should be continued, but the lengthy public consultation and planning measures mean that a final decision will only be made after the parliamentary elections.
But even if it sets the wheels in motion, the rail network must be built in sections.
The trains would first have to switch from the high-speed trains to existing rail lines in the north of Birmingham, which would allow the journey time between London and Scotland to remain for more than three hours.
This is seen as a crucial point of cracking in order to ensure a change from plane to train, a measure of direction for the rail revolution.
Taxpayers come up for mortgage for 75,000 pounds of a conservative’s orangery
Alan Duncan, the Conservative’s leading House of Commons member, has billed the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year for the cost of an orangery he could build in his residential home in his constituency.
The party’s prison spokesman, who was demoted by David Cameron for complaining that housemates must live “of lean rations,” has raised his mortgage by <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 to allow himself to be built an oak timber factory plant at his second home in Rutland.
He was allowed to charge the taxpayer the additional amount of interest, a sum of hundreds of pounds per month.
The House of Commons officials approved the applications at the time, and they were also not questioned by Sir Thomas Legg, who carried out a review of the spending of the House of Commons members. Last night Duncan said the applications could not have been "more clean or understandable".
Duncan, one of the richest lower house members, owns a two-story house in a village in his Rutland and Melton constituency.
Nearby houses have achieved a purchase price of almost one million pounds (1.1 million euros).
The ground floor includes kitchen, living and dining room, but the Fees Office, an expenditure control post of the lower house, has agreed that Duncan needs more space.
Last year, he cultivated a conservatory called "orangery" in the plans.
Neighbors described him as a "glass house for entertainment".
Duncan was also not asked by the Standards and Privileges Committee to comment on increased borrowing during a recent investigation of his previous mortgage contracts.
The Committee cleared him of the breach of the rules last month following an examination of his expenditure.
In 2004, Duncan transferred security for a mortgage of <0xC2><0xA3>271,406 (300,000) from his London house to his constituency, which he had purchased in 1991, a year before his election as a Member of Parliament.
This week’s published documents show that Duncan received about 1,400 pounds (1,500 euros) of mortgage interest each month by March last year.
In April, his claims rose to more than 1,800 pounds (2,000 euros) per month.
Duncan’s RBS mortgage interest rate hasn’t changed during this period, suggesting that the entire increase was used to fund the <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 cash raise (€85,000).
The normal incremental RBS mortgage rate dropped from 7.94 percent in December 2007 to 4 percent in March of this year, where it still stands.
The latest documents published by the House of Commons show that Duncan continued to assert his right to <0xC2><0xA3>1,250 (1,400) per month this May.
Duncan lost his post as opposition leader of the House of Commons in September after an undercover reporter filmed him when he said after the spending scandal that MPs would live "of lean rations."
“In essence, working for the state means living on lean rations and being treated like S*****e.”
He said, “I have spent my money on my garden, and I claim to have a very small share of what belongs to me.
And I could have claimed the whole damn sum, but I don't."
The member of parliament, millionaire from his previous career as an oil wholesaler, was attacked for the first time in May for his expenses when it became clear that he had demanded thousands of pounds for his garden before he had agreed with the Fees Office that this could be considered “excessive demand.”
An activist dug a hole in Duncan’s lawn in the form of a pound sign after it was announced that he had claimed 4,000 pounds (4,500 euros) over three years.
When asked about the raised mortgage last night, Duncan said, "This had been approved both by the Fees Office and subsequently by Legg to increase value."
He added: "There is no debate about evasion and slurping or bending the rules or the like.
Everything is fully transparent and moves strictly within the rules, is approved and everything.
It couldn’t be cleaner and clearer.”
Come all your faithful to admire Brighton's beach hut Advent calendar
For the winter months, beach huts in Brighton have found a new content as an interactive Advent calendar.
"Beyond", an alternative church group that spurs spiritual discoveries through creativity, has invited 24 owners to decorate their cottages with Christmas songs as a theme for every December day.
The event started on 1 December and visitors were allowed to watch the latest hut every day from 17:30 to 18:30 with free mulled wine and traditional Mince Pies, dried pastries.
The Christmas songs selected so far are "I saw three ships", "O come, o come, Emmanuel" and "The first No<0xC3><0xAB>l", where the cottage decoration is the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is a volunteer minister of the Chichester Diocese and head of Beyond.
He said, “We want to make religion more important to people in a post-Christian society.
Why do we, as a church, expect people to come to a strange old building? I think the church should go to the people and hold exciting celebrations.
The idea for the beach hut Advent calendar began as a conversation with some friends at dinner.
Brighton is such a fantastically creative and vibrant place and we try to express this through our spirituality."
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and the world for the climate.
Tens of thousands of people have demonstrated worldwide and in Copenhagen on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding agreement on the fight against climate warming, where police have made several hundred arrests.
At least 30,000 people, according to police, hundreds of thousands according to the organizers, marched in the cold of the Danish capital, on the edge of the United Nations Climate Conference, which should lead to a conclusion by Friday that could come into force from 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish chairman of the climate conference, the increasing mobilization in the world for the climate contributes to this, which is illustrated by these demonstrations that the "political price" of a failure in Copenhagen would be very high.
The incidents in the Danish capital took place shortly after the train passed, when a group of 300 demonstrators, dressed entirely in black, had smashed windows with paving stones and hammers, a journalist from the AFP noted.
Anti-quiet police officers have intervened immediately and without regard.
Police have announced that, according to their assessment, 600 to 700 people, mostly members of the Blacks Blocs, these extremely violent splinter groups, who have already made themselves famous at the NATO Summit in Strasbourg, were arrested in eastern France, in April.
The Coalition Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the organizers of the demonstration, has sharply criticized the conditions under which hundreds of militant supporters had been arrested "without distinction", and has stressed that about a hundred of them "were still being held in the streets on Saturday evening", despite the extreme cold with handcuffs and sitting in position.
The rather peaceful move has gone from Parliament towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations took place.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to get in.
A stage was installed to welcome the intended speakers for an evening of candlelight, with the participation of former South African archbishop, Desmond Tutu.
The majority of the demonstrators arrived with buses and trains from major European cities, but also many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, as well as some Africans.
About 3,000 people, most of them with sky blue raincoats, made a first run in the morning in Copenhagen, as they followed the call of Earth's friends to form "blue tides" for the "climate justice".
Today, we are going to the streets to demand a reparation of ecological guilt in favor of the South, said Lidy Nacpil, Filipino activist at the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can’t go on like this and say that we have time,” said Angelique Kidjo, a singer from Benin.
There are rivers in Africa that dry out, where you can walk, just as it has never been the case in the past.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, founded in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the movement of globalization critics has approached environmental organizations.
European MP José Bové, the figure of the globalization critic, announced that he came to Copenhagen to link "climate justice and social justice": "Today there is no difference between the fight against climate warming and the fight for another world."
The Asia-Pacific region, where many islands are located, which are particularly vulnerable as a result of warming, has given the start shot for the demonstrations.
Some 50,000 people have walked the streets, according to the organizers in Australia.
In Manila, there were several hundred people, mostly students, who marched in red and coughed bandanas, in which you praised the solar energy.
In Hong Kong or in Jakarta, but also in Canada, marches of a few hundred demonstrators took place to demand an energetic approach to climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organized by the network "350" have gathered a few hundred people, namely in Paris, in Marseille (south), in Lille (north), in Bordeaux (west) and in Lyon (east).
A number of people gathered in Geneva.
The separatist Abkhazia has elected its president, Georgia denies that this is a "strike".
Abkhazia elected its president on Saturday, which happened a little more than a year after Moscow recognized this pro-Russian separatist Georgian territory as independent, Tbilisi denounced the "strike".
About 131,000 people were called to participate in the first election after the August 2008 Russo-Georgian War for control of the South Ossetian territory, another Georgian secessionist territory recognized by Russia.
The polling stations closed at 5pm GMT.
The voter turnout was about 58% a few hours before the local voter turnout, according to the Abkhazia Election Commission officials.
The first preliminary results should be announced on the night from Saturday to Sunday.
The five candidates, including the previous president, Serguei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which condemns the election.
These elections are a farce.
On his part, the Georgian president, Mikheil Saakachvili, regrets that Abkhazia is now under Russian total occupation, his press spokeswoman, Manana Manjgaladze, has explained.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognized the independence of this area with 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world perceive it as a part of Georgia, which is illegally occupied by Russia.
After separating from Georgia during the 1992-93 conflict, with several thousands of people dying, Abkhazia wants to prove by means of this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage in our new life, a new era, as an independent state, Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian who claims to have elected Mr Bagapch.
She was one of the voters who went to choose a polling station located in a school in the capital Soukhoumi, a beautiful white building with a few palm trees in front of the entrance.
The question of Russian dominance is the heart of this presidential election, in a region with beautiful landscapes on the Black Sea.
Large signs on which Bagapch can be seen on the side of the Russian president and the head of government, Dmitry Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, are everywhere in this small area that has 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, located in the east of the country, the district chief, Beslan Archba, has prepared a warm welcome to the Russian representatives who have come to oversee the election.
We, the Abkhazia people, are grateful, he said at a small celebration, as an allusion to Moscow’s support, especially with regard to the decision to recognize Abkhazia’s independence.
I hope that your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, Alexei Ostrovsky, a member of the Russian parliament, answered and raised a glass of vodka.
The opposition, for its part, represented by the former vice president and two Russian businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, has criticized the agreements reached with Moscow last year, as the one in which Abkhazia Russia leaves control of the railway for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Banba, claims neither to support the current government nor the opposition.
A majority of 50% plus one vote is needed to win the election.
If none of the candidates reaches this limit, a second round of voting must be organised within two weeks.
Climate: Demos Worldwide, incidents in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people have demonstrated all over the world on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding contract from the Copenhagen Climate Conference, where police have arrested at any time ready to use, about 700 people, on the edge of an important demonstration.
Thirty thousand people, according to police, hundreds of thousands according to the organizers have demonstrated in the afternoon cold in the Danish capital, which until 18 December receives delegates from 193 countries, who are looking for an agreement to enter into force on 1 January 2013.
From the parliament, the peaceful train marched towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations take place.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the center and did not attempt to invade.
A stage was built to welcome the intended speakers for an evening of candlelight, with the participation of former South African archbishop, Desmond Tutu.
A few moments after the train had passed, a group of demonstrators dressed entirely in black and armed with bricks and hammers began to strike discs, a journalist from the AFP noted.
Anti-quiet policemen have immediately encircled you and have intervened without regard by throwing some of you on the ground.
Police have announced that 600 to 700 people have been arrested and have made it clear that they are mainly members of the Blacks Blocs, these extremely violent splinter groups that have already made themselves famous at the NATO Summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, in April.
In the evening, a police officer suffered an injury from a paving stone during the incidents in which about twenty people were provisionally arrested, according to police. Four vehicles burned near an occupied house.
"We've got the extreme groups under control," police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen said, while the helicopters of the law enforcement forces crawled in the air.
Most of the demonstrators who travelled by train or by private vehicle from German cities, London, Amsterdam or Milan were Europeans.
However, there were also many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, and Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in the sky blue raincoat, formed in the morning in Copenhagen after the call of the "Friends of the Earth" to a first group, which should represent the "blue seas" for "climate justice".
“Today we are going to the streets to demand that the ecological debt be repaid to the people of the South,” said Lidy Nacpil, an activist at the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
“We can’t say, ‘We still have time,’” says singer Angélique Kidjo from Benin.
“In Africa, there are rivers that fade, there are watercourses through which you can run, which has never been the case before.”
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which was launched in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the movement of anti-globalization has approached environmental organizations.
French MP José Bové told AFP that he had come to Copenhagen to “connect climate justice and social justice.” “There is no difference today between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world.”
The organization Oxfam has mobilized several personalities, such as the Danish model Helena Christensen or the former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson, who turn to the masses.
The Asia-Pacific region, where there are many islands that are particularly vulnerable to global warming, has given the impetus for the demonstrations.
In Australia, according to the organizers, about 50,000 people walked on the street.
In Manila, a few hundred people, in the majority of students, dressed red with bandanas, have advertised in front of the city administration of the Philippine capital for solar energy.
Hundreds of protesters have also gathered in Hong Kong and Jakarta in an action against climate change.
In France, several hundred people joined forces during the demonstrations organised by the "Net of 350", particularly in Paris, Marseille in the south, Lille in the north, Bordeaux in the west and Lyon in the east.
Several people gathered in Geneva.
The subjects of geography and history, according to Chatel, emerge strengthened from the school reform of the Lycés.
National Education Minister Luc Chatel explained in an interview published in the Sunday newspaper "Journal du dimanche" that the subjects geography and history emerge strengthened from the school reform of the lycés, even if they are not taught mandatory in the terminal (12th school year).
"The students of the Premi<0xC3><0xA8>re (11th year of school) now have every four hours of the week and the same program," confirms Mr. Chatel.
For the minister, "this hypocrisy must be overcome", because according to him, "the scientific profile is no longer a scientific profile", but, in general, a concentration "of the best student."
"The economic-social and the literary profile (ES and L) must not become a sub-profile of the scientific", he continued, emphasizing: "I have not heard many historians and intellectuals who have been outraged by the lack of historical-geographical education in the terminal on technical lycees."
On Saturday, an IFOP survey published in the Humanité found that nearly seven out of ten French (69%) criticized the government’s project of abolishing compulsory education in history and geography in Terminal S (12th school year with scientific profile). Many teachers and intellectuals also complained about this project, as well as the left and some representatives of the right.
The Minister replied that there was no question of restricting the philosophy of the Terminal S programme.
Luc Chatel also defended the educational reform for teachers, while 16 organizations (students and trade unions) called for Tuesday’s protest against the project, which she believes will be the victim of the educational training of future teachers.
The Minister stated that in Master 2 (M2) at the beginning of the year, they are subject to a subject-specific suitability test and at the end of the year, an admission test in which their teaching skills are tested.
In addition, they carry out internships during the year in the M2 and then teach a year before the students as teachers in the internship.
He continued, “If you add all the internships offered before the performance exam, you’ll reach even more hours you’ve spent in front of the students, i.e. more than 300 hours.”
Finally, the minister declared that he wanted to offer "the individual right to education" - a "thing that does not exist in the education of the people."
He confirmed once again that he wants to abolish the school card "until 2012".
15 minutes for the climate at the "Ecole Normale Supérieure"
Fifteen minutes to talk about the deployment at the Copenhagen Summit: this is the challenge that Jean Jouzel, vice president of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, had to face on Saturday morning at the Ecole Normale Supérieure in the Rue d'Ulm in Paris.
As a journalist from the AFP noted, the Nobel Peace Prize winner Jean Jouzel opened the first of the "Ernest" conferences, in which experts each turn to the public for fifteen minutes with filmed contributions.
You want to do something that reaches people and makes them feel like they want to learn more, explained Edouard Hannezo, 22 years old and one of the organizers of this day, on the edge of the conference. The name of this event goes back to the name that the students gave to the fish in the pool of the school.
"Among the experts, around twenty participants were selected, even after their charisma," he said.
“You can talk about climate warming for hours, but the core goals can also be explained in a few minutes,” said Jean Jouzel of the AFP, who only spoke freely with the help of films in front of about 50 people.
"This is part of our role as a scientist," he stressed in the hope that the audience may derive from the fact that "the Copenhagen conference is based on an absolutely serious scientific dossier."
The videos filmed by these conferences will be available online on the school’s website from December 15.
The next "Ernest" day is scheduled for February and will take place every two months thereafter.
Delay in payment : angry prison guards, actions planned
The unions of law enforcement officials have called for a general day of action on Friday to ensure that the premiums and overtimes whose payment was postponed for budgetary reasons until January are transferred before the Christmas holidays.
The 2nd union of prison officials ("FO-Pénitentiaire") called on employees who have no service to demonstrate in front of the prison on Tuesday morning and to block them in order to draw attention to the "theft of what they are entitled to".
The 3rd union of law enforcement officials ("CGT-Pénitentiaire") called for "a strong mobilization in the various prisons", on which the non-payment of the overtime, night surcharges and Sunday and public holiday surcharges in December is burned as "harmful and unacceptable".
The first union of law enforcement officials, the Autonomous Federal Criminal Institution Union (UFAP/UNSA), called for "general mobilizations (...) to show discontent and anger."
The head of the Correctional Service and the Ministry of Justice stated that the overtime in 2009 has risen sharply and not all of them were budgeted, but they guarantee that the remaining claims will be paid in January.
As the Justice Department said in the evening, Mich<0xC3><0xA8>le Alliot-Marie sent a letter to the unions of law enforcement officials guaranteeing that the payment will be made next month.
"I know very well about the staff's efforts to keep and modernise our prison system functioning," the Justice Minister said in a letter.
"I have instructed the head of the prison to take immediate action so that such a situation, which has arisen due to a lack of assessment of the overtime involved, will not repeat itself in the future," Ms Alliot-Marie added.
The December salary is therefore lean, except for the management staff who benefit from high service and target premiums, explains the UFAP/UNSA, for which the "budgetary constraints" must be maintained.
"This is an absolute scandal," the interregional trade union FO in Marseille is outraged and announces that it will boycott "all meetings and convocations" until new instructions.
"The staff does not go to work on Sundays and public holidays, if the hours of October in December are still not paid. This also applies to their overtime hours", the FO Rh<0xC3><0xB4>ne-Alpes-Auvergne also threatens.
“At a time when more and more tasks are being imposed on us without hiring more staff, the attempt to enrich the staff’s funds is more than inappropriate,” the Bordeaux CGT union said.
According to the unions, the situation is not the same in all regions; some are less affected than others.
In any case, however, it is wrong, stated the Secretary General of the UFAP, Jean-Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Forget.
Obama thinks he is distributing Christmas better gifts than he gets himself.
US President Barack Obama, who will spend Christmas with his family for the first time in the White House, has told TV talkmaster Oprah Winfrey that he is distributing better gifts than he gets himself.
In a special broadcast broadcast on Sunday evening via the ABC channel, the president and his wife Michelle gave an insight into how they will spend the holidays in their new illustrious home.
Even Bo, the little four-legged companion of the family, will be part of the game.
“Santa Claus also loves Bo,” Michelle Obama affirms, adding that the dog also receives a gift.
Michelle Obama strongly rejected her husband’s claims about the quality of the gifts. “I gave you beautiful gifts last year,” she teases the president.
"So please," he scolded her, pointing to the pearl chain of the First Lady: "And who gave you this?"
During this one-hour broadcast in a casual atmosphere with the well-known television presenter who had so vehemently supported Barack Obama during his campaign, the president and his wife also talked about gifts they had most loved as a child.
Barack Obama recalled a bike with ten gears and also a basketball that his father, whom he saw very rarely, had brought with him for Christmas from Kenya.
“I remember when my father visited us once for Christmas and brought me a basketball,” he said.
“It wasn’t until much later in my life that I understood that I had this ball from him.”
The First Lady remembered her doll house.
“I didn’t know how to arrange the furniture in a house at all, so I put them all on the wall instead of grouping them around the fireplace, but I loved this little doll house,” Michelle Obama said.
Johnny Hallyday re-operates, RTL confirms he has been transferred to artificial coma
Johnny Hallyday was again operated in Los Angeles for significant "damage" after surgery in France. According to the people surrounding him, the situation was "under control", although RTL confirmed that the singer was put into artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rock musician was re-operated at Cedars-Sina<0xC3><0xAF> Hospital in Los Angeles on the night of Wednesday to Thursday after American doctors found "damage resulting from the operation of a disc incident" he had suffered in Paris on November 26, according to his Paris production company, which added that these damage would have required a re-operation.
The singer’s production company nevertheless wanted to clarify that the situation was “under control” and said that a new medical opinion would be available within 48 hours at the latest.
However, according to RTL, the partner during the singer's last tour, Johnny Hallyday was put into an artificial coma to avoid "pain and complications".
However, only after 48 hours had a little more certainty about the patient’s condition when he opened his eyes, RTL added.
At the request of the AFP, there was no confirmation or comment from the production company.
RTL also confirms that "certain sources emerge" that after its first operation in Paris, "no drainage" was laid.
The rocker had been operated at Parc Monceau's international clinic due to a herniated disc.
The procedure planned for several days was performed by neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known doctor who had already treated many stars.
This was not available on Thursday evening for comments to RTL.
After the operation of Johnny Hallyday, the singer was hospitalized at Cedars-Sina<0xC3><0xAF> Hospital in Los Angeles on Monday for a follow-up infection following the procedure.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, who is very close to Johnny Hallyday, told RTL on Thursday that his friend was just going through a "deep valley", but he assured himself that there was "no need to worry" about the rock musician, as he was "a good fighter".
"He had called me before he left for Los Angeles, and I told him it was nonsense to put himself on a plane for 12 hours after such an operation, which is not going to happen," Mitchell said.
On Wednesday evening, the singer's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, confirmed that Johnny Hallyday "reacts well to antibiotics" and that "the infection is contained."
Mr. Camus also stated that he had spoken to Laeticia, the singer's wife, and that he had not felt any particular concern.
Nevertheless, the singer’s health concern had grown ever greater since he spent nine days in a hospital in July after falling on his yacht.
Two months later, to the general surprise, it was said that Johnny Hallyday had a "small bowel cancer surgery" which led to a slight infection.
At the end of September, the singer recorded his long "Tour 66" as a farewell tour.
Since then, however, every health problem has been extensively commented on. Fans and journalists have not escaped the fact that the singer on stage had trouble moving.
It was not until mid-November that the people around him had to deny re-entry to the hospital.
Euro-2009/Kurzbahn: First place for Bousquet over his favorite distance
Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, three-time medal winner at the 2009 Swimming World Championships, won an international title on Thursday about his favorite distance, 50m freestyle, at the Euro-2009 on the short track in Istanbul.
On the first day of this competition, when the polyurethane suits were allowed for the last time, there were only three world records, while a true record flood was expected.
A record was improved by the Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto over 4 x 200 m layers and the other two by Russia at 4 x 50 m layers of the gentlemen.
Damage to Bousquet, who wanted to grab the world record at the 50m freestyle, whose record he holds in the big pool (20.94).
At one of the two king's distances in swimming, 50m freestyle, the 28-year-old Frenchman claimed himself in 20.53 sec. in a final with ten swimmers at the start (usually there are eight) - a premiere at international level.
Bousquet defeated Croats Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but failed to break the world record (20.30) as planned.
"You can believe in ever greater things and in this case, if the world record is within my reach, I will try."
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers started out in polyurethane suits, which are banned from January 1, 2010.
With 238 world records since February 2008, these combinations finish their epic in Istanbul, which began in 1999 at the same competition for the first time.
The use of the combination has not paid off this time for the German Paul Biedermann, double world champion in the pool this summer in Rome and world record, in the end.
The young swimmer has not managed to improve his best time over 400m freestyle (3:32.77), yet he has prevailed with the second best time in his career (3:34.55), ahead of Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
“I didn’t give everything this time.
I knew I couldn’t win a world record today, but I defended my title and fulfilled my task.”
"Lobintsev will be a serious opponent in the future," Biedermann said.
US: Zola grave plate estimated at $1.5 million
A Roman tomb plate, which appeared in particular with the French writer Emile Zola, was estimated at $1.5 million over its value on Thursday, according to art dealer Sotheby's.
This plate is two meters long and 63 cm high. It dates from the III century AD and has always been valued at 150,000 to 250,000 dollars.
The marble, on which "four scenes of Dionysus are depicted in a sophisticated architectural decor, surrounded by satyrs and bacchus figures, is a rare piece. There are only four or five of them in the world," said Florent Heintz, vice president for auctioning Roman and Egyptian antiques at Sotheby's, on Tuesday to the AFP.
It was sold under hundreds of pieces.
“Sales are still going on, but this part is certainly what buyers have offered most of the time,” Sotheby’s spokesman Dan Abernethy told AFP.
The discovery of this acquisition of the marble part by Emile Zola goes back a long way.
The record was at home in Rome for almost 300 years in the famous collection of the Borghese family, after which she appeared piece by piece with the French actress Cécile Sorel, who found use in her Parisian hotel bathroom and with Paul Reynaud, Minister of the Third French Republic and President of the Council before Marshal Pétain came to power.
The next fifty years are in the dark.
While searching the Louvre database, Florent Heintz discovered that this record was part of an "inheritance of Emile Zola", which was opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of the "Thér<0xC3><0xA8>se Raquin" and the fresco "Rougon-Macquart".
Zelaya's exit attempt from Honduras towards Mexico has been thwarted
On Thursday, Mexico had declared the conditions for the transfer of the overthrown Honduran President Manuel Zelaya to domestic soil as no longer compatible after this leadership had been rejected by the coup government as unacceptable.
After a telephone conversation with President Zelaya that took place last night, everything seems to indicate that there is disagreement about the possibilities of carrying out this transfer, Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa said.
According to the immigration authority, the plane provided by the Mexican government, which arrived in Salvador on Wednesday for the purpose of transferring M. Zelayas, had returned to its place of departure.
The coup government wanted to require M. Zelaya to "abstain" and to request political asylum for him abroad under management.
The overthrown president, however, refused to do so because he wished to return to Mexico as a welcome, acting head of state.
The coup regime "has suffered a renewed failure by trying to move me to give up on my costs (...), they wanted me to resign," Zelaya told Radio Globo on Thursday, in which he has frequently spoken to Radio Globo since the beginning of the political crisis, which has been going on for five months in the Central American country.
I like to stay here for ten years, here I have my guitar, added the overthrown president, who had fled to the Brazilian embassy of Tegucigalpa two and a half months ago, under the influence of some chords.
The Mexican embassy has presented us with a request for guidance, but unfortunately we cannot accept it, as it does not include a request for asylum, had on Wednesday Oscar Raul Matute, Interior Minister of the coup government, told Honduran Radio HRN.
I am not seeking asylum in any country, Manuel Zelaya had answered in an interview with the channel Telesur, whose seat is in Caracas.
A possible departure from Honduras, he had stressed, he would only do as president of the Honduran people.
The rumours of M. Zelayas’ departure on Wednesday mobilized the supporters of the overthrown president, who had opened up to the Brazilian embassy and gathered around it, and the military had intensified its efforts.
Brazil’s Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticized the coup government’s position.
This, according to his assessment, reveals the marginal character of this government in the face of international norms.
Zelaya, who had approached Socialist Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, had been overthrown on 28 June, on the day of the referendum organised by him in preparation for his re-election, against the advice of the Supreme Court, the Army and Congress.
He had returned from exile in Costa Rica on 21 September and had fled to the Brazilian embassy.
If he leaves, he will be arrested for treason, which he is accused of by the judiciary, according to the coup government.
Putsch President Roberto Micheletti has managed to organize a presidential election on November 29 to replace M. Zelaya.
Porfirio Lobo was recognized by the United States in the course of the contested election, but was rejected by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil.
Three days later, the Congress had voted massively against M. Zelaya's return to office until the end of his mandate on January 27.
Wall Street in recovery, U.S. trade balance feeds optimism
The New York Stock Exchange concluded on Thursday with a high, the US trade balance figures testify to a price recovery of the United States shares and their partners: the Dow Jones has increased by 0.67%, the Nasdaq by 0.33%.
According to the stock market close figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has risen from 68.78 points to 10.405.83 points, the Nasdaq in turn, which is dominated by technology, from 7.13 points to 2,190.06 points.
The Extended Index Standard & Poor <0xCC><0x81>s 500 was credited with 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1,102.35 points.
There is good news from various industries, Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial judged.
However, this remains anecdotal under the premise that the market only focuses on “half-full glasses”, she said.
According to Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors are mainly fixed on the figures of the US trade balance, "which has an improvement in activity in the fourth quarter".
The U.S. trade deficit fell by 7.6% to $32.9 billion in October compared to September.
In contrast, the analysts had expected a deficit increase.
Both imports and exports have increased.
The big news is the increase in the total volume of trade, especially in freight exports, which reflects the economic growth of the main trading partners of the United States, said Christopher Cornell of Business Research Economy.com.
In contrast, unemployment reports in the United States have gone up against all expectations last week and have now reached the level of 474,000 requests.
However, the average value of new job seekers over the past four weeks has “falled to the low of the year,” Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors said.
The bond market has fallen.
The return on government bonds to 10 years has increased to 3,482% compared to the 3,432% from Tuesday evening, the return on bonds to 30 years to 4,492% compared to the 4,408% from the previous evening.
Cuba: Hundreds of Partisans standing in power chant "Ladies in White"
Some hundreds of partisans standing in Cuban power on Thursday robbed the wives of political prisoners gathered in Havana for the purpose of the World Human Rights Day and also thwarted another rally, temporarily arresting a good dozen dissidents.
Around the forty "women in white", wives or close political prisoners, were plucked out on the open road by partisans of the government under Raul Castro, just as they were on the foot march into the center of the capital to demand the liberation of the political prisoners, a journalist from the AFP confirmed.
Down with the Yankies!, "Soldiers!", "the road belongs to the revolutionaries!", "Fidel and Raul live!", the empowered partisans with a raised fist chanted to the dissidents.
The latter were escorted by civilian agents who had appeared to "ensure their protection".
A similar demonstration against the "Ladies in White" had taken place in Havana the night before, during which there were no injuries or arrests.
On the other hand, a dozen dissidents were temporarily arrested by civilian police in Vedado, who also opened up to the demonstration on Thursday in the face of the International Human Rights Day, a reporter from the AFP confirmed.
The police have, according to this journalist, forced the dissidents exploited by the partisans of the government to enter civilian vehicles using force.
The temporary detention of dissidents under such circumstances is usually limited to only a few hours.
As candidates for the Sakharov Prize, awarded by the European Parliament in 2005, the "Ladies in White" organized an unauthorised march for the purpose of "Ask for the release of all political prisoners", whose number according to the dissident list has around 200 people, Laura Pollan, one of the leaders, whose husband Hector Maceda is serving a 20-year prison sentence.
M. Maceda belongs to the group of 75 Cuban dissidents detained in March 2003, 53 of whom are behind bars.
The Cuban authorities consider the opponents of the regime to be "soldiers" or "agents" in the service of the declared archenemy, the United States.
A rarity in itself is that Cuban television reported on Thursday’s demonstration events between militant pro-government fighters and “counter-revolutionaries.”
Cuba, led by a united party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of vilifying rights and freedoms, in particular freedom of expression.
Madman kills 80-year-old with knife and leaves 5 injured in Clichy-la-Garenne
A two-bladed madman killed an eight-year-old and injured five more people on Friday at late afternoon at the main business time in downtown Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine).
According to the survey, the 28-year-old attacker had injured the eighty-year-old from an unexplained cause in or in front of a pharmacy on Boulevard Jean-Jaures with two knives, and this, according to police records, in the presence of witnesses.
The old man, born in 1929, is reported to have succumbed to the consequences of his injuries, according to a police syndicate in the hospital.
In or in front of the same pharmacy, he has tied up a couple with a pregnant woman.
The man, about in the three-sigers, intervened and was injured.
The first two victims were taken to the hospital, where the eighty-year-old died.
The other injured person is at risk of life because, according to police sources, apparently vital organs were affected.
The pregnant woman has become ill as a result of the events and she is said to have been hospitalized in a "shock condition" according to a police source.
The armed man, who appeared to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs according to police reports, is said to have immediately escaped to the street, the equal boulevard Jean Jaures.
He had injured two other passers-by, apparently by chance: a thirty-year-old and a forty-year-old, the latter of whom were heavy.
The scenario remained in the dark in the evening.
He had been armed with two butcher knives, which he carried crossed behind his back, said Arnaud Pressé, a manager of the Syndicate Alliance of the Hauts-de-Seine region.
Several passers-by, including young people, are said to have tried to restrain the madman, according to the witness reports determined by the AFP.
I saw a guy in the threes with a green vest.
Three young people tried to intervene.
They couldn't do it because the guy was well built, Alberto, a waiter at a nearby bar, reported.
A horde fell over him, he added, including a city policeman who broke his wrist.
Still on Boulevard Jean-Jaures, at number 61, two city police officers, including their superior, tried to arrest the armed man and were injured with stabbings, police said.
The event has taken place in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where a number of shops are located.
Passersby have come to me to tell me that there is an injured person out there.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old person lying on the floor, I put them in the first aid position and noticed a palpitating wound in the stomach area, Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist, told the AFP.
Five minutes later, a second, about thirty-year-old person came in injured by cuts.
Police officers have finally arrested the man who did not carry identification documents with him.
The Prosecutor's Office of Nanterre has commissioned the District Department of the Criminal Police of Hauts-de Seine (SDPJ 92) to investigate the case.
The madman was hospitalized on Thursday night.
In view of his condition, he has not yet been heard in court.
A police source does not rule out his being sent to a nerve hospital.
According to another police source, six police officers planned to arrest him at the Clichy Police Commissioner's Office, where he had been taken.
He was "in a state of overexcitation" like "all mentally confused of this kind, in which the forces released themselves during the Tathergang".
US: Polanski's lawyer calls for resumption of prosecution
The lawyer of French-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski has repeatedly called on Los Angeles (California, Western United States) on Thursday to drop prosecution against his client, who is currently on trial at his place of residence in Switzerland due to a slump of more than 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, the lawyer for the director of the "Pianist", has denounced three judges of the Court of Appeal in the second district of California with serious procedural errors at the time of the 1977 hearing.
I am asking for a penalty on the spot, M. Hummel explained, before adding that the behavior of Judge Laurence Rittenband, who was charged with the case at the time of the trial, "let a cold run down his back."
According to him, the judge Rittenband, now deceased, had discussed with a prosecutor, who was said to have told him that Roman Polanski deserved a house of education -- which represents a grave procedural error.
This discussion had been raised in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski: persecuted and wanted), especially by the in-depth prosecutor David Wells.
M. Wells had finally declared at the end of September that the authors of the documentary had "believed".
Should the Court of Justice refuse to suspend the criminal proceedings, Mr Hummel requests that a trial be conducted which would allow him to present the evidence for his argument.
The prosecution, for its part, has repeated the evidence already explained at first instance, i.e. that a discussion on the annulment of the facts charged to the defendant cannot be seriously considered, as long as Roman Polanski does not appear in court.
The 76-year-old director had fled the United States in 1978, even before the announcement of the penalty for "illegal sexual relations" with a 13-year-old minor.
Since then, he has not traveled to the United States.
Los Angeles County deputy prosecutor Phyllis Asayama said Roman Polanski had to be there to attend the trial.
If you want to spread the message on this matter, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other defendants, the escape is a way out?, asks Mrs Asayma.
In her opinion, the filmmaker “requests the Court of Justice for a favor and thus despises its authority.”
One of the three judges – who now have 90 days to announce their decision – even pointed out that “there are other escape alternatives.”
Hummel was not the only one who had requested the cessation of prosecution against Roman Polanski.
The lawyer of Samantha Geimer, the victim, also called for the suspension of the criminal proceedings.
She recalled that her client would no longer tolerate being harassed by any resurgence of the Polanski affair, adding: “No one in this room can say that this procedure was just.
Thirty-two years is enough.”
Roman Polanski was arrested in Switzerland on September 26 at the request of an American arrest warrant.
After spending two months behind bars, he was then sentenced in anticipation of possible extradition to house arrest in his chalet in Gstaad.
Wall Street is slowed by the rise of the dollar and closes without price.
The New York Stock Exchange closed without a price on Friday, in a market torn between better indicators than the US and a rise in the dollar: the Dow Jones won 0.63%, while the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
On the basis of the final figures available at closing, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has increased by 65.67 points to 10.471.50 points, while the technologically dominated Nasdaq has dropped 0.55 points to 2,190.31 points.
The Extended Index Standard & Poor's 500 increased by 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1,106.41 points.
“To be honest, the market is pretty quiet,” Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management noted.
"It remains narrowly limited, the trading volume has become very small and I think this will remain so by the end of the year."
The trend was supported by the publication of better economic indicators than intended, which "have contributed to improving the market view on the solidity of the recovery of the economy," summarized Charles Schwab's analysts.
In the US, retail sales increased by 1.3% in November, thus already two months in a row and far more than planned.
Furthermore, American consumers’ confidence has improved significantly in December to 73.4 compared to 67.4 in the previous month, according to the University of Michigan’s index preview.
However, the indexes were slowed down by a new rise in the dollar rate, which has reached the highest level against the euro for two months, pushing "the sectors vulnerable to the economic situation down," said Owen Fitzpatrick, Deutsche Bank.
As a result, the technological values have lost some ground.
The bond market has declined.
The return on the Treasury bond over 10 years increased by 3.540% on Wednesday evening compared to 3.482 % and the bond’s return over 30 years to 4.497 % compared to 4.492 % of the previous day.
Miss World elections in South Africa
After a month of touring South Africa, the 112 candidates for the title of Miss World will cross the final hurdle on Saturday to realize their dream: to be chosen as the most beautiful woman in the world and to watch it in front of a billion television viewers.
During this big beauty fair, which is held for the second time in a row in the Johannesburg area, five of them have already entered their ticket to the semi-finals.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma from Canada were named Miss Sportive or Miss Topmodel during their African stay.
This was a true strudel of pleasure.
Beautiful cities to visit, such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Horn, were simply exceptional.
I've seen a lot of things and had a lot of experience!, said Miss Sierra Leone with great enthusiasm.
This competition will take place for the ninth time in South Africa and will be broadcast live from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, on Saturday, from 5 p.m. (15 a.m. Central European time).
I could not imagine a more beautiful country to hand over my crown.
This experience was simply fascinating.
I am happy to have made this experience twice, Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova underlined in the heat of the South African summer.
For the young Russian woman, her second stay in South Africa was characterized by numerous exchanges of experience with candidates and the rediscovery of "atember-authentic landscapes".
After a month of galas, rehearsals, meetings with the press and safari, Miss is now focusing on the competition.
The Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to follow in the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, who was elected in 2000 and will also be present in this election, as well as Aishwarya Rai, who was elected in 1994 and became both Bollywood stars.
It is, of course, every woman’s dream to be crowned once as the most beautiful woman in the world, but it’s not just about the look.
We are ambassadors of our country and I want to come home with the crown, Miss India throws in with a wide smile.
According to the organizers, this 59th edition is underlined with music and dance.
The candidates defilate in traditional costumes and not to forget, in a swimsuit.
The performance will be presented by a television presenter, Chinese Angela Chow, ex-beauty queen from South Africa, Michelle McLean and Miss World committee executive Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it knows how to receive the world with a warmth and pride that can hardly be overwhelmed, says Julia Morley, chairman of Miss World.
The candidates, like last year, made a safari, visiting the famous township in Soweto, but this time they tasted it by bike and local cuisine.
The meeting with South African President Jacob Zuma, however, was quite extraordinary.
Not common for a head of state, Miss Sierra Leone noted.
Her most beautiful memory, however, remains undoubtedly the draw in Cape Town (South West) for the World Cup in June 2010, a kind of country to advertise for this event a little more.
I’m wrong with people that I’ll probably never be able to approach.
I will definitely return to the 2010 World Cup, Miss Italy promised enthusiastically, Alice Taticchi.
The news about Johnny Hallyday is “very positive” according to his son David.
The news about Johnny Hallyday is "very positive," his son David assured on Friday on his arrival at Los Angeles airport, where he visited his father, who has been in the hospital there for a few days.
The news is very positive.
He is very strong, everything is going very well, David Hallyday explained to the press when he left the plane, where he arrived shortly after 1 p.m. local time (21 p.m. CET) from Paris.
The singer's son, who made a relaxed impression, assured that he would "fastest" go to Cedars-Sina<0xC3><0xAF> Hospital, where Johnny Hallyday was hospitalized in Paris on Monday for a bacterial follow-up infection following an operation on a herniated disc incident on November 26.
The singer was "placed in an artificial coma in Los Angeles this night to ease his severe pain and be able to perform his treatment," the press service said.
Johnny Hallyday was transferred by doctors at Cedars-Sina<0xC3><0xAF> Hospital in Los Angeles to an artificial coma where he was hospitalized on Monday for a bacterial follow-up infection following a herniated disc surgery on November 26 in Paris.
The singer had to undergo another operation during the night from Wednesday to Thursday due to the pathological changes caused by the last intervention.
His wife Laeticia attended a school event at the French high school in Los Angeles on Friday morning, in which her daughter Jade goes to school, a photographer from the AFP noted.
Head of the Department of Orthopaedic and Traumatological Surgery at the Pitié-Salp<0xC3><0xAA>tri<0xC3><0xA8>re Hospital, Yves Catoné, announced that he would visit the singer at the Los Angeles hospital on Monday.
The producer has severely burdened neurosurgeon Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, who operated the singer on November 26 at the Clinique internationale du parc Monceau in Paris.
We were told that he had committed the purest massacre.
The Los Angeles surgeons said they were completely disheartened, Mr. Camus explained.
I have heard that you may be going to court, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus believes that Johnny Hallyday "has travelled to Los Angeles far too quickly and this has been done with the permission of the Paris surgeon."
I spoke to this doctor personally, who assured me that he saw this trip as completely unproblematic, which surprised me a lot, since I already have two disc surgeries behind me, he added.
Shortly before, he announced to RTL that the singer had apparently left the hospital after the operation "without drainage, without everything".
Dr Stéphane Delajoux is very well known in the artist environment.
He had the actress Marie Trintignant, operating in Vilnius a few days before her death, in a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine, where he was practicing at that time.
In 2007, he had also operated on actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to reabsorb a hematoma after a brain hemorrhage.
However, he is also a doctor with a dubious reputation, who has already been convicted several times because of failed operations and not to forget, because of tax evasion and fraud.
Me Olivier Metzner, lawyer for the Medical Chamber, described him as "a man without scruples" who is "regularly" accountable to the board of directors and "anything but recommendable".
After a few days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux made a statement on Friday about his lawyer, Me David Koubbi.
He explained that the intervention would have been “perfect” and the post-operative investigations would have been “normal.”
The operation "did not produce bleeding and therefore does not require drainage," he added.
In any case, the tour of the singer, whose health problems have been growing since last summer, seems to be in question.
It is quite clear that it is a bit too short for a continuation of the tour on January 8 (in Amiens), Mr Camus explained.
The party alliance UDF (Union for French Democracy) becomes energetic and urges the Nouveau Centre party to stop using its seal
The party alliance, which is overseen by Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrou's MoDem party, reacted violently on Friday to an attempt to take over the seal, the party that was once founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, from the side of the chairman of the Nouveau Centre party, Hervé Morin, and urged him, under threat of prosecution, to stop using this seal on any document.
Hervé Morin publicly announces his intention to take over this UDF seal, believing that Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrou would not be worthy of defending this political legacy after he had reached the left hand.
The Secretary of Defense, whose party partner is the UMP, wanted to reaffirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
In order to emphasize his efforts, he had received the support of the MP Hervé de Charette (formerly UMP, now at NC) who claimed ownership of the UDF brand because he was the first to apply for this brand in 2004 at the "Institut national de la proprieté industriale".
However, the office of the party alliance UDF, which was monitored by Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrous's friends, broke the silence and made it clear that they could not be expropriated and set a time limit for the Minister and the MP, under threat of prosecution, to stop using this seal and transfer to it the property rights of the trade mark.
You have made numerous statements in recent days that you would propose your political movement to take over the UDF Seal Zu+, the party alliance wrote in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 office members, including Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez, the MoDem party, and the Senator Jean Arthuis of the centrist alliance.
You probably also believed that you had the right to have the name of this movement +Nouveau centre+, the slogan + of today’s UDF+, printed on their political material as well as on the homepage of your website.
As you know, you have no right to use this seal, the UDF's office said, and urged the NC party to "without prejudice to the mention of the name UDF of all material as well as of (their) website".
Hervé de Charette was also asked to "transfer the trademark's ownership rights to its legal claimants".
If you refuse to do so, we will take action against you in order to respect the law and to defend the legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories warned.
In their letter, they stress that "UDF has been a full-fledged political movement since 1978 and recalls that Morin and his friends "made the choice" to leave it in 2007 to form a competing movement, as others had already done in 2002 to form the party "UMP".
The Nouveau Centre party has therefore, according to the signatories, no rights whatsoever to use the UDF seal (Union pour la démocratie fran<0xC3><0xA7>aise).
They further recall that the last UDF Congress in 2007 approved the three-year accession to the MoDem Party and the establishment of a branch to defend the "material and moral interests" of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the office continues, "he was no longer a member of the UDF for three years at the time he applied for the brand name" but of the UMP.
He profites in a scandalous and fraudulent way, from the absence of the filing of the acronym UDF to carry out this for himself.
Furthermore, keep in mind that this recklessness is the best way to turn into a crime, and ironize the NC strategy: "It seems to us, in politics and in life, more dignified to make a name for oneself rather than trying to get out of anonymity by making a name that you have no legal claim to".
Affaire Liliane Bettencourt: Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois-Marie Banier sentenced for exploiting weakness
On Friday, the Court of Nanterre decided to judge the artist Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois-Marie Banier to determine whether, as billionaire Liliane Bettencourt’s daughter claims, he had exploited a weak moment of the eighty-year-olds to sneak up part of their fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his star photographs, will have to answer for exploiting weakness in court on April 15 and 16, 2010, a crime punishable by a maximum of three years’ imprisonment and a fine of 375,000 euros.
This decision means that there will indeed be a trial in this affair worthy of the saga of one of the wealthiest families in France, in which mother and daughter are fattened and at the same time have the reins of the L'Oréal cosmetics empire in hand.
Likewise, however, the 15th Chamber of Detention ordered a medical examination of the 87-year-old Liliane Bettencourt, which is jointly conducted by three doctors.
The heir and principal shareholder of L'Oréal has so far refused to undergo such an investigation, especially under the conditions presented during the investigation by the Prosecutor's Office of Nanterre.
The doctors appointed on Friday are expected to present a report before 10 March 2010 in which you will clearly state whether and at what time Liliane Bettencourt may have been in a state of weakness.
I think she's going to undergo these investigations.
I will speak with her, the lawyer of Mrs. Bettencourt, Me Georges Kiejman, explained after the hearing.
As for the lawyer of Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise Bettencourt-Meyers, Me Olivier Metzner, he is very satisfied with the decision of the court.
This is an excellent news (...). The opinion will prove that he (Banier) manipulated this old lady, which you have to protect, he affirmed.
For two years, Liliane Bettencourt’s only daughter has initiated a criminal lawsuit against Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois-Marie Banier, photographer and all-round artist, accusing him of exploiting her mother’s weakness for years to sneak up on donations of a total of one billion euros in the form of bank checks, insurance policies or paintings.
For her part, Liliane Bettencourt had always denied being manipulated by the photographer, whom she sees as a longtime friend.
Although the court had to examine the admissibility of Mrs Bettencourt-Meyer's lawsuit, the lawyers' plaidoyers led to a large family debacle on Friday.
For example, Liliane Bettencourt’s lawyer called herself on three letters sent to her notary by his client (1999, 2003 and 2005) in which she wrote that she distrusted Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise Bettencourt-Meyer’s husband.
Liliane Bettencourt added: “Please explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier for fifteen years, once or twice a day.
I have never been able to speak to Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise since her marriage.”
The prosecutor’s office of Nanterre again believes that the applicant had no right to respond, especially because a guardian’s court has refused to initiate a judicial protection procedure against her mother in recent days.
Liliane Bettencourt "is fully legal, is not under protection and has no guardianship.
No one has the right to act in their place,” said Marie-Christine Daubigney, the prosecutor’s representative.
The court has now decided to give a ruling after the admissibility trial of Mme Bettencourt-Meyers took place.
Manager revolution or the end of the Strategic Early Enlightenment?
If nothing changes in the leadership of the great French companies, our struggle for the development of economic intelligence has been in vain.
For over a decade, the attitude of managing large companies in terms of its employees, said the position of the companies vis-<0xC3><0xA0>-vis the consumers before the marketing revolution: It is for the staff to join "values" determined the best as it used to be on the consumer products designed by the technicians in the factory to impose.
By placing the customer at the center of the companies, the marketing revolution has given the strategies of conquering the markets in the place ... although the authoritarian temptation products separate factors to impose customer preferences again regularly!
Demobilization of employees can lead to fatal demoralization.
The suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are just the tip of a much larger phenomenon that particularly affects employees.
This demobilization has a negative impact on the development of all intellectual functions of the company, especially those of R&D, which is even more crucial to those of economic intelligence.
In fact, the IE (Intelligence Economique = Economic Intelligence) "requires a proactive approach and a forward-looking view of all parties involved"; it claims an effort by its employees that completely contradicts the instructions of authoritarian management.
That is why we are calling for a corporate revolution, which would be to put employees at the centre of the company’s concerns on an equal footing with customers.
The Very Conditional Benefit of Internal Opinion Surveys
Will internal opinion polls, such as the questionnaire that Orange submitted to its wage earners, stimulate this revolution in terms of management practice?
I'm afraid, unfortunately not.
- First of all, because I could see that in the face of a new situation, after many detours, the whole structure finally arrives to do primarily what it has always done.
Also because authoritarianism - one of the pathologies of power - increases proportionally to the importance of its own failures.
And finally, because most executives have a greatly simplified idea of human behavior.
From the great engineering schools her interpretation of psychology is mechanistic.
They adopt through intellectual comfort the old behavioral theory, which was recently reactivated by the American "neurosciences" and unknowingly widely disseminated by research institutes and through the media.
Thus, and by suggesting that it is possible to activate the "leverage" (sic) of employee engagement, a recent Le Figaro.fr survey from Ipsos reinforces the leaders in an attitude towards a mechanistic control system that is unsuitable for today's world.
Identify and measure the mobilization factors
Instead, an operational revolution necessary for the smooth functioning of modern enterprises presupposes the adoption of a definitive view of human behavior.
It consists in integrating a basic protocol into any consideration or practice of governance: for the wage earners, commitment to the company is only possible if it clearly appears as a means to realize a part of their dreams, ambition and projects.
At the moment, only the studies from the multifunctional analysis assume this concept of motivation of the employees.
These studies have shown that they assess their company on the basis of a predefined doxa that allows them to estimate what it offers them to achieve their life goals through their perceived image of the company.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of these mobilization factors, the managers of the companies can control, predict and anticipate their “social performance” and place their human resource management back in the right place.
In this way, they create a fertile soil that is favorable for the coordinated development of a robust and efficient economic intelligence.
Oslo’s speech: the “just war” brings Obama praise from the right
On Friday, U.S. rights welcomed the speech delivered by Barack Obama in Oslo and was pleased that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize defended the notion of “just war” against the enemies of the United States.
The Conservatives, who mocked the awarding of the prize to Obama on October 9, applauded this time the President's speech, following the example of former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin in the 2008 elections.
I liked what he said, Palin explained, the face of the right wing of the Republican Party in the daily USA Today and added that she herself had brought to the topic of a "sometimes necessary" war in her memoirs published above.
The war is, of course, the last thing I think Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
We need to stop the terrorists down there, she says.
Obama, who inherited two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, has made an effort in Oslo on Thursday to justify the use of force; a way to explain his decision nine days ago to send 30,000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, expressed the opinion that the president had done "very good work" in Oslo.
I found that the speech was really very good, delighted the former president of the House of Representatives, who especially acknowledged the reference to "the existence of evil in the world" in Obama's words.
In some parts, I felt this speech was quite historic, Ginrich explained, who was interviewed in the radio show "The Takeaway".
The former MP, who is seen by some as a possible candidate for the 2012 Republican nomination for the 2012 presidential election, said he was pleased to have seen a "President of the Left" who reminded the members of the Nobel Committee that they "were not free and could not issue a price for peace if the use of force did not exist."
For Michael Gerson, former writer of George W. Bush and now editor of the Washington Post, Obama has given “a very American speech.”
In addition to portraying himself as a “cosmopolitan” as “he always does,” he spoke “like an American president” when he pointed out that Europeans “live like in a bubble of security that they didn’t create themselves and don’t do much for their protection,” Gerson said.
Among the few unconvinced rights, former U.N. ambassador John Bolton, a falcon of the Bush era, described the speech on the National Review Online website as “slow, high-stakes and uninspired.”
To the left of the president, Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich is alarmed at how Barack Obama defends the military’s backlash.
If you pack the war under the cover of the judiciary, the massacre of the innocent can be easily justified, he warns.
The press of the moderate left, however, continues to praise the president.
The Los Angeles Times, which still believes that the Nobel Prize was awarded to Obama prematurely, described the address itself as a "monumental work" for a speaker known for his talent.
The speech in Oslo "provides a timetable for managing international decisions against conflict, poverty and oppression," according to the California daily.
The New York Times believes that Obama “proclaimed the necessary discourse” and calls his speech “dark and exemplary at the same time.”
Three Marathons for an Agreement to Secure Supply for Christmas
After a three-week negotiation marathon, the unions of the road association and the TLF – the only employer organization that remained until the end – reached an agreement on Friday evening that will end the strike warrant and the impending severe shortage of supplies at Christmas.
At the signature meeting on Friday evening, the Secretary of State responsible for transport Dominique Bussereau "welcomed" the agreement, which was initiated on Wednesday morning after several weeks of negotiations.
After a second night of negotiations, the negotiators separated early Friday morning in the hope of quickly signing the agreement in the late morning.
And this despite the fact that the three employers' associations (FNTR, Unostra and OTRE) had abandoned the meeting.
However, more than six hours passed from the beginning of the meeting at 11:00 a.m. to the conclusion of the agreement and only at 18:00 the agreement was signed.
The conflict “had done a lot of damage to the company” and “it was to be feared that it would affect the holidays at the end of the year,” Bussereau said.
The agreement provides for a 4% increase in wages for the lowest wages (local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest wage groups (international transport).
The hourly rate for workers with the lowest wages thus rises from 8.72 euros to 9.06 euros.
"That's not much, but we're starting small," said Patrice Clos (FO).
The activists are now instructed not to block the supply centers anymore.
“However, there will probably always be some reluctances that are not satisfied with the agreement,” he adds.
TLF chairman Philippe Grillot spoke of a "good deal" although it was "difficult to grant these wage increases in the face of international competition".
According to him, the increase is 170 euros per month for the low and 100 to 120 euros for the high wage groups.
“This agreement is based on common sense and respect for employees,” said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) said of “a historic agreement.”
Richard Jaubert (CGT) expressed himself in this regard on "an acceptable compromise".
The agreement also provides for the 3% increase in travel costs and the maintenance of the overall budget for road transport in the first half of 2010, which will in particular allow to address the 13th month's salary and the modernisation of collective agreements.
M. Bussereau recalled that "the fall in taxes for employers amounting to 100 million euros" was the subject of a government amendment to the bill of corrected finances for 2009, which was passed by the National Assembly on the night of Thursday to Friday.
The government is calling for “an identical” vote by the Senate.
The signature of the TLF allows the agreement to first apply to the companies affiliated to this organisation and then to apply to the entire profession in the event of an extension by the Minister of Labour.
This will be the case "in the shortest time", Bussereau assures.
The opposition of employers' associations can only delay the procedure.
The FNTR Association denounced a "fraud trade" because the €100 million "had already been promised to the sector to offset part of the carbon tax".
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate as soon as possible, but not on the basis of a joint analysis, but in order not to trip the goose eaters on the coming Christmas days, the Unostra complains.
For the Otre Association, the agreement threatens "to shake a big grave for the small and medium-sized companies in the industry over the next 12 months".
Line RER A: Disruptions this weekend, trade unions dissatisfied with RATP proposals
The disruptions on the RER A line, the largest expressway network in France for the Greater Paris and the <0xC3><0x8E>le-de-France, continued on the weekend, while a meeting on Friday, the 2nd day of strikes between the trade unions and the management of the RATP (Independent Paris Passenger Transport Administration), which allows strikers to continue waiting with their demands for wage surcharges.
On this important shopping weekend before Christmas, there were no trains between 10:00 and 20:00. On the central line (between La Défense and Nation) only one of two trains and outside the central line only one of four trains was ready for use.
The connection to the trains of the SNCF was interrupted in Nanterre Prefecture, which forced the travelers to change.
The Galeries Lafayette department store chain, which counts 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that "the RATP is trying to connect the big business with traffic technology".
The line RER A passes through the Paris metropolitan area from west to east.
The route section of the RATP connects the towns of Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre, as well as Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one in two trains operated on schedule at the main traffic time, and almost none during the low traffic time.
As already on Thursday, there was no human commotion on the railways, as the inhabitants of <0xC3><0x8E>le-de-France had adjusted to the situation.
So early in the morning, the train station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was far less crowded than usual, mainly due to the lack of high school students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, an engineer (29), said he had risen “an hour and a half earlier to get to work on time.”
The SNCF, which had planned to take care of travellers by staff and law enforcement, pointed out that there were no bottlenecks at Saint-Lazare station.
The trains operated by the SNCF on the RER A line or in the direction of Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or drove via Saint-Lazare station to ensure the connection to the metros.
On Saturday and Sunday, general meetings of the strikers were held again, during which the results were reviewed, which the associations had classified as "difficult" after the meeting with the leader on Friday afternoon.
The RER Managing Director proposed the specific development of a protocol for line RER A with regard to all relevant aspects, working hours, career paths, etc.
However, this is not what the drivers want, according to Thierry Garon (Sud) they demand a long-term wage surcharge.
The CGT was outraged that the RATP itself is putting its wage surcharge proposals in a jam, stressing that the top management is "not able to solve a problem, while this was also possible with the remote drivers and the SNCF."
The RATP made it clear that a new meeting was planned for Monday for the "comprehensive review of working conditions".
This also shows the associations that the company "ignores the weekend drivers".
In the morning, about 150 drivers searched for the establishment of a committee in Paris.
Once again, it was the leader who so far rejected any discussion during the strike, and suggested a meeting after a calming of the situation.
On Tuesday, the conflict threatened to extend to line RER B after a pre-announcement by Unsa and Indépendants.
The Associations are demanding a wage surcharge of 120 (Unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud, Indépendants) and they are also complaining about the deterioration of working conditions on this route, on which millions of travellers are travelling daily.
The drivers of the RER line, who have many years of professional experience, receive a gross salary of 2,200 to 2,700 euros as well as a salary surcharge of 600 to 650 euros for shift services, as well as Sundays and public holidays.
Turkish Constitutional Court dissolves pro-Kurdish party. Decision with serious consequences
On Friday, the Turkish Constitutional Court announced the dissolution of the country's pro-Kurdish main party; a decision that followed immediately angry demonstrations in the Kurdish community in the south-east of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision threatens to greatly complicate the work of the government, which seeks to reach out to the Kurdish community in order to put an end to the conflicts that have been going on for 25 years.
The "Party for a Democratic Society" (DTP) was dissolved as it had become a "place of activities that are detrimental to the independence of the state and its indivisible unity," according to the President of the Constitutional Court Hasim Kili<0xC3><0xA7> four days after the decision against the press.
According to Kili<0xC3><0xA7>, the decision would have been taken unanimously by 11 judges, with a majority of seven votes needed to impose the dissolution, and he pointed out that 37 of the party’s leaders, including Chairman Ahmet Türk and Parliamentarian Aysel Tugluk, were excluded from political action for five years.
The judge also announced the lifting of the parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Turkey and Tugluk, as well as the confiscation of the party’s goods.
The DTP now has 21 seats in Parliament (out of 550).
The party leaders expressed before the ruling that parliamentarians would prefer to leave parliament rather than meet like partyless parliamentarians.
The decision was followed by a trial initiated in 2007 by the prosecutor of the Turkish Federal Court of Abdurrahman Yal<0xC3><0xA7>inkaya, who accused the DTP of following the “wislings” of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), which is regarded by Ankara and numerous other countries as a terrorist organization.
Numerous observers believe that the DTP is the legal political showcase of the PKK rebels.
The party assures that it has "no connection" to the PKK, but refuses to call it a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate.
The ruling of the Constitutional Court sparks the government in between, which seeks to address the Kurdish community and propose a series of measures to strengthen the rights of the Kurds in order to silence the support of the PKK by the Kurds and put an end to the conflicts.
The leaders of the DTP reaffirm that a resolution could lead to a resurgence of tensions in Southeast Anatolia, where numerous demonstrations against PKK chief Abdullah <0xC3><0x96>calan’s detention conditions have led to clashes with police in recent weeks.
Since the court’s announcement, thousands of demonstrators have gathered in front of the DTP’s premises in the million-dollar city of Diyarbakir in the southeast, which is mostly populated by Kurds.
The police used tear gas grenades and water launchers as the protesters began to throw Molotov cocktails and stones.
Hundreds of people also protested in Istanbul.
According to the verdict, Türk assumed that the court's decision "will deepen despair even further".
"Turkey cannot resolve this (Kurdish, ed. editorial) question on the basis of a party's ban," he told the press.
The government, consisting of a party that emerged from the Islamist movement, also regretted the decision.
"We oppose the closure of the parties on principle.
This does not solve the problems,” said Minister of Energy Taner Yildiz.
“This decision is a torpedoing of the democratic opening promoted by the government,” said Ahmet Island, a political market observer.
“You can obviously get caught up in a reaction from the PKK,” he adds.
On Thursday, the PKK confessed to an attack in which three days before seven soldiers were killed in northern Turkey, which was one of the most brutal attacks of the past months.
The snow can come
A really crisp winter, that's what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
Not because he wants to harass the citizens, says the FES winter service manager.
But so that his employees can try out and master the entire vehicle technology.
This weekend, according to meteorologists, could be the first time this has happened.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of snow and ice.
The FES follows an exact plan.
As soon as it snows all over Frankfurt and the temperatures are below zero degrees, 20 so-called A-routes are driven off with large-range vehicles, Brauburger explains.
These include main traffic and thoroughfares such as the Neue Weg and the Hanauer Landstra<0xC3><0x9F>e.
But also fire brigade accesses, public transport routes, pedestrian zones and routes with gradients, such as Atzelbergstra<0xC3><0x9F>e.
The service of the FES begins at three o'clock in the morning
If necessary, the approximately 1040 kilometres would have to be scattered in a maximum of three hours with moisture salt, which adheres better.
That is why the FES starts at three o’clock at night, “so that the routes are free until the professional traffic starts”.
It will be difficult if it snows only at 7.30 a.m.
Then we have a problem, says the winter service manager, "because then no one is willing to make room for the stray vehicles".
Only after that, if it does not snow further, are supply and development roads, which also includes the Rat-Beil-Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e, in the series.
The last priority is side and side roads.
There will be complaints, Brauburger knows.
At five o’clock in the morning, the foot population of the FES sets out on its way, and danger points and crossings are primarily cleared.
The FES usually cannot take care of all cycle paths.
There is a special service in Frankfurt that keeps an eye on the bridges from 22 to 4.30 a.m., says Brauburger.
Since there is a quick smoothness on this, as soon as the temperature drops below two degrees, the scatter is on the way.
If necessary, it is also called by the police.
The Cradle of Dinosaurs
Tawa hallae looked like many other carnivorous dinosaurs: The two-meter-long and 1.50-meter-sized animal ran on two powerful hind legs, had an elongated skull with sharp, curved teeth, short arms with sickle claws and a long tail.
If the species had lived a few million years later, it would have been nothing special.
But Tawa hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these body features, reports Sterling Nesbitt of the University of Texas in Austin and colleagues in the journal Science on Thursday.
The animal lived about 215 million years ago in present-day New Mexico, which was then in a dry zone of the supercontinent Pang<0xC3><0xA4>a on the equator.
Tawa opens a new window to the early evolution of the dinosaurs, Nesbitt says.
He shows us a lot about the relationship, the spread and the characteristics of the early dinosaurs.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other paleontologists began digging at the Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico.
We have sometimes found a dozen dinosaur bones in one day, which is unprecedented for deposits from the Trias, team member Randall Irmis of the Utah Museum of Natural History reports.
Some of the bones quickly identified the researchers as a new species.
In the course of the excavation, they carried together the remains of a total of five individuals.
Fund confirms theories about Dino's early history
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt, it is an extraordinary finding: "Dinosaur fossils from the Triassic are extremely rare, usually only single fragments can be found."
Other dinosaur experts don’t necessarily share the enthusiasm.
This finding is not particularly spectacular, but it confirms some theories about the early history of the dinosaurs, says Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
According to the current doctrine, the dinosaurs first appeared about 230 million years ago.
However, many of the oldest fossils are incomplete, which is why the assignment of these primordial dinosaurs is mostly controversial.
For example, the experts debate when the lizards split into their three main lines of development: the carnivorous theropods, which later included the Tyrannosaurus rex, the Velociraptor and also the birds, the four-legged sauropods known as the "long-necked" and their relatives, and the plant-eating ornithophagus (Vogelosaia) are among the species's.
After the analysis of Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa hallae is an original theropod.
It has an interesting combination of primitive and advanced properties, says Nesbitt.
On the skull of Tawa hallae, for example, the researchers found clues about air bags, as they also have the descendants of the theropods, the birds.
Thanks to the airbags, the breathing of birds is more efficient than that of mammals.
At Tawa hallae, the bones of the spine were apparently also partially filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive theropod with airbags, says Randall Irmis.
Since the related line of giant sauropods later also had airbags and lightweight construction bones, probably the common ancestor of both groups had already produced this useful innovation.
At least three migration waves to North America
Because the most primitive known dinosaurs lived in South America, the researchers conclude that the lizards first appeared there.
Accordingly, the three development lines separated early on and spread from South America across all continents, which at that time formed a single land mass as the supercontinent Pang<0xC3><0xA4>a.
The team, together with Tawa hallae, found the remains of two other, not particularly closely related, theropods.
The three cannot be descended from a common immigrant ancestor, the researchers argue.
We believe there were at least three migration waves to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, a co-author of the science study.
Of course, there are also contradictions.
An even older species, Silesaurus, which belongs to a sister group of dinosaurs, lived in present-day Poland, says paleontologist Martin Sander.
In his opinion, a distorted picture could emerge, because in South America, just a particularly large number of primitive dinosaur fossils have been preserved, while on other continents there is hardly anything to be found.
As the dinosaurs managed to evolve from a relatively rare sideline of the reptile tribe to the dominant terrestrial vertebrates of the Middle Ages, it is still mysterious.
During the Triassic period, the dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, for example with the ancestors of today’s crocodiles and the fly-acids and with numerous other lizards.
Towards the end of the Triassics, the dinosaurs spread all over the world and developed many new species, while their relatives died out on the border from the Triassic to the Jurassic.
Success story did not last forever
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There could have been a mass death that the dinosaurs survived by chance, but the other reptiles did not.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted so that they could beat the competition out of the field.
In any case, the success story did not last forever.
150 million years later, a meteorite impact helped a group of animals to bloom, which had also developed in the Triassic and since then tempted a shadow existence: the mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signatories are international.
Professors at the University of Toronto stand on it, the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna or from Berkeley, California.
Teachers from Naples are there, from Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The police clearance of the occupied casino of the Goethe University in Frankfurt is making waves worldwide.
278 professors and teachers from Goethe University, as well as from universities throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America, join forces with the protesting students on the Westend campus.
In a statement written in German and English, they "disapproved" the police operation initiated by the Bureau.
Uni President Werner Müller-Estler had the building occupied by students and lecturers in the educational strike cleared last week because walls and works of art had been smeared.
Five students were injured.
The property damage, the signatories judge, did not justify "the violent dissolution of self-organized courses of students and teachers by a police command".
The eviction represents an "unacceptable intervention" in the freedom of research and teaching.
The exclusive focus on vandalism serves "the delegitimization and criminalization of the protest" and distracts from the content.
The Bureau avoided the necessary discourse.
The teachers demand the immediate cessation of criminal prosecution.
The majority of the occupants did not support property damage, it said.
Protest legitimized
The youth of the Verdi trade union and the German trade union federation also stand in solidarity with the students.
The protest is a legitimate expression of growing concern for one’s own future, says Verdi State Youth Secretary Alexander Klein.
Hessen’s Minister of Science Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU) defended the action of the Unipresident and the police.
We are grateful to the president of the university.
Destruction and occupation are completely unacceptable means, she said in an up-to-date hour on Thursday in Wiesbaden’s Landtag.
We have an understanding of the protest, but no understanding of vandalism, according to CDU MP Peter Beuth.
The opposition factions SPD, Greens and the Left saw this differently.
The CDU takes painted walls as a pretext to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (left).
Instead of dealing with the arguments and demands of the students, they have been cleared.
The Left has submitted an application calling on the Minister of the Interior to report on the police operation.
New Silicon Valley
For many years it was considered a secret city, inaccessible to Western visitors.
Selenograd, one of ten districts of the capital Moscow, was a strictly guarded site for secret armament research in the Soviet Union.
Today, the municipality with its 216 000 inhabitants, 37 kilometers from the center of Moscow, is considered the "Russian Silicon Valley".
Significant research and production facilities for micro- and nanoelectronics are located here.
Since September 2008, representatives of Selenograd had made contacts with the Frankfurt-based research site Riedberg - with the university institutes and the companies of the Frankfurt-based Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There were several mutual visits and on Wednesday Selenograd and Riedberg signed a "Protocol for closer cooperation" in Frankfurt.
Moscow Deputy Mayor Yuri Rosljak and Prefect Anatoly Smirnov of Selenograd led the Russian delegation, for Frankfurt signed planning director Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and small and medium-sized companies of the scientific focus for a seminar will travel to Selenograd.
Scientific exchange
It is a continuous scientific exchange.
But it is also about economic relations.
Companies of the FIZ will be able to gain a foothold in the growing Russian market.
On the other hand, Russian science companies want to obtain orders in Germany.
Selenograd is the seat of major Russian research institutes and companies.
These include the Moscow Institute of Electron Technology, the large corporations Sitronics and Rosssijskaya Elektronika.
The municipality was founded in 1958 as a so-called "socialist planning city" for armament research.
Selenograd (literally translated "Green City") received its name from the wooded hilly landscape in which the research facilities are embedded.
Stuttgart brake pad
The dimensions of Stuttgart 21 cannot be set high enough.
For the promoters of the project, it is simply about "the new heart of Europe".
S21 is much more than the lowering of a railway station, more than a monstrous construction project that will plunge the city of Baden-Württemberg’s state capital into complete chaos for a decade.
Stuttgart 21 was born out of the spirit of the 1980s.
Main railway stations with tracks ending in the middle of the city were then considered to be 19th-century traffic-technical fossils, which acted like brake blocks of modern rail transport, as it once took a tremendous amount of time to span locomotives from the rear to the front.
Drive in, keep short, drive on - that's how it's supposed to go.
And that’s why the main railway stations should disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a transit station, which is about halfway between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava, the trans-European rail-magistral railway station - therefore the slogan of the "Heart of Europe".
S21 is now actually being tackled, although the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even very ambitious planners have realized that it is almost priceless in the Hessian and Bavarian cities to implement the lowering.
However, the main railway stations no longer have an entry and exit problem, since there are modern turn trains with engines and control cars at both ends.
Nevertheless: Stuttgart 21 along with the ICE new construction line to Ulm is now being tackled.
State and local politicians have enforced it.
The railway also participates, because the risks of the largest single infrastructure project carried by the Republic of Taxpayers and not by the State Group.
The project can still be justified in terms of urban design.
A new urban space is being created, which - if you think the computer-generated graphics of the planners - is equipped with a lot of green.
S21 is harmful to the rail transport system.
The transit station and the extension of the route are intended for passenger traffic, which is attributed to huge growth - typically in the 1980s.
At the time, there was no competition from the low-cost airlines.
Modern transport policy, however, must first be about strengthening freight transport, since rail transport is considerably more environmentally friendly than by truck on the road.
However, the new construction route is not suitable for freight trains due to heavy gradients.
Even more serious is that S21 indirectly also affects many other rail projects.
A good six billion euros are to be banned in Swabian.
This is the official number.
Experts consider 10 to 15 billion to be realistic.
It is certain that in the next decade, the money will be missing at other nodes and bottlenecks in the network.
A total of sixty major projects are on the list of the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the expansion of the 180 km long route through the Rhine Valley.
Since 1987, the road has been built at a slow pace.
It would be necessary to press the tube properly.
But S21 will act as a brake pad.
The Rhine Valley Route becomes a bottleneck for international freight transport: right in the heart of Europe.
Government reviews judgment on airport
The state government has left open in the Wiesbaden Landtag whether it will go into review against the judgment of the Hessian Administrative Court (VGH) on the night flight ban.
The CDU/FDP coalition has commissioned experts to have the more than 400-page VGH ruling legally reviewed, said Minister of Economic Affairs Dieter Posch (FDP).
On these days, the VGH in Kassel had stated in writing that the country had to re-order the night flight ban in the event of the construction of the planned Northwest runway at Frankfurt Airport.
The approval of 17 flights between 23 and 5 p.m., as provided by the state government, should not be compatible with the statutory protection of the population against nighttime flight noise.
The coalition must decide by 4 January whether it will go against the ruling in revision.
The opposition criticized this postponement and urged the government’s representatives to refrain from a revision at the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
SPD Group leader Torsten Sch<0xC3><0xA4>fer-Gümbel called on CDU and FDP to return to their pre-election promise of a night flight ban, otherwise this would be considered a "word break".
It's damn hard to keep your word, Greens chief Tarek Al-Wazir said in reference to the FDP election slogan "We keep our word".
Minister Posch rejected the accusation of Sch<0xC3><0xA4>fer-Gümbel, the state government is still trying to get to their night flights with "legal twisting and trickery".
An exact legal examination takes time.
The coalition does not want to operate on the basis of a “fast first impression”.
We need a legally secure decision, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
As she portrays the opposition, his faction’s statements on the night flight ban have never been.
U.S. banks pay back aid
The U.S.-backed big banks are squandering their state bonds.
On Wednesday, the Bank of America paid back aid from the Tarp bank bailout fund totaling $45 billion (about €30 billion) in a single stroke.
The Citigroup is also planning to refund state aid, according to a report by the US channel CNBC.
The institutions want to get rid of the restrictions associated with the acceptance of the money – such as the limitation on the payment of manager bonuses and the payment of high fees.
The Bank of America had raised $19 billion of fresh money from investors via convertible bonds.
She took the rest of the sum from her own cash register, which was well filled, among other things, by segment sales.
Bank chief Kenneth Lewis expressly thanked the American taxpayer on Wednesday evening: The money injection has helped over a very difficult time.
The money house had risen to the height of the financial crisis with the acquisition of investment bank Merrill Lynch.
The Citigroup also wants to raise money on the capital market in order to free itself from its liabilities vis-<0xC3><0xA0>-vis the state.
Already on Thursday, the US bank could announce a roughly $20 billion increase in its capital, CNBC reported citing circles.
A Citigroup spokesperson did not want to comment.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had already paid back their aid.
Quick Choice
Everything went faster than I thought.
Just two weeks after the ZDF Administrative Council had pushed the acting editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender out of office, the broadcaster can present a successor.
Last night, the committee wanted to vote on the staff.
Peter Frey, head of the ZDF-Hauptstadtstudio in Berlin, was considered a favorite.
However, there was no confirmation from the broadcaster for this - officially, in order not to proceed with the procedure.
However, it is also likely that the role of the ZDF intendant Markus Sch<0xC3><0xA4>chter should not be affected by this proposal to the Board of Directors.
Frey, Sch<0xC3><0xA4>chter’s candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 board members.
The result of the vote was not yet determined at the end of this edition.
Two weeks ago, Sch<0xC3><0xA4>chter had failed in the Board of Directors with his proposal to extend the contract with Nikolaus Brender for another five years.
Only seven members spoke out for Brender, seven voted against him. Brender's re-election was a harsh defeat for Sch<0xC3><0xA4>chter, but an expected one.
For the majority of the Union in the Board of Directors had signalled weeks before the election that Brender did not want to confirm in office.
The opposition was organized against the editor-in-chief of Hessian Prime Minister Roland Koch.
With the argument that under Brender, the ZDF’s news broadcasts had lost on turn-on quotas, he declined another term of office of the highly regarded editor-in-chief.
Until shortly before the election, there were therefore protests in which the political influence on the ZDF was scourged.
More recently, even 35 state lawmakers had interfered in the debate, who considered Koch’s approach unconstitutional.
It has nothing to do with it.
To the person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and romance.
He then worked at Südwestfunk and the Frankfurter Rundschau.
In 1983, Frey moved to the ZDF, initially to the "now-journal".
Subsequent posts: 1988 to 1990 personal speaker of the editor-in-chief; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 head and moderator of the "Morning Magazine"; until 2001 head of the ZDF foreign policy; since then head of the ZDF headquarters studio.
The Greens announced a constitutional lawsuit following Brenders’ election, which was still elected as Journalist of the Year by the industry magazine Medium Magazine on Wednesday.
Koch’s counterpart on the Board of Directors, the Rhineland-Palatinate Prime Minister Kurt Beck, said last week that the countries should change the ZDF State Treaty in such a way that staff proposals of the intendant cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
However, an expulsion of party politicians from the supervisory bodies of the ZDF also excluded Beck.
Brender's expected successor Peter Frey had recommended himself to the Board of Directors with a clever chess move - criticizing the board immediately after the Brender election.
Thanks to this document of journalistic independence, he was able to nominate both chessmen without loss of face for the post of editor-in-chief and to elect the board of directors, without suspecting that a party-goer would be appointed to the office.
In party arithmetic, Frey is anyway attributed to the left-liberals.
Study is derailed
Part success for the students: After a year of the educational strike, the Ministers of Culture of the countries finally got involved on Thursday: at a meeting of the Minister of Culture and University Rectors Conference, both sides agreed to improve the study conditions at Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees.
Students should be able to manage their studies in the future.
In detail, they agreed to reduce the examination burden: in principle, each study module should only complete with a single examination.
In addition, the workload of the students should be checked and "a realistic and justifiable measure" guaranteed.
Politics and universities also want to simplify the recognition of examination services between universities within and outside Germany.
The countries committed themselves to making common structural requirements more flexible for bachelor’s and master’s degree programs.
There should also be no deviating country regulations.
Less testing
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, ministers of culture and university principals have carried the winged word of the better studyability in the mouth.
For the first time, it was filled with concrete content.
The so-called Accreditation Council decided to drastically reduce the number of examinations in part: "Each module usually concludes with only one examination", says a 30-page paper, which is intended to partially re-regulate the admission of degree programmes.
With the "significant reduction in the examination burden," said the Accreditation Council Chairman Reinhold Grimm, to be offered a "failure to stop development that significantly affected the student's ability to study."
In addition, the "studyability" in the future should be "the decisive criterion" in the design.
Modules such as content are "strictly to check" whether "unnecessary restrictions of the students in the choice of
Events would be avoided.
The students had “claims to maintain leeway that enable and promote their own initiative.”
The rules should apply when approving new courses, but also when reviewing existing courses of study.
These must be “reaccredited” every five years – which means that it will take until 2015 for all degree programmes to be reviewed.
This is the responsibility of ten accreditation agencies nationwide, which are under the authority of the Accreditation Council set up by the countries.
In October, the Ministers of Culture had urged the countries to act “with emphasis” on the agencies in such a way that the substance content is not too large and the examination regime is not too strict.
In individual federal states, universities and universities of applied sciences have already agreed with the state ministries on appropriate measures.
As the only country to date, Rheinland-Pfalz has committed additional funds for the further development of the Bologna process.
Of the money, the universities are primarily to set up tutor programs and strengthen study advice as well as examination and foreign offices.
Countries and universities want to spend ten million euros on this.
At the beginning of 2010, the government wants to bring a short story of the Higher Education Act into parliament.
After this, only a single examination is required for the completion of a study model.
The design of the study programme is to become more flexible, in addition to ensuring the recognition of certificates of performance at other universities and facilitating access to the Master’s programme.
By the end of next year, all the country’s degree programmes will be reviewed for their studyability.
On Thursday, the government and the opposition again disputed the conditions of study in the country.
In addition to praise, however, there was also criticism of the decisions.
The Federal Board of the Juso-Hochschulgruppen demanded that the shaping of education policy should no longer take place in the future "behind closed doors" of the ministers and university rectors.
At the latest after the educational strikes, the students should now also "come into a word" as affected.
The future academics received support from the president of the University Rectors’ Conference (HRK), Margret Wintermantel: "We need the experience of the students," she said at a meeting with the ministers of culture with whom the HRK discussed a joint reform paper.
The Education and Science (GEW) union did not go far enough: it demands a legal claim that allows every graduate with a bachelor's degree to have access to a further master's degree.
On the other hand, countries need to ensure that the current generation of bachelor students will have enough master’s degree places tomorrow with the best possible study conditions, according to GEW board member Andreas Keller.
Countries need to hire significantly more teachers.
However, the ministers of culture did not comment on a free access to the Master.
More than a footnote to Herta Müller
Entering Germany and out is pretty much no control..." is the starting line of a poem by the lyricist Werner Söllner, in which this in disturbing language fetters thematicizes the arrival experience of a dissident who won the freedom but at the same time lost his language space.
Born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, Werner Söllner had first worked as a German and English teacher in Bucharest and later as a lecturer in a children's book publishing house before moving to Frankfurt am Main in 1982.
Söllner has been awarded various literary awards, in 1993 he gave the legendary Frankfurt poetry lectures at the Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been head of the Hessian Literature Forum at the Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
He made a significant extra-literary appearance last Tuesday during a conference in Munich, which was about "German literature in Romania in the mirror and the shredding of their securities files".
Visibly insecure, Söllner sends a statement in which he admitted his involvement as an IM for the Romanian secret service Securitate in front of Romanian German writer colleagues, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer.
Together with some of the presenters, Söllner had received the German Language Prize in 1989.
The recruitment attempts had begun in a slick way, first in 1971.
I am, concluded Söllner, "so someone who has not resisted enough against intimidation attempts by the Securitates."
The lyricist Werner Söllner is IM Walter.
Almost simultaneously with the Nobel Prize ceremony for Herta Müller and their unprecedented literary examination of the mechanisms of dictatorial rule, the literary scene and in particular the community of the German authors from Romania is shaken by a case that identifies the abysses and the downfall of a political system based on surveillance and scrutiny.
Werner Söllner is, as far as one can say according to previous knowledge, not only a perpetrator, but also a victim.
In his Securitate act, IM Walter played a role, said after the confession of Söllner of literary scholar Michael Markel, referring to the positive influence of IM Walter for him.
He “cut him out” in all the points that were difficult for him at the time, Markel said.
It is a moral need for him to make this remark.
Söllner’s statement was unexpected in form and in front of this audience, but completely surprising is the confession of a former dissident and his collaboration with the Romanian intelligence service.
Germany had been a comfortable reserve for Securitate Spitzel, had already written Herta Müller in July, after reading her own file, 914 pages.
Those affected, it may be assumed, will be speculated and in some cases have probably also known which clear name was hidden behind the cover names Sorin, Voicu and even Walter.
In contrast to the now very procedurally secure sighting of the Stasi files in this country, the handling of the omissions of the Securitate monitoring is still very diffuse.
A systematic education has been pushed back and hindered in recent years.
A national council on the preparation of the Securitate files (CNSAS) was established by the Birthler authorities in 1999, but the issue of the files has been rather sluggish ever since.
Only since 2005 has there been a law governing the administration of the files.
That the influence of former Securitate members in Romania is still very great, after the announcement of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller, an interview took place in which a former Securitate chief from Temesvar spoke conspicuously about the winner.
She has a psychosis, after all, she was interrogated only once.
The infamy of power meant to express itself here in the form of freedom of expression.
Certainly, the case of Söllner, as so often in connection with covert guilt, inevitably raises questions.
The sound reaction of the listeners to Söllner’s confession leaves hope that the continuation of this chapter will be determined rather by the urge to know than by guilt and shame.
To the genesis of Herta Müller’s work, which received the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than a footnote.
Saturation supplement Champions League
It seemed as if an adrett-dressed field servant had just come from a very nice Christmas party, on which a sporting goods manufacturer Goodies had distributed, when the new VfB trainer Christian Gross, accompanied by an orange plastic bag of the equipment, rose a quarter of an hour after midnight into a summoned C-Class.
The man with the striking slick could be chauffeured because of the city he is still a stranger.
Otherwise, he could have driven himself - alcohol was not in the game after all, and drunk with luck, the 55-year-old was just as little.
Had been a pleasant evening, but tomorrow the work just goes on.
Or just really get started.
In the words of the Swiss, who had only committed three days earlier: "We have reached the eighth final", namely in the Champions League thanks to the 3:1 success against Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "but we must not be blinded by the success: it will be a brutally hard fight against the descent."
The "much more important task" is ahead of us on Sunday.
Then it is necessary to repeat the royal class performance in the league everyday in Mainz.
And the very again revealed weaknesses after the fast three gates through Marica (5th), Tr<0xC3><0xA4>sch (8th) and Pogrebnyak (11th).
Drawout
The Champions League's eighth final (Hinspiele 16./17. + 23./24 February/ Rückspiele 9./10. + 16./17 March) will be played in Nyon on 18 December.
So the joy of the fulminant condition of Babbel’s successor remained.
Not only the alleged healer, who had imparted confidence, commitment and joy to the unsettled Stuttgart professionals in the short time.
I approached the players and told them to reflect on their strengths, and stopped them from being braver, Soulklempner Gross explained the so simple sounding recipe for success, which under the therapist Babbel had but no longer had any effect.
He has sparked a certain magic, Babbel advocate Jens Lehmann admitted, "when a new impulse comes in football, sometimes things happen that one would not have thought possible."
And Sami Khedira, who, after weeks of injury break, became the best player on the pitch thanks to his dynamic, tried to describe the established "phenomenon" with the proverbial "fresh wind" and the workings of the new superior: "He is a man who penetrates and demands discipline.
That’s what we need in the current situation.”
Under Babbel, it was obviously missing.
VfB Stuttgart is not yet above the mountain, warns sports director Horst Heldt
The VfB Stuttgart, however, needs above all consistency.
Like Gross, players and managers were also careful not to overestimate the victory against a weakened and completely overburdened defense of the Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow before four days later in Leverkusen at 0-4 the evil awakening came, Khedira said.
And sports director Horst Heldt warned that while one season goal has been achieved, the other one is still far away.
We are not yet above the mountain.
The fact that on his 40th birthday, even after the first home victory in three months, Heldt was not ready to celebrate, was due to the events of the weekend, which were fresh in the form of a television interview by goalkeeper Jens Lehmann broadcast immediately before the start of the game.
There are decisions that make others, not the Jens, Heldt countered Lehmann’s harsh criticism.
He had shown leadership weakness to the board and decided to change the coach to pressure puberty fans.
Also, that his day off after playing had been cancelled, Lehmann regarded it as a sign of lack of sovereignty and disapproval.
Lehmann’s statements were “purely characterized by selfishness,” Heldt chimed back and announced consequences for the final man.
You will no longer be friends for life, the two 40-year-olds.
After all, they agreed with everyone else that without the preparatory work by the replaced coaching team, the playful and combatively strong idea would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants had "a large share of success," said Heldt and Lehmann unisono - and the man with the plastic bag also agreed.
Heavyweight World Cup Fight
Hot Duel in Bern: Challenger Kevin Johnson repeatedly provoked World Champion Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
But after twelve hard rounds, the Ukrainian defended his heavyweight title after version of the WBC.
The verdict of the judges was unanimous.
Hamburg - Vitali Klitschko remains the boxing world champion in heavyweight.
The 38-year-old champion by version of the association WBC defeated American Kevin Johnson on the night of Saturday in Bern by points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Klitschko, it was the third successful title defense after his comeback in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian was already twice world champion of the associations WBO and WBC.
Unfortunately, it did not work with the K.O., which everyone expected.
Klitschko expanded his record to 39 wins in 41 professional fights, twice he had to give up due to injuries.
Challenger Johnson had to accept the first defeat in the 24th fight.
In front of some 17,000 spectators in the Bernese Arena, the 2.02-metre-long Klitschko wanted to dictate the fight with his left hand.
However, the 11-centimeter-smaller Johnson, who had announced the end of the Klitschko era before the duel, repeatedly escaped the beatings of the world champion, so that Klitschko could not decisively bring his dangerous rights to the finish.
Overall, the passive Johnson did too little for a challenger and only tried to get over the rounds.
Although he provoked Klitschko with words and gestures, his blows rarely met the world champion.
After all, he is only the second boxer after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who went over the full distance of twelve laps with Klitschko.
The challenger had caused some vortexes before the fight in the Swiss capital.
He insulted Klitschko as a "ugly zombie" who "can't do anything right".
While weighing, the champion was then provoked on Friday to push Johnson’s sunglasses off the nose, “to see his eyes.”
Fourth victory after Klitschko's comeback
Klitschko also remained victorious in his fourth fight after his comeback on October 11, 2008.
After almost four years off, he had beaten the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and got back "his" WBC belt, which he had previously abandoned without a fight.
This year, he defeated Juan Carlos Gomez from Cuba and Chris Arreola from the United States in September.
I got only one stroke in this fight and I am physically very well in shape, Klitschko had justified the quick return to the ring.
His dream, however, remains the unification of all four important titles in the family.
Brother Vladimir is world champion of the WBO and IBF associations.
But the belt of the WBA is worn by the British David Haye after he was able to dethrone the 2.13 meter Nikolai Waluyev in November.
Haye had previously cancelled a battle planned for September against Vitali Klitschko.
Allegedly, his promotional company is already planning to fight Klitschko in London’s Wembley Stadium.
Fall Kunduz
Frontal attack from the opposition: Green Group leader Jürgen Trittin has called Defense Minister Guttenberg a liar because of false information about the Kunduz affair.
The SPD and the Left demand clarification from the Chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin - According to the latest findings on Kunduz's air strike, the opposition Defence Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) has made a conscious deception.
The minister has said about the deadly bombardment on two September tankload trains "knowingly the untruth", Green Group chief Jürgen Trittin said on Saturday in the ARD news broadcast "Dayshow".
It’s called lying; it’s lying.
The order to kill was issued in violation of the rules of the International Protection Force for Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the substance of the report that NATO had read to Mr Guttenberg, Trittin said.
On Friday, it was announced that the attack was not only about the destruction of the kidnapped cargoes, but also about the targeted killing of two Taliban leaders.
In the US air strike requested by German Kunduz commander Colonel Klein, up to 142 people had been killed or injured, according to the NATO investigation report.
On Saturday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) called on Greens, the SPD and the Left to express themselves immediately before the Bundestag and also to clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Ms Merkel needs to clarify whether a strategy of targeted killing is part of the Afghanistan policy of the federal government - and whether the chancellor's office, the Bundeswehr and the intelligence service have approved this new strategy, Jürgen Trittin and Grünen-Kollegin Renate Künast demanded.
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm resolutely rejected the criticism.
The chancellor’s office did not have any influence on the specific operations of the Bundeswehr in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, doubts about the Ministry’s presentation of the background to the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert had also become loud.
According to information from the SPIEGEL, the two Guttenbergs have correctly and completely informed about the background of the tank loader attack.
Officially, it had been said that they had denied the existence of NATO reports and withheld sensitive details from the minister.
However, from the environment of the two top officials, they said they had even pointed out several reports to the Ministry of Defence, including a two-page document by commanding Colonel Klein and a field-hunter report.
Wichert is said to have asked in a letter for clarification of the facts, reports the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung".
He has not received an answer so far, he said.
The ministry did not comment on the allegations on Saturday and pointed out that this was clarified in the Bundestag's Committee of Inquiry, which wants to form next Wednesday.
Dream Worlds
Some people see images and hear voices that others don’t see or hear.
Not only in mentally ill people and in drug noise, the boundaries between imagination and reality are blurred.
As long as it happens in sleep, everything is fine.
When we lie in our dark rooms with our eyes closed, we are allowed to give ourselves uninhibitedly to the wildest ideas and imaginations.
However, those who experience dreamlike states in waking up, see and hear things that others do not see or hear, are usually considered crazy or drug addicts in the modern Western world, at least as special people.
But such images and voices do not only arise in the mentally ill or in the drug rush.
Guilt is our imagination: The same neural processes that allow us to design houses, paint pictures or write novels sometimes make the boundaries between dream, delusion and reality blur.
Dreamlike altered waking states can occur in a variety of forms, at best we call them visions, at worst delusions.
Although triggers and effects may differ, the visions of the mystic Hildegard of Bingen, the drug experiences of the New Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, shamanic states of rapture, psychosis and hallucinations can be traced back to similar processes.
Hallucinations or delusions arise when the balance of the brain’s neuronal messenger substances – primarily dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin and acetylcholine – is derailed and the interaction of various brain parts is disrupted.
Complex hallucinations and delusional thoughts occur very frequently during schizophrenia psychosis.
Gravity no longer has power over him.
The connection between delusion and dream has occupied philosophers and physicians since ancient times.
Aristotle conceived hallucinations as a form of dream in the waking state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, in 1861 observed a "great similarity of insanity with dream states", for Sigmund Freud the dream was even "a psychosis, with all the inconsistencies, delusions, sensory distortions of such".
It’s autumn 2001 when Henning T. turns into a comic book character.
His body is two-dimensional and squeaky.
Gravity no longer has power over him, it floats on the ceiling of the room.
He feels a kick.
Behind him winged devils with blood-red, distorted fragments, teeth-flattering.
They chase him, kick him with heavy, flaming boots, throw him against the walls, he feels the pain on the whole body.
Loud, malicious voices are rumbling from walls and radio.
He can no longer bear it, the voices that insult and insult him.
Henning T. rips two cables from the stereo, knots them to a loop and attaches them to a hook on the ceiling.
He climbs on a loudspeaker and puts the sling around his neck.
Jump.
The sling is loosening.
This is supposed to be a lesson for you, the voices yell in a drumming chorus, "Go to the clinic and let yourself be healed!"
Today, Henning T. is 40 years old, he has experienced six acute psychoses, the last being 2 years back, the first almost 20 years.
It was triggered by LSD.
His diagnosis is schizoaffective paranoid psychosis, he is also manic-depressive, he takes medication, against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, he has been married for three years.
In psychosis, I have experienced the worst fear and deepest despair, he says.
The illusions are a cruel reality
About one percent of the population suffers from schizophrenia at least once in their lives, and in psychiatric clinics it is treated as the second most common disease after depression.
In an acute schizophrenic psychosis, those affected usually can no longer distinguish between the inner and outer worlds, they get into an overexcited state that can lead to hallucinations, size, relationship or persecution.
It is particularly common to listen to voices – voices that command, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are also rare.
The affected person can no longer separate the important from the unimportant, the brain can no longer filter out disturbing signals, the consciousness is flooded with impressions.
Like the dream, psychosis also opens the locks to a flood of ideas and fantasies that originate from deeper layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is subject-centered, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, senior physician at the Department of General Psychiatry at Heidelberg University Hospital.
The schizophrenic is located in the center of the action, everything has a direct meaning to it.
At the same time, he gets into a passive role, he is, like in a dream, overwhelmed by the events and cannot actively shape them.
Schizophrenics therefore often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
A balance of reality is usually not possible for them, the delusions are cruel reality, awakening is excluded.
Having experienced hallucination once in a lifetime
Unlike in the dream, Fuchs says, "but the sensual and spatial structure of reality, which is perceived in psychosis, remains basically preserved."
The delusional thoughts and hallucinations are based in reality, the alienation of experience takes place in the real context.
Why exactly our brain beats caprioles, researchers are still puzzled.
Exceptional states can cause any person to lose the reality reference for a short time, Fuchs says.
But not everyone will develop a psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but twin studies have shown that the genes are not the alone determining factors.
Researchers assume that there are minimal brain damage in those affected.
We suspect that the neuronal maturation of the brain is disturbed at an early stage of development, due to a viral disease of the mother during pregnancy, for example, explains Fuchs.
But it remains a mystery how the disorder of the neuronal system comes about, which also does not manifest for many years at first.
Environmental influences also play a role - stress or traumatic experiences can be triggers for psychosis when disposition is present.
Also, hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychoses because they interfere with the transmitter system.
When our brain is running hot
The crazy thing is that psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and swallow expensive drugs to get rid of them, others spend money on drugs to get some, says Lübeck psychology professor Erich Kasten.
Whether delusions are perceived as pleasant or unpleasant is often only a matter of point of view.
Kasten has been collecting reports of hallucinations and concussions for ten years, and last year he evaluated his results in the book "The Irreal World in Our Head".
Hallucinations are among the typical side effects of psychosis, but also of amazingly many other diseases.
In addition to mental disorders such as borderline or depression, these often include diseases such as migraines, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer’s and cranial trauma.
Surprisingly, under certain conditions even the brain of healthy people hallucinates.
Hallucinations, according to Kasten, are composed of memory contents that are usually held back.
They arise when brain areas in which sensory perceptions are processed are overactive or too little inhibited; when our brain is running hot or even when stimulation is lacking.
Drugs can trigger this condition just as much as brain damage or a psychosis.
But also travel, stress, love grief or other mental states.
In recent studies, up to a third of those surveyed reported having experienced hallucination at least once in their lives.
In the summer of 2005 Sarah K. is 16 years old, she lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and attends high school there.
A normal girl, actually.
If it wasn’t for the pictures and voices.
During the break, it can happen that a slick boy with long, dark hair will appeal to it.
When it responds to him, the classmates look at it in surprise—no one else sees or hears this boy.
They think the shy girl is a twisted daydreamer, but Sarah K. doesn’t dream, she knows.
She is awake, she hears and sees this boy, just as she hears and sees the girl in the bench next to her.
She can even feel his presence, at least for moments.
A pleasant feeling is that she likes the boy.
Am I crazy? she asks herself sometimes.
But she knows that this boy and the other delusions are not real and disappear again.
At night, the apparitions are mostly scary
Often, the illusions are also a burden.
When she sits in the classroom, she can sometimes not follow the teaching material, because the teacher in her eyes and ears is just introducing a new classmate, while explaining mathematical equations to everyone else, both audible and visible, on the board.
At night, the apparitions are usually scary.
When she waits for sleep in her dark room, which is far too rare and far too late, she often can’t tell if she’s awake or already dreaming about the pictures she sees, the frats or the girl with the bleeding cuts on her arms and legs, in front of her open or closed eyes.
Leave me alone, she yells at the figures.
Parents and friends don’t tell her they think they’re crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
She passed the high school last year and lives with her boyfriend.
A year ago, the hallucinations stopped.
Since she has contacted the psychologist box on the Internet, she knows exactly that she is not crazy.
Wahn is also a work of art of desperation
If someone is socially isolated or suffers from a draw, he is likely to have hallucinations after a while, Kasten says.
I suspect the brain is then underemployed and takes care of its own entertainment.
Sarah K., a single child, was afraid of other children as a little girl, often playing alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at the age of 13, that the man she calls Papa has not been her biological father since she can think.
Since in visual and acoustic hallucinations the same areas of the brain are active, which also process real impressions and sounds, it is difficult for those affected like Sarah K. to distinguish illusions and reality. “Every experience,” Kasten says, “is taking place in the brain, the reality forms there.
Hallucinations are also images that make the brain come into being, which is why they seem so real.”
Even nocturnal dream images value boxing as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally different from those of acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics, mentally healthy people are able to recognize their delusions as irrational.
Kasten therefore advises his patients to appreciate the hallucinations as a special ability.
Boundary state between dream and hallucination
Unfortunately, in our overly conscious world, imaginary experience is mostly pathologized, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor in Heidelberg and chief physician of the Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy of the Florence Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious, distressing disease, but it also contains positive, creative - delusion is also a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has researched the so-called oneiroid experience form, a special form of traumatized waking consciousness.
Oneiroids are highly complex, detailed quasi-dreams, which the experiencer considers real and which he cannot distinguish from the waking state even afterwards.
The oneiroid state of consciousness arises in trauma- or disease-related extreme situations, for example in polyradiculitis patients who experience motor paralysis with full consciousness.
When a person is threatened by self-loss and world loss, for example, by persistent, complete inability to move, he replaces the life-threatening real situation with a separate, imaginary world that is disconnected from reality, Schmidt-Degenhard says.
A kind of boundary state between dream and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to cope with a situation in reality, a world change takes place, but the real situation is perceived in the imagination.
An intense form of meaning and meaning in an inherently intolerable situation that enables us humans to have their own design ability, not to fall into a nothingness of loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in memory
Zurich art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen also describes his Oneiroid experiences in his book "Heart change" as a rescue action of the soul.
He is 49 years old when his consciousness travels for days after a heart valve surgery followed by a heart transplant, while his body is condemned to motionlessness at the intensive care unit.
Claussen dives into a self-created world, visits strange times and places: he experiences himself as a bedridden, old man, aboard a train sanatorium, a robot watches over his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages among nobles who produce drugs from blood.
Being taken by a Greek on a motorcycle in his native country, surfs with his hospital bed in the firn snow of the Alps and meets a Korean mafioso.
He goes completely into the imaginary happenings, everything is real, even later in memory.
These inner journeys are fundamentally different for Claussen from any dream.
Dream is another condition, he describes his experience.
In contrast, the memories from mental journeys after years and in incidental details are clear to me.
More clear and intense even than really experienced.
The intensity of this experience blows up the horizon of our other life experiences, says psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
In the end, oneiroids, psychoses, hallucinations, and drug noise show how fragile our inner images of outer reality are in the wake.
Any change in the state of consciousness, summarizes the psychologist Kasten, "can lead to a deformation of what we call reality."
An experience that can also be enriching.
The snow can come
Burda
Children should take over the publishing house at the age of 27
The new head of publishing Kallen is an interim solution: In the long term, Hubert Burda wants to give his company into the hands of his two children, he told SPIEGEL.
The holding will continue to belong to 100% of the family in the future.
Hamburg - The publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children in the long term.
Both children inherit at the age of 27 and have a firm will to enter the company, the 69-year-old told SPIEGEL.
We have precautionally regulated the details of this.
The question of whether they are also active in the company only arises afterwards.
The question is whether they are able to do so.
You cannot introduce 7,500 employees to their children if they are not sufficiently qualified.
That kills the children and the company too.
Burda announced on Thursday that he would retire from the Executive Board from January and appointed Paul-Bernhard Kallen as his successor.
The 52-year-old Kallen has been a member of the board of Burda since 1999.
Initially, he was responsible for technology.
Later, with the Treasury division, responsibility for corporate assets was added, and after Jürgen Todenhöfer left, also those for direct marketing, foreign, print and finance.
For the first time, no family member is at the top of the publishing house.
Burda's children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who was 42 years old today, died a few years ago.
The designation of Kallen also serves to bridge "10, 15 years", Burda said.
The holding should remain 100 percent of the family in the future, Burda said.
In view of the cases of fate and Schaeffler, Burda stated that even family businesses are not safe from the downfall: "This always concerned families who were infected by a capital addiction that was completely speculative and thought they could rise to the very big player.
My strategy was never that.
He had "no world power dreams," Burda said.
I don’t see myself as the political preceptor of this country as it was Springer, and I don’t want to compete in the World League with ‘Time’, these stores have become too big.
Perfect beauty
Everything you want in terms of beauty and well-being is now at your disposal.
At least that’s what El Corte Inglés has done, which recently opened a retail store with an area of more than 1000 m2 in the shopping center in Callao (Madrid), where everything is all about personal care.
In the wellness area, which is located on the eighth floor, you will find other well-known companies such as Hedonai, which provide hair removal with lasers; Spaxi<0xC3><0xB3>n, with rooms for relaxation and beauty treatments; the hairdressers Luis & Tachi, Marina d'Or with a gym or L'Occitane with their natural cosmetics.
However, there is also a food department that stands out through their tea house with more than 130 different tea varieties.
Enjoy a relaxing massage together with your partner while having a fantastic view of the capital, or rent the relaxation area for two hours to put your own "beauty party" with eight girlfriends on your feet and then relax in the hot tub or with massages and a glass of champagne, these are just a few of the many ways Spaxi<0xC3><0xB3>n offers.
The total area is 250 m2, which is divided into 12 rooms for the latest facial and body treatments as well as for hydrotherapy.
For example, for cavitation in the fight against cellulitis or with vibrating surfaces.
The gym also has this type of equipment, and there are also virtual trainers who take care of the training sessions of the customers and thus provide them with a completely personal training.
You start a training session by entering a personal password on a touchscreen that is located opposite the devices.
After that, various videos will show you how to perform your workouts correctly.
The head of the gym assures that 15 minutes (including warm-up and stretching exercises) are enough to train the body muscles.
And if, after you have trained your body, you still want to visit the hair salon, the company Luis & Tachi has a room where treatments for regaining hair splendor, shine and health are offered in a personalized way for your hair.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to be the key words for this wellness area in the middle of the city, which is always open from 10.00 a.m. to 22.00 p.m. 365 days a year.
The most diverse décolletés
Christmas is getting closer and therefore it is again a good opportunity to copy the look of the stars and bring their party dresses into our wardrobe.
The shape of the décolleté, which is very important for highlighting the silhouette, is one of the points that needs to be considered.
Here are some suggestions.
The singer Fergie has chosen an exaggerated and very complicated décolleté, which you can only advise against.
Endesa and Barcelona by electric car
The power company Endesa, together with the city of Barcelona, has created the "LIVE office".
This is a project for the development and promotion of electric cars in the Catalan capital.
The "LIVE office" (Logistics for the introduction of the electric car) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the introduction of the electric car in the city and make agreements on mobility by managing, coordinating, subsidising, etc.
On the other hand, the MOVELE project is being developed to promote the electric car and to summarize opinions and measures of the areas concerned.
This is an attempt to advance the means of transport of the future.
3 "electric cities"
However, Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the introduction of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville are also participating in this project.
These are the three cities selected by the government in the MOVELE project to accelerate the introduction of the electric car.
The electricity company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the government of Catalonia (la Generalitat).
This framework agreement aims to promote research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These activities are, among other things, activities related to energy and, in particular, to its performance.
However, it is by no means the only initiative in which Endesa participates in the promotion of the electric car.
The company participates in standardisation groups across Europe and maintains a number of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees “a horizon of calm” for the automotive sector
The President of the Government, José Luis Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Zapatero, prophesied the Spanish automotive industry, which is the country's largest exporter, "a horizon of calm".
At the presentation of the 2009 economic report by the President of the Government, Zapatero once again recalled the measures that the government initiated in support of the automotive sector during the year of the government.
“Without the plan for the competitiveness of the automotive industry, we would today have a panorama of the neglect and closure of some of our main production plants,” he said.
"Thanks to this plan and the willingness of car manufacturers to continue to produce in Spain in a highly competitive industry, we can see a calm horizon for the supply of this industry, which is our largest export industry," he added.
He also recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, which is part of the overall plan for the automotive industry (PIA), provided €800 million for projects by 19 vehicle manufacturers and 137 suppliers, which in turn provided investment of more than €3 billion.
The head of government explained that these investments are intended both for the development of new models, as well as for the modernization of existing products and processes.
Zapatero also underlined the government's measures to boost demand, in reference to Plan 2000E, which are applied in cooperation with the Autonomous Communities and car manufacturers.
According to the head of government, this plan allows the emissions of new vehicles sold on the Spanish market to be reduced by an average of 6%, which in turn led to a "strong increase" in approvals, which rose "by 40 percent" in November.
On 20,000 square meters of classic vehicles
The first edition of the International Classic Motor Show will be held in Madrid, an exhibition for professionals and lovers of the world of motors.
This fair will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 at the Pabell<0xC3><0xB3>n de Cristal of the Casa de Campo in Madrid.

Skill tests with classic cars and motorcycles are also carried out on a specially equipped race track in the outdoor area of the exhibition grounds.
Mazda3 i-Stop: Eco-friendly Sportiness
Mazda wants to prove that sportiness is perfectly compatible with the protection of the environment.
For this reason, Mazda recently introduced the automatic stop and start-up system of the engine, named i-Stop, in the Mazda3 model, a device that is currently only available for the 2.0 petrol engine with 150 hp.
This second generation of the Mazda 3 stands out by its good grades in the overall picture.
The final processing, the execution of the vehicle, the comfort, its road behaviour, the mechanics, the i-stop system ...
All of these aspects are “very good” with the new Mazda3.
Starting with the front seats, you can see that the front seats offer excellent ergonomics and good grip.
Furthermore, the game of the steering wheel is excellent.
Looking further at the unit, which consists of the instrument panel and the dashboard, it can be seen that Mazda, with a variety of buttons and switches in the striking colors red and blue, is on the same line as the Japanese trend towards a futuristic interior design.
This style reminds us in part of the style of the Honda Civic.
Therefore, it can easily be said that both the Mazda 3 and the Civic, both Japanese models, stand out from the sobriety of German cars, especially the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to surpass.
The passenger compartment of these two Japanese compact cars offers more than ever the appropriate comfort, so that four adults can ride comfortably by car at first.
To all this comes a large and clearly shaped trunk.
The stop and start-up system is currently only available for the 2-litre petrol engine with 150 hp and a 6-speed transmission.
This engine is a real pleasure, it stands out by its fineness, by its quiet noise, its performance and by its low consumption.
And all those who don’t drive many kilometers a year should consider this i-stop with gasoline engine because of its great comfort in gearshifting and its low consumption, even though at Mazda especially the diesel models are the best-selling.
In terms of equipment, the so-called Sportive model selected for the test drive is a special feature, since it has a significantly larger number of elements from the standard equipment.
The series equipment mainly features the assistant for the lane change (RVM), which thereby eliminates the dead angle, but also the controls for traction and stability, speed control, the light-sensitive interior mirrors, the on-board computer with a large screen, the sensors for parking, an independent air conditioning, rain and light sensors, Bluetooth and audio Bluetooth as well as the chrome.
Moreover, this version also includes, as if that were not enough equipment, the Premium package, which contains the following for an additional 1,500 euros: in addition to other elements, especially the learnable Bixenon headlights and the sound system BOSE with CD charger.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars of its class.
It is particularly outstanding in terms of the materials used, due to its driving behaviour and the variety of equipment.
Moreover, those who do not travel many kilometers a year can also buy the i-Stop version, which is only available with a 2.0 petrol engine with 150 hp.
The only negative about this model is its somewhat high price, which is between 21,770 euros for the model Luxury and 23,270 euros for the tried-and-tested model Sportive.
However, in return for this high price, the Mazda3 offers us the highest driving experience every day.
A premiere with a lot of glamour
L. A. rolls out the red carpet of sensuality for Penélope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
At the premiere of "Nine", the stars, dressed in models that look just as elegant and sexy, shined more than ever.
Our "Pe", as elegant as ever, chose a dark "Lady" dress.
The promises of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, a device with which you can only read your emails without a way to see certain attachments or surf the Internet.
It enjoyed its five minutes of fame when it chose Time magazine as one of the products of the year.
Seeing it on the street is rather unlikely, but the idea itself is still of interest especially to young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek only costs very little and has a very cheap flat rate, for example, only half the price of an iPhone's flat rate.
After seeing the company’s success with it, it has launched two new devices: one intended only for Twitter, the other with a lifetime free service for data, quite unlike Peek, where you have to pay a six-time higher price.
Fonpeek, presented yesterday at the event Le Web, is the European version of this invention and thus its third version.
It has the same boundaries as its American counterpart, however, has a surprise ready.
The monthly maintenance price for the phone, about 12 euros per month, includes roaming for all of Europe.
Those who travel around the world with a smartphone already know what it means to have to do without all the data in order to be able to read their emails as soon as you have crossed the national border or if you are desperately looking for a café with WIFI (or a connection with Fon).
The idea of flat rate roaming is incredibly seductive and should actually have been possible for a long time.
It is true that some telephone providers already offer special contracts and prices for stays abroad, but in my experience you already need a doctorate in physics and a good pair of glasses in order to be able to read all the small print.
The repeated criticism by the European Commission regarding affordable roaming tariffs for the whole of Europe has almost always been ignored.
Outside of your own country, you are always afraid to read your emails and rightly so.
The fact that a small device like FonPeek (although it’s always amazing that it has the name Fon even though it doesn’t have Wi-Fi/WLAN) can offer these types of rates means that phone providers need to think slowly but safely and start considering different ways to use their data network.
Kindle is another good example of this, its prices include downloading books and other requests on the Internet.
Without carry and without hooks.
This is an internet-enabled device and you only pay for it once, i.e. when you buy it, and not monthly.
And that’s exactly what I expect from FonPeek one day, a purchase option with lifelong internet access as Peek already offers in the US.
Not because I want to buy it.
I read my emails with the phone, thank you.
But I expect this because I think it would be a more appropriate model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
The fetish color of Michelle
Yellow is undoubtedly the favorite color of the American First Lady.
When Barack Obama took office as President of the United States, she appeared in a dress and a coat of this color and chose the same color again to accompany him at his second most important moment in his life: the award of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama has worn very similar models on both occasions: although it was almost the same color - a shiny green-yellow -, the clothes consisted of three parts - dress, jacket and coat made of the same fabric-, and she wore something roughly embroidered or a necklace.
It even goes so far that at first sight it seemed that the First Lady of the United States wanted to follow the example of the Princess of Asturias and had decided to wear the same dress on more than one occasion.
However, the two dresses differ greatly in the type of fabric from which they are made.
At the inauguration, she wore a lace dress and a patterned velvet in Oslo.
The accessories were also different: the first time green shoes with half-high heels and the second time a decent model, but golden.
The hairstyle was also different every time: the hair was put up as a hair ring on this occasion, the previous time she wore the hair open.
75% of working mothers have had problems at work because of their motherhood
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially among younger women who want to have children.
This is the result of a study carried out by CSIC in collaboration with the Institute for Women’s Fertility and Career of Women in Spain.
The survey of 9,737 women between the ages of 15 and 75 leaves no doubt about this: 75% of working women see their career opportunities in the labour market limited due to their motherhood.
The study reveals that there are big differences in the decision to start a family and the number of children, depending on whether the women work or not, and if so, what kind of profession they practice.
Those of them who do no other work outside the house, work only half a day or have no fixed employment contract, are more likely to become mothers and have more children.
In contrast, women with permanent employment, especially in the public sector, are moving towards the establishment of a family and motherhood and therefore have fewer children.
The women in the age group between 35 and 49 with a permanent position receive their first child on average only 3.7 years after contracting, a figure that increases to 4.1 years for women with permanent positions who have taken longer to achieve this and who have only realized their contraction and the first child much later.
Moreover, the type of work also has a major impact on motherhood, albeit less than the calendar in terms of conception readiness,” explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that must be taken into account in the age of women in marriage and the first child.
According to the survey, the age at the time of marriage and the first child is all the higher, the higher the level of education.
This difference was also found in women of the same age.
For example, the women in the group aged between 35 and 49, depending on whether they only have the primary school diploma or higher education, became mothers for the first time on average with 25.1 or 32.1 respectively.
Furthermore, depending on their level of education, there is another difference between women.
While the women with the main degree already get married before their first permanent position and have their first child, the women with a middle or high school degree do it exactly differently and first look for a permanent position and then get married and then have their first child, Delgado notes.
Diane Kruger is also worth it.
L'Oréal Paris recently added a new name to its all-encompassing list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
Starting next year, the German actress will be the image of different products of the brand and will also say the well-known ad slogan "Because you're worth it".
The main actress from "Joyex No<0xC3><0xAB>l", one of the most elegant actresses on an international level, will thus become another famous poster such as before her Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and Spanish actress Penélope Cruz.
Before her, the last to join this exclusive club were the actresses Evangeline Lilly ("Lost") and Freida Pinto ("Slumdog Millonaire").
Among the men, the cosmetics company also has only exceptional ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey ("Grey's Anatomy") and Matthew Fox (a playmate of Evangeline in "Lost").
The award ceremony of the British fashion industry
The British have an important word to say in the fashion world.
Their highest representatives – fashion designers and models, both yesterday and today – met at the annual award ceremony held in London at the Royal Court of Justice.
For this reason, they had all appeared.
The ex-model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, who was voted best model of the year.
The Poker Game of Manuel Vicente
Manuel Vicente presents in "Poker of Aces" (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) the three X-rays of writers who have accompanied him in his literary life (and, in some cases, also in real life).
He does not use a predictable and fear-influencing genre (short biography, life and work), but rather looks for a similarity to the glowing heart of the Creator.
The journey is exciting and Vicente doesn’t save on horror or enlightenment.
However, this book is a delicious reading pleasure, it is also a moving invitation to read and read over and over again.
Here are some excerpts from the book.
On Albert Camus: "When reading his pages, I found that the Mediterranean is not a sea, but rather a spiritual, almost sensual drive, just as I have always felt, without having found words for it: the joy in contrast to the incurable fate, morality without guilt, and innocence without any god."
About Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, allegorical Christian, he wrote about what he had in his blood, not in his mind, between impotence and ignorance, with a stunning poetic humor, without any sense, like the knife blade that almost killed him."
About Graham Greene: "Our man was captivated by this woman with a passion that lasted thirteen years, whose flesh combined emotions due to adultery with the pleasure of repentance, a spiritual privilege that consisted in coming to heaven on the detour of destruction."
About James Joyce: "The Odyssey" was published by Sylvia Beach in Paris in 1922. It is one of the 8000 summits in world literature, one has to climb up on the north wall, on the wall where the best climbers try again and again."
About William Faulkner: "He was a funny chew.
He sometimes said of himself that he was the heir of a landowner of the county and again other times he said that he was the son of a black and a crocodile.
Both dreams bear witness to a certain greatness."
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: This writer took up the insane scream that was screamed out of a bridge from that personality from Munich, so that his echo echoes into the night of the 20th century echoed in his literary way. This he did in a journey, in which he fled before himself and in a speech full of violence in front of the worms appealed to the afterlife.
About Dorothy Parker: "One day she knelt down and prayed: my venerable God, I ask you to do everything in your power so that I finally stop writing like a woman."
About Joseph Conrad: "On his grave these verses of Spencer are engraved: 'sleep after the effort,/ after the thunderstorm of the port,/ the rest after the war,/ after a full life one finds pleasure in death."
About Virginia Wolf: "She always had her depression in her luggage.
The husband took it with complete normality when she told him that Edward VII was spying on her between the Azaleas or singing the birds in Greek.
No other case is known where the man was so patient and in love with a neurotic whose literary talent was much greater than her madness."
About P<0xC3><0xAD>o Baroja: "What did Mart<0xC3><0xAD>n-Santos do other than try to inflate Joyce in Baroja?
What did Benet intend to do if he did not lead Baroja to Faulkner's weapons?
What, then, did Cela, except to destroy the glory of that man, so that he could put himself on this podium?"
Feige Aggression
My 70-year-old mother walked through our neighborhood in the village of Fuenlabrada last week, when suddenly a group of young people between the ages of 15 and 18 walked next to her and our dog, our dog is a mixed dog that we brought out of the shelter and weighs just six kilos, and then out of the serene sky they missed him two footsteps and hurt him severely.
Our indignation cannot be put into words at all, since it is incomprehensible to us, where the fun in a cheap aggression against a small and helpless animal, which of course was carried out on the leash.
In addition, the suffocation attack that a woman who walked comfortably got when she wanted to correct these people because of the incident, she even feared for her own life, because if such a madman attacks a dog, he will perhaps do the same with a woman, a child, an older gentleman, or probably even with anyone who is weaker than himself.
The incident occurred in a normally quiet neighborhood at five o’clock in the afternoon on an ordinary Tuesday.
The dog cried all day long.
Of course, we have reported in a nearby police station, but we have great doubts whether this will bring anything at all and in order to prevent any prejudices from the very beginning, we just want to make it clear that the cowardly criminals were Spaniards.
Our indignation about what happened has led us to point out this incident.
We cannot understand what must happen in the minds of these young people that they find a cheap attack on a helpless animal funny, on an animal that gives us love, society and friendship.
We do not know where the good education and respect for the animals and the people have remained.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of the helmet
The tyre manufacturer Michelin, in collaboration with the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to promote helmet use, especially among younger motorcyclists, as both companies announced today.
This initiative aims to draw attention to the importance of helmet use, since it is ultimately the only protective element that can prevent head injuries or even death in the event of a motorcycle accident.
Michelin pointed out that this campaign is part of its commitment to road safety, which “is far more than just designing and manufacturing products that become safer every day,” and further reaffirmed that with other actions of educational and informative character, it also helps to move one step closer to this goal every day.
This new campaign to promote helmet use on the motorcycle, which runs under the slogan 'To be or not to be', will distribute posters to over 500 motorcycle workshops in a first phase, in order to achieve the best possible distribution.
In conclusion, Michelin stressed that road safety is “a constant concern” of the company, and precisely because, as a manufacturer of tyres for two-wheeled vehicles, they are always committed to the development of increasingly safer products.
Sales of small trucks are on the rise again
After almost two years, the car market for vans finally begins to see some light at the end of the dark tunnel.
The 9,425 vehicles approved in Spain in November represent an increase of 12.6% in relation to 2008, and, more importantly, they are the first ever increase after 22 consecutive months of steady decline, according to the figures presented by the manufacturer association Anfac and the car dealer association Ganvam.
However, these good figures are only to be enjoyed with great caution at the moment, since the reference data used for comparison are from November 2008, which was a particularly bad sales year with a 60% decrease compared to the previous year.
However, it must be borne in mind that, apart from the increase in the last month, the total admissions of these 11 months are still 40% below the sales figures of the previous financial year.
Since January, a total of 95,853 vehicles have been sold, but this number includes all vehicles that make up the van market: descendants of passenger cars, pick-ups, vans, small vans and lighter vans/cars.
Furthermore, the same storm clouds are still in the sky, which are most affected by demand, because even if some of the vehicles are bought by private individuals, the bulk of the sales goes to small and medium-sized enterprises, which in almost 100% of all cases make the purchase with a third-party financing.
In this way, it is necessary to include further factors to these restrictions, which are the result of the credit institutions' turned-on money tap, such as the increase in the unemployment rate or the continuation of the poor economic situation.
With this panorama and in contrast to the passenger cars, the financial support for the purchase of a vehicle of Plan 2000E has helped little.
This plan is not only intended for private individuals, however, even self-employed and small companies have a right to buy a van up to 3.5 tonnes with a CO2 emission that cannot exceed 160 grams per kilometre driven, but the low sales figures speak for themselves.
Just yesterday Ganvam had reminded us that it is absolutely necessary on the part of the state to also pay special attention to these small trucks as well as of course also to the industrial vehicles (trucks and buses).
The Automobile Dealers Association predicted a similar year for 2010 to the previous year, for which it expects a 19 % drop in sales (for passenger cars and off-road vehicles).
Support for braking manoeuvres in critical situations is now mandatory
As was the case with the ABS anti-lock braking system at the time and as is currently the case with the stability control ESP, the auxiliary braking systems must become mandatory equipment in European cars in case of emergency.
In fact, they are already mandatory for all newly registered passenger cars and light vans, for the remaining vehicles a waiting period has been set until the end of February 2011.
The aim of the measure adopted by the European Union is to improve the protection of pedestrians, but these braking systems can also help to prevent many collisions due to their operation.
The task of the emergency brake assistant is to exert more pressure on the brakes in the event of a critical brake manoeuvre which detects the system on the brake pedal on the basis of the brake strength performed by the driver.
However, this system does not exert this pressure until the end.
According to an investigation commissioned by the component manufacturer for the Bosch vehicles, a third of the drivers involved in an accident were no longer able to step on the brake pedal before the collision and half of them had not braked with full force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The braking aid, on the other hand, intervenes with maximum force in the braking system and thereby reduces the braking time and thus also the braking distance that a car travels during the braking process.
According to a study conducted by the EU, up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be prevented each year if all cars were equipped with this type of emergency brake assistant.
There would be even fewer accidents – one expects that every fourth accident could be prevented with personal injury – as soon as the so-called intelligent emergency braking systems become popular.
Then the vehicle is equipped with a system that detects obstacles (via radar or a camera) and warns the driver, while at the same time exerting a slight pressure on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, the system helps him to increase the pressure on the brake pedal if necessary.
If the driver does not respond to the warning and even if the collision is already inevitable, the brake assistant exerts the maximum pressure on the brakes in order to keep the damage as low as possible.
General Motors postpones plan for Opel until January
While the staff of the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) have already been informed by Nick Reilly, the new chairman of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva will start in the first week of April, probably on the 8th, according to Javier Ortega, the American vehicle manufacturer points out that he needs more time to complete the rescue plan for Opel.
Nick Reilly, GM Europe’s new chairman, wants the affected side to give its approval to every single point of the plan in advance.
And for this reason, it may be that the final document, which will first be presented to the workers and then to the governments of the countries in which there are works, will be postponed until the beginning of 2010.
On the other hand, GM is assured that it will make a decision on the sale of Saab in the next few days.
It is not surprising that the Swedish government has increased the pressure on the American automaker to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to being in contact with some potential new buyers.
One of these buyers could be Geely, who would also like to buy Volvo, but the option of the Dutch manufacturer of the Skyper sports cars, which has back cover from the Russian group Converg, is gaining more and more traction.
If none of these buyers were to reach an agreement, GM could sell some assets to the Chinese BAIC.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year, if it has not been sold until then, will continue to be maintained.
At the wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
For the development of their latest and very expensive jewel, the engineers used the Boxster S as the basis and really managed to make it easier by 80 kilos, which now only weighs 1,275 kilos.
In order to create such a thing, they first dispensed with the automatic folding roof, which was replaced by a tent curtain roof with manual drive, so that you alone saved 21 kilos; thanks to the aluminum doors used in this model such as the GT3 "disappear" another 15; by the removal of the air-conditioning another 13; moreover, the fuel tank from 64 to 54 liters was added to the tank, and the fuel tank from 64 to 54 liters was added.
Then, by renouncing the audio system CDR-30, six kilos less had been reached again and by replacing the door handles with handles made of fabric the missing kilo.
Although it is also available with the PDK dual-clutch transmission, the test drive was carried out with a vehicle with 6-speed manual transmission, mainly on the smaller California highways, on mountain tracks that were really very curvy.
With his driving behavior, you can only give him the note flawlessly.
The reduction of its weight, however, has by no means led to the fact that it would no longer be so safe on the road.
It is more the opposite: for a long time we have not tried such a small and light model, which gives you but at the same time also a feeling of great safety in the curves, even at high speed.
He is a small athlete, able to warm his muscles at a low gear in the required time until we give him the orders to race, brake, recover and then get everything out of his engine again...
The car does everything we suggest with our hands on the steering wheel, thanks to its steering, which is as communicative as it is precise.
And he does it with the precision of a surgeon.
A motor sound for all tastes
The sound of its V6 Boxer with 320 PS (10 more than the Boxster S) has been extremely successful and you can still increase it with the 'sport' option as well as with a system that can change the engine noise, which was already used for the first time at Panamera.
The ability to accelerate is unimaginably brutal, whether it’s standing out or accelerating again.
The suspensions are strong, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt on the country roads on which we drove with the Boxster Spyder was already quite damaged, but the car mastered the potholes well.
The electronic assistants had almost nothing to do throughout the course; and this, although we found ice in the morning grey and rolling split at some of these curves in the morning.
To sum up, it’s an ultra-light car, a car with which you have an indescribable ride, as it is otherwise rather rare and in it there is much more than just a small improvement of the Boxster Ss.
The car will be on the market in February 2010 and will cost 70,831 euros.
Bag Girl
The singer, a busty friend of Karl Lagerfeld, is the face of the Coco Cocoon cosmetics line and an occasional star in the fashion shows of 'maison', she presents her evil face with the same neck stiffness as her pockets of Chanel.
Much more than "Bad Girl" or "It Girl", she is a "Bag Girl".
The Basque Country gives itself a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral, despite the many out-of-the-box players on the Dusko Ivanovic team, celebrated an excellent 82-91 triumph on his visit to the complicated football field of the Maccabi Electra, coming in first place within his group after the great performance of Mirza Teletovic, who was the best of his team with eight triples (29 in the review).
The Vitoria team was able to replace the significant failures of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with a large dose of effort and teamwork, even if they had to wait until the bitter end for their victory.
The great hits from the perimeter with 16 rated triples contributed to their final victory.
The game began with the leadership of the blue-reds, who sat at the top of the billboard from the start.
Since the first four baskets of the team from Vitoria were already coming out of the perimeter, one could already guess that they had come to the field with well-warmed wrists.
It was English and Teletovic who were mainly responsible for the 18-20 at the end of the first quarter.
The second quarter was hardly different, only that the <0xC3><0x81>lava team opted for an inside game of Barac and for the game of Eliyahu, which was received on his return to the team with whistles and applause, which is his home to expand their advantage further until the break (34-43).
Teletovic already began to stand out as the best of his team with 13 points, even though the "minus six" rating from Splitter already suggested that this would not be the best evening of the Brazilian.
Nevertheless, despite the clear advantage of the break, the game had not yet been decided and the Maccabees wanted to remind the Victorians once again that not everyone wins on their field, and thanks to the repeatedly attacking "hand of Elijah" they came back into the game.
Eidson and Pnini contributed decisively to the "yellows" turning the rudder (50-49).
Even more disadvantages
The team of Ivanovic, injured, but anything but dead, had to prepare a few moves with safety to get air again and at one of them suddenly came the Mirza Teletovic pistol, which, with three almost consecutive triples and with the support of English and Ribas, was able to make sure that the ad panel showed a more soothing distance of (54-67), which the host was able to give at the end of the quarter.
The Alavese were bled in the last quarter, and English and San Emeterio (60-75) already announced that they would not allow anyone to take back the victory they had honestly earned in the first three minutes.
Nevertheless, Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team, did not resign and tried to give their team strength again by three points off the line (70-77).
Despite this, and although Splitter was eliminated due to fouls, Ivanovic's team did not give up, defended well and although the Israelis were still picking up in the last minute (80-85), the game had already won and Tel Aviv lost for the first time this season.
Injuries prevented Unicaja from being offered the forehead
Unicaja lost loudly in Greece against Olympiacos and had to step down in Group B of the Euroliga to him, and that in a game marked by the failure of the players of Unicajas (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), especially in the indoor game, which facilitated the victory of the Greeks.
The M<0xC3><0xA1>laga team was not afraid of the mood in the hall of peace and friendship, nor of the opposing team, which is perhaps one of the strongest in Europe and has a lot of money.
Thanks to their offered game in the first quarter, the Andalusians were allowed to start dreaming. An aggressive defense and three consecutive triples, two of them by Omar Cook and one by Guillem Rubio, blinded the hosts at 12-18 in the 9th minute.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of the honor Unicaja, even though the local team with an in-game between Bourousis, Vujcic and Sortsanitis managed to show the ad board in their favor in the 13th minute 22-20, the minute in which due to an action almost to the beating between the two Americans Beverley and Williams, and why both were disqualified.
The Greek team began to finally warm up and its superiority on both halves of the game, while the departure of Englishman Joel Freeland due to an injury and the three self-inflicted mistakes of Carlos Jiménez left clear marks at Unicaja.
Among their players in the indoor field and Lithuanian forward Linas Kleizas, with his triples, they increased their advantage in the 19th minute to 44-32.
A catch-up was impossible
The third quarter was characterized by many attacks against the Olympiacos team, which, despite its 19 losses, proved to be superior and even managed to offset the difference of the game played in M<0xC3><0xA1>laga by 66-48 in the 27th minute, which in turn caused the leadership within the group to fluctuate.
Unicaja tried to get over the many failures and the elimination of Robert Archibald, who was injured during the game.
Despite the many disadvantages for the Unicaja, in the 31st minute, thanks to the spring lead and the triples of Cook and the use of Lewis came back some hope for 66-57.
Nevertheless, it was actually impossible, as the Olympiacos, as soon as he attacked and showed his superiority with centimetres within the basket area, could not slow down.
Croatian captain Nikola Vujcic managed in the 37th minute to raise the basket difference to 81-62 and Unicaja had to beat himself and had to step down the lead at Olympiacos.
How much should you earn based on your profile on Facebook?
Users of Facebook can now experience their salary thanks to the new application Trovit, the search engine with the most ads of real estate, job offers and cars in Spain, which they should earn based on their profile.
The tool "How much should you earn?" calculates the salaries of users based on more than 140,000 job offers available at Trovit in Spain. Users are provided with a form in Facebook that allows them to enter their profession, work experience, age and the city in which they work.
Already after a week after the application was available for the first time, the search engine found that the Spanish employee, on average, feels "poorly paid," explains the Trovit manager, Albert Ribera, in a press release.
The Spaniards are the worst paid according to the data that Trovit has through its search engines in the UK and France.
A British programmer receives an annual gross salary of 45,226 euros and a Frenchman 31,059, as opposed to the 24,000 euros earned by a Spaniard.
Consequently, a truck driver has an annual net salary of 34,247 euros in England, 25,751 in France and 16,420 euros in Spain.
According to Trovit, the worst paid work in Spain is that of a waiter with 11,592 euros a year; followed by the work of a seller with 14,725 euros and that of a worker with 15,667 euros.
The most sought-after jobs on the Internet in the last three months are those of a driver, half-day jobs and social workers.
Brazil calls Zelaya a date to leave
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya’s stay in their embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The President removed from office must leave the diplomatic mission no later than 27 January 2010 if his mandate expires officially
Francisco Catunda, the trade delegate to the Brazilian embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows that before that date he must have left the embassy where he had found asylum since September 21.
"He is aware that he has to leave on January 27, as his mandate expires on that day and he has to look for a new accommodation."
The broadcaster also quoted the ex-president, who confirmed his intention to leave the message before the set deadline: "My point of view is to go as soon as possible, logically with the backing of the government of Brazil," Zelaya said on the phone.
After the November 29 elections (which saw Porfirio Lobo emerge as the winner), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, this week he tried to get refuge in Brazil.
However, this failed in the refusal of Zelayas to recognize the status of an asylum-seeking politician whom the de facto government, chaired by Roberto Micheletti, wanted to impose on him.
Thank you very much!
After the most tempting days since last spring, when the inflation of assets was the prevailing mood in the markets, uncertainty has returned in the markets, which is in no way surprising, since this is its natural state, in an environment where brokers make decisions about a naturally uncertain future.
The measure used to stabilise the markets was to settle the debt with the direct purchase of assets and indirectly to leave the liquidity free at interest rates that move around zero, so that the banks buy assets to pay off.
The central banks have already confirmed that the direct purchases of assets are almost complete and, without questioning their heterodox liquidity policy, are starting to scatter some sand into the gear, as the BCE n<0xC3><0xA6>c already predicted with its annual auction, will take place next week.
Therefore, investors doubt the ability of the global economy to sustain economic recovery without these heterodox measures and we are just witnessing a reversal in reducing risk premiums.
The volatility of exchanges and the differences in corporate bonuses are rising again, even though they are still far from the paranormal amounts they reached at the beginning of the year.
The states were forced to nationalize the private risks and the public debt is rising again.
It now relies on quality again and the USA, Japan and Germany are the preferred refuge of investors, which in turn leads to an increase in the differences between the eurozone countries in terms of Germany.
Spain was hardly affected by this episode of instability until now, but then Standard & Poor's came and threatened to come down with a new revision regarding Spain's rating.
On the other hand, some uncertainty does not hurt to silence the defenders of moral risk who had once again tried to raise awareness among those responsible for the world economic policy for what they had caused, as they had slowed down the devastating effects to which the restriction of credit led to the loss of jobs, when they should have decided a new day of thanksgiving.
Nevertheless, what happened in Dubai indicates a tribal war between the Emirs in order to restore power in the Emirates and the development in Greece was predicted earlier.
A government that conceals public debt, elections, and a new government that pulls in the same direction.
Prodi made it in Italy to Berlusconi and S<0xC3><0xB3>crates in Portugal to Dur<0xC3><0xA3>o Barroso.
It makes no sense for Ecofin to save Hungary at the beginning of the year from non-fulfilment of its foreign payments and thus allow a euro member state to no longer fulfil its obligations.
On the other hand, it is logical that Ecofin has forced the Greek government to be transparent and to take its citizens into the obligation to maintain the stability of state funds in the event of the need for extraordinary measures.
Yes, we are, as expected, ahead of an episode of normalization of risk premiums, after some devaluations on too high amounts, that would now be within the expectation.
In the case of Spain, there is no need to worry as long as the differences in public debt increase at the same rate as the European corporate bonuses.
However, if European differences were to decrease and the Spanish continued to increase, this would be a special Spanish risk.
Standard & Poor's is a farce. While its preferred indicators force a large part of the market research institutes to prefer their recovery scenarios and correct their 2011 scenario upwards, including the OCDE and the European Commission, which once again come up with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy, this does not promise a long life span.
Once again, it seems to be an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish shares, although at the moment "precaution is required when driving".
Connected Branches
The chairman of Iberdrola, Ignacio S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Gal<0xC3><0xA1>n, was the first to appear before the subcommittee of Parliament yesterday, where the strategy on the energy supply of Spain will be debated over the next two decades.
After his appearance, followed by the chairman of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Gal<0xC3><0xA1>n gave the press some clues about what he had submitted to the subcommittee behind closed doors.
According to the chairman of Iberdrola, Spain will have to invest 50 billion euros by 2020 and another 60 billion euros from that date by 2030, provided that current nuclear power plants continue to operate.
If this were not the case, the required investments would not amount to 60 billion, but up to 95 billion.
However, Iberdrola believes that one should no longer invest in an increase in energy generation capacity, but in distribution networks and international allies.
As of 2020, the issue will change and performance should be increased.
His proposal focuses on both gas and coal plants with facilities to capture carbon dioxide and, of course, above all on renewable energies.
In this case, he assumes that 18,000 MW more is needed, subject to the condition of course by other "support energies".
Gal<0xC3><0xA1>n, who believes that the draft law for a sustainable economy, which has just been passed by the government, is in line with what his company has demanded, did not want to say anything against this law, such as creating incentives for national coal consumption, which would be exactly the opposite of all political strategies in the fight against climate change.
In his view, in the long term, this direction is clearly set, despite some "individual" measures, as she called the chairman of Iberdrola.
Be it like it is, Gal<0xC3><0xA1>n says that decisions on investments should already be made, even if they are long-term, as it will take some time and a stable remuneration framework must be created to tackle them.
Ferrovial gets the "handling" of Aer Lingus at ten airports
Ferrovial’s subsidiary for services at ground airports, Swissport, is the preferred partner of the Irish airline Aer Lingus for luggage service at ten European airports where they are represented.
Paris, London, Frankfurt and Brussels are some of the most important.
The agreement, to which no figures have yet been announced, has been drawn up for five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the government of Castile-La Mancha and the University of Alcal<0xC3><0xA1> de Henares yesterday signed a protocol for cooperation in order to create an innovation center for intelligent infrastructures.
The alliance plans investments of 20 million by 2012, of which 50% will come from Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the centre will be to investigate energy efficiency on motorways and airports.
Acciona competes with Hochtief and Bouygues for its first highway construction in Australia
Acciona is fighting for the approval of its first highway in Australia, a market where they are already represented as energy and water companies.
The construction is a tunnel that will cost 1.7 billion Australian dollars (about 1.047 billion euros).
The French company Bouygues and the German Hochtief are his competitors.
A 5 kilometre long tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east coast, has become the best opportunity for Acciona to establish itself in the country as a construction company and highway operator.
The city government wants to complete the construction at the end of 2014.
After the administration had chosen a public-private cooperation (PPP is the English abbreviation) to advance the project according to a business plan drawn up by Ernst & Young, the administration is already in possession of a final list of candidates for construction and toll office administration.
Expecting the offers presented in May, the estimated investment amounts to 1.7 billion Australian dollars (1,047 billion euros), with three consortia, mainly composed of European construction companies, competing with each other in the final phase.
The group called Transcity is led by Acciona, the only Spanish company, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first company is one of the largest construction companies in Australia, while the second, based in Italy, is one of the best specialists in civil engineering.
Acciona’s team joins the Northern Direct consortium, formed by the British company Laing O’Rourke, the Australian Transfield, responsible for infrastructure and the French Bouygues sub-group.
The third and final consortium, which is in the narrower choice, is called LBRJV, formed from the capital of the Australian Leighton (subsidiary of the German construction company Hochtief, which in turn belongs to ACS), the also native Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the French company Razel, which specializes in public construction.
The Australian infrastructure market promises tremendous construction work and privatization, but has a hurdle to overcome, because you only get access by buying a local construction company.
A strategy followed by the aforementioned companies Hochtief or Bilfinger, in addition to Asian references, and which has yet to be pursued by the Spanish construction giants.
Even ACS has only gained entry to this market through its 30% stake in Hochtief, the owner of the Leighton mentioned.
Millions of assets
Acciona places great importance on this geographical area for the industry, in which it is already well known due to its activity as an energy supplier and in the desalination industry.
Among other assets, it already has its largest windmill park (192 MW) in Victoria and leads the group of companies commissioned to build and manage Adelaide’s desalination plant with a budget of 700 million.
Its purpose is now to consolidate itself in these two areas and use these synergies to gain access to the branches of construction and infrastructure.
The subterranean toll route, promoted by the Brisbane City Infrastructure Office and called Northern Link, is intended to connect the western highway in Toowong with the bypass road in Kelvin Grove (see map) over a length of 5 kilometres through tunnels, which is the largest one for reducing traffic to Brisbane.
The timetable issued by the city administration foresees the awarding of summer 2010 and the start of construction work in December next year.
Although this toll route is expected to open to traffic in the last few months of 2014, it is assumed that the construction work will continue until 2016.
The tunnel was designed in 2005.
It has two lanes in each direction, an electronic toll system and a complex vent system.
The Government of Queensland participates in the financing with 500 million Australian dollars (308 million euros).
Brisbane is already a big business for high-rises.
Australia is constantly awarding significant orders to High Low, which yesterday signed a contract with the government of 154 million.
The subsidiary ACS will use its local subsidiary Leighton to improve the infrastructure of the domestic broadband network with fiber optic cables.
This improvement will provide fast internet access for 400,000 people and will keep the German company busy for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has received the 27-storey King George Tower construction project in the Australian city of Brisbane, which has not yet started and Hochtief has received 129 million.
Also in the UK, in Manchester, it competes with Laing O'Rourke for the construction and management of two schools to 25 years.
The initial investment amounts to 75 million euros.
FCC awarded contract for a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC has acquired the sum of 64.5 million euros through its subsidiary Alpine, the construction of a tunnel over 2.1 kilometers in length for a motorway in Slovenia.
The company received this contract only a few days after receiving the contract for construction work to expand the Bosruck (Austria) tunnel over 130 million.
In this way, Alpine strengthens its experience in tunnelling.
Construction work is scheduled to begin in early 2010 and its implementation will take over 32 months.
Sra. Rushmore receives publicity from Renfe
Renfe has attributed the advertising and marketing services for the next two years to the agency Sra. Rushmore over a sum of about three million euros annually, the railway company said.
This contract also offers the possibility of two extensions of 12 months each. Sra. Rushmore was selected among 16 agencies that presented the competition advertised by Renfe, 4 of which came into the final round, among them TBWA, which was responsible for advertising in the last three years.
From now on, Sra. Rushmore will be tasked with designing and producing the campaigns.
Punishment over 63 million for France Télécom for slowing down the competition.
The French competition regulator France Télécom has imposed a fine of more than 63 million euros for anti-competitive behaviour in the Caribbean.
According to the Authority, the telephone provider has restricted competition for landlines and mobile phones by signing exclusive contracts, pricing plans and loyalty programs for consumers on the edge of regulation.
Together with this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state enterprise has accumulated more than EUR 560 million in penalties since 1994 due to the obstruction of its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday has even been increased, as the authority guarding the competition believes that France Télécom has committed similar infringements in the past and has therefore fallen back.
Application trading
On the other hand, the French company’s subsidiary has followed the example of other telephone providers and has opened an application trading page on the Internet for the purpose of increasing revenues from non-phone connection transactions.
In principle, this Orange website is active in France and the UK.
You have to wait until 2010 for this site to be available to other countries, such as Spain.
Madrid and Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a have raised 476.4 million since the start of the Champions League.
Since its inception in 1992, the Champions League has developed into a revenue source for the football club.
So much so that Real Madrid and Barcelona have since taken 476.4 million, bringing them the third and fifth place of the football clubs that have earned the most money in the league.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Champions League not only brings glory, it is also one of the main sources of income for the big clubs.
According to UEFA, the league has distributed up to €5,362.5 million to the 105 teams (including 12 Spanish) that have participated in this event since its inception in the 1992/1993 season.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona have benefited from this distribution.
The Wei<0xCE><0xB2>e Club is in third place in Europe, which has earned the most money through its participation and which, alongside AC Milan, is the only one to have won the trophy three times.
The reigning Catalan champion and last winner of the former European Cup in 1992 took fifth place.
The list leads Manchester United and Bayern Munich, two teams who also made the most money by participating in the past Champoins League.
And that, even though they lost to Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a.
On the other hand, Spain is only in third place of the countries that could take money from the champions, although it has more titles than all others (five, unlike four bee Italy, three at England and two at Germany).
Distribution
This obvious contradiction is explained by the complicated money-sharing procedure used by UEFA.
This fiscal year, the organization, whose chairman is Michel Platini, expects revenues of 1,090 million through the Champions League.
Of this money, UEFA provides 413.1 million for fixed payments: each of the 20 football clubs that took part in the qualifying preliminary round (among them the Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who won a participation received 3.8 million due to their blue presence, in addition to the 550,000 euros for each game they contested.
There is also a bonus for winning (€800,000) and for a draw (400,000 per team). The clubs that came in the eighth final each receive three million; the four that came in the quarterfinals receive 3.3 million.
The last four get 4 million each.
The winner earns 9 million, as opposed to the second, which receives 5.2 million.
For example, a football club receives at least 7.1 million and at most 31.2 million in fixed income.
Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a again earned 2.5 million with his victory at the European Supercup in August.
However, there are also the variable payments, for which 337.8 million are planned.
This money is allocated proportionally to the value of each individual television market.
The Spanish is one of the first and has 4 assigned places.
Last year’s champion will receive 40% of the allocated money, 30% of the second, 20% of the third placers and 10% for the fourth place.
The other part will be distributed depending on the number of games they play at this year’s edition.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million for 29.9% participation in Sos
The Nueva Rumasa Group has leaked details yesterday about the purchase offer of shares, with which it intends to acquire a ceiling between 25 and 29.9% of Sos’ capital.
A percentage that does not force them to make a public tender (opa) due to the number of shares.
In concrete terms, Nueva Rumasa offers €1,5025 per share, which is paid out to ten years and with an interest rate of 1% annually due to this shift.
Sos shares closed yesterday with 1.85 euros, which is why Nueva Rumasa rated the company 18% below the market value.
According to Nuevan Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the real rating of Sos.
The offer is associated with the appointment of eight of the 15 advisors.
The Jeréz Group gives shareholders a period of 15 days to share their interest in the sale of their shares.
CNMV assured that it had not been informed of this offer, although Ruiz Mateos confirmed that it had contacted the Authority.
Upon closing, the deposit would amount to 611.7 million, while the value of Sos is 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, Sos continues to restructure its management.
In an attempt to remain on the verge of possible offers of purchase and the judicial disputes of his ex-managers, the brothers Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s and Jaime Salazar announced the appointment of Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Luisa Jord<0xC3><0xA1> as head of internal auditing.
A decision that makes her the first woman to hold a high position at the food company.
This is a newly created post, which is directly under the chairman of the group.
This is anything but free of polemics because the company is involved in a court battle for the suspicion of diverting more than 230 million Sos to other companies of the Salazar family.
It cannot be ruled out that Sos will postpone further capital over the next few months.
With regard to Salazar’s credit, former advisers Ildefonso Ortega and <0xC3><0x81>ngel Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez Noriega (represented by the CCM and Unicaja) appeared before the National Assembly yesterday and confirmed that they had approved the move of 212 million without knowing their destination.
CNMV approves Paternina’s public exclusion invitation to tender submitted by investment company Mer
The National Stock Exchange Commission (CNMV) approved the public exclusion invitation for Federico Paternina presented by the investment company Mer last October 9.
The supervisory authority stated that it approved this invitation after it had been proven that the conditions are in accordance with the legislation in force and thus the content of the presented explanatory document, following the amendments of 2 December last, can be considered "sufficient".
CNMV has also announced that this offer is aimed at the acquisition of 558,008 shares of Federico Paternina at the price of 7,65 euros per share, which in turn is 8,95 % of the share capital, which is composed of 6,142,786 euros in shares admitted to the Madrid and Bilbao exchanges.
Furthermore, it has been announced that 5,592,778 million shares have been fixed, which cannot be transferred in any way until the end of the tender and whose price has been fixed by Federico Paternina in accordance with the statutory provisions.
New programmes for the assessment of vehicles
In these days of storms and accidents, not only do the automotive workshops deserve
Every day, thousands of vehicles involved in an accident are hauled into the workshops, where an assessor must assess the damage caused and the cost of repair.
Not a single accident is the same and calculating the cost of parts and working hours can be a lengthy and complicated task.
The calculation of repair costs of between 20,000 and 30,000 euros per hand, including parts and working hours, can take up to two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the support of the latest computer science tools, it is a matter of minutes
That’s why almost 100% of reviewers use this type of system.
The service and application providers for the assessment of accidents and repair collect the information they receive from the manufacturers in order to process it and offer it to their customers in the form of a useful program.
In Spain, Audatex, part of the American group Solera, is the market leader; 80% of all reviews are produced with their products.
The other two companies competing with the tool market for reviewing and drafting a report are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data that the manufacturers provide is anything but easy.
According to Eduardo Vel<0xC3><0xA1>zquez, sales manager of Audatex, 63 manufacturers and importers work together, each of them providing the information in a different format.
Moreover, the amount of data to be processed is getting bigger and bigger, up to the point that in the last five years even more versions, variants and motorizations have come onto the market than in the entire fifteen years before.
As soon as a new car comes onto the market, the work begins for the companies.
It is a laborious task, because each one of the thousands of vehicle parts has to be catagolized and its price entered.
In addition, each model creates an "intelligent" graphic image on which you can "click" different parts of the vehicle.
If this is a much sold model, the work can be completed in one week, if the procedure progresses quickly.
If this is a less common car, it can take up to three or four months. Currently, Audatex has complete information on 99.2% of cars sold in Spain.
Among the more exclusive models, they have, for example, information about the Porsche models, but not about Ferrari or Lamborghini.
With regard to the vehicle park on the roads, it is more than 99%.
Audatex has eight centers worldwide (Spain, France, Germany, USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) for the purpose of carrying out documentation work and the production of databases, and each of them specializes in specific brands.
The national headquarters are located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (usually mechanics professionals) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Every year, Audatex invests 90 million euros in the development of these databases.
Every month, they record 2.5 million data and their customers receive updates every other day.
The development of this enormous flow of information allows companies to use it in different ways and thus offer different products.
The most common use is the use for repairs and repairs, but depending on the country, there are also tools for the management of scrap parts or for calculating the error or residual value of a car.
The only company that informs about a guide about the value of used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer this offer in Spain, but in the United States.
When reviewing the products that Audatex offers, you can easily get an overview of the type of support it provides to industry experts.
This company offers ten different tools, the star of which is AudaPlus, a standard solution for assessing accidents for the reviewers.
It includes vehicles, motorcycles as well as light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it includes the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or the paint prices.
This tool is paid according to the purpose of use, i.e. for each report.
It will be the most expensive for customers who rarely use it a maximum of 10 times a month, namely 5.75 euros per month.
On the other hand, any insurance company that produces thousands of reviews negotiates the price with Audatex.
With other products, such as AudaVIN, one can fully identify a vehicle and the equipment with which it ran from the assembly belt, solely on the basis of the chassis number.
AudaGlass deals with the vehicle wheels, and AudaSubastas is an online service open to the specialist market that can be used for vehicles that have been declared as total damage.
Your statistic service is very useful in identifying trends, performing geodemographic analyses, or for obtaining information about the deviations by brand and model.
One can, for example, examine how many models of a particular car brand had to go to the workshop due to breakdowns or how many of them were involved in a serious accident in a certain period of time.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of computer tools.
Among other things, it sells Gt Estimate, which is also intended for reviewers and delivers digital images in the same way, access to parts or prices and official working hours of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa Group, which was founded in 1971 as a provider of services and solutions for the assessment of damage, breakdown or maintenance of vehicles.
The GT Guide for Expertise is a reference product on the market.
They work with 24,000 users in workshops, 3,100 reviewers and 53 insurance companies.
Their business volume has increased by 20% annually over the past three years and in 2008 sales amounted to 10.8 million euros.
At the beginning of last year, they started going to the international market with the opening of an office in Paris.
Audatex, on the other hand, was founded in Germany in 1966 and established in Spain in 1979.
According to the company’s sources, 62% of its business is done in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38% in North and South America, working with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 workshops, 3,000 of them in Spain.
Total sales in the world of the group Solera (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) amounted to 557 million dollars, 3.35 more than in 2008.
In this country, the company has revenues of 19.1 million euros, 7.2% more than in the previous year.
In 2005, the Solera Group was worth $1 billion on the stock exchange and today its shares are traded at a value of $2.4 billion.
Since 2007, they have been on the New York Stock Exchange and part of the Standard & Poor's benchmark index.
Auction of accident cars on the Internet
Last October, the Solera Autoonline group bought a flatfom on the Internet for the sale of accident vehicles and motorcycles.
This purchase meant paying 59.5 million euros for 85% of the company’s capital, which could increase to the remaining 15% next year.
The purpose of this purchase was to offer its customers more services and value-added, with the opportunity to gain access to a huge international market.
This review and purchase service is aimed exclusively at industry professionals, such as insurance companies, reviewers, car rental companies, workshops, scrapyards and car dealers, who need to register before their activities.
This platform was founded in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650,000 operations across Europe, 500,000 of them in Germany alone.
Its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
Today, the site has more than 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 reviewers.
Every day, 3,000 ads are managed and 100 new ads are added to the Spanish market every day.
According to Spanish legislation, a vehicle whose chassis number has been deregistered may no longer drive on the roads, but certain non-damaged parts may be used as spare parts.
The cars with historical value, on the other hand, may be re-approved, even if they have been deregistered after difficult public authorities.
Cost estimate of the workshop in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, Audatex ensures that the user receives a cost estimate in just four steps: identification of the vehicle, search of the spare part, creation and creation of a cost estimate.
The easy handling of these systems is a fundamental condition, especially to convince the older professionals who are usually more or less opposed to the use of these new computer techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, 666 of which are passenger cars, 109 off-road vehicles, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Of course you need to use a computer with internet connection.
After the model to be repaired has been identified on the basis of the chassis number, a graphic of the respective model appears and after that the required spare part is selected.
The user can include variables, such as the price for the working hours, surcharges or discounts and after that he can have the cost estimate printed out and passed on to his customer.
However, AudaTaller is not a tool for peer review like AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalogue.
The main difference between the two systems is that the workshop oriented does not include estimated working hours.
The cost of using this tool is 350 euros per year, an amount that the customer can easily pay.
Currently, Audatex is working on offering these images in three-dimensional format.
This is an innovation that car mechanics have been waiting for a long time, for example, because you can choose a door with it and then turn the picture completely to look at the inside.
