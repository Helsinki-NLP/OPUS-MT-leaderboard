No liberating short story for Tymoshenko by Parliament
The Ukrainian Parliament today refused the request to abolish, within the framework of a short story of the Criminal Code, those paragraphs on which opposition leader Yulia Timoshenko had been convicted.
The new regulation, which could have paved the way for the release of the detained Prime Minister, rejected the MPs at the second reading of the request to reduce the penalties for economic offences.
Timoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison in October for concluding an allegedly adverse contract with Russia for the purchase of natural gas.
The verdict is not yet final, and in December the appeal of the convicts is to be heard in court.
Timoshenko himself described the ruling as a political revenge of the regime and in the West the trial also caused suspicion of the bias of the court.
The request to remove paragraph 365, on the basis of which the Prime Minister was sentenced to remove from the Criminal Code, was supported by 147 MPs.
226 votes would have been required to be accepted.
Libyan victory
The story of the Libyan liberation struggle or Libyan rebellion already knows its losers.
Muammar al-Gaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is over.
Now only the winners are to be defined.
As usual for this region, in the elections Islamists win, the question is only which - the moderates or the radicals.
The National Transitional Council acknowledged the custom of the Shari’a, of which one now has a certain idea with God.
Libya would be a country without crime, because for theft you cut off your hand.
Women should also forget about emancipation as soon as possible, possible faith apostates are executed, and so on.
Instead of a single dictator, society will be united by the Koran from mutually opposing tribes in the future.
In short, there will be an order in Libya that is hardly imaginable and, above all, hardly desirable in this country.
Only - our lifestyle is not the only one and objectively not the best and would hardly suit the Libyans mentioned.
In this sense, it is rather strange that the Moslem fighters could be helped by the infidel dogs.
To their excuse, perhaps only the fact that NATO’s airstrikes were not directed by any general from America, but by Allah himself, whose omnipotence was praised after every successful hit.
The winners in Libya? The West is not part of it.
We only took part in a gunfight, served the interests of Islam, and our politicians got rid of themselves in the person of the dictator of a political ally without this having brought any advantage.
After the fresh and bad experiences from Afghanistan and Iraq, we preferred to refrain from a military occupation of Libya.
As a result, the locals are a concern - namely the expulsion of the crusaders.
But will the oil companies get the black gold at the spot price even without occupation?
Hardly any, and so the West can finally rightly boast of its selflessness in terms of the protection of human rights.
If this does not destroy the Shari’a representatives.
Beginning of a new crisis era
France and the rest of Europe focus on investors.
On Tuesday, a statistical storm broke through Europe.
The individual states published their data on their GDP for the third quarter.
The Czech economy stagnated compared to the previous quarter, Germany and France increased.
However, the bond market is breaking all records today.
Investors not only keep an eye on Greece, but now also Spain, France, Austria and other countries.
The statistical offices of the European zone, Germany, the Czech Republic and some other European countries published their preliminary forecasts of economic development in the third quarter.
According to expectations, Germany’s GDP grew by 0.5%, compared to France by 0.4%.
At the same time, both countries corrected their data for the second quarter in which Germany recorded higher growth than had originally been expected (growth of 0.3% instead of predicted 0.1%), while France reported a slight decline of 0.1% (original data only spoke of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 per cent in this year’s third quarter compared to the previous year.
Compared to the previous quarter, however, the gross domestic product stagnated and, according to the Statistical Office, the trend of growth slowed down in economic performance was thus confirmed.
The results are therefore worse than the forecasts of the analysts.
The most important events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 per cent in this year’s third quarter compared to the previous year, but it stagnated compared to the previous quarter.
According to preliminary and seasonally overcalculated data, the German economy grew by 0.5 percent in the third quarter.
Across the eurozone and the EU, the economy recorded growth of 0.2 per cent between July and September compared to the previous quarter, which is in line with analysts’ expectations.
The Greek economy fell by 5.2 percent compared to the previous year.
The yield from their 10-year government bonds reached the value of 28.45%.
The yield of Italian and Spanish government bonds increased to their critical limits.
Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium and other countries are also beginning to feel problems...
The return on Czech government bonds is below 4%, even if the situation in the region deteriorates.
In Germany, votes are loud, the ECB should become the creditor of the last instance.
Czechs qualified for EURO
In Montenegro they won 1-0 and now celebrate their qualification for 200 million
The football selection has mastered the toughest task of the whole season!
Thanks to a well-placed goalkeeper <0xC4><0x8C>ech and a magnificent goal by Petr Jir<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek, she won 1-0 in Montenegro.
With a large portion of luck, Czech football was able to defend its luxurious lead from the home game and will once again not be missing in the European Championship.
IHNED.cz followed the ascent game in a detailed report.
Little excitement in the first half and a huge portion of happiness in the second.
The Czech selection also won quite happily 1-0 thanks to the final weakness of the home team, a brilliant <0xC4><0x8C>ech's and the hero of the day Jir<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek in Montenegro, thus redeeming their ticket for the European Football Championship.
Also because of the precise defensive play of the Czech team, they put more pressure on the Montenegrins only in the second half.
The lucky birds of the game were Damjanovic and Vucinic, who wasted two huge chances.
Thanks to an excellent Petr <0xC4><0x8C>ech, the Czech selection will also be part of the European Championships next year, it is also pleasing that domestic football will receive a premium of about 200 million.
From the first few minutes, it was a very competitive football game.
Both teams combined for a long time and so were mainly played around the middle line.
Also in the second half the pressure of the home team was not enough and the large knock-offs in front of the penalty area were successfully repelled by the Czech defence.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country’s core program.
They formed a living shield.
A few hundred college students formed a living shield around a core object in Iran.
With this gesture, they wanted to demonstrate their support for their country’s core program before a possible Israeli attack.
The students had prayed in front of the object on Tuesday afternoon and then announced the death to the United States and Israel.
A few hundred students from the University of Isfahan in Iran formed a living shield around the nuclear technology center in Isfahan on Tuesday, where uranium is processed.
In doing so, they wanted to announce that they are ready to protect their country’s core program, if necessary, with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) recently stated in its report that Iran has not given up on everything after its efforts to create a nuclear weapon.
Israel is also talking about a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
Students had prayed at noon before the entrance to the complex and subsequently announced death to the United States and Israel.
In the case of an attack aimed at putting the Iranian nuclear program largely to shame, the Israeli press said from the center in Isfahan would also target the nuclear enrichment plant in Natan’s attack.
The Menu of a Fatty Child: It Does Not Breakfast and Eats to Dinner
More than a third of children from 9 to 13 have problems with obesity, with 9 percent of all students and 5 percent of all children being overweight.
Recent surveys have shown that obese children mostly come from families with unhealthy lifestyles.
This shows once again how important it is for a person’s healthy development to be the environment in which he grows up and are the examples that surround him.
On the tables of obese children, sausages are up to half more often on the table than in families where normal-weight children live.
More than 19 percent of overweight children had French fries on the eve of the Enlightenment campaign under the motto "Adiposity is not a coincidence" for the evening meal.
In families with dickerchen, sport is not exactly one of the favourite occupations, however, as does the majority of today’s students – only 15 percent responded that their parents find time for active movement at least once a week.
Survey of 900 children
The survey took place last year towards the end of the school year, with nearly 900 children from primary schools across the Czech Republic being surveyed.
This was already the second year of the action "Adiposity is not a coincidence", which is supported by the General Health Fund and the Unilever Society.
So far, more than 12 thousand students from 4th and 8th classes participated in the project.
Unhealthy diets and lack of exercise in the family are crucial factors that are responsible for the frighteningly increasing number of overweight or even obese children.
“For example, only half of the children surveyed said they ate breakfast-second breakfast-meal-vesper supper five times a day—one of the main prerequisites for a healthy diet in the breakfast-second-meal-vesper-event-break mode—one of the survey results.
No breakfast and sausage for dinner
Experts point out that even relative little things, such as the family’s regular breakfast time, are important for the healthy development of a child.
In the Czech Republic, however, only 23 percent of the students’ families have breakfast.
And - in most families, everyone eats breakfast alone.
Worst of all was the finding that in every tenth family is not breakfast at all.
Breakfast is considered to be the cornerstone of a healthy daily diet.
The survey showed, among other things, that people in the families of overweight children often consume unhealthy French fries.
And almost everyone - regardless of weight - drinks sweet lemonades every day (70 percent)
Although more than 40 percent of the children surveyed do sports, only less than half of their parents do – namely, only 15 percent.
Create your own menu
Another part of the survey allowed selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to compose their own meal plan from offered possibilities according to appetite and opinion.
“What Czech children between the ages of 12 and 15 prefer in terms of nutrition is far from the ideal of a healthy diet.
Among their favorite dishes were many flour dishes, meat dishes and of course sweets.
“Alarming is, above all, the great popularity of sweet lemonades,” the final report on this survey emphasizes.
At lunch, i.e. the main course, pasta won just in front of poultry.
The children almost didn’t like legumes and the popularity of fish and vegetable dishes as lunch was very low.
Return to health
At the same time, however, the survey also showed that the children are quite willing to change their eating habits when they get the right information.
"In many cases, the control group of the survey participants who completed the questionnaire after completing the informative lecture "Adiposity is not a coincidence" saw a significant shift in preferences towards principles of healthy nutrition," the results of the project show.
This was obvious, for example, with the sweet limos, where many children began to give priority to ordinary water.
In the questionnaire, the children also crossed much more often on poultry or fish as the main dish of the day and were ready to eat less dumplings or sweet food.
Professionals claim - a stylist must also be a good psychologist
In the introductory article on how stylists learn, I had kind of embellished that this was a bit too much fabric for the beginning.
At least I didn’t know what was coming.
Lectures by three professionals from the industry, the clothing of problematic figures and a seminar on how the "on the pitch" runs.
It's supposed to get even worse.
The closer the exam gets, the more information and practical tasks are ahead of us.
But even if the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, it is still fully documented.
This time we debated with Director Alena (not a single man attends the course) how to attract a woman who has no ideally proportioned figure.
After all, these are most of us.
Some have too short a neck, others have too young a figure without proper curves, and others are clumsy.
It is up to the stylist to visually cover wide shoulders, extend the neck or conjure out the necessary curves.
We also got tips on how to dress a woman type like Jennifer Lopez - that is, with a big bust, wide hip and narrow waist - pretty and figure-bound, without her seeming too provocative.
For example, if the difference between waist and hips is so great that the skirt or pants really don’t fit, you should have at least one piece cut to size.
You won’t regret that, because well-fitting clothes are simply priceless.
In such a tailor-made skirt you feel much better than in one of the poles that always slides up and down, stands off in the waist, etc.
Young figures can in turn allow themselves to wear clothing with folds, bushes, applications, embroidery or rafting.
With this amount of information and character types, I am glad that I have a whole week to let everything go through my mind thoroughly.
And yet I am afraid that it is almost impossible to do it in the face of the busy homework.
Each of the participants was awarded a celebrity for which she is supposed to design suitable outfits - day wear and evening robe.
In doing so, we should take into account the current appearance, the fashion style of the respective star and its figure type.
I'm supposed to "dress" Miranda Kerr, who you might know from the Victoria's Secret campaign.
I’m cheering inside, because that’s a lot better for me personally than wearing Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, for example, who has recently probably increased to a hundred kilos (well, that’s a bit exaggerated), or even the young Selena Gomez.
We are supposed to cut out the garments from magazines or search the internet, print them out and then edit them graphically.
In the "moodboard", as the whole result is called, our very personal style and our relationship with graphic design should then be expressed.
It is very important to also think about the graphic side of the styling.
The stylist not only attracts the models physically, but also designs the so-called product page in the journals (according to specific specifications, for example trend handbags, coats, etc.).
The stylist and designer Mario Kamen<0xC3><0xAD>k told us about this.
But that's only on Sunday.
This means that a stylist must have a good overall overview.
The Saturday lecture, which was filled with information about character types, was seasoned by three visitors from the industry:
by stylist Jan Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD>, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Ren<0xC4><0x8D>.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is illusion and that a stylist should be able to take advantage of this.
And sent-in stylist can work with a single piece of clothing in very different ways.
The magic word is variability.
For example, you can wear a trench coat as usual over the jeans, so like a t-shirt or coat, but you can also wear it on the naked body, put on heels and wear it as a dress.
It is enough to curl up the sleeves or collar and the whole look looks very different.
“Play with it,” he said.
Most of the time, however, the following advice came to me: "First you need to know the rules perfectly."
"First you can hurt her," said Jakub.
Finally, it becomes clear to me why we have to pause all these lessons, what you can combine with what and why, even if you often see something completely different in fashion journals.
Not to mention fashion shows.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I now know that a stylist must have prepared much more clothing variants than he finally photographs.
So you have to be prepared for a fashion story with ten pages (say ten outfits) to style at least fifteen.
And also that the clothes in the photo in combination with other accessories sometimes look quite different than in reality.
So you have to expect all of this in the design of the outfit.
The fact that image and style sometimes make up half of the success was confirmed by Jan Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD>.
You only need to look at Madonna, a not exactly brilliant singer, from whom image and marketing have made a world star.
In the Czech Republic, the services of a stylist are rather reserved.
Also well-known personalities often think this is money thrown out (the main thing is that I bring something that I look like is secondary).
And if any of us can be styled, then we should expect that he or she is very likely to force us on a completely different (smaller) size than he or she really needs.
Then you only have to google to make sure that the tabloid is writing, the corresponding celebrity has returned to or decreased, etc.
Jan and Mario put us at our heart on Sunday, not to believe that a stylist just needs to focus on fashion and then "assemble" the outfit.
In his work, he must primarily communicate with the people he styles and he must be a wise psychologist.
Appreciate people without worshiping and standing in his opinion.
"If any manager orders us to see her wardrobe and to add pretty pieces, then we can't clear her all the closet and say - my God, that's terrible."
“You have to find at least a few commendable things to which you recommend what you can wear,” says Mario.
He also showed us quite concretely what a so-called "place bag" must contain.
So such a bag, which you button at the waist and in which you carry all the necessary proprieties with you.
In addition to such clear things, such as scissors, hair removers or safety needles, it also contains such utensils, such as a nylon thread (so the stylist helps to photograph products, such as handbags or hats), special clips, with which the clothes are unwrapped at the back, if they are too big (nickel or other stuff is not allowed).
But so that we can not only listen, but also try something practical, we learned how to properly stick shoes.
Even when photographing in the studio, where the floor is level, you can damage the shoe sole, let alone the outside.
We were stuck and glued...
With scissors you can not even touch the shoes, so that you do not damage them.
So you really have to act skillfully.
Mario delighted me by praising my "creation" without restrictions.
The skill mentioned above is not exactly my strength.
All of this was just a fraction of what we heard during the second weekend continuation course.
One thing has now become clear to me - to devote oneself to styling at a professional level is not a breeze.
V Need for Speed: "The Run" - the illegal race across America
Review
The original carefree ride is caused by a series of completely avoidable, dilettant errors for the routine ride to the early shift.
Although it was possible to fulfill the ambitions for the most part, what good is it if obviously no one wanted to do a little more.
Even before he came to the store tables, the new part with the subtitle "The Run" aroused high expectations.
He promised to move the already year-old game series "Need for Speed" back into a new dimension and in the playable demonstration examples he actually seemed to be not only one of many action racing games.
We were also curious as to how the fitted passages, in which the main protagonist gets out of the car and continues on foot.
But as you’re used to with NFS, in the end, much is different than you’d expect.
Sure - potentially it's quite decent arcade races, but overall the game is narrowed by some superfluous bugs that have been present in this series for more or less a few years.
So they are actually no longer errors, but rather signs of a basically incomprehensible laziness of the game developers.
The adventure begins very well.
For the first time in history, the main character Jack has certain personal character problems; the only solution seems to be to participate in an illegal race across America.
In San Francisco, on the west coast, you sit on the steering wheel - with the task of being the first in New York.
The basic idea contains a whole series of interesting elements.
The entire route is divided into ten stages and more than fifty individual races.
This means that each race is held on a different track and that the individual stages take place in different, sufficiently different and interesting environments.
You don’t have the impression that the game would offer the same thing over and over again.
Some environments are still very nice to look at, although the technical level of the graphics does not go beyond that of the earlier parts of the series.
So nothing world-moving.
But the journey through the desert, through autumnal landscape or high up through deep snowy landscape seemed visually very pleasant.
From time to time, unusual elements bring a little variation to the individual races.
In the desert, for example, one is surprised by a desert storm that severely restricts sight.
In the mountains, on the other hand, you have to be hellishly careful not to be spilled by an avalanche.
By the way, the individual races are installed quite well one after the other.
Only a few, but they are enough.
For a while you try to overtake the prescribed number of opponents (in principle a classic race), then you have time to catch up (classic race against the stopwatch), then you expect another personal duel with a single opponent.
And then there's the police who want to mess up the whole thing.
A novelty is passages in which Jack leaves the car.
It’s more about certain interactive animations where Jack flees from someone and where the player has to help him by pressing the right button at the right moment.
So nothing complicated.
However, it is surprising that there are far fewer passages in the game than one would expect (in fact, only three).
Ultimately, this is more of a benefit to the game, because this element has at least no chance of getting bored - it is one of the elements that make the game more varied in the context of the above.
The driving model is in the footsteps of the previous parts.
That is, from today’s point of view, it does not tear out trees, but on the other hand, one could not claim that it would be bad.
If you are looking for realistic simulations, you have to look elsewhere.
But an action-packed racing will continue to be very well suited to the local driving model, although you could find better in the competition.
Until then, everything is in the best order.
Real problems only appear after a certain amount of time.
In contrast to the driving model, the collision model is not quite O.K.
Of a game of this kind, it is hardly to be expected that it calculates complicated deformations and collisions, but if you have virtually no idea before any impact on any object how the car behaves, then obviously not everything is fine.
Typical example: When you overtake or pass on cars coming in, you "strip" the other cars only slightly in some places, but in other, almost identical situations you get into the spinning and spinning wild pirates.
Or drive the cart straight to scrap.
Thanks to the restart system, this doesn’t matter anymore, it’s always annoying.
The restarts are solved in this way: if you have total damage or land far away from the track, then you throw the game back to the last clue of the track.
Only - in every race you only have five restarts.
When you have exhausted them, everything starts from the front.
So the restarts are more like a tool, in case something fails, but you should rather not rely on it.
Sometimes, however, the restart doesn’t even help, as nothing else helps but to learn the critical section from the head.
Very unpleasant is that the same things often happen in the same places.
Some curves, for example, need to be traversed in a very specific way, otherwise you simply do not fit through.
Elsewhere, you always meet "civil" cars in the same configuration at the appropriate location, whether you come first or fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
This is especially annoying in situations when you see that the opponent comes past two cars in front of a playing, but until you get there yourself, the cars are already in such a position that you have to drive around or brake them.
And it doesn’t matter when you get there, everything is designed to get to this situation always close to your nose.
The competitors have other advantages.
Throughout the game there are a few places where you are always overtaken in the same place by the same opponent and again here again without regard to the time.
The craziest thing is to finish the game on the long bridge, which you pass in the opposite direction.
The opponent must obviously get one out of here on the devil's side.
And if he is already in front of you, then of course he takes the view, so that you drive your own car in Klump a few times at first.
Sure - you just want to make the game more exciting and exciting but this intention is so clear that it quickly misses the joy of the game.
And that’s a shame, because despite a simpler driving model, the game is quite entertaining and in some places so action-packed that you almost no longer know where one’s head is.
And in principle, it doesn't matter what "guilt" is about - the concept of fifty unique routes, the arrangement of races in a way that no boredom can arise, or something completely different...
An unusual idea is also the car change over the course of the races.
You should not miss the gas stations along the route, because this is where you can change the car, although in most cases the car you have right now is enough.
The cars are divided into three categories.
The sports cars are well suited for the urban areas, the strong American limousines for the straight highways and exotic super sports cars for the technical rides, for example on the serpentines in the mountains.
Hand in hand with the game history mode, the task mode (challenges) also goes – i.e. the races in the individual locations that you know from history.
Here there are not only medals, but also points of experience for your own profile, which is common for the tasks (challenges) and the history.
In order to get to the higher level of the driver, different items must be opened: from the car to the background for the profile.
This is simultaneously linked to the Autolog online feature, which among other things compares its own results achieved with those of other players and also provides additional collective features.
One of the more incomprehensible carvings is a situation in the last race of history.
Here you get by car to a subway tunnel (meeting), where you rest long in the dark on the rails (meeting).
On the tacho, numbers look between 150 and 200 km/h (means), but there comes at once from behind a subway and drives an uncompromising to scrap.
In our editorial office we will probably argue for a long time about whether this was a blackout of the game designers or whether the authors think we are so stupid.
The technical side is nothing overwhelming but at least the visual overall impression is quite appealing in most cases and even brilliant here and there.
It is all the more annoying that at some exciting moments the refresh rate becomes slower and sometimes quite dramatic.
However, this is particularly true of accidents involving a greater number of participants, where a continuous FPS is of no use whatsoever.
The sound reproduction is as far as O.K. and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In an effort to appeal to a scale as wide as possible rather young audiences, a soundtrack was created a l<0xC3><0xA1> "of everyone something" - but who buys such a game already because of the music?!
Need for Speed: The Run: Need for Speed: The Run: Need for Speed: The Run
If the game wasn’t narrowed by the above-mentioned totally unnecessary mistakes, we could have argued with the breast tone that The Run is the best piece of NFS in recent years.
But that’s how the game seems kind of unfinished.
In itself a great pleasure, but one should be prepared to see these errors with the power of airport lights.
Concert of "Students of the velvet revolution" with singing ensembles of Karlsuniversit<0xC3><0xA4>t
The Festival Festa Academica is now offering for the third time the quivering of the World Student Day with the anniversary of the Velvet Revolution and this together with music experience.
In the course of the festival, the twenty professional and university choirs will present themselves.
The main focus of the festival is the two concerts, which take place on 17 November.
Karlsuniversit<0xC3><0xA4>t has a large part in the festival.
"The participants are also represented by the choir of the Faculty of Education and the Faculty of Humanistic Studies, and the Festival Committee also includes the Rector V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Hampl," said Jakub <0xC4><0x8C>aloun, head of the organizational team.
The absolute highlight of the festival is the public concert of school choirs, which takes place on 17 November from 2 pm on the square in front of the National Technical Library in Dejvice.
The programme includes the composition of the important Czech jazz musician Karel R<0xC5><0xAF><0xC5><0xBE>i<0xC4><0x8D>ka "Celebration Jazz Mass".
In the evenings, the concert "Students of the velvet revolution" (Studenty sametu) takes place in the gala rooms of the Volkshaus in Vinohrady, where choirs of Charles University also perform.
Festa Academica aims not only to celebrate World Student Day and commemorate the 22nd anniversary of the Velvet Revolution, but to present choral music to the public at the highest level and to promote the creative collaboration of young people.
The main organizer is the Association of Czech Choirs in cooperation with the Johannes Kepler Gymnasium.
The patronage of the entire event was taken over by Bohuslav Svoboda, the mayor of the capital Prague and V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Hampl, the rector of Charles University.
The festival takes place from 16 to 20 November in Prague and in Pardubice.
In addition to festive concerts, the schedule also includes numerous music meetings, student happings, matinees and other events.

EU Ambassador Vicenov<0xC3><0xA1>:
Czechs have the reputation of negativeists and Eurosceptics
"The Treaty of Lisbon has made the balance between the individual institutions palpably out of balance."
I didn't expect such a hard war to burn out."
“It will take five or six years for the waves to smooth and all to get used to their new role,” began Milena Vicenov<0xC3><0xA1>, the Czech ambassador to the European Union, quite sharply speaking at the Faculty of Law.
How seriously she takes the motto "Understanding and open about Europe" she showed in the first part of her lecture, in which she managed to describe the individual bodies of the EU and their mutual relations in such a manageable and understandable way that she could have envied so many lecturers of the Faculty of Law of Charles University.
Ms Vicenov<0xC3><0xA1> also praised the new permanent chairman of the Council of Europe Herman Van Rompuy:
"In the beginning, criticism became loud that he was too inconspicuous - a grey official who had not grown up in such a role, but I have to say that it has put everyone's breath down on how well he has accepted the matter.
"He is a person who manages to listen patiently to twenty-seven member states, communicate with them and has clear ideas about how to proceed with the EU.
She then explained the new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy in response to the question: Who is this really - the European Union? What number should I call?, thus as an important step towards agreement and better readability of EU policy towards states, such as China or India.
No one wants to ban us our oil hats quargel
Ms Vicenov<0xC3><0xA1> also devoted herself to the agenda according to which the European Union lived, lives and is thinking about living in the near future.
The Czech Presidency of two years ago described it as a success.
The Czechs had mastered the financial crisis and the gas crisis and also hosted the Eastern Partnership Summit.
The case of the government during the presidency described it as a major negative, which severely damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU currently has all the hands to do.
In the words of the ambassador, it was not only in the Presidency, but also in the ensuing crisis, which has not yet been overcome, that has become quite hectic.
And the EU’s seven-year budget still needs to be approved, which makes the matter much more complicated precisely because of today’s economic situation.
Whether it will be a slim and economical budget, which sectors will take precedence, which countries will be more and which will be less supported - all of this is now on the agenda.
The ambassador also recalls her own slogans with which she came to Brussels: "Understanding Europe".
“If I don’t like something, it’s greyish abbreviations, foreign words, and technical jargon that no one understands.
How should I know, as a citizen, whether you really think about crumbling or round cucumbers and different large bananas in Brussels, or whether someone actually wants to ban us from the quarries?
It would also have liked to have used the EU’s soil to get more Czechs in European institutions.
Europe of two or different speeds in view
According to the EU ambassador, the Czechs are called to be Eurosceptics who perceive more the negative than the positive sides of the matter.
The weaker representation of Czechs in European institutions is all the more annoying.
This is due to many factors, including the reluctance of our candidates, their inability to write motivation letters and, last but not least, the weak support of the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, it also highlighted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group, the so-called V4.
"Do you believe me when a Pole or Hungarian comes to me and a Slovak is nearby, then the Frenchman next to me says, 'Hey, what are you putting your heads together - is that your V4 again?' and that makes a pretty sour mine.
According to Vicenové, the EU expects tough rules for Member States’ budget policies in the future.
As much more real than a "European Federation", it sees the concept of a Europe of two or even different speeds.
"We have here the countries of the Eurozone and the countries outside the Eurozone.
"We have the Schengen area and we already have the Institute of Enhanced Cooperation."
“For the first time, it has been said that only those countries that want to work together and those that don’t want to, should stand quietly away.”
"There will be more and more such institutions, which will ultimately lead to a strong 'Europe of different speeds'," Vicenov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
In this respect, it also recognised the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuyes in enforcing the principle that all issues with an impact on the EU as a whole must be discussed by all Member States, not just by the eurozone countries.
Brand Story:
IBM’s Innovator Enters the Second Century of Its Existence
If you wanted to search for a suitable word that would characterize IBM’s strategy most accurately, then this would probably be the word “longevity”.
For the general public, IBM is synonymous with technological revolution; it is known as a modern company, although it has been around for a century since its inception.
The basis for this longevity was already laid by her first boss - the visionary Thomas J. Watson sen.
Already he represented the slogan, countless worldwide problems could easily be solved if people were willing to think a bit.
His slogan "Think!" thus became the trademark for which the life of the future giant should take place (and at the same time the title of the company's internal magazine, which was already published at IBM in 1935).
This was also the basis of the company culture thoroughly prepared by Watsen.
“For us from IBM, this long-term thinking means a continuous movement towards the future.
IBM survived and was therefore successful for a whole century because it remained true to its principles and did not shy away from changing everything else around it.
This allowed us to transform the technologies, business and society in the course of our first century.
We hope to do even more in the next hundred years,” said Samuel J. Palmisano, the company’s current director on the occasion of the anniversary.
Well-thought-out system
Watson was already in his thirties social care for his employees - in a similar way to the entrepreneur Ba<0xC5><0xA5>a in Czechoslovakia: the IBM people had paid as one of the first American employees, an insurance policy by the entrepreneur plus elegant uniforms as work clothes and a well-thought-out reward system for the best newcomers and traders.
IBM’s long-term relationships with its customers are equally well-defined.
From the very beginning, the company was brilliant in promoting talent – as one of the first companies worldwide, IBM lifted any discrimination – and was able to choose accordingly.
In line with this anti-discrimination strategy, the current plan to replace Palmisan at the top of IBM next year is by a woman – Virginia Rometty.
It has been with IBM for thirty years, and so far it has taken on the position of head of sales, marketing and strategy.
IBM has been doing so-called online brainstorming in recent years, from which many future strategies and innovations are emerging.
No wonder - ideas are enough, in the company almost half a million people are employed.
An institution with a good reputation
Their unshakable position in the business guarantees the company a strong image and this is done both internally and externally.
“From the beginning, IBM had the concept of an institution rather than a mere technology company,” said Harvard Business School professor and author of a book about IBM, Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
“IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps solve business problems using technologies,” George Colony of Consulting firm Forrester Research added.
As the company itself emphasizes, it is a difference to be present in the market only or to form it directly through this presence.
IBM - named in the states of its logo for familial "Big Blue", has grown into one of the largest companies in the world in a century.
It’s one of the most versatile technology companies ever – IBM is developing hardware and software, infrastructure, hosting and consulting services across an incredible product range – from servers to nanotechnology.
Of all American technology companies, IBM owns most patents and five of its employees have already been awarded the Nobel Prize.
His best-known inventions include, for example, ATMs, credit cards, financial swaps, barcodes or even the floppy disk.
With approximately $220 billion in market capitalization, IBM was the second-largest technology company (just after Apple) this year, with Microsoft overtaking it for the first time since 1996.
Looking ahead
Not all products and innovations met the taste of today's customers - unfortunately, for example, the experiment with the own OS/2 operating system, the Prodigy online service or even the computers IBM PC Jr.
“Business is based on the forward movement, so you shouldn’t be emotionally tied to the past,” says Samuel J. Palmisano.
That’s why IBM has no problem building its foundation walls on different platforms – and if they don’t work, they’ll leave again.
Unlike Microsoft, which basically stands and falls with its Windows operating system.
Promising Technologies
IBM’s profits are largely driven by services, software, and hardware, with one-fifth each.
In 1990, hardware with a share of more than fifty percent was the most represented.
Since 2000, IBM has been selling low-profit-making assets worth $15 billion, but at the same time, it has invested $58 billion in the purchase of future-proof technologies.
In these investments, IBM continues after 2008, when the current financial crisis swept the world like a storm for the first time.
Here, too, IBM remained faithful to the legacy of its first boss Thomas J. Watson, who increased its investment volume in the midst of the major global economic crisis.
So far, it seems that the IBM company remains undamaged from today’s crisis.
The value of IBM shares has risen by 120 percent since 2008 in a rocket-like manner and the company’s net profit is growing continuously.
IBM’s corporate slogan is: Everything can be changed – only the values cannot.
This is also why it can be expected that this flexible giant will also cope with the next crisis.
IBM history: From cheese cutters to space flights
Founded in New York a century ago, IBM (International Business Machines) initially had a rather complicated name – Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The name IBM was not adopted until 1924, when it was originally a brand name for a branch in Canada and South America.
IBM laid the foundation for the merger of four companies, whose history dates back to the 1980s.
They had technologies, such as the famous cutting-card clocks to register the start and end of work.
The architect of this new company was Charles Ranlett Flint, who also held the chairmanship of the Supervisory Board until 1930.
And it was Flint who hired the head of the competition firm Thomas J. Watson to help him lead the company.
This leader then even shadowed IBM’s founders – based on Watson’s ideas, the company’s invincible culture and identity to this day.
Watson ran the company until 1952.
IBM began, as the name suggests, with the manufacture and distribution of all kinds of machines for trade – from sausage and cheese cutters to cash registers.
In the first four decades Watson led the company, he doubled its sales to $9 million and the company gradually expanded to all continents.
Watson was so indispensable to the company that he sat in the executive chair for forty years, only then was he replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under its leadership, IBM began to work on the development of artificial intelligence and also developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, IBM technicians and computers helped lead NASA’s flights into space – to Mercury and Saturn, and in 1969, the famous flight of humans to the moon.
Meanwhile, in 1964, IBM developed the first computer family with the same computer architecture - the IBM System/360 series.
A classic PC that set the computer standard of that time came on the market in 1981 under the name IBM 5150.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, but on the other hand, it bought the consultant part of PricewaterhouseCoopers and entered the business with high added value consulting services and services.
The strategy that IBM has been paying off over the past three years is the concept of “Smarter Planet”.
It embodies the intention to use technologies wisely in areas not even planned, e.g. to improve the situation in traffic and urban administration.
In the retail sector, IBM recently introduced the “Smarter Commerce” platform to help traders lead the entire commercial cycle.
IBM also has a strong history in the Czech Republic.
In 1932, IBM established a branch in Czechoslovakia, the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, IBM <0xC4><0x8C>R also operates a strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
The Centre for Central and Eastern Europe is located in Prague and here there is also a top research team of world level, which deals with the technology of voice recognition.
Darina Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>ov<0xC3><0xA1> about her unfaithful husband:
Iveta - you can keep this donkey, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>ov<0xC3><0xA1> (53) says - now it's over!
After her husband Josef Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99> (53) had become their lover by the protector of Iveta Barto<0xC5><0xA1>ov<0xC3><0xA1> (45), Darina still remained hopeful that Joseph would wake up from his pink dream and come home.
But now it is finally over with patience and for the rest of her life she has set clear rules.
“Joseph can come home, but no more than my partner,” D. Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>ov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
When Darina Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>ov<0xC3><0xA1>, the singer I. Barto<0xC5><0xA1>ov<0xC3><0xA1>, had offered refuge in her own house, she probably wouldn’t have even imagined what would happen to her husband.
When Iveta moved out and back to <0xC5><0x98><0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>any after 30 days on her urging, Joseph immediately joined her.
He even publicly admitted that he loved her.
In time, Darina resigned, yes, it even seemed as if she wanted to reconcile with her unfaithful husband again - but now she finally gave him the running pass.
Rychyt<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99> doesn't care who his wife sleeps with
If Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99> Iveta Barto<0xC5><0xA1>ov<0xC3><0xA1> should leave in the future, he will certainly not receive open arms at home.
"He is the biological father of my dreams and if he wants to decide his days in our common home, then I will not chase him out."
"However, not as a beloved, lost old donkey, but as a human being to whom I still have certain ties," Mrs Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>ov<0xC3><0xA1> said; but she also said that she had already emotionally separated from him and insisted on mutual decency alone.
The fact that Darina locked the back door for him is a fact that Joseph has so far carried with dignity.
“I respect my wife’s decision.”
"I stay with Iveta, nothing changes."
"My wife wants a paper marriage and I respect that."
"The company continues, I take care of the repairs, the garden, the property, I make the purchases."
"With Darina, I am quite normal, but we don't share the bed," said J. Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99> (the leaf) Blesk.
If Darina wants to find a new love, he doesn’t want to stop it.
“We don’t sleep together, so I don’t care if she has a friend or who that is.
I realize this is my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and therefore I take all responsibility.
The Worst Female Insufferers: What's up with you?
If you ask the men to name some typical female infidels, they shake out their sleeves without exception.
Dear women, do you recognize yourself in the following lines, in which we make a few unsitted revisions happen again, which let the men pour the blood into the veins?
Shopping addiction
Does their spouse accuse them of being shopping addicts?
Do you need to buy at least one hater a week?
Do you like to go shopping and can it be a bit more at the same time?
In your case, it’s really a weakness.
Some women are at least aware of this and try to keep their desire to shop halfway under control.
But hand to heart, what woman does it take to just stroll through a dress shop in search of a well-fitting outerwear and not try all (in all possible color combinations) in the cabin?
Even though shopping for most women is a hobby, for the men it is often the pure hell.
Think about how many times you've told your husband - you'd rather stay outside...
Constant dissatisfaction
“Am I not too fat?”
"I would have to lose at least five kilos - should I start jogging or doing gymnastics?"
"Do I like you at all?"
Does this seem familiar to you?
- Yeah?
Then you are probably also among the women who are really obsessed with what they look like.
That doesn’t mean you should let go, but many men are allergic to it when their wife constantly complains about their appearance.
The stronger sex agrees - with the increasing frequency of complaints, women are becoming more and more intolerable.
Order and cleanliness in the first place
It is a battle against windmills.
Cleaning windows, wiping tiles and dust, scrubbing the tub - and this at least twice a week.
Do you chimp with your partner because he once again tramples on the clean tiles with dirty shoes, did you scold the children because the just-shrouded sink is already dirty again and because the glass door on the living room cabinet already has fingerprints again, where the polishing makes so much trouble?
If you suffer from this kind of "deviance", then you should know that you can't exaggerate anything and that the order and cleanliness in family life are not the first priority.
In the end, this immaculate purity frock can also damage mutual relations and, above all, the peace in the family.
Stitching
"Beautiful gym pants come in the laundry basket."
"Do you really want to wear the old socks again tomorrow?"
"You don't just throw a wet towel on the floor."
If your partner is exposed to such a tirade, don’t be surprised that it brings him to the palm.
Of course, this is not a bad thing, they just want everything to have its order.
If the men knew this, then the women might not have had to complain so much.
Klatsch and Tratsch
Some women like to gossip and gossip, as they are tricked or even slandered behind their backs, or they make alliances.
Women are now focused on relationships, so they like to cheer through such topics, such as - who, where, with whom, how and why.
Probably every one of us women has a bit of harmless gossip and gossip in stock.
Hand on heart - that's probably all women's own.
However, this is not to be confused with the clichés of the gravest calibres, to whom nothing and no one is sacred, who probably despise everyone in their environment and which pose a considerable danger especially to women’s collectives.
J<0xC3><0xA1>gr and Vor<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek helped Philadelphia win with their assistants
Ice hockey striker Jarom<0xC3><0xAD>r J<0xC3><0xA1>gr had a large stake in the 5:3 victory of Philadelphia on the ice in Carolina at the NHL's Monday game with two assists, making him again the most productive Czech player in the NHL.
The winner of the nine-and-three-year-old ice hockey star’s overview was Claude Giroux, who added an assist and was named the best player in the match.
Two assistants in the same game also recorded J<0xC3><0xA1>gr's co-star Jakub Vor<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek.
J<0xC3><0xA1>gr claimed after the game to journalists that he had predicted Giroux a great evening.
"Before the game, I tell him that he's going to get a hat-trick today."
I kind of felt that."
“A feeling like that happens over and over again,” explained J<0xC3><0xA1>gr, after whose action Giroux scored a goal at the first shot of the Flyers.
A little later, the second hit also had "a Czech track".
Vor<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek fought the Puck behind the door of the Hurricanes and put it between the circles to the successful Maxim Talbot.
One second before finishing the first third, home player Patrick Dwyer scored a short-hand, but the second third then belonged to the Flyers again.
Specifically Giroux.
In collaboration with J<0xC3><0xA1>gr, he scored his third goal, after which Wayne Simmonds steered his shot to the fourth goal.
“I love playing with him.”
“I don’t want to say he’s the best player in the league, but he’s definitely one of the best three,” J<0xC3><0xA1>gr said.
"I wouldn't have imagined in my life that I would play with such an ice hockey player at the end of my career, as with him."
“I’m very pleased with that.”
“I cut my game to myself.”
"All the years in the NHL my fellow players put their game on me and now the skewer turns around," J<0xC3><0xA1>gr grinned.
Carolina turned the game into a drama - by the hits of Tuoma Ruutua and once again Dwyer, who got through a penalty shootout, it came to a goal.
Matt Read, however, prevented any further complication in which he was successful in number two against one.
"Excellently acted Pronger still in our zone."
"He caught the puck, I took a ride and (read) moved to more distant posts."
"I tried to meet him and I'm glad it worked," Vor<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek described the last hit of the game from his point of view.
This victory led Philadelphia to the top of the Eastern Conference.
The Czech defensive player of Montreal Jaroslav <0xC5><0xA0>pa<0xC4><0x8D>ek injured himself in the game against Buffalo and retired in the second third due to an injury to the upper body.
The Candiens, in addition to their experienced Beck, also lost their lead in penalty shooting 2:3.
Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Plekanec was unable to convert one of the penalty shots.
More than the lost points, the coach of the home team probably hurt the high disease-related failure in the defensive - the game they played only ended with five defensive players.
"That's bad."
"We only ended the encounter with a single experienced player, the rest were young players."
"But nothing can be done there, so we have to deal with it," said Jacques Martin.
"At each change one attack wave after another and we had nothing to do with it."
“We should have made the game easier and brought the puck out of our third.”
There were reserves here,” said P. K. Subban, one of the defensive players.
Czech goalkeeper Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Pavlec repelled thirty shots from Tampa Bay and thus contributed decisively to the 5:2 victory over Winnipeg.
At the gates of the jets, which ended a series of five defeats, five different shooters were involved.
Development of travel prices since 1989
Until 1989, there were only five licensed state travel agencies in the then <0xC4><0x8C>SSR: <0xC4><0x8C>edok, sporturist, CKM, recrea and autoturist.
At the time, the travel agencies mainly only sold trips to the socialist Eastern Bloc countries, while in the West only selected people were allowed.
And so Czech tourists travelled to the Baltic Sea (to the German Democratic Republic - the GDR), to the Soviet Union (Sochi on the Crimea peninsula on the Black Sea), to Bulgaria and Romania to the Black Sea and to Hungary to the Balaton.
A slight exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when it was also allowed to travel to Yugoslavia, then Yugoslavia took a pro-Western course and therefore the trips to Yugoslavia were severely restricted.
A great paradox of these socialist times was that it was not even allowed citizens of the Eastern Bloc (i.e. the Czechoslovaks) to travel freely within the framework of the socialist countries.
For example, if a citizen of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSR wanted to travel individually to Poland or even to the Soviet Union, then he needed a so-called invitation letter, otherwise individual trips were not possible.
Even then, the travel agencies offered travel to the West, but then you had to buy huge snakes or also stay in the sleeping bag in front of the travel agency, or at least have "good friends" in the travel agency.
This was not the case for a long time.
The so-called foreign exchange pledge - the condition for an exit to the West - was only granted to "politically reliable" people - the others were not allowed to travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely exchangeable currency, so without a foreign exchange commitment it would have been impossible to raise the necessary funds (Western currency) for a trip to the West.
The vast majority of Czechs therefore spent their holiday in the country, no wonder that the Czechs bought countless weekend houses and dates - a habit that continues to this day.
The combined revolution of 1989 followed a travel revolution of the Czechs on their feet.
While until 1989 a holiday in the GDR or Bulgaria was the measure of all things, the Czechs spent 4.5 million of their foreign holidays last year in countries all over the world.
A huge paradox, of which one is no longer aware today, is the fact that one could not travel to the most popular holiday country in the Czech Republic - Croatia until 1989 at all, because it was part of Yugoslavia at the time.
Right from the beginning of the 90s of the last century, foreign exchange obligation was lifted in neighboring Western European countries, which caused a huge wave of short visits mainly to Vienna in Austria and to Germany.
The Czechoslovaks could not get enough of their travels to the West for a long time, everyone wanted to be there for at least a few days.
The Czech tourists slept in the tent in the park when travelling to Paris, because who would have had the money for accommodation in the hotel or in a pension at that time.
A typical feature of trips abroad from Czech Republic was a luggage room packed with canned food, beer and permanent sausage, etc.
Another important milestone was the introduction of the freely exchangeable Czech krone - after decades our tourists were finally able to buy the western currency freely.
Our level of living and, as a result, the average wages increased, which resulted in another important moment in 1997.
Thanks to the increased demand for travel, the travel agencies began to regularly prepare trips through charter flights after 1997, which made the flight trips incredible compared to the past thanks to the ability to negotiate volume discounts.
At the end of the 1990s, the Czechs, with the exception of the United States, already had foreign exchange-free payment transactions with all the advanced countries of the world, which made travelling even easier.
Another interesting moment in the history of "post-total" travel came in 2000 when, thanks to the high demand, the first direct charter flight to an exotic country was completed - to Thailand.
Since then, direct charter aircraft with Czech passengers have been flying every year to far-away sunny countries; this year you fly directly from the Czech Republic to twelve exotic destinations.
Every year, 100 Tsd Czechs travel to exotic countries!
Another significant moment in the era that marked our “post-revolutionary” development came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the U.S. lifted the visa requirement for Czech tourists, making our country definitely one of the most advanced countries in the world.
In 2008, the Czechs spent more than half of their holiday abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in their history spent more than 15 thousand CZK per capita for a single holiday, including the cost of the resort.
The Annual General Meeting is to find a new chairman - again a patt threatens.
For almost five months, Czech football has no chairman, threatening that Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek’s successor at the head of the Czech Football Association (FA<0xC4><0x8C>R) will not even be known after the extraordinary general meeting in Nymburk on Thursday.
To this day, there is still no agreement as to which electoral order should be elected.
And without this, no vote on the three potential successors is possible at all.
Three interested parties want to manage Czech football - Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k.
In June, Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek resigned from his function, prompting his colleagues to agree and find a strong personality that could guide football in the future.
Only - in the era after Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek, the old quarrels broke out again between the two federation chambers, which cannot agree on a common candidate.
This was clear and clear on September 16, when the new chairman was to be elected.
The delegates of the Annual General Meeting had come to the People’s House in the Prague district of Sm<0xC3><0xAD>chov for no reason, because the negotiation did not lead to a result and it was not just about the election itself.
One could not even agree on who is actually entitled to vote in the full collection - only the statutory representatives or also the officials endowed with a power of attorney.
In this single point, there was at least partial agreement, which also contributed to the recommendation of the Institute for State and Law, whose opinion is that representation on a proxy basis is not admissible.
However, the disputes over the electoral system continue.
The Executive Committee also did not bring any more clarity to the matter, in whose meetings - whether ordinary or extraordinary - nothing else is in principle on the agenda.
Even if the views on the election changed a few times - the neuralgic point remained the same.
The question is: how to proceed in the 3rd round to avoid a patt situation?
"The issue concerns whether to proceed in accordance with the statute or whether a completely different model must be found," said Du<0xC5><0xA1>an Svoboda, one of the three deputy chairmen of the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R, who represents professional football in management.
According to the statutory model, in the third round, the candidate who receives the greater percentage of support in the chamber for which he is running wins.
Moravia is allegedly ready to respond to the compromise that the candidate who receives the higher number of votes from both chambers wins.
The Czech side, in turn, consists on the condition that the winner receives at least a two-thirds majority in this percentage vote count.
"Then the two preliminary rounds have no sense at all, this mode would question the entire two-chamber concept," Svoboda understands the objections of the Moravian side, who found it best not to bend the electoral order, but to choose according to the valid statute.
Surprisingly, Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k also agrees, even though it is clear that the statutory electoral system is most likely to come against Pelta by all candidates.
"My wish is that, as far as possible, it will be elected in accordance with the Constitution."
"That no foolish substitutes should be devised, as at the last Annual General Meeting," explained the owner (football club) Victoria Plze<0xC5><0x88>, who ran for the first time and distinguished himself in his comments, especially Pelta.
Pelta is optimistic.
In his opinion, the new chairman will be known in Nymburk and he believes that the candidates will also cooperate constructively in the future.
"The possible qualification of the national team for the European Football Championship today would certainly contribute to calming the minds."
“If football only rides on the euphoric wave, then the willingness to cooperate is also greater,” says the Jablonec official, who has the greatest experience of all three Adepts, both on a professional and regional level.
Rajchl is more restrained.
"I hope for an agreement, but the situation is unfortunately ambiguous."
"This is not a matter between the people of Bohemia and Moravia, but there are certain efforts to "bend" the regulations for their own purposes."
"Therefore, a new blockage at the Annual General Meeting is not excluded."
“I hope, however, that the common sense ultimately wins,” Rajchl said.
Only - a lot of time to agree on all pages is no longer left.
Some negotiations should supposedly take place directly in Montenegro, but who knows if the football generality will be complete until the qualifying game.
The charter aircraft, with which Dalibor Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era and Rajchl were to fly to Podgorice, among other things, could not start in Prague in the morning due to a technical disturbance and so they were searching feverishly for a replacement variant, how to bring a part of the executive committee still to the venue of the barrage hint.
In the end, the meeting at ministerial level is probably crucial, to which it is supposed to arrive on Wednesday.
Josef Dobe<0xC5><0xA1>, the Minister of Education, Youth and Body Education, would have liked to have moved the divided parties within the country’s largest sports federation to an agreement.
There is a lot at stake: government grants, the confidentiality of Czech football and also the upcoming general meeting of <0xC4><0x8C>STV, which is to show Czech sport the new direction after the financial problems of Sazka.
Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k goes into the fight for the position of chairman because he does not see a suitable candidate
If Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k, the head of the Pilsner footballers before the Extraordinary General Meeting, could have been a strong candidate who would have fulfilled all his ideas about the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FA<0xC4><0x8C>R), he would not have taken part in the fight for this top position at all.
"If there were a good candidate, I would fight for him and renounce the election."
“But in the current situation, it was not possible to find such an adept,” said Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k <0xC4><0x8C>TK.
The main reason for Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k to go into the duel with Miroslav Pelta and Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Rajchl is to prevent the alleged favorite of the choice, Pelta, from reaching the top of the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R.
Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k also stresses that in the event of his victory, he intends to exercise the function of the Chairman only for one year, i.e. until 2013, until the date of the ordinary general meeting.
In the position of chairman, he would have liked to see an experienced top manager who is not too involved in football.
“I spoke personally to some of the people in question.”
Hard to believe that some told me they didn’t want to identify with Czech football at the moment.
"Such views would have liked to have changed," he said.
Most of all, Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k allegedly interferes with Pelta’s association with the chairman of the Pilsner district football association Roman Berbr, a man of controversial reputation who is considered a powerful lobbyist behind the scenes, with the ability to influence delegates voting at general meetings.
For Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k, it is therefore unacceptable that Pelta should hold the position of chairman.
"In his victory, the present state would be preserved and in Czech football it was not progressing at all."
“The support of Berbr, a clever businessman, is twice as bad for football,” Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k said.
He also hinted that Pelta's name had been dropped some time ago in connection with telephone interrogations to investigate in a corruption affair, but that Pelta was found to be free of criminal charges.
"I don't know what prestige a Pelta victory should bring to football."
"And how would we stand in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said <0xC5><0x99>ekl Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k, who said his earlier statement, "he will sell the Pilsner football club if Pelta becomes chairman", but looks a little quieter.
However, if Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k wins in the Thursday election, he could well imagine a future collaboration with Pelta.
Just as another candidate thinks - Rajchl, who Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k had supported before the Annual General Meeting in October, which ended with a failure.
"He (Pelta) would be the first one I would go to."
"He has great skills".
“I could imagine him, for example, as the head of the national team.”
"But I don't think he's capable of running the association as a manager."
"I'm not putting my nose on matters of which I don't understand," said Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k, who in September caused a stir to replace Dagmar Damkov<0xC3><0xA1>, who was behind the dismissal of the Referee Commission with Lu<0xC4><0x8F><0xC4><0x9B>k Macela.
Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k himself claims that he feels the role of the union chairman has grown.
And in doing so, he relies on his skills in managing private companies, since last summer he is also the head of Pilsen, who, with his support in May, celebrated the first triumph in the league.
“I have the power to change something in the football environment and contribute to some cultivation of it.”
"To limit the influence of certain stakeholders that tend to influence disciplinary and vocation commissions, which can lead to adverse situations," Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k said, noting that he does not hide from his antipathy, for example, towards Sparta's chief executive Daniel K<0xC5><0x99>et<0xC3><0xAD>nsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
As one of his priorities, he sees the strengthening of relations between the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R and the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which he would lobby political top politicians for more money from the lottery tax to flow into the sport.
"This is one of the crucial things that the new chairman should devote himself to."
“When it comes to taxing gambling, as the political parties declare, then I understand their argument, but then they also have to say clearly where the money is going,” he said.
His connection to the Pilsner Club also does not see Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k as a handicap, although he himself stresses that the chairman of the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R must be "superpartisan".
Pelta, in turn, is connected to Jablonec, Rajchl to the Prague Dukla.
"That's not exactly ideal."
"But I don't think it makes much sense to transfer my shares in the Pilsner Club to a third party in order to return after a year and a half," Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k said.
Pelta promised new statutes of the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R that would rule out a patt situation in the future.
Two days before the Annual General Meeting of the Football Association, one of the candidates for the chairmanship, Miroslav Pelta, promised that, in the event of his election, the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R would make a strong effort to obtain new statutes, which in the future exclude disputes about the electoral system from the outset.
The official from Jablonec is confident before the Thursday trial in Nymburk and believes that the election campaign will certainly defuse in the event of a possible success of the Czech election.
Pelta had already promised before the unrealized election in September that he wanted to focus on the national team and the extraction of funds in the event of his election.
He decided only at the last moment to participate in the election before the last Annual General Meeting and so the two-month break would help him to defend his ideas about the management of football and present it in a broader context.
"People at all levels are dedicated to football, they are impatient and therefore expect the chairman to be known on Thursday."
"He feels that it is high time that the association is run by someone," says the man, who is primarily associated with the Jablonec club, but who also worked for Sparta and the executive committee for many years.
This is also why he believes he has sufficient experience to lead Czech football.
He is convinced that the euphoria that prevailed at the time of Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek is responsible for today's problems with the election.
"Unfortunately, statutes were approved at the Annual General Meeting in June, which were not as perfect as everyone had assumed.
If they hadn’t allowed different interpretations, we would have had a chairman from September,” Pelta said.
He used the revision of the most important document of the Citizens' Association as a means of attracting delegates.
"If I should become chairman, I will take it personally and be willing to bear personal responsibility if it doesn't work out."
“This is a principled thing without which he cannot be,” Pelta says.
Furthermore, he does not try to separate himself from his counterparts.
He had previously announced that he could introduce himself to a collaboration with Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Rajchl, whom he recognizes because of his legal education and he knows well that his opponent would be his first deputy.
He also did not attack Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k for a long time, which in turn did not leave a dry thread on Pelta.
He has been in football for over a year and can already refer to certain successes."
"His attacks, however, were slashing and many people were shocked by his election campaign."
"That's also why many people now doubt his real character," Pelta addressed his counterpart, who probably remained true to his proclamations, which he had already uttered in September.
In his opinion, his strongest weapon is the knowledge of football from the lowest classes of play to the national team.
And this should be the sign of Czech football.
"I would also strive to end all affairs - from the Causa Bohemians to the aftermath of last year's corruption scandal."
“Just after that, I would rush into negotiations with the private and state sector to ensure sufficient funding for the entire football industry,” said the forty-six-year-old candidate <0xC4><0x8C>TK two months ago.
At the time, he also promised that his entry into the top of Czech football would not mean any personal cleansing.
"I would first have to familiarize myself with the work content of all employees," he said towards Strahov, where due to the long anarchy, there is comprehensible nervousness.
Despite the catastrophic scenarios that accompany the upcoming Annual General Meeting, he believes that the delegates will not go to Nymburk for nothing on Thursday.
"If really the only point at stake is how to choose in the third round, then we'll get over it."
“Football needs credibility, and it only wins back when it finally has a new leader,” Pelta said in a statement.
Rajchl promises that the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R will start working hard under him
If the former deputy chairman Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Rajchl were to be elected as the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic at the Annual General Meeting on Thursday, this would allegedly avoid the mood of many people in the association.
Rajchl promises to start working hard in case of his choice.
He wants to introduce system changes and make the members of the Executive Committee responsible for individual football areas.
He also promised to solve Bohemian’s case, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money into football, and otherwise continue the work that former chairman Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek has begun.
“As president, I want to dedicate myself to football as a whole.”
From international contacts to UEFA and FIFA, to national selection, professional football, to performance football for youth.”
“I don’t want to say that I want to do everything alone,” Rajchl told <0xC4><0x8C>TK.
"I am a team player and therefore want to distribute the competences in the Executive Committee in such a way that each member devotes himself to a certain area."
And I will be distributing tough tasks so that football progresses in every segment with miles of strides.”
Many would not be thrilled about this because, instead of just criticizing the work of others, they would have to start working really hard themselves,” he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement, it has been considered not to run at all.
“I know I work 20 hours a day.”
“But I need to know that it makes sense and that people are standing behind me, who don’t throw a lump between my legs and question every step I take,” he said as an explanation of why he was hesitant.
“Many people told me that I shouldn’t give up because otherwise others would too.”
"That's trust you can't play," he said.
He is also reportedly motivated to continue the work he started under Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
“In two years, we’ve done a lot of work and I don’t want to throw that away.”
"Procedures have been launched that will probably only come into effect in a few years and I would just like to see someone stop them," he said, expressing his concerns that, in the event that the other candidate - Miroslav Pelta, would be elected, the situation could return to the times before Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
"I believe in systematic action and that's something that Mirek Pelta doesn't bring."
"Behind him are mostly people who would make football so that he would only be there for the chosen."
I think I can blame something, but not that I’m biased.”
“I try to be objective.”
“I want football for everyone, because everyone is doing well and not just the chosen one,” Rajchl said.
He also contradicts the claim that he is only a chairman of the Czechs.
"Even though some people say the opposite, I really intend to do the best possible for Moravia."
"For example, it's time to consider whether you shouldn't divide the league into a Czech and a Moravian section, whose winners then each rose to the first league."
"Then it could not happen that today only three Moorish clubs play in the league, which is a problem especially for the young players in Moravia," Rajchl says.
Because the head of the Pilsner club Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k has now joined the fight for the function of the chairman, Rajchl does not dare to assess his chances of being elected.
"I feel a strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has elected me as its deputy chairman and now recognizes that clear successes are behind me," Rajchl said, who also sees the savings of tens of millions of kroner for unfavourable contracts, the agreement of television contracts and the negotiations for the lottery law as his success.
On the other hand, he is partly blamed for the fact that the association does not pull on a single strand.
While he says of Pelta that "he is disqualified from the outset to give Czech football new confidence," he considers the second rival - Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k to be a strong candidate who really has something to offer to football.
"No one can question that he has done excellent work in Pilsen in just one year."
"If he were to be elected, he would probably continue the things that Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek initiated and also the staffing in the commissions he would obviously not fundamentally change."
He certainly wouldn’t want to bend things in his favor,” Rajchl said of his rival.
Europe's most beautiful pools
Jump into the Blue
By Julia Stanek
Planschbecken in ufo-optik, Prunkpools in Budapest: Those who travel through Europe can experience its blue wonder - and after a city tour or a hike, rest their tired legs in whirlpools.
A book shows where wellness in the water is most beautiful.
When Iris Meder went on a research trip over the past year and a half, one in her luggage was not to be missed: her swimsuit.
Lying back on the water, she looked high in elaborately designed domes, she swam marble pillows waiting for her at the edge of the pool, and marveled at meticulously restored Art Nouveau swimming pools.
If she liked a bath, she took it flight into her notebook - including knowledgeable details about the construction and history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools explored architecture historian Meder in this way - and now presents them in her recently published book "Badefreuden": Volksswimmerhallen in Munich, historic bathing palaces in the Black Forest, "Hardcore concrete buildings" in the Taunus.
Through 13 countries, she led her "journey to the most extraordinary baths in Central Europe": in addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and one city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old German is a true bathing culture enthusiast.
With sport, she doesn’t have much on her hat, says Meder – only in the water it’s different.
Annoying only that swimming fans have to deal with blue tiles and chlorine tanks, while joggers can breathe in the beguiling scent of spruce forests or listen to cheerful bird chirping in the park.
“One day I was wondering why swimming pools always have to be so ugly,” says the Meder, who lives in Vienna.
"So I started collecting beautiful bathrooms."
Water surface doubles architecture
Splatters in the spring pool and essential sauna oils - the wellness factor in bathrooms is therefore so large because all senses are served, according to Meder.
And when the builders have struggled, swimming pools can be a real eye-catcher: "Instead of a floor, you have a water surface in bathrooms."
"On the one hand, it is transparent, but on the other hand it reflects the beauty of the whole building."
Everything visually doubles: high vaults, colorful tiles, springboards.
The small-format picture book "Badefreuden" provides information on the architectural and cultural history of historic wellness oases on 190 pages - but above all makes you want to jump into the blue.
Notable specimens discovered the pool collector Meder during her research in Hungary.
In addition to magnificent spas such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi Bath in Budapest, she found a nitrate-containing water in a rustic karst cave (the cave bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) as well as a thermal bath, whose pools are filled with alkaline water and are located in a bottle-shaped building (V<0xC3><0xA1>rosi Term<0xC3><0xA1>lfürdö in J<0xC3><0xA1>s).
Spectacular views, on the other hand, offer many heated outdoor pools in Switzerland and Austria: while you have the whole city in mind from the Zurich rooftop pool, you can look at the snow-covered Arlberg in the outdoor swimming pool in St. Anton - and: in the steam room there is a window from which you can observe the drifting on the ski slope.
Perhaps the most extraordinary pool design awaits bathing guests in L<0xC3><0xA4>ngenfeld: The Aquadome <0xC3><0x96>tztal looks like a UFO just landed in the Alps.
From three shells open upwards, it evaporates in winter, while in the background the mountains of the <0xC3><0x96>tztal valley rise into the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Not in every swimming pool the pool collector Meder got the smell of chlorine in the nose.
Many thermal baths smell like sulfur, in the <0xC3><0x81>rp<0xC3><0xA1>d-Bad in Hungarian Békescsaba it smells so strong like heating oil that you hardly think you’ve landed in a health bath.
The smell comes from the alkaline-hydrogen carbonate-containing healing water, which is almost black and whose slick sticks to the skin as soon as you get into the pelvis - a wellness experience of a special kind.
In one place, however, Iris Meder was also disappointed in her search for beautiful bathing spots: when she wanted to visit the open-air and sunbath in the Czech bath Luhatschowitz, she found a blocked terrain.
The bathroom, designed by architect Du<0xC5><0xA1>an Jurkovic in 1902, has now been closed.
When Meder took a look through the weathered windows of the red-and-white-yellow Art Nouveau building, she saw weeds growing between the tiles.
On the other hand, you have counteracted the decay in a magical swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
Three phases of construction have already gone by; one can discover not only neo-romanic elements dating back to the time of its construction in 1844, but also a Moorish Alhambra-style hall, which was added around 1900.
Since the careful modernization in 1995, the Palais Thermal has been the favorite swimming pool of pool connoisseur Iris Meder – and not just because it was originally from the Black Forest.
“It’s already a feat of merging different building styles into such a great unit,” Meder says.
With such a palace, the dive in the thermal pool is apparently only minor.
Agricultural Speculation
Deutsche Bank lights up its raw material business
By Christian Teevs
Does Deutsche Bank abandon its business with agricultural raw materials?
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE information, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to examine the consequences of speculation for the world’s poor.
In January, the CEO wants to draw consequences.
Hamburg
According to one study, 84 percent of Germans find it unacceptable for banks to speculate with agricultural raw materials such as wheat or corn.
Two-thirds of respondents even demand that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions exit this business because it exacerbates the problems of the world’s poorest.
This is the result of a Forsa survey commissioned by the consumer organization Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
In it, author Harald Schumann shows that the bets on the global commodity exchanges are driving prices up – and the banks are therefore co-debted to the global hunger problem.
The consumer protection campaign is specifically directed against Deutsche Bank CEO Josef Ackermann, even though large banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act similarly.
Originally, commodity bets were intended to hedge traders against price fluctuations.
But now most experts agree that the sugars have decoupled themselves from supply and demand – and make profits at the expense of the poorest.
Unlike the US competitors, Ackermann responded to the criticism: he promised to examine the allegations and said that no business was “worth putting the good reputation of Deutsche Bank at risk”.
According to information from SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is currently investigating the allegations from the Foodwatch report.
By the end of the year, the examination will be completed, the results will be presented to the Management Board of Deutsche Bank - including recommendations on how to deal with it.
At the end of January, the top of the bank will then tell you what consequences it will have.
In the end, there could be a reduction in the commodity business, or even the complete departure.
Ackermann paints on his image
Foodwatch chief Thilo Bode welcomed the news, but at the same time reiterated his criticism of the financial industry: "Beingt on rising food prices shows particularly drastically how ruthless banks today are hurting the general good."
As a top banking lobbyist, Ackermann is now particularly in charge.
“Deutsche Bank must remove all investments from its portfolio that use money to bet on food prices,” Bode said.
"Whether it's Mr. Ackermann about hungry people or the reputation of the Deutsche Bank."
Ackermann’s insight comes as a surprise at first sight, but it is clear that the CEO wants to give a perfect picture a few months before leaving office.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that unlike planned, the CEO will not switch to the Supervisory Board.
With a departure from the controversial agricultural speculation, he could improve his image.
And for possible losses, he hardly needs to shave himself - that would eventually have to do with his successor.
Every second would terminate raw material plants
Foodwatch strives to keep the pressure on the manager high.
So far, more than 30,000 Internet users have participated in the organization’s campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published the survey, for which the Forsa Institute surveyed 1001 people on 7 and 8 November.
At just 11 percent, it is therefore considered legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer facilities where prices for food are wagered.
Many bank customers would also draw personal consequences if they learned that their bank is involved in such transactions: According to the survey, every second would terminate all investments where money flows into the commodity speculation.
43 percent would advise acquaintances from such a bank, 49 percent said they thought about canceling their account and switching to another institution.
21er Haus in Vienna
The Moved Pavilion
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
An architectural history with highs, lows and happy end: the Austrian World Exhibition Pavilion of Brussels won prizes in 1958, became a museum in Vienna, stood empty and got lost.
Now he is reopened as an exhibition house.
If modern post-war architecture swarms with clear shapes, glass halls, bold turns and new building materials typical of the belief in technical progress, then the Austrian pavilion of the architect Karl Schwanzer is an apt and famous example for the 1958 Brüssler World Exhibition.
Schwanzer’s pavilion was awarded the Grand Prix d’Architecture at the time for its light and floating steel-glass construction.
The construction is still considered a milestone in contemporary architecture.
He made the architect so famous that he also built Austria’s pavilion at the next world exhibition.
With his legendary BMW four-cylinder house plus bowl-like annex in Munich, he finally became internationally famous in 1973.
His pavilion, which was planned as a temporary exhibition building, had been erected after the world exhibition in the Swiss garden at the Wiener Südbahnhof, rebuilt and opened in 1962 a museum of the 20th century - the "20th House" it was called.
However, the building was neither spatially nor technically suitable as a museum - no walls for hanging art, no good climate.
Nevertheless, it was used until contemporary art in Vienna got a new house.
Since 2001, the building has stood empty and came down more and more.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has rebuilt the pavilion, he is now called "21er Haus" and will be used in the future as a museum for contemporary art.
On Tuesday evening, the Belvedere Museum, to which the house belongs, opens the first exhibition there - a lucky case in every way.
Agnes Husslein-Arco, who became the new director of the Austrian Gallery Belvedere in 2007.
Husslein-Arco, a distinguished art historian with a considerable career, among other things in youth as an art painter, later at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and as founding director of the Museum der Moderne Salzburg, strongly enforced the reconstruction with politicians and monument protectors, procured public funds and private sponsorship funds and determined the use.
In addition to contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba were to be exhibited by the eponymous foundation, there was to be a café and a bookstore, and an office building had to be built for this purpose.
Strict supervision, small budget
Krischanitz was then the ideal cast for the performance.
Not only because he had sensitively rebuilt and expanded Joseph Olbrich's Secession in Vienna and won the competition, but because he studied at Schwanzer at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilion for him was an "immeasurable place" where he had viewed the exhibitions "almost every weekend".
He knew the original design, and he knew the problems of the building, which already lost in its transfer to Vienna and its re-use in generosity and ease.
There were far greater problems with the current reconstruction: the building was "an energy slinger," says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of the glass fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade were replaced, glass fiber-reinforced insulating glass was used and the glass roof was replaced by special safety glass.
Cold bridge steel supports have been reinforced or replaced, and asbestos-filled ceilings have been renovated.
Two basements provided space for the new use, a lowered light trench between the house and the road provides for the exposure, a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new building, but still the light Schwanzer Pavilion.
The original exterior doors have remained, the house is painted in the old red-brown rust protection shade.
And the cinema is still exactly as it used to be.
And all this under the strict supervision of the monument authority and with a small budget.
“Often, a material that is good and cheap had to be found and also liked the monument protection office,” says Krischanitz, pointing to a sloping floor in the basement.
Despite all the constraints, problems and alterations, the building has remained flexible and light.
It was difficult with the pavilion that “came out of Brussels,” Krishanitz recently said, a typical “drop-in-the-city story.”
Such an architecture is "always in the wrong place" and still wants "to raise a proper awareness".
In this case, however, the 21st house is not in the wrong place, because there has been an urban development lucky case: around the Swiss garden, the completely new planned "main station quarter", with office and residential buildings is being created.
And another good luck may come: the 21st house could get reinforcement from another Krischanitz building, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg bought the Berlin Temporary Kunsthalle, and, as you can hear, she is already negotiating with the city for a neighboring location in the Swiss garden.
Train Plans Winter Crisis Package in Million Height
The railway has devised a crisis plan to prevent train failures in winter.
The number of employees should be doubled.
It costs millions.
In the fight against winter-related train failures and delays, Deutsche Bahn is is issuing an additional €70 million this year, according to a newspaper report.
The Bild newspaper reported in advance, citing an intra-group crisis plan, that by 2015, investments totalling around 300 million euros were planned.
This should improve the availability of vehicles and rail networks even in extreme weather conditions.
Among other things, it is planned to double the internal and external employees for the snow removal on railway systems and railway platforms to 16,000 people.
The aim is to free platforms up to the start of operation and 90 percent of the necessary routes within four to five hours of snow and ice.
Two months ago, railway chief Rüdiger Grube had warned of train failures and delays this winter after a top meeting with government and industry.
Last winter the railways had considerable problems in passenger transport, as it lacked reserves, among other things, in difficult weather conditions.
For example, numerous new regional trains have been waiting for approval from the Federal Railways Agency for years.
There is also a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
The train has also been making it possible for years to have axes of ICE trains checked in the workshop much more often after an ICE had an axle break in Cologne Central Station.
Deutsche Bank to pay millions of dollars in the US
After the tumult over Chief Josef Ackermann comes a new impasse from the USA: Deutsche Bank has to pay a million fine there.
As if the problems at home for Deutsche Bank were not enough, the industry giants are now also catching up with their past in the US: The Frankfurt Institute is paying 145 million dollars (106 million euros) in a comparison to settle disputes over the bankruptcy of five major cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
It is about selling mortgage papers.
The financial market regulator NCUA accuses a number of large banks of inducing cooperative banks with false promises to buy financial products; they have downplayed the risks.
Such papers lost a lot of value during the financial crisis and plunged the banks into the depths.
"We are pleased that we were able to resolve the issue without the parties having to go to court," a German bank spokesman said in a statement.
The bank admitted no guilt with the comparison.
This also applies to the Citigroup, which committed to paying $20.5 million.
NCUA Chairman Debbie Matz welcomed the arrival of the two financial institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for U.S. cooperative banks and jumps in at pleas to protect customer deposits.
The NCUA is trying to replace the billion-dollar damage caused.
The comparisons now made are the first of their kind.
The regulator had also buttoned other major banks and sued JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs in the summer.
The mortgage securities in question are so-called mortgage-backed securities.
These are based on house loans.
When the U.S. real estate bubble burst in 2007, this became a mess for a variety of financial firms.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers switched over.
Even though the events have been going on for a few years, the banks are currently blowing a sharp wind in the US.
Investors and regulators have tried countless lawsuits to get redress or to condone wrongdoing.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has triggered the biggest lawsuit.
It accuses 18 major international banks of overspending US state-owned real estate financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac on mortgage transactions in the amount of around $200 billion.
Deutsche Bank also has to file a lawsuit against FHFA, which involves several transactions worth a total of $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authority requires that the Frankfurters stand up for "substantial losses", but without mentioning an exact sum.
Deutsche Bank had rejected the claims as untenable and stated that it wanted to defend itself.
Warren Buffett Raises $10 Billion at IBM
Finanzguru Buffett invests heavily in the IT company IBM.
Since March, he has purchased shares worth more than $10 billion.
So far, the big American investor Warren Buffett has always stated not to invest in IT and computer companies, as the long-term development of the companies is poorly predicted.
Now, however, he has read IBM’s annual reports and changed his opinion about investments in the industry.
He has had to understand much earlier that IBM primarily provides services and creates computer systems for the IT departments of other companies.
Warren Buffett's investment is considered a knight's blow in the financial world.
As a result, IBM is now allowed to call itself “Sir IBM”.
Buffett revealed in CNBC that he had purchased IBM shares worth $10.7 billion since March.
His investment holding Berkshire Hathaway has thus risen to one of IBM’s largest shareholders with a share of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said that even IBM had not known anything about the engagement so far.
He praised the management, which had provided decent profits even in the economic crisis.
“They did a great job,” Buffett said.
IBM has been relying for some time on the lucrative IT services such as the operation of data centers.
The more than 100-year-old computer pioneer also offers software and consulting as well as powerful company computers.
Buffett had avoided technology companies to date.
He says he only invests in companies whose business he understands.
Instead, Buffett used a freight railway, a lubricant manufacturer or machine builders, for example.
His holding Berkshire Hathaway, in addition to around 80 own subsidiaries, also owns shares in a number of large corporations such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, the former Munich-based Rück.
The 81-year-old had taken over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and expanded it into one of the most valuable companies in the world with smart investments.
However, his lifestyle is modest.
It is therefore a cult figure for countless investors around the world.
His almost indisputable sense of making money has earned him the nickname "Oracle of Omaha".
After the Buffett investment was announced, the IBM stock rose by one percent on a pre-market basis.
“Big Blue,” as IBM is called, is worth more than $220 billion in total on the stock market, making it one of the most valuable technology companies in the world along with Apple and Microsoft.
At Microsoft, Buffett said, but he didn’t want to get in.
Founder Bill Gates is a close friend.
The threat is tangible
After the discovery of the "Zwickauer Zelle", Turkish media doubt the German rule of law.
A newspaper even speaks of a "bloody ideology" that is now alive again.
The murders of eight Turkish tribesmen and one Greek small business owner between 2000 and 2006 had a right-wing extremist background.
This news is being responded to with fear and concern in Turkey and within the German-Turkish population in Germany.
For many German-Turkishs, this brings back a long-deadly ghost: Since the fires in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no comparable violence with a right-wing extremist background against Turks.
The fact that there is xenophobia in Germany was never in question.
However, the uncovered right-wing extremist network reveals dimensions whose dimension is not yet foreseeable.
"Does the bloody ideology live up again?" headlined the Internet edition of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk".
On the other hand, the newspaper "Sabah" stresses that one of the perpetrators should have been a V-man of constitutional protection, and is concerned that German authorities might also be involved in the right-wing swamp.
The Turkish community of Germany reacted in a clear way: it reminded the victims of racist violence on the weekend with a vigil in front of the Brandenburg Gate.
Only two weeks earlier, the Turkish community in Berlin, together with German and Turkish politicians, had thought in a festive act of the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement.
In cheerful colors, the collaboration had been staged - as a story of success.
The coverage of some Turkish media: "Germany's Gift for the Fiftyth" is the headline of an article in the Turkish internet platform "Haber X", which refers to the background of the murder series.
Even the German edition of the "Hürriyet" cannot be taken to draw this mental connection.
"It starts to stink," is the title of Ahmet Külahci's column.
He stressed that people had been murdered, paid taxes and made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany with their work.
In German-Turkish Internet forums, the police’s actions and their subsequent success are discussed extremely critically.
The authors wonder why the German authorities have not been much more inclined to look for suspects in right-wing extremist circles.
Some, at least rhetorically, show themselves ready for drastic means: "If there is still a slur here, the migrants will have nothing but self-defense and armament."
"This will probably be the best self-protection."
"The quality of the education and the appropriateness of the punishment of the entire network depends very much on the inner peace in Germany," writes "Selen".
What it means when internal peace in Germany is in danger, the attacks of Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s made clear.
The photo of the Solingen fire pit is deeply rooted in German and Turkish memory.
For no other event showed the Turks living here more clearly that there is a tangible threat, and the Germans that distrust and distance can lead to right-wing violence.
The attacks, however, sharpened the feeling of being on the Turkish side.
Do not repeat the mistakes of the past
In the Turkish press at the time, the failure of German politics after the attacks was mainly criticised: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the fire attack of Solingen, he sent a telegram of condolences to the Turkish President, but was represented at the funeral ceremony in Cologne by his foreign minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel listed in his speech at the time how many charges the local Turks made.
It is as if the value of a person is calculated according to the amount of his taxes.
The current coverage of the Turkish media shows once again how deep the distrust of many German Turks in the local rule of law has been since.
In addition to the efforts of extensive clarification and re-evaluation of extreme right-wing terrorism in Germany, this time we need open words.
The scandal bank of the Zürisee
The most adventurous bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
UBS almost went bankrupt in the financial crisis and has since slipped from one crisis to the next.
Now it's supposed to be a German.
That’s not what Axel Weber thought.
After his spectacular departure from the top of the Bundesbank, it was announced in July that he would take on an almost equally spectacular new job in 2013: Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Swiss Grand Bank UBS - an unexpected and lucrative career step.
Axel Weber was publicly delighted, praised Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its newfound solidity, and left friendly comments about the future colleagues.
"The UBS has made the turnaround".
"I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel".
But in September it became clear that everything was going to be completely different.
A dealer at UBS in London had bypassed all of the bank’s security systems and slashed around 1.7 billion euros.
UBS CEO Oswald Grübel, a not only Swiss-renowned banker, had to leave.
Since then, the Chairman of the Board of Directors of UBS has also been considered a hit – and everyone asks: When will Axel Weber finally arrive?
Weber is expected to advise the bank in February 2012.
And he takes over the Chairmanship of the Board of Directors in May - not until 2013, as the bank announced on Tuesday.
For Axel Weber, this is going to be tough.
He is not a banker, rather an economics professor and central banker, and would certainly have needed an induction period.
He then takes responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which has just proven once again that it has long earned the title of "Europe's largest scandal bank".
Because UBS is huge on the one hand - until recently it was the largest asset manager in the world - and on the other hand it has been glaring from one scandal to the next for years.
Nothing, it seems, is spared the once so proud Swiss bank.
It started in the financial crisis.
Until 2007 UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of the silent and solid, but also exhausted Swiss asset manager had combined it with ambitious goals: it also wanted to become a very big number in investment banking.
For example, UBS managed more money than any other bank in the world with $1.6 trillion in 2007.
On the other hand, as an investment bank, she had advanced to the league of the largest banks in the world.
That made an impression.
The former banker and later long-time banking professor in Zurich Hans Geiger relates: "My students at the time I always presented UBS as a pattern of a good bank."
“From today’s point of view, you ask yourself: How could I be so wrong?”
He was greatly mistaken.
In 2007, it was revealed for the first time that something was wrong in UBS.
In the middle of the year, CEO Peter Wuffli resigned surprisingly, who until then was considered a highly intellectual and equally brilliant banker.
A few months later, they realized why he had left.
The bank’s investment division had swindled with subprime papers and had to write off billions.
To shoulder this, UBS announced a capital increase of CHF 13 billion.
To this end, she actually found investors, but some of them, until recently, would have shrunk their noses: an intransparent Asian state fund from Singapore and an Arab state fund that was so silent that one didn’t even know its name.
But that was only the first blow.
It got worse in April 2008.
The bank had to announce new billions of losses, Chairman of the Board of Directors Marcel Ospel, in 2006 the second highest paid Board of Directors of Switzerland, resigned.
In October 2008, the disaster followed: in view of their misinvestment in the financial crisis, UBS faced the collapse and had to be saved by the state.
The National Bank bought UBS for tens of billions of problematic securities, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for a forced convertible bond, through which it could become co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was shaken - because she noticed how dramatic it is for a small country when it houses such large banks.
Finally, the balance sheet total of UBS 2007 was more than five times that of Switzerland’s economic performance (see graph).
“Once again, we couldn’t save UBS,” said Geiger, a bank researcher.
The first disaster was followed by the second.
Just a few months later, UBS capitulated in tax dispute with America and agreed to release the data of wealthy customers who may have lashed behind taxes with the help of the bank.
In addition, she agreed to a $780 million payment – in return for unjustified profits from these transactions, including a fine.
UBS was more or less open to helping with tax evasion.
At the same time, she lost something that had always been her capital in the competition for rich customers: the Nimbus of secrecy.
After the scandal, the Swiss bank secret was no longer the same.
This was followed by the resignation of Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors.
And the exodus of customer money.
Within a few months, the bank had lost its credibility in both central business areas: in investment banking through misspeculation and in asset management through the help of tax evasion.
And just as things got a little quieter, just as you thought, now the UBS is going to get it again, so follows this unspeakable dealer story: a single trader swindles 1.7 billion euros before the bank realizes that something is going wrong.
And it turns out: with risk management in investment banking, it obviously still doesn’t work.
“With the case of Adoboli, it has been found that risk control has not changed very much,” says Martin Janssen, economist and finance professor at the University of Zurich’s banking institute.
The chief financial officer of a large German bank is also certain: "The problem of UBS is that it does not control risk control."
It was the very idea of the caution with which the Swiss bankers had long ago started to become guardians of the great fortunes of the world: not too great risks, but security for money - might even collapse the world beyond the Alpine Republic.
The Swiss banks’ vaults have become a symbol of unwavering reliability, such as Lindt and Sprüngli for particularly fine chocolate.
The headquarters of UBS in Zurich still fits the cliché of the Swiss private bank - it's just a bit bigger.
The location is classic.
The bank has its headquarters on Zurich Bahnhofstra<0xC3><0x9F>e, which leads from the main station directly to Lake Zurich, which is framed by the snow-capped peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are magnificent, the store rents are among the highest in Europe.
Jewelers such as Tiffany's can be found here between Swiss traditional shops such as the Confiserie Sprüngli.
For centuries, Swiss banks have resided here: from the National Bank to the Palace of Credit Suisse to elite private banks such as Julius Baer.
The reception room of the UBS is accessed by a heavy revolving door.
Inside, the walls are marble-clad, in front of them are thick leather armchairs, next to the bank logo a large sign for the "Safe".
UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: Security.
This idea of the Swiss bank has displaced both Swiss major banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, but at some point – or betrayed, as the head of a small Swiss private bank finds.
He prefers not to read his name in the newspaper, after all, like all Swiss bankers, he also does business with the two big banks.
UBS has become too big, he finds - especially in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons had also spread.
The Swiss have nothing more to say.
"And if so, they have long since adapted to the customs of the Anglo-Saxons."
In fact, it was the Anglo-Saxon investment banking that changed UBS, gave it first high profits and then the debacle: no European financial institution has lost as much money in the subprime jungle as the Swiss big bank.
On October 15, 2008, the disaster became visible.
"On that Wednesday, the government coalition of the small seven million country decided on the largest rescue operation in the history of its nation," author Lukas H<0xC3><0xA4>ssig wrote in his book "The UBS Crash".
Up to CHF 68 billion or around EUR 45 billion, the politicians agreed to save the big bank facing bankruptcy.
How could this happen?
If you talk to Swiss bankers, they see the problem especially in the size of UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three Swiss major banks merged into a huge group.
A bank was created that was already too big for small Switzerland at the time of the merger – and continued to grow.
This helped to complement the two different predecessor banks of UBS: a rich but sleepy bank with a focus on asset management in Zurich and a poorer but already more internationalised bank.
All of a sudden, the internationalized investment bankers came in cheaply with a lot of money, with which they could turn a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with this rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, CEO of UBS from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then Chairman of the Board of Directors.
“I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team,” says bank researcher Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the highly intellectual, modest, who understands much of models and statistics, and Ospel, the abdominal man who has worked up from banking to the very top."
But Ospel finally relied on Wuffli.
And Wuffli probably made a crucial mistake in the end: "He thought his models were reality," Geiger says.
“This is a tragic case.”
Tragic, maybe.
It is clear that pride came before the case.
UBS employees recall clearly the executive meetings on which CEO Wuffli repeatedly issued the same slogan: Goldman Sachs is stepping down from the throne.
The American Bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
She led the "League Tables", the rankings that documented the success of the banks of that time.
The UBS wanted to go to the top.
A few steps she had already succeeded.
She played at the top in foreign exchange and stock trading.
However, company advisors who were hired highlighted a weakness: in the international interest rate business, in the banking language "Fixed Income", there is a huge gap between the largest banks.
UBS has gaps in U.S. mortgage products.
To close this gap, UBS embarked on an adventure that almost cost her existence.
Hungry for growth, both the bank itself and a hedge fund founded before it invested in American subprime facilities.
It developed into a massive machine that packed and passed on securities on American mortgages, but also kept risks to itself.
Even when other banks were looking for a way out.
"Even in the summer of 2007, when the American real estate market was in flames, UBS bought there," says banking expert Geiger.
So big the euphoria, so deep the case.
One manager after another had to go as the attempts to clean up were more difficult than thought.
Posts at UBS became a spin seat and are still shaky to this day.
Whoever leads the big bank now has an almost impossible job.
He needs to find a strategy for a bank that has lost all the obvious business models.
Bank researcher Geiger already has an idea: end with investment banking, focus on asset management, return to the Swiss roots.
The bank does not want to go that far (yet).
But investment banking is supposed to shrink sharply, so much is already clear.
Next Thursday, the new bank manager Sergio Ermotti will present his future strategy to the world.
The 51-year-old Italo Swiss was actually only intended as a transitional solution when the bank surprisingly separated from its predecessor Grubel.
In the meantime, he has prevailed: he is to run UBS’s business permanently, the Zurich Bank said on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants the investment bank to go back to the mid-nineties.
3,500 jobs have been cancelled.
But that will not be enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does she want to make money with?
These are the questions that Axel Weber is probably asking himself right now.
So far, he has only said that he will be looking for an apartment in Zurich with his wife.
Next year.
Fears of recession in Europe burden the U.S. stock market
The impending recession in Europe has taken the courage of US investors for the start of the week.
The change of government in Athens and Rome remained unimpeded.
The threatened industrial production on the continent suffocated the hopes of stabilizing the debt crisis in the bud.
The general relief over the change of government in Rome and Athens could not prevail.
The euro fell against the dollar.
The Italian and Greek glass was still half full last week, not half empty – but now the problems have again come to the fore, said Mark Luschini of Janney Montgomery Scott.
Above all, financial values were on the sales charts.
The Dow-Jones index of the standard values listed at the close of trading with a minus of 0.6 percent at 12,078 points.
In the course of trade, the market barometer fluctuated between 12,027 and 12,170 points.
The broader S&P 500 index closed at 1251 points, a minus of one percent.
The index of the Nasdaq technology exchange lost 0.8 percent and went out of business with 2657 points.
In Frankfurt, the Dax passed with a minus of 1.2 percent at 5985 meters.
The industry in the 17 euro countries has significantly reduced its production and is gearing up for the end of the boom.
The companies produced 2% less in September than in the previous month, according to Eurostat.
“We are not an island, but dependent,” said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
Europe will not be able to liberate itself from a recession so quickly, and there will also be further signs of weakness in the banks.
Investment legend Warren Buffett only confirmed this caution: It is not yet clear whether Europe is strong enough to do everything for an end to the crisis, he said in a CNBC interview.
That is why it is too early to invest in European government bonds or banks.
Instead, Buffett threw a decades-old principle over the heap and entered the U.S. technology industry.
His investment of more than ten billion dollars in IBM supported the stock price of the traditional group and allowed him to initially list against the trend in the course of trade just under one percent higher.
The paper closed almost unchanged at $187.35.
Buffett paid an average of $170 per piece and now holds 5.5 percent.
The share price of his investment firm Berkshire Hathaway lost 1.3 percent.
Bank of America shares declined significantly more than the market at 2.6 percent.
The house sells almost all of its shares in the China Construction Bank, slashing $6.6 billion.
With the net profit from the business, the Institute wants to boost its capital ratio and thus meet tougher regulatory requirements.
The aircraft manufacturer Boeing increased and thus limited the losses in the Dow.
The stock gained 1.5 percent after the group collected the largest order in its history.
Airline Emirates ordered 50 777-type long-haul machines on Sunday, estimating the value of the order to $18 billion.
Including options on 20 other machines, the volume even amounts to $26 billion.
On the New York Stock Exchange, around 710 million shares were exchanged by the owner.
719 values increased, 2281 declined, and 79 remained unchanged.
At Nasdaq, sales of 1.38 billion shares closed 630 plus, 1913 minus and 82 unchanged.
Intelligent crows spread in cities
In many places, seed-crows are considered "problem birds": but the highly intelligent animals can no longer be driven out of the cities, experts claim.
Some like them, others want to get rid of them very quickly: crows have been part of the cityscape for centuries, but in many municipalities residents complain about the dirt and noise of the animals.
So far, a remedy against the "problem birds" has not been in sight.
Seed crows can no longer be extracted from the cities, experts said at the first crow symposium in East Frisian clay.
There, experts from all over the federal territory advise on possible ways out.
You are looking for alternatives in the cities
Nature conservationists also traced the problems in cities to the land escape of the particularly protected seed herbs: the chemical use in agriculture increasingly destroys the traditional habitats.
Hunting, increasing cultivation and the fall of typical breeding trees made life difficult for birds.
Crows are protected by nature.
Large colonies with more than 600 breeding pairs can be found, among others, in the Westphalian Soest, in the northwest, among others in Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen, as well as in Leer.
There, in 2005 a controversial project on the mass killing of crows in the county had resulted in negative battle lines.
Critics had described the capture of the animals in bird traps and the slaughter with nodules as particularly brutal.
"The normal expulsion, the humiliating, brings nothing," noted the urban and landscape planner Werner Klöver from Leer.
Nests sprayed away with water or trees fell, often have undesirable consequences, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr in Baden-Württemberg.
"The animals are divisive, large colonies split up and spread out in other places."
Embarrassment is only conceivable as an exception to hospitals, retirement homes or schools.
“We have to live with them, we can’t take them away.”
Without the surrounding area, the problem cannot be solved in the cities, Mayor Wolfgang Kellner from Leer said.
A combination of entanglement of animals from sensitive living areas and curling offers is conceivable in order to resettle them in other places.
On the other hand, the psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens called for a completely different way of dealing with the animals: "A pimple on the face we can finally bear most confidently."
Jürgens had co-founded the Ascheberger Kr<0xC3><0xA4>hen-Lehrpfad in Schleswig-Holstein, where signposts inform about the life of the highly intelligent seed cows.
The project has already been accepted by tourists.
Jürgens also had his own opinion on the criticism of the noise of birds: "There is a lot of communication, they have a lot to say."
The intelligence and skill of the animals are legendary: Seed-crows not only use tools to get to a treat, but also produce their tools themselves as tools.
Behavioural researchers at the University of Cambridge recently tested on four seed herbs how far the intelligence of the birds reaches.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to bring down a scaffold with stones in order to reach a moth larva.
Without much training, they determined what size and shape a stone must have in order for the platform to collapse.
In a second attempt, the clever crows then had to solve a more tricky problem.
In a vertical cylinder, the researchers had placed a small bucket with a moth larvae.
With the beak, the birds could not reach their prey.
However, the researchers had laid them wire pieces.
From this, all four animals formed a hook, with the help of which they then fished the bucket at the handle from the tube.
Three of the four seed cows even managed to do so immediately.
Cristiano Ronaldo shoots Portugal at the 2012 European Championships
The hopes of the Bosnians and the Turks for a coup failed.
The favourites Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and Ireland are at the 2012 European Championships.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have released the last tickets to the 2012 European Championship in Poland and Ukraine in the playoffs.
Led by double-successful superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8th, 53rd), Portugal beat Bosnia-Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1) and made the fifth consecutive European Championship appearance perfect after the 0-0 draw.
The Czechs scored a 1-0 (0:0) in the play-off-replay with outsider Montenegro, after the playoffs (2:0) had already been a clear thing.
Croatia won 0-0 against Turkey, Ireland got a loose 1:1 (1:0) against Estonia.
Nani (24th), Helder Postiga (72nd, 82nd) and Miguel Veloso (80th) scored the further goals for Portugal.
Former Wolfsburg Bundesliga professional Zvjezdan Misimovic with a converted trade yard (41st) and captain Emir Spahic (65th) had shortened twice for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic saw the yellow-red card (54th).
Bosnia had already failed Portugal in the play-offs at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.
At the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal got a tailor-made start.
Ronaldo chased a free-kick from around 30 meters for early guided into the meshes.
A good quarter of an hour later, Nani showed his long shot qualities and hit from 25 meters to 2-0.
The Bosnians, who did not take place in the first half of the hour, had their first clear chance by goalkeeper Edin Dzeko.
The ex-Wolfsburger from the English table leader Manchester City put a header on the lower edge of the latte, but the ball did not cross the goal line (33rd).
Jiracek meets for Czech Republic
Subsequently, referee Wolfgang Stark from Ergolding was the focus.
After an attack against Helder Postiga in the Bosnian penalty area, Stark decided on Schwalbe and showed the Portuguese the yellow card (36th).
On the other hand, Stark gave a controversial trade yard after an action by Fabio Coentrao, which Misimovic certainly transformed.
But after the break, the 2004 European vice-champion made it all clear with four hits.
For the Czech Republic, Petr Jiracek also ended the last doubts in the 81st minute.
The 1976 European Championship will be held for the fifth time in a row.
The team of coach Michal Bilek with the Bundesliga legionaries Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1st FC Nürnberg) was also lucky and had to survive a second of horror in the early stages.
Finalist Petr Cech with a reflex at the last moment prevented a possible own gate by Tomas Sivok (9th).
Montenegro had its greatest opportunities when the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic shot in the 40th minute from the rotation of the penalty area border just barely past the gate of Cech.
After the break, the crossbar had to save for the already defeated world-class goalkeeper of the Czechs, again the striker of FC Seoul had withdrawn (50th).
The gate just before the end made it all clear.
Turkey missed the football miracle of Zagreb.
Four days after the 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks in Zagreb did not get beyond a 0-0.
While national coach Guus Hiddink has almost certainly to take his place on the bench of the 2002 World Cup third, the Croatians can look forward to their fourth participation in an European Championship final round.
In front of 31,000 spectators at the Maksimir Stadium, the Turks had almost caught a dream start.
Selcuk Inan hit only the post in the seventh minute with a distance shot, attacker Kazim Kazim could not sink the bouncer in the gate either.
After the horrors, however, Croatia took control more and more.
Even after the break, the Croats did not burn anything.
In addition to Mario Mandzukic from VfL Wolfsburg, who took place for Dortmund’s Ivan Perisic from the 62nd minute, the Bundesliga legionaries Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) were still in use.
Trapattoni goes to the European Championship
In Dublin, the Irish celebrated their first participation in the European Championship since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward led the team of coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who had already made a preliminary decision with the 4-0 victory in the playoff, in the 32nd minute.
Konstantin Vassilyev (57.) was fine for the guests.
Ireland pushed the pace from the start, but had to wait until the 23rd minute before Robbie Keane of Los Angeles Galaxy had the first good chance.
Only at the last moment did the Estonian back team prevent the possible lead hit.
But in the 32nd minute, it was over.
After an unlucky defense from finalist Pavel Londak, Ward was on the spot and pushed the ball to 1-0 over the line.

Hungry Labrador Turns On Cooktop - Apartment Fire
A hungry dog has probably triggered a fire in Brandenburg/Havel.
The Labrador probably jumped on the stove to get food, police said on Friday.
He probably moved the switch and turned on a plate.
Paper on the stove caught fire.
The apartment on the fourth floor of a multi-family house was set on fire on Thursday afternoon.
The dog died of a flue gas poisoning.
Against the 18-year-old tenant, who was not in the apartment during the fire, is determined because of negligent arson.

SAP wants to double the number of employees in China
Europe’s largest software manufacturer, SAP, will invest billions in China in the next few years and will almost double the number of its employees in the country.
By 2015, around two billion dollars (around 1.5 billion euros) will be flowing, the Dax Group said on Tuesday.
“We will create additional research and development facilities and hire employees accordingly,” co-chief executive Bill McDermott announced at a customer fair in Beijing.
The workforce is expected to grow from about 2,500 to 4,500 employees at present.
The number of offices of the world leader in enterprise software will double from five to ten or eleven.
So far, SAP is present in Beijing, Shanghai, Guanzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
Approximately 4,000 of the world’s more than 176,000 SAP customers are located in the boomland.
The growth plans in China are also an important component of Dax Group’s 2015 strategy.
SAP aims to increase sales to 20 billion euros by 2015.
Last year, the Walldorfers had redeemed around 12.5 billion euros.
Currently, the business of the software provider, which employs 55,000 people worldwide, is running almost as rarely before.
SAP has been active in China for 20 years.
“Now we want to expand our activities,” McDermott said.
“Our goal is to promote sustainable growth in China, supported by comprehensive education.”
Mass slaughter on a personal level
Sensitive and generous, Peter Englund’s new book “Beauty and Horrors: A Story of World War I, tells in nineteen fates” begins with a long list of protagonists who go to heart.
Here’s a tip on how to proceed: Cut this page carefully and make it your bookmark.
You will get to know these people very well in Englund’s novelty story, and these main characters will function as your GPS, as a beacon in those few moments when you, like Englund’s men and women, are lost in the fog of war and deprived of your illusions.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which determines the Nobel Prize for Literature.
He has written an unusual book that he does not incorrectly describe as "a work of anti-history."
It contains only a few big names, important contracts or famous battles. There are hardly any ambassadors, furious reporters or discussions about tactics and equipment.
It’s less a book about what happened, he explains, but rather “a book about what it was like”. It’s about “feeling, impressions, experiences and moods”.
"Beauty and horror" almost combined the war experiences of 20 more or less inconspicuous men and women on both sides of the war, from schoolgirls and botanists to mountaineers, doctors, ambulance drivers and office workers.
Some of these people become heroes.
Some become prisoners of war, lose limbs, go crazy or die.
Each of these lives flares up like the votive candles in a church, some are added while others are extinguished.
Englund’s book differs from the usual history books.
It also corrects the idea that the First World War was only the devastating war on the Western Front.
"Beauty and horror" wanders with expert views over other war scenes: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
On the soldiers in this book fall beehives, one celebrates Christmas under the pyramids in Egypt, Tsetsefliegen is an insoluble problem.
This is almost a moving book from the beginning.
The war floods the lives of these people like a natural disaster, like a hurricane Katrina that smells like Kordit.
Imagine you're a woman who's at home with her children, hearing gunfire in the distance. Do you stay or take the escape?
Who's coming at all?
Hardly anyone understands what is happening or why this war is being waged at all.
"Feeling facts," Englund states, "were furnished with conjectures, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares, and rumors."
"Beauty and horror" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German ship's sailor.
Her stories were mainly taken from memories, letters and other already published material.
Their life reports can be frightening or gripping, but they are extremely vivid in Englund’s collection of small moments that are lost in detail.
Many of them act of lack and help themselves.
In the story of a German schoolgirl, he tells: "Replacement, everywhere replacement."
"Replacement coffee, false aluminum, false eraser, paper compounds, wooden buttons."
He tells us more about replacement food in Germany.
He describes "meat made from pressed rice and baked in broiler fat (and last served with a false bone of wood), tobacco made from dried roots and dried potato shells, shoes soaked with wood."
There were, as he noted, "837 registered food substitutes allowed in the production of sausages, 511 registered coffee substitutes."
Some stories are about honor and bravery.
An American recognizes his own urge to ferocity and says about the war: "You feel that, despite everything, this is what was intended for men rather than sitting in the armchair, with the evening leaf or the bestseller and a cigarette and a whisky in his hand, and so to do as if such a facade meant civilization and as if there were no barbarism behind his own strengthened and besieged shirt."
Conversely, a British soldier realizes that he is likely to die and that no one will take note of it or take care of it.
“If you distance yourself from the thought of sacrificing yourself, you want to think that this is happening in front of an audience,” he writes.
Instead, it's as terrible as "a convicted man who was hanged in secret."
Other observations are about the old Europe falling apart and about new types of terror.
“The conflict became increasingly an economic competition,” Englund writes, “a war between factories.”
He captures the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the bestiary of the still young century": "the word turned and ideologically convinced mass murderers in the suit of measure who slaughter while sitting behind a desk."
People behave in an unforeseen way and there is just as frivolous behavior as heroism.
Englund discusses the soldiers who actively tried to infect themselves with a prostitute with a sexually transmitted disease in order to escape the front service.
"The grotesque expression of this can be discovered in the trade with Gonocokken-Eiter, because soldiers bought and lubricated their genitals, hoping to get to the hospital," he writes.
"Those who were truly desperate rubbed him in the eyes, causing them to be blind for the rest of their lives."
In this translation from the Swedish by Peter Graves, Englund’s poetry becomes smooth yet unobtrusive and perfectly adapts to his human task.
In dozens of small scenes, he captures the way the war "uncontrollable forces unleashed in a unique way: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred."
People begin to wonder why their leaders are making them fight.
The best books about the First World War were mostly more falsified like Paul Fussell's "Great War and Modern Memory" or novels like Erich Maria Remarque's "In the West Nothing New" than extensive history books.
Englund’s band joins an unconventional hall of fame.
His book has the most devastating ending of which I have ever read in a nonfiction book.
I'm not gonna give it to you anymore.
But it is as if he had snatched us away with his book this side with the main characters in front of his nose and lit with a match wood.
After an early miscarriage, a minutely planned assault
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them wearing emergency helmets.
They had chosen the night from Monday to Tuesday, because at that time there were hardly any people in Zucotti Park.
The operation was kept secret and only a few high-ranking officials were informed, and everyone else initially believed in participating in an exercise.
Police President Raymond W. Kelly was in the middle of them and his presence underlined the fact that the operation was full of challenges.
The incidents of recent weeks such as the use of pepper spray against protesters, which violates the rules of the department and caused the homeowners an enormous increase in public sympathies, were no longer allowed to repeat themselves.
And so the police action to remove the protesters from Zuccotti Park was carried out after two weeks of planning and training.
Officials had prepared these by observing how occupations were handled in other cities.
A disaster exercise had taken place with a view of Zuccotti on Randall's Island.
Officials reinforced the so-called chaos training - measures to combat terrorism, including the rapid relocation of a large number of police officers - to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training session took place on Monday night on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The order to move into the park came “at the last minute,” said someone familiar with the orders, which spoke of a declaration as a “practice.”
“The few police officers involved in my knowledge didn’t know it was about Zuccotti Park,” said someone who wanted to remain anonymous.
"The only people who knew it was about Zuccotti Park were the high-ranking officials of the resort."
One reason for secrecy was a lesson the city had learned.
On October 14, officials wanted to clear the park, but then retreated when hundreds of protesters came together after they learned of these plans.
Officials from various police units were involved in Tuesday’s operation, including deployment commands from across the city – hundreds of mobile officials, usually deployed in highly criminal neighborhoods.
Mr. Kelly said that during the day many people in and out of the park, almost like commuters, so 1 a.m. at night is a good time to go in.
“It was appropriate to do this when the least number of people in the park are staying,” he said.
Emergency vehicles with Jupiter lights and loudspeakers were ready for departure at Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive near the Manhattan Bridge.
The lights and the pre-recorded messages that erupted from the speakers seemed to intimidate many protesters.
When public officials entered the park in their light blue wind jackets, many protesters simply picked up their belongings and left the place.
Police said that by 1:45 a.m., no tents would be touched to give the protesters time to pack their belongings together.
Other teams of officials were seen gathering in the area to intervene should arrests in the park become necessary.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Paul J. Browne, spokesman for the police president, said this had happened to their own safety.
But many journalists claim that they wanted to stop them from watching the police action in the park, and they said the handling of the officers was very rough.
Mr. Browne said that TV cars on Church Street could have taken photos on the west side of the park.
As the police moved westward through the great confusion of personal belongings of the protesters, including suitcases, artificial turf and bags of clothes, their staff followed the city cleaning, which lifted what had been left behind.
Some protestors who refused to leave were dragged outside, pictures of which appeared on the Internet a short time later.
A main core of protesters occupied position near the camp's kitchen area in the center of the park.
Some established barriers and the police continued their methodical arrests.
About 10 people in the epicenter of the camp tied themselves to their arms.
And two people chained themselves to trees, Mr. Kelly said.
Civil protection officials were called to cut them off.
As Mr Kelly said, no arrests were carried out in the park until about 3:30 a.m.
The evacuation was completed after 75 minutes, according to the police.
Mr. Browne said 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of the arrests came, as he said, due to “indecent conduct and resistance to arrest.”
The most prominent official on the site was Joseph J. Esposito, the head of the department, the highest uniformed official of the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, head of the Department of Criminal Officers, was also there.
Despite his presence, Mr. Kelly "did not lead the operation," as Mr. Browne said.
In case they were to access, a second group of officials waited on the eastern side of Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Street.
In Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and in Pine Street, a block further south, barricades were built.
It was observed that from these locations the police expanded the perimeter around Zuccotti Park.
In one place, it was observed that several officials, many of them with shields, drove people outside.
About 28 people were in the northern area.
Some of the most violent actions of the night took place in the south of the park.
At about 5 a.m. south of Pine Street, a protester jumped onto the roof of a police vehicle and other protesters let the air out of the tire of a police bus.
In one place, the crowd threw a piece of plywood.
In the end, an official and a protester came to the hospital.
The union of supervisors will file a lawsuit against the city for dismissals
The union, which represents hundreds of school caretakers who lost their jobs last month, plans to sue the city on Wednesday, as the dismissals due to their inappropriate influence on the schools that teach poor students are not necessary and discriminatory.
The lawsuit is probably the last possibility that the union, District Council 37, is still open in their efforts to reverse the dismissals.
Sixty-six school helpers, care coordinators and other employees, who were among the worst paid employees in the city and had lost their jobs on 7 October in a chess move, have described the union leader as a political revenge for denying access to a health fund that the working groups were supposed to hold.
This accusation was categorically rejected by the authorities.
At a meeting of the city council last month, Dennis M. Walcott, director of schools, said the layoffs were part of the budget that was passed in June.
A member of the city council shot back and explained to him that in the budget nothing specified that employees would be dismissed from school assistance.
City Council officials 37 said they had and warned the Ministry of Education against a lawsuit, and on Wednesday there will be a press conference formally announcing the filing of the lawsuit before the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
The lawsuit will run Mr. Walcott and the city's Ministry of Education as defendants and count eight dismissed workers as plaintiffs, all of whom are colored or Latin American women, like most of the helpers who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman for the city's Department of Justice, said the city was not facing the lawsuit and thus their individual claims could not be commented on.
According to a New York Times lawsuit, the union has focused on the number of layoffs at schools in the city’s poor neighborhoods to support a lawsuit for unequal treatment, claiming that poor schools had lost more helpers because they were chronically underfunded.
While there were no layoffs on Staten Island and only a few layoffs in the Upper East Side or TriBeCa schools, 17 school helpers in District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, lost and 46 helpers in Districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx were released.
Determining the loss of five out of eight school helpers employed in public school 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the lawsuit states: “This is not a neighborhood of impoverished parents who can organize donations to catch budget cuts.”
P.S.: The budget of the 36th district was cut by 3.26 percent this year, and money was lost when the city changed its calculation method for extra funding for each poor school enrollment.
The union also complains that the heads of high schools were misled by the language in a memo that approved the dismissal of the care coordinators.
The memo used the English word "excess" to describe the action, even though "excess" in the U.S. usually describes the change of a teacher from a school's payroll to a pool of available workers who are paid by the central office.
"Six-six care coordinators were dismissed, not transferred," the complaint says.
Mission ended, Congress ready to agree on Libya
In the end, it looks like Republicans and Democrats in Washington are already agreeing on the uprisings in Libya.
All that was needed was the success of the revolt, the arrest and murder of the longtime dictator Muammar Gaddafi and the cessation of American interference.
On Thursday, the Senate International Relations Committee passed a resolution under which Chairman John Kerry (Massachussetts) along with Senator John McCain (Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Connecticut) will stand, praising Libya for the successful rebellion and the U.S. troops for their "mut."
“This resolution honors the brave people of Libya who have begun rebuilding their country,” Kerry said.
"It is a confirmation of the support of their democratic efforts by two parties."
The language may sound innocent, but so far nothing has been easy in the Libya debate.
This summer, lawmakers from both parties and the White House disputed the wording of a series of resolutions approving or disapproving the role of the U.S. military in NATO’s Libya mission.
In June, Kerry and McCain presented a resolution that approved the limited use of U.S. military forces in Libya.
The law was rejected in the Senate by a broad margin group of both parties and there was no vote.
On the same day, however, this law was passed in the Senate, and the Chamber also passed a decision to cut funds for American operations in Libya.
As a result, the U.S. mission got into a kind of legislative purgatory – with a Congress that was upset enough to criticize Obama’s approach as part of the mission, but not angry enough to finally pull the floor under his feet.
Then the indecision of Congress was overtaken by the events.
Tripoli fell among the Libyan rebels in August and Gaddafi was killed on October 20.
The NATO mission officially ended on October 31.
Now the Senate may be ready to act.
The resolution of the Committee on International Relations "congratulates the people of Libya for their tremendous courage and their extraordinary endurance in their self-liberation" and "praises the men and women of the U.S. military and their coalition partners who support military operations to protect the people of Libya for their extraordinary courage and professionalism."
The resolution also reaffirms "the United States' national interests in a successful and irrevocable transition from Libya to democracy."
Will the new measures be fully supported by the Foreign Relations Board or will they split the legislatures, as the law of June has done?
The last version comes against the opposition of Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indianapolis), the top Republican of the committee.
Lugar's spokesman said on Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new law.
According to the Capitol, it is up to the Senate to vote this week on a constitutional amendment calling for a balanced budget, a top priority in almost every congressional legislature period of Republicans and some Democrats.
The measures under the leadership of Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia) will be the first constitutional amendment to the budget or any other area that is currently being voted in the Senate or Congress.
Other legislators have so far unsuccessfully tried to put their changes to the vote, although they have often tried enough.
Goodlatte's amendment is just one of 68 constitutional amendments that have been presented to this Congress and cover a whole range of topics.
Some are double – the same law was passed to both Congress and the Senate – others differ only slightly from each other.
There are at least 15 versions of the balance sheet change in the Senate alone and another dozen that would "control federal spending".
Some of the laws are also identical, but they give their clients – especially beginners among Republicans who want to polish up their resumes – the opportunity to boast that they have “written” such a measure.
The Budget Control Act, passed in August, requires both the Senate and Congress to vote on a change in the budget balance.
In March, 58 senators voted for a non-binding resolution that supports the idea of such a change.
Beyond the budget, some members want to limit the number of provisions that members of Congress can put forward, while Republican José E. Serrano (New York) wants to lift the limit to two terms of office of the President.
Republican Jesse L. Jackson (Illinois) has proposed a number of changes that, among other things, guarantee the right to good education and health care.
A change that prohibits marriage among same-sex couples, as well as a change that prohibits the burning of flags, is an ever-recurring template.
Some legislators also want to allow the repeal of federal laws if two-thirds of states reject them.
As eager as the members propose changes, they move even faster than in previous years.
In the 111th Congress, legislators presented 77 such amendments. in the 110th Congress 66.
The pace fades compared to that of the early 1990s, in which members regularly proposed more than 150 changes every two years, according to the figures provided by the Senate Library.
But they weren’t much more successful than they are today.
The last amendment to be added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992, but was actually proposed to Congress as early as 1789.
"Succeeded but not defeated," Giffords said in the first television interview after the assassination.
Ten months after an armed man shot at her from a nearby distance during an election event in Tucson, Republican Gabrielle Gifffords (Arizona) appeared on national television Monday night, singing alone to the Broadway play "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and saying the desire to recover was greater than the one to return to Congress.
When she appeared with Diane Sawyer in the ABC news "20/20", she ran for words and needed help walking.
The show showed the severe slow recovery from the damage that the bullet, which split her skull, pierced the left side of her brain and crossed her head from front to back.
Three months ago, she unexpectedly returned to Congress to triumphantly cast her vote on the debt brake.
In her first television interview after the January assassination, in which six people were killed and 13 injured, Gifford smiled, laughed and sang - describing her recovery as "difficult".
When Sawyer asked her how she felt, Gifford (41): "Very well."
The interview with Gifford and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a one-hour “20/20” special recorded shortly before the release of the couple’s new book, “Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope.”
The special has been tracking Gifford's recovery since the January 8 assassination.
In videos that Kelly recorded in the first weeks, you can see them in the hospital bed, with bald shaved head and a long scarf over the forehead.
She can only lift one or two fingers if her husband encourages her to do so.
Months later, Giffords sits in a wheelchair while therapists show her how to perform simple movements.
A nod with his head.
A twitching with the lips.
And then, their first words: "What."
After a few days, Giffords whispers another word: "Toast". She wants her breakfast changed.
Videos played in the ABC show show show that music played an important role in Giffords' recovery: One sees Congressman singing along with therapists to Cyndi Lauper's "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" and to Tom Petty's "Free Fallin'".
In an interview with Sawyer, Giffords, who spends two hours of therapy a day, said she can’t remember the day of the attack.
Her husband said that on March 12, he read an article in a daily newspaper about the assassination when she interrupted him and asked for the first time about the six people who had been killed during the assassination.
The alleged gunman, Jared Lee Loughner, sits in a Missouri prison and is forcibly treated medically while waiting for his trial.
"Many people have died," Giffords Sawyer said.
"Hard, hard, hard."
In the course of recovering his wife, Kelly told Sawyer, she said, "I was hit."
"So, I'd say, 'Gabby, you weren't defeated,'" Kelly said.
You were just hit.
And you're going to get through this and you're going to recover and you're going to come back stronger than ever before.
Troops are more likely to feel compassion than respect
The event was a Wall Street gala that raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, frustration and loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, pilots and marines gathered around him.
The crowd in black smokes stood up and applauded.
“The soldiers and soldiers were seen as heroes,” said David Saltzman, who organized the fundraiser in the spring.
A high-ranking military officer at the gala, who was watched by the chief of staff and then-president, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops differently.
“They were introduced like orphans,” the officer wrote in an email.
I'm sure the organizers meant it well.
I know that.
But it wasn't respect, really not. It was pity.
The sharp conflicting impressions illustrate the heavy relationship between the military and the most distant, sometimes admiring American public.
The troops are overflowing with praise for their victims.
But praise has its price, say servants.
The public is increasingly acting as if people in uniform were suffering.
“We were by no means a victim,” said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and will soon go to Afghanistan.
"But apparently the only way to support is to push us into the role of unhappy souls."
The issue is extremely sensitive to military leaders who do not want to appear ungrateful or in dispute with the public they serve.
They also realized that the anger of returning troops in the last years of the Vietnam War was far worse.
As a result, conversations of compassion in breastfeeding and private between war veterans take place.
After his two sons returned from fighting with the Marines, Colonel A.D. Mark Cancian warned them that people outside the military world could see their service from two different perspectives.
Some would look at them with a sense of awe as they defeated rebels and traveled to exotic places.
Others would wonder if a “inspiring, violent veteran is hiding under the surface,” said Cancian, who had fought in Iraq and took over a raised state post in Washington after his return.
During his job search, he said, he felt that some of the surveyors subtly asked if he was able to withstand the pressure of a demanding post in Washington right after his return from the fight.
“When you talk about your ministry, you have to stop the negative impressions,” Cancian told his sons.
The military’s lack of ease is partly rooted in the Americans’ lack of interest in the war.
Services on the battlefield are rarely taken out as praise by a country that has little experience with the military and sees little benefit in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
“We as a nation no longer value military heroism as it was absolutely usual in World War II,” said Lieutenant General David Barno a.D., who commanded U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the praise of politicians and the public is largely focused on the suffering of a servant.
Troops find recognition for the number of attacks they have endured, the number of friends they have lost or for the severity of their injuries.
Military faces growing pressure to crack down on rape
This week, an important hearing will decide whether 28 women and men will be charged with non-intervention in a rape before the military court.
Should this not happen, hundreds of plaintiffs are ready for the next hearing.
Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and pregnant on the 11th week when she was raped by a soldier's colleague at night.
It was October 2008 and she just returned to her barracks in Miramar north of San Diego from dinner with a friend when she met a male colleague carrying a 12 pack of beer.
He asked her if he could accompany her to her room for a drink.
“My alarm bells went on,” Lyman said.
But the Texan wiped aside her concerns.
I thought, "Well, he's 19.
“He’s from Texas,” he said.
"I wish I'd listened to my gut feeling."
A few minutes after going to Lyman’s room, the man stood behind her, pushed her down and raped her, she claims.
This week, on November 18, Lyman and 27 other current and former military employees are anxiously awaiting a trial with a historic hearing in Arlington, Virginia, in which it is decided whether a lawsuit they have brought against former defense minister Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will be admitted to court.
The lawsuit alleges that Gates and Rumsfeld have not acted against the widespread rape within the military and in violation of the constitutional rights of the soldiers.
In February, Susan Burke, a Washington, D.C. attorney, filed the lawsuit initially comprised 17 plaintiffs, who, however, rose to 28 in the following months: 25 women and three men, all claiming they were raped or sexually abused by soldier colleagues, and that the military failed to investigate, convict, or provide a proper case-law after the alleged assault.
Burke says she is pursuing the top military leadership as the problem begins there.
“The military is hierarchical,” she says.
"Who are the individuals who are in the position to exterminate the culture retribution of the? The leadership."
Burke also says she has contacted nearly 400 more survivors since February, many of whom could be part of future lawsuits.
Your strategy: Instead of all plaintiffs putting their eggs in a basket, so to speak, they will, if necessary, file many more lawsuits to maintain the pressure.
The Defense Department’s defense team, led by Attorney General Neil MacBride, has filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit.
The files of the court, which are available to Newsweek, elaborate on the defense strategy, primarily that the military cannot be charged by current or former soldiers for injuries to which it has occurred in the armed forces.
Due to a law of the Supreme Court of 1950, the so-called Feres doctrine, the government is not liable for injuries inflicted on active service soldiers.
“The alleged damage occurred during the plaintiffs’ military service,” the document states.
The Ministry of Defense refuses any comment on this story.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
If women are still not allowed to serve in combat, the distinction lies only in the name: modern wars rarely have clear fronts.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of soldiers are playing increasingly important roles, especially in contact with local women in the war zones.
The result: between these two wars, 150 soldiers died, two thirds of them in combat.
It’s time for the military to be modernized, Burke says.
And she is not alone in her struggle: three more lawsuits besides her are pending.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans’ Legal Services Clinic is preparing a lawsuit against the four major military academies for allegedly promoting a feminist atmosphere.
Independently, the non-profit Vietnam Veterans of America collects a lawsuit against the military, focusing on the diagnosis of “personality disorder” that rape victims received in order to release them from the service – a common practice according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati of the Service Women’s Action Network, a human rights group.
In December, her group filed a lawsuit against the Veterans Administration (i.e. the administration of war veterans) accusing her of discriminatory practices in dealing with performance claims for persons who stated that they had been sexually abused in the service.
Nine laws were presented to Congress independently by a mix of senators and representatives of both parties, providing a number of clues.
In 2010, according to the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office (the Office for Prevention and Reporting of Sexual Abuse), 3,158 sexual abuses were reported by the Department of Defense.
But most abuses are not reported at all, and according to the Pentagon’s own estimate, this figure takes into account about 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 cases to which it comes per year.
The report, published in March, also examines the law enforcement rates: in 2010, 20 percent of cases recorded in the military were brought to justice, only half as many as in civil law.
The plaintiffs in Burke’s case describe their attacks as only the first of a series of dreams.
In Lyman's case, she reported the alleged rape of the military police less than an hour after the assault.
That night, she says, she was asked 11 times to tell the details of her rape of a number of police officers, doctors, and commanders.
She had a rape set and her attacker's blood, which came from a cut on his arm, was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was heard by a judge, during which she was asked about the sex she had before the assault with her boyfriend.
Six persons testified as character witnesses in the name of the alleged perpetrator, who was ultimately acquitted.
“I still remember the day the verdict was read,” Lyman says.
"I thought the labors would come in, and I ran out of the courtroom screaming."
"They brought me to the psychiatric department and I remember when I came out again, I said to my commander, 'This was not his procedure.' That was my procedure."
Lyman was asked to visit a military psychiatrist who ultimately diagnosed a personality disorder and declared her incapacitated.
In January 2010, she was released dishonorably, so she received no support.
Whether the lawsuit that Lyman and the other plaintiffs filed is progressing is pure speculation, says John Turley, a professor of law at George Washington University Law School.
Still, he notes, "In my opinion, they should move forward."
What stands between them and a verdict is this doctrine that has been criticized since it was first questioned.
I am a critic of the Feres doctrine.
The military is lagging behind for a decade, because they do not have the same incentive and the same deterrent that a liability entails.
He adds, "The chances are against them... but it's important for them to try it."
These things will only change when good people are ready to fight.
If the hearing does not follow their path, Burke, the plaintiff’s lawyer, will begin with her hundreds of other plaintiffs for future cases.
“We will continue to fight the military in this regard until reforms come about,” she says.
Or until we die, whichever comes first.
Walls Have Eyes: How Researchers Watch You on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was just one of many guys who sent her anti-immigration opinion online.
On Monday, Breivik, who confessed to having committed a shooting in Norway in July, in which 77 people were killed, had his first public hearing in court.
Although Breivik may have acted alone, he is by far not alone in cyberspace: he has spent a lot of time in front of his computer, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists who support far-right groups on social networks.
After the tragedy of this summer, researchers wanted to find out more about these people.
But how do you find them?
It's easy - you just have to log in to Facebook.
“We found that it wasn’t hard to come to them,” says Jamie Bartlett, the lead author of a recent report by the British idea factory DEMOS on digital populism in Europe.
Facebook’s hiding of personal data is so encyclopedic, Bartlett says, that researchers simply need to use the site’s advertising tool to accurately determine their desired demographic data with scientific accuracy — just as marketers have been doing for years.
Bartlett’s team found half a million fans of far-right groups across Europe and then invited them with add-ons, but instead of linking to a new band or a new diet product, the Adds invited users to a survey asking about their educational status, their attitude towards violence, and the assessment of their own future.
Thanks to Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to survey more than 10,000 supporters of 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries – without even having to leave their office once.
“It’s a fairly new research method,” Bartlett says.
Some of the results hardly surprise. Online supporters of far-right groups are mostly young, male and angry about immigration.
But in a kind of surprising twist, “those who combine their online activism with an offline activism are more reasonable, democratic, and less violent than those who sit behind their computer screens.”
DEMO’s work is just one example of how Facebook becomes a new hot tool in the hands of scientists.
Idea factories, medical researchers and political scientists use the site to study everything from health issues to societal trends such as in "likes", text messages and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding on average three content per day, Facebook’s “Data Supernova” generates a research boom that has increased the number of scientific works with the name of this page in the title by nearly 800% over the last five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is the fact that through this site you can study people that you don’t usually reach with his clipboard on the street.
"If you tried to interview people of the British National Party in the past, it was very difficult to identify them."
“They had to inform the party first and it would never have allowed them to enter,” Bartlett said.
“On Facebook, it all falls away – you go straight to them.”
Others say the site provides a way to detect and resolve social health issues.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues found that students who discussed their full-blown on Facebook tended significantly more to problem drinking than students who remained silent on this topic.
Moreno suggests that like-minded students, such as housing consultants, monitor the site and help a student if they post too many status updates.
“You can’t solve a problem if you didn’t recognize it,” said Dimitri Christakis, Morenos co-author and head of Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Children’s Research Institute in Seattle, Washington Post.
"We have found a way to identify vulnerable children who otherwise would not have been found."
Facebook is also constantly tapping on the data of its own population.
The site’s data team has compiled statistics on relationship status and Valentine’s Day, voter turnout in the 2010 interim elections, and a National Happiness Index (using primarily data that only Facebook has access to – masters of digital freedom have long known that the site should make its large data base accessible to others for research purposes).
However, Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they want it or not. In order to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, you allow the site to share your own personal data.
But what if Facebook users become part of a survey they don’t even know anything about?
While researchers have strict guidelines on how to collect their data offline, everything is allowed online.
“I don’t think many users have even thought about the fact that a researcher could study their profiles,” says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, to a 2006 study in which he investigated the public pages of students on Facebook.
"As far as she's concerned, it was just about her and her friends."
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even offline, there is no guarantee that a research participant is absolutely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know how much of the information is true in a user profile and in posts.
“What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things,” Selwyn says.
Therefore, despite his years as a technology researcher, Selwyn thinks that a clipboard and a pen are still the best research tools anyone can use.
“There is no substitute for going out into the real world and talking to real people,” he says.
"Social research has to take care of the social - and a lot of social life is still taking place offline."
"Cold and Inhuman": Anders Behring Breivik appears in public court for the first time
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who ran two rounds of amok in which 77 people were killed in Norway this summer, described himself in his first appearance before a public court in Oslo as a "resistance" fighter.
“I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and a temple knight of Norway,” he said in front of a courtroom with more than 500 people.
"I object to the court because you have received your mandate from organizations that support hate ideology and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I recognize the laws, but I do not admit guilt."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue as he "did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform on which he can express his views."
For the same reason, he refused Breivik, who brought a pre-written speech, permission to address the relatives of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered that Breivik police remain in custody for another 12 weeks, with no access to the media for four weeks, and that the authorities will closely monitor all visits and all correspondence over eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and relatives of the victims took part in the hearing.
Some came in the hope of seeing Breivik in the eyes, others wanted confirmation that he was behind the castle and bars.
Everyone took part with the goal that everything is going to be closed down.
“I thought he was cold and inhuman,” a survivor of Utoya told Norwegian broadcaster NRK.
"It was unpleasant, but for me it goes a bit further after I've seen and heard the suspect."
Breivik wore a dark suit and a blue tie and was calm and professional throughout the hearing, looking into the eyes of journalists and survivors as he entered and left the building.
Despite Breivik's bizarre hint that he was part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge concluded that he was not mentally ill and said there was no evidence that he had accomplices.
It may seem to some that the July 22 attacks were apparently the work of a single extremist and not that of a group of radicals.
But does this automatically ease the grief and confusion that an entire nation still feels?
"I wish he looked like a monster, but he doesn't," the victim's family said.
"It would be so much easier if he did it."
7 Lessons From Interview With The Deceased Steve Jobs Shown In A Theater This Week
After the death of Steve Jobs on October 5, some compared him to Henry Ford, highlighting the engineering genius as a great modern inventor.
But what Apple fans may find most revealing in the recently rediscovered job interview, which was dusted off in key markets this week before special film screenings, is how much this creative mind understood business processes and workflows.
He was certainly a designer, a dreamer, and self-proclaimed hippie, but he was also an meticulous organizer who eagerly crafted diagrams—a man who believed that many managing directors suffer from “a disease of thinking,” “that a really great idea constitutes 90 percent of the work... [but] there is an enormous amount of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product.”
In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the television series "Triumph of the Fachidiots" about the break-up of the personal computer, and he spent more than an hour sitting with jobs in which they conducted one of the rare, in-depth conversations.
By that time, it had been 10 years since Jobs had been pushed out of Apple, and he was already working hard on his new computer company NeXT, looking forward to the widespread adoption of the Internet.
While a small part of Cringley’s interview was used in specialist idioms, he says that the copy templates of the interview were missing in delivery.
It was only after Jobs’ death that a full VHS copy was discovered in the director’s garage.
This slightly revised footage forms the basis for the 68-minute film "Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview", which will be released this Wednesday and Thursday at the Landmark Theatre.
For someone who is known to hate in-depth interviews, Jobs here seems surprisingly eager to explain his technological philosophies and business strategies.
And incredibly thoughtful.
Over the course of the interview, there are four times longer breaks between question and answer - 10 to 15 seconds of reflection, in which jobs clearly weigh their thoughts and strive for accuracy.
There are also moments when Jobs’ perfectionism comes to light when he seemingly impatiently responds to Cringely’s questions and urges him to respond more quickly to issues or side actions of greater importance.
Before the era of Pixar, iPod or iPhone recorded, the Lost Interview somehow seems incredibly far-sighted when Jobs evaluates what other companies think is right or wrong and represents his own vision for the future of the computer.
It’s one thing to read posthumous appreciations of Jobs’ career, but seeing Jobs here as the eager dreamer who is on the jump to greatness is something completely different, original and inspiring.
He has a vision of how things can and should be.
Shortly after doing all this, he left and did it.
A quick look at seven remarkable sequences of the Lost Interview:
How he learned to run a company:
"During all the years in business, I always ask, 'Why are you doing things?' and the answer you always get is, 'Oh, that's how it's done.'
No one knows why he's doing what he's doing.
That's what I found.
Jobs continues his efforts to streamline accounting at Apple.
Astonishing how costs were recorded—mostly starting with “standard costs” that were quoted on mere assumption and then adjusted with “difference”—he developed an automated factory that ensured that business costs could be determined to the very smallest extent.
How the Pope became obsolete:
Jobs tells of the "Blue Box" he built with Steve Wozniak, a device that could sneak into the phone company and lead long-distance conversations in vain.
Much has already been written about the device, but Job’s enthusiasm when he describes the Blue Box as an act of self-empowerment is contagious.
He describes how Wozniak and he would test the box by using a toll-based phone, making a call, and then connecting from one AT&T network to another while looping through as many satellites as possible.
"We sent stuff a half dozen times around the globe and when you grumbled on the phone, it came out a minute later on the phone next door," Jobs said.
“We were young and we learned that we can build something ourselves that can control trillions of dollars in infrastructure around the world.”
We both didn’t know much, but we were able to build this little thing that can control a giant thing, that was an incredible lesson and I don’t think there would be Apple without it.
Jobs continues to tell of a glorious strike that Wozniak and he almost pulled off when they called via Blue Box in the Vatican in the middle of the night and wanted to talk to the Pope while they were as good as they could imitate Henry Kissinger.
Since several members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to speak with the American diplomat, the two had to laugh before the Pope himself came to the phone.
How he fell in love with technology (and called unprepared Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12, when he was looking for spare parts to build a frequency counter, he searched for Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called him.
Shortly after her 20-minute phone call, Jobs received a part-time job at Hewlett-Packard for the summer.
"That had a remarkable impact on me. It was the only company I had seen at that age and it shaped my views on what a company was and how well it treated its employees."
Later, Jobs became one of HP’s employees who visited the company’s research labs in Palo Alto, where he saw “the first desktop computer ever made.”
He was as big as a suitcase, had a small screen with Braunscher tube and I fell in love with him.
I would climb up at HP as a teenager and hang on to this machine and write programs for them.
How to improve innovation:
Several times in the interview, Jobs talks about how to spontaneously invent new products.
Early in his career, when he built some boards, he was asked by a customer to assemble the whole computer.
He worked with a payment period of only 30 days and had to think through both the assembly and delivery of the finished equipment.
Later at Apple, he recalls the problems he had when developing a computer mouse:
"I remember striking arguments... they yelled at me that it would take five years [to build a mouse that would cost $300] and I got up, went out and found a manufacturer."
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could have built for $15, which was incredibly credible.
About large companies that are slowing down:
Long before he brought Apple back to life, Jobs anticipated the ways in which so many industrial giants stumbled upon their visions and lost control of their stocks.
"Do we say you're working at IBM or Xerox, so you're making a better copy or printer, now and then?"
You own the stock monopoly, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, so [are it such people] who ultimately run the companies and the product that pushes people out of decision making.
The product genius that has led to this monopoly position is eradicated by the people who have no concept of good products vs. bad products - craftsmanship is necessary.
This is what happened with Xerox...
Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry.
You could have been ten times bigger if Microsoft could have been in the 1990s.
You caught the defeat of victory.
About innovation as an art form:
“There’s a lot of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product... when you develop that great idea, it changes and grows.”
You learn a lot about your intricacies.
You have to make votes, certain things you can’t, but electrons, glass, robots, factories.
You have to remember 5000 things, these concepts, and they all bring together...
Ultimately, it goes out to the taste, it goes out to the fact that one tries to deal with the best stuff that humans have created, and then tries to bring these things together into what one does.
Picasso said that good artists copy, steal great artists.
We are always shameless in stealing great ideas.
Part of what made Macintosh great was that the people who worked there were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians who happened to be the best computer scientists in the world.
Had it not been the computer industry, they would create fantastic things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas dine with opponents of health laws as court accepts case
On the day the Supreme Court gathered behind closed doors to discuss the politically-dividing question of whether to listen to a challenge to President Obama’s health laws, two of its judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, attended a dinner sponsored by the law firm that the case will be represented in court.
The incident took place last Thursday, when all nine judges met for a meeting to discuss the petitions for review.
One of the cases to be dealt with was a lawsuit brought by 26 states against the far-reaching health care reform passed last year by Congress, a law that became a buzzword among conservative activists across the United States.
In fact, a 5 1/2-hour basic discussion is expected in March, the result of which is likely to spur the 2012 presidential campaign, which will be in full swing at the time the court decision is announced.
The lawyer who will stand trial and claim that the law is to be tipped will probably be Paul Clement, once Attorney General under the government of George W. Bush.
Clement’s law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies that supported the Federalist Society’s annual dinner, an old-fashioned group dedicated to defending conservative legal principles.
Another company that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the business associations, the National Federation of Independent Business, which contests the law.
Another sponsor was pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., which is enormously involved in the outcome of the process.
The dinner took place a few hours after the court had consulted on the case in a Washington hotel.
Among other things, he served with Mitch McConnell, the Republican faction leader in the Senate, and a declared opponent of health reform.
The guests of the dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
This is nothing new: The two judges have been attending federalist society events for years.
This does not violate moral rules.
In fact, judges are exempt from the Code of Conduct, which regulates the actions of the lower federal judges.
If they did, they would probably fall under principle 4c of the Code, which states: "A judge may participate in benefit events of law closer to and other organizations, with the judge not being a speaker, guest of honor or, according to the program, a guest of such events."
Nevertheless, the extreme proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two of the law firms related to the case, as well as to a company with a massive financial interest in it, was sufficient to alert moral and government activists.
"This astonishing breach of morality and the contradiction to the Code punishes the lawsuits of some judges lying, the court adheres to the same rules that apply to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, president of the Common Cause, a civil rights movement in the United States.
"The judges won and dined during a beneficiency event with lawyers with floating lawsuits in court."
Their appearance and support of a fundraising event for this event undermine any claim to impartiality and are not acceptable.
Scalia and Thomas show little regard for critics who say they would mix court matters too easily with groups that can be guided by the agenda, such as Federalist society.
And Thomas' wife Ginni is a well-known conservative activist.
On the other hand, the Conservatives claim that it is Judge Elena Kagan who has a moral problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was an attorney general under the Obama administration when the first lawsuits came to trial in the first instance.
Her critics urged Kagan to withdraw herself from hearing the case for bias because she was too committed to defending the law to be unbiased.
Kagan does not make institutions to do this.
Boeing takes record $18 trillion contract to land
Emirates orders 50 Boeing 777 twin-engined aircraft with an option for 20 more aircraft.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliners to Oman Air, a business worth more than $1 trillion.
It’s really a rare news that a company gets an order over 50 pieces of its products.
But it’s a big deal if the company is the aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. and the list price for these 50 aircraft in total is at a record sum of $18 trillion.
Equally unusual is Boeing’s client: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In a forecast released on Monday, the Chicago-based company estimates that Middle East airlines will need $2,520 worth $450 trillion in the next 20 years.
Boeing announced its largest commercial aircraft order of all time this weekend, measured by the value of the order: 50 double-aisle Boeing 777 jets.
The hammer order came from the airline Emirates from Dubai.
The airline also has, Boeing announced in 2011 at the Dubai Aviation Show, an option to purchase 20 more aircraft that will raise the total list price to $26 trillion.
On Monday, according to Boeing Oman Air, six Boeing 787-8s, the so-called Dreamliner, were ordered, which greatly improved passenger fuel consumption and comfort.
The list price for six of these aircraft is more than $1 trillion.
“This is absolutely positive for Boeing,” said Neal Dihora, Morningstar stock exchange expert.
"The quality of these special customers is very high."
Many of the Middle East’s airlines are owned by oil producing countries.
So not only do they have the money to pay for the planes, but an increase in oil prices that usually harms airlines, as this is one of their biggest cost points, is not so harmful, as the country deserves a higher oil price.
This is important because they tend to cancel or postpone aircraft orders less than other airlines as oil prices rise, Dihora said.
“They have natural security,” he said.
The Emirates order reaffirms Boeing’s leadership in the space aircraft market and helps keep Airbus’ competitor SAS in check, which is attacking the dominant position with the A350.
Boeing’s victory at the aviation show comes four months after Airbus announced it would postpone the launch of the largest A350, competing directly with the 777-300ER.
The introduction was postponed to gain more confidence after customers demanded a higher payload and range.
Boeing shares rose 1.5% to $67.94.
Mexican president's sister loses election in Michoacan
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that drug dealer opponents Fausto Vallejo of the PRI supported in the race around the governor's post.
President Felipe Calderon's sister apparently lost her application for Governor of Muchoacan's office during the violent state elections, claiming on Monday that drug dealers had influenced the race in favor of one of her opponents.
Following the preliminary results, Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Party of the Revolution, the PRI, won the race for the governorship of the Western State.
“The intervention of organized crime throughout the electoral process and especially yesterday is alarming, not only for Michoacan, but for the whole country,” Calderon said in a radio interview one day after Sunday’s election.
"They threatened our candidates, our employees in the polls ... they've occupied election booths, built road blockades ... and hired people to vote [for the PRI]."
The PRI ruled for seven decades in Mexico until they lost the presidency in 2000.
But they strive for a return and victory in Michoacan is an important step in these efforts.
The PRI is hoping for a victory in the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have narrowly beaten Claderon, who had led in the polls before the election day.
Calderon, a candidate for her brother’s conservative Partido Acci<0xC3><0xB3>n Nacional PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the candidate of the left-wing Democratic Revolutionary Party PRD, the current incumbent governor, came in third place, a heavy defeat for the split and luckless left-wing leadership for the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to acknowledge the preliminary results.
Vallejo, former mayor of the capital of Morelia, denies links to drug traffickers and urges the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacan has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and amphetamines.
It is the homeland of President Calderon and he has chosen Michoacan to launch a military-led offensive against drug traffickers in December 2006.
Violence is still ongoing.
A PAN mayor was killed a week before the election during an election event for Luisa Maria Calderon and numerous candidates have left the local elections for fear.
For the PRI, a victory strengthens the party, no matter how disgusting the elections in Michoacan appear.
The man who will probably represent the PRI in the race for the presidential office is Enrique Pena Nieto, who congratulated Vallejo from Washington and said, "I think this victory will give us a bold look at next year."
ADB urges Asia to help save the eurozone
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) calls on India and China to help save the eurozone in its severe debt crisis to prevent a long-term downward trend that will slow the growth of Asia’s economy.
Rajat Nag, Managing Director of ADB based in Manila, said the two fastest growing economic nations in the world must do “everything in their power” to accelerate the recovery of the currency bloc either through the International Monetary Fund or through direct mutual agreements.
He warned against the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China) that look “unfortunately” at the difficulties in Europe, saying that financial support for European leadership and European resources through Asia helps prevent a long-term collapse of the global economy.
“We’re all in the same boat.”
“So anyone who can help Europe out of this crisis is helpful,” he told the Financial Times in an interview on the edge of the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
“Asia may be protected to some extent, but it is not immune.”
"If China and India can help, then by all means."
Europe’s monetary union has been in a serious debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italy’s interest costs have risen dangerously and the prime ministers have resigned from both Italy and Greece.
The emerging severe debt crisis in Europe is fuelling fears that the global economy could plunge into recession and led to calls that the leading emerging economies would have to unite to support the eurozone.
Mr Nag predicted that any support from Asia will be channelled by the IMF, but said that mutual agreements – such as the purchase of bonds from the EU bailout fund, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) – offered greater bargaining power to European partners in Asia.
Anand Sharma, the Indian Minister of Trade, said that “India will do everything in its power” to help the eurozone, as its own economy is now suffering from the declining exports and the drying out of foreign capital flows.
“No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and turbulent,” he said.
“We are facing major challenges and we need to maintain a high level of growth.”
“It’s not an option, it’s an assignment, because where else do we find work for our millions of young men and women.”
Others argue that developing economies like India have no reason to help the rich Europeans when they themselves face major economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University, said it would be politically very difficult to sell the 1.2 trillion people in India help for Europe, more than 800 million of whom are living out of $2 or even less a day.
“Sometimes they’ll find out that the Greeks retire at 50 and spend holidays on the beach, and then you’ll have a problem,” he said.
Lee Howell, Managing Director of the World Economic Forum, similarly asked why India’s reserves should be used to keep the numerous and well-paid employees in public service in Greece, with jobs in poorly managed, loss-making facilities such as the railway.
Mr Nag said that the crises in the eurozone will have "significant dominoes" across Asia.
ADB’s forecast of economic growth of 7.5 percent in Asia for 2011 is now threatening “the risk of gradation” due to the impending danger from Europe.
He said vulnerable emerging markets would have to create “crisis plans” to protect themselves from a downward trend and a significant capital outflow of their wordscapes.
Urgent warnings from the Pentagon about possible cuts in defense
Defense Minister Leon Panetta fired at Congress on Monday when he warned that automatic budget cuts would undetectedly weaken national security, triggering a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon's halls to the war scenes in Afghanistan and the civilian flow bands.
The Pentagon is already contemplating cuts of $450 trillion over the next decade, but now fears that further cuts of $600 trillion or more will be needed if Congress cannot reach a conclusion in spending.
"The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the ministry," Panetta wrote in a letter to Republican Senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said a failure of Congress in reaching a budget agreement, which will lead to a so-called seizure, would result in 23% general cuts as well as a halt to numerous new projects.
“Such a high cut, carried out in such an unconsidered manner, would make most of our ship and construction projects unworkable — you can’t buy three quarters of a ship or a building — and seriously harm other modernisation efforts,” Panetta wrote to the senators.
"We would also be forced to involuntarily separate ourselves from a large part of our civilian staff and, as the reduction would be implemented so quickly, we would certainly have to leave civilians to achieve the goal."
"These changes would destroy the faith of those who maintain our military and seriously damage our alert readiness."
The cuts were ultimately going to hit the combat troops,” Panetta said.
"While the wartime contingents in the anti-terrorist struggle are not directly affected by the seizure, the serious intervention in the basic budget would adversely affect the war effort," Panetta warned.
“Personal settings have been shortened, which would lead to delays in the settings and the hiring oversight that support the war.”
"The salaries of the staff would be cut, leading to late payments to wartime traders and the legal as well as political support would be disrupted."
The two senators responded to Panetta 10 days ago and asked for further details regarding the potential impact of the automatic cuts on the defense ministry.
"The consequences of confiscation of the Department of Defense would prompt a rapid decline of the United States as the world's leading military force."
"We are vehemently opposed to this draconian act," the senators said in a joint statement on Monday afternoon when they published Panetta's letter.
“This is a result we can’t live with, and it’s certainly not something that should be imposed on us.”
"The seizure is a threat to the national security interests of the United States and their entry should not be allowed."
Whether Panetta’s letter and the senator’s new warnings will increase the pressure on a compromise in the budget or increase demands to exclude the Pentagon from cuts remains to be seen.
Panetta has increasingly bluntly expressed the potential cuts, although he has many years of experience with the budget in Congress and the White House before he came to the top of the Pentagon, and knows he is facing tough decisions.
At a press conference last week, the defense minister painted a gloomy picture of what might be ahead – a military with a shell, but without a core.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a brigade without ammunition."
"It's an Air Force squadron without sufficiently trained pilots."
"It's a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without sufficiently trained soldiers capable of fulfilling the mission," Panetta said in his opening address at the Pentagon.
“It’s a force that lacks morale and alertness and is unable to accommodate it with potential opponents.”
“She makes you really angry.”
In an appendix to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta cited new details on how reductions "create significant operational risks: delays in times of crisis, conflicts and disasters, serious restrictions on our global operational and operational capability, leading to an unacceptable risk in future war operations."
And Panetta said some of the biggest defense projects of the deletion could fall victim, including those that have already been tested and are already in the early planning phase.
This list also includes the F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a planned new bomber, the next generation of ballistic submarines, the new Littoral Combat Ship and the new ground combat vehicle that the Army and Navy need to replace the Humvee.
If we stopped the further development and testing of the F35, it would save up to $80 trillion in the next 10 years, but proponents say it is an important next step towards upgrading so that potential dangers can be banished by China and other opponents.
How to Detect a Lie
A look at the current headlines shows how questionable and widespread deception and lies are in daily life.
The Republican presidential candidate, Herman Cain, is working to master the allegations of sexual harassment on the part of several women, both sides accusing each other of lying.
Penn State's leadership is accused of perjury, allegedly withholding reports that a retired football coach sexually abused boys.
Last week, an open microphone was heard when French President Nikolas Sarkozy told US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
Lies destroy careers and shake countries.
New York Congressman and Internet exhibitionist Anthony Weidner made a fool of himself when he circulated denials that were very quickly refuted by incontrovertible evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards is accused of campaign funding violations related to the cover-up of an extramarital affair.
And then, of course, no one who has experienced it forgets the media circus that President Bill Clinton triggered when he lied to the Oval Office about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky during his second term in office.
Stories about school cheating and college exams are widespread.
There have been incidents where teachers have given their students the exam responses so that they can stand up for themselves in their performance reviews.
Mentors who should teach the opposite send a message that lying and cheating are okay.
How much deception do we experience?
As studies prove, we lie between 10 and 200 times every day.
However, many of these lies are considered to be emergency lies.
Another study shows that strangers lie to each other three times during the first 10 minutes of a meeting.
Identifying lies or "discovering lies" is one that is important for every person to learn, both for personal and professional reasons.
Far from a social game such as Sharades, where the goal is to call "Have You!", the defamation of deception is a serious field of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades at prestigious universities that conducted far-reaching research projects, especially in the fields of psychology and physiology.
One result of the research is that most of the ancient myths about lying have been debunked.
Lies look you in the eyes.
They stutter, stammer, blush, and do not always falter.
However, it should not be concluded that these liars are difficult to uncover and denigrate.
An experienced liar can penetrate to the truth by learning something about the structure of the claim, the fine facial expressions, about questioning and timing.
I have spent several years examining the scientific results of the extensive and steadily growing field of defrosting, and it is clear that defrosting a deception is a modern skill that is easy to learn and helps us in our complex world, especially if the hiring or questioning of persons or negotiations or administration is part of our own professional responsibilities.
Good liars are very good at estimating other people, awakening their interest and mastering their own emotions, and intuitively feeling how they are perceived by others.
Thanks to research, we know that extroverted people are more likely to lie than introverted people, that men are more likely to "self-centered" lies than women whose lies are more "orienting to others" - usually, they want to protect the feelings of others - that married people are less likely to lie to their partners than unmarried people (but the lies they tell are usually "fat").
We also know that if a person was exposed as an evildoer, others feel less guilty of lying to that person.
How do you know if someone is lying?
First, by observing the normal behavior of that person.
This is called "baselining", the starting position.
It provides a reference point for later evaluation of changes.
Observe the attitude, laughter, voice quality of their subject.
You should know better when someone is usually constantly tripping with their foot, so they don’t falsely accuse him of tripping with their foot during a meeting.
Then pay attention to accumulations of conspicuous verbal and non-verbal behaviors.
Consider these accumulations as alarm bells that scream, not as evidence of defrosting.
People who deceive may become more obstinate when they try to remember their story. Maybe their feet point towards the door or they lean towards the exit, change their position in a significant way, or show a "relaxation after the hiring conversation", this deep, relaxing exhalation and change in attitude when all the hard questions are over.
Askers often falsely signal that a hiring interview is over, just to keep an eye out for this relaxation after the hiring interview.
Also, pay attention to the language of your subject.
Scott Peterson’s slipper is famous when he used the past form when he claimed that his dead wife was still alive and triggered a national search for her.
Deceiving people can also use a distancing language: "I didn't have a sexual relationship with this woman... Miss Lewinsky" or if you repeat a tricky question in general.
The most common verbal signs are subtle.
Some people use "qualifying language" when answering a tricky question: "Well... to tell you the truth ... as far as I know ... to the best of my knowledge and conscience."
This makes the answer more perceptive than factual, which often makes the alarm bells scream.
There is no magic tool for defrosting lies, but you can learn skills that allow you to defrost.
Thanks to these skills, anyone less often can become a victim of fraud, both in private and professional life.
Controversial plan of an oil pipeline is revised after threat by delayed U.S. approval
A few days after the Obama administration threatened to delay the approval of a planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico, which angered the unions and at the same time reassured environmentalists, the pipeline-building company is trying to re-plan the project to return to normal.
TransCanada said on Monday evening that the planned pipeline will be diverted from the ecologically sensitive area of the Sandhills in Nebraska.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the Nebraska parliament building.
Alex Pourbax of TransCanada said the company remains confident that the pipeline will eventually be approved, albeit with a different course.
This came after an announcement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs last week, after which a decision on federal approval for the project would be postponed until the new possible course was reviewed, which would avoid the area of the Sandhills in Nebraska as well as the Ogallala aquifer, a large underwater supply.
“This is a real step forward,” Republican Lee Terry, a Nebraska Republican, told Fox News.
The new environmental review ordered by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs may delay a decision until 2013, after the elections next year, even though officials deny that politicians were involved in the decision.
Obama said last week in a written statement that the decision was a task of the State Department and said he would support it.
The 1700-mile pipeline was connecting Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would pump 700,000 barrels of oil a day from the province of Alberta to the refineries in Texas.
For this purpose, the pipeline would have to cross six states.
Environmentalists hate them, but labor markets love them because they appreciate that the pipeline creates 20,000 jobs.
But the Nebraska lawmakers, who are against the plan, weigh down the laws to force a departure from the Sandhills region and the Ogallala aquifer, a major source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current study on the impact on the environment of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has found that the project had little impact on the environment, but the source of the energy industry says that the Ministry’s chief investigator has requested a separate probe of the review process, which focuses on two issues.
One is whether a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was an adviser to Hillary Clinton in 2008, is in a conflict of interest.
The other is whether a company commissioned to conduct the original study was an inappropriate choice because it is connected to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle charged with allegedly forcing a toddler to vomit out of fear
A New York family claims that the disco diva Patti LaBelle in the lobby of her Manhattan building had suffered a bout of intoxication that would have scared her little daughter so much that she surrendered to fear.
The tirade of the "Lady Marmalade" singer made the 18-month-old Genevieve Monk so afraid that she was suffering from "personality changes, sleep disturbance" and "enhanced fear of strangers," her family told the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
It was on November 10 last year that stage worker Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanna, a kindergarten teacher, and Genevieve wanted to set off for a family trip.
While Kevin Monk picked up the car, Roseanna Monk went with her luggage and Genevieve on her arm into the lobby in her Riverside Boulevard building.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped near the door and dropped her daughter off for a moment.
“Someone came up behind me and said, ‘Do you know what your daughter is doing right now?’ I said, ‘Yes,’ and went to take her back on her arm,” she said.
LaBelle warned the pregnant woman furiously.
“She said in an aggressive tone, ‘You shouldn’t drop your daughter near the door,’” said Roseanna Monk.
“I told her, ‘I don’t care what you say or think.’
She got angry and started to scold - she used the F-word and the A-word and got very loud...
She had a bottle of water in her hand and started to tip water out of the bottle on me.
She said Genevieve had become hysterical.
"I said to this woman, 'See what you did to my daughter,'" the child's mother said.
LaBelle rushed to the mother, who still carried Genevieve on her arm, and had to be held back by her escort and dragged to a waiting car, Roseanna Monk said.
The baby cried so much that it had to surrender, she said.
Later, the LaBelle family requested an apology in writing, but received no reply.
LaBelle’s lawyer and representative did not respond to calls asking for an opinion.
The lawsuit is for an unspecified damages, but the family lawyer, Sam Davis, said he will not charge a fee and plan the family to donate the money they get to child cancer care.
“We want Patti LaBelle to take responsibility for her behavior,” Davis said.
"This kind of behavior is absolutely unacceptable, especially when it is revealed to a kindergartener who is carrying an 18-month-old baby on his arm."
Climatic adversity slowed down the economy
In the first year that Mario L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Valdez is in government, unemployment and undeclared work increased in Sinaloa, while foreign investment declined and the economy stagnated.
2011 will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloas. It is the first year that Mario L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Valdez, who calls himself the initiator of change and fueled great hopes about economic growth, is on the government. However, due to the climatic difficulties, growth cannot be the talk of growth, but, on the contrary, the main economic indicators deteriorated.
The low temperatures in February not only caused losses in the millions in agriculture, but also placed tight limits on the growth of the state economy and caused a general decline in economic activity by 3.6 percent in the first quarter of this year. This is mainly due to the historical decline in agricultural development by 31.16 percent, which has had a slowing effect on other economic sectors.
According to a report published by the Consejo Mexicano para el Desarrollo Rural Sustentable (the Mexican Council for Sustainable Agricultural Development) on the impact of the frost, 582,000 hectares of agricultural land were damaged, of which 78.03 percent were completely destroyed and the remaining 21.07 percent were partly affected, mainly by vegetable, maize and chickpea crops.
The decline in economic activity by November has led to a steady rise in unemployment in the Mexican state. The Instituto Nacional de Estad<0xC3><0xAD>stica y Geograf<0xC3><0xAD>a saw a rapid increase in unemployment in the first quarter of the year, as from January to March 55,053 inhabitants of Sinaloas had no employment, which corresponds to 4.53 percent of the labour force. In the second quarter, the unemployment rate rose to 5.28 percent and from July to 6.19 percent.
Lower liquidity
The unemployment rate in Sinaloa in the year goes back to several factors: the economist Gerardo L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Cervantes, Dean of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the University of Aut<0xC3><0xB3>noma (UAS), comments that the policy of public institutions indirectly explains the growing unemployment.
“What we are currently observing is an increase in unemployment that has to do with several factors, including liquidity losses on the market as a result of the mid-term cuts passed by legislation to combat money laundering in Congress, because for those who are prohibited from raising dollars, it is not easy to let them work for themselves, invest them, or use for anything else,” he explained.
Migration Stopped
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Cervantes pointed out that growing unemployment is also a demographic factor.
"The number of people who leave the country looking for work abroad, especially in the United States, has declined. This is due on the one hand to the entry problems and on the other hand because it is difficult to find work there too. These people stay here and look for work here, which increases unemployment," he says.
Black work
The analysis of the labour market in Sinaloa is even more serious considering the high proportion of undeclared work, which, according to INEGI, comprises 60.38 per cent of the employees working in the country without depositing into the social security funds.
Unemployment and undeclared work are the lowest wages, the lowest in all of Mexico, according to the statistics of the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (Mexican Social Insurance Institution) and the Secretar<0xC3><0xAD>a del Trabajo y Previsi<0xC3><0xB3>n Social (Government of Labour and Social Care in Mexico).
The average monthly income of workers in Sinaloa was 5352 pesos by September; this is much less than the general government average, which is 7375 pesos.
Decline of ADI
In addition to the decline in economic activity and rising unemployment, the highest decline in foreign direct investment (ADI) in the last ten years was recorded in 2011, according to Secretar<0xC3><0xAD>a de Econom<0xC3><0xAD>a (State Economic Authority), the ADI was $630,597 from January to June, which is a staggering 87.74% compared to the $5,143,312 in the same period last year.
The Secretar<0xC3><0xAD>a de Desarrollo Econ<0xC3><0xB3>mico del Gobierno (Government Authority for Economic Development) recorded a total investment of 17,280 000 pesos in 2011, mainly from companies in the tertiary sector.
The Debt
In the face of the economic crisis, the state government applied for a loan of 3 000 000 000 pesos at the National Congress in July, which should be invested in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities in order to reactivate the economy. The state congress approved an amount of 200 600 000 pesos, but no positive effects of the debt on any of the industries in the country could be detected by November.
Reactions
For the representatives of entrepreneurship, the first year of Mario L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Valdé’s government’s incapacity made clear.
Miguel Loredo L<0xC3><0xB3>pez, Chairman of the C<0xC3><0xA1>mara Nacional de la Industria de la Transformaci<0xC3><0xB3>n (State Chamber of Manufacturing Industry in Mexico), said that in 2011 no efforts were made to harmonise the views of the different sectors, including the state government.
"The economic activity in Sinaloa was really very poor this year. It has to be worked hard to regain the terrain lost this year and in 2012 we have to make a double effort. The efforts of all and especially the progress of the already well-conceived government team have not been sufficiently coordinated," he said.
Slow economic development
Loredo L<0xC3><0xB3>pez stated that events such as the frost at the beginning of the year made the country’s economic development difficult and slowed down.
"The low economic flow is the result of several events, including frost. One of the most important impacts is a slowed economy that is not moving enough to create an economic dynamic that could create an acceptable flow of processes, products and services, which is why we will close the year far below our expectations," he said.
Redefining vocation
Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, chairman of the Confederaci<0xC3><0xB3>n Patronal de la Rep<0xC3><0xBA>blica Mexicana (Business Association of Mexico) in Sinaloa, said that the state must be encouraged to engage in more dynamic productive activities.
"In general, we have observed that work has been done. We believe it is necessary to develop a long-term program to redefine the country's economic vocation and line, because it is important to activate all material and human resources Sinaloas," he said.
There is a lot to do
Coparmex’s chairman stressed the importance of developing a future perspective that will guide the government’s efforts in better ways.
“In general, I would say that the government has achieved good results in various areas. Economic development has progressed, but it is important to develop a long-term program,” he explained.
He stressed that the current state power had made progress with the government.
“There are areas where you can say that the government has acted more comprehensively, and what I can say is that work has been done and that the government is aware that there is still a lot of work ahead of it,” he said.
Arrest for 8 kg of marijuana
Five years in prison and 100 days in prison, a Navolato resident was convicted of possession of eight kilos of marijuana.
The state prosecutor’s office of the Republic announced that the drug retailer was Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, who was punished for a crime against public health – here the property of marijuana destined for trade.
According to the AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I file, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by Mexican military forces on June 7, 2010, while monitoring the road Cipriano Valdez, opposite the No. 80 guard station in the town of El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug dealer drove in a white van in which he kept a black bag in a box in the car and in the passenger seat a small backpack in which the military found eight kilos and 23 grams of marijuana.
For this reason, the seized goods were handed over to the judge of the district and the punished person is still in the prison.
Debts for construction work
The social buildings provided for migrants in the programmes H<0xC3><0xA1>bitat, Rescate de Espacios P<0xC3><0xBA>blicos and 3x1 run the risk of not being completed due to lack of funds or only with great delay, Miguel <0xC3><0x81>ngel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Miranda said.
The head of the municipal authority for social development explained that, although the construction programs are already advanced, they are now in danger because the state government has not paid the funds it is entitled to, which exceed 11 million pesos for the three programs.
He said the total investment in these three programmes was almost 50 million pesos, of which 25 per cent fell to the state, and so far only the Federaci<0xC3><0xB3>n and the municipality have contributed to the construction work, which is why a delay in construction is to be expected.
“They have to contribute 12 million, and even though the year is coming to an end, they haven’t given us a penny, and even though they had to pay us a portion already in July,” he said. “In order not to be too late, we’ve already started the construction work, and they’re already far advanced, but we need the money.”
He pointed out that under the government of Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s Aguilar Padilla, the state had failed to meet its obligations, which is why the municipality had to take out a loan of 7 million at the beginning of its reign, which corresponds to the amount that the central government would have had to pay.
"We had already done so in the last legislative period, because the state did not have sufficient economic resources. The programmes continued and this year we had to get the funds that the state had not raised to participate in these programmes," he explained.
Although the State authorities are obliged to pay these funds, he commented that the Minister for Administration and Finance, , was requested to speed up administrative work and to pay the outstanding share as soon as possible.
“Almost 12 million people have to contribute, and even though the year is coming to an end, they haven’t given us a penny.”
The court approves the transition to digital television in Mexico for 2015
The conversion of analog to digital signals has been one of the most important changes worldwide in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) rejected the constitutional lawsuits filed by the Senate and the House of Representatives against the presidential decree, and by virtue of which the switch from analog to digital signals from 2021 to 2015, due to the lack of eight votes required to challenge the law.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Supreme Court, Juan Silva Meza, felt that President Felipe Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n had not exceeded his powers when he issued the Legislative Decree detailing the switch to terrestrial digital television.
With this decision, the constitutional dispute initiated by the Senate was rejected, as it did not receive the required qualified majority of eight votes, so that the court could decide on the constitutionality or the non-constitutionality, thus the law remains in force.
In the project for the lawsuit prepared by the Minister Olga S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Cordero, it was proposed to declare the Legislative Decree unconstitutional, since for the regulations relating to radio and television, the Comisi<0xC3><0xB3>n Federal de Telecomunicaciones (Cofetel) (Federal Commission for Telecommunications in Mexico) would be in charge, which is why the Legislative Decree upholds the Hierarchical Principles and the Legislative Decree.
Only Zald<0xC3><0xAD>var, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Cordero voted for the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies filed constitutional complaints against the Legislative Decree. After the adoption of the lawsuits, the Minister S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Cordero no longer applied the Legislative Decree and discontinued all activities for the establishment of digital transmission.
The Council of Ministers also rejected the action submitted by the Chamber of Deputies without entering into the debate on the project for which Minister S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Cordero was also responsible.
In his contribution, the Prime Minister stated that he did not agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the country government is not allowed to regulate the measures to be taken by the public administration with general rules.
"I also do not believe that if this were to be done, the independence of the regulatory body would be impaired", she also recalled that for the planning of strategic policy areas, such as the telecommunications sector, the central government is responsible for constitutional reasons, because this leads to state affairs.
Replacing analog signals with digital is one of the most important changes that have taken place in recent years around the world, and it brings about better use of the radioelectric spectrum, increased quality of the signal and more channels.
The postponement of the transition, she said, was a postponement of the use of digitization, which was a decision in the public interest that not only had technical aspects, "because it encompassed economic, social, political and security aspects."
These matters, they stressed, "required the action of the entire system, according to the principle of economic management by the state, they included a group of features that put the Constitution in the hands of the central government."
She recalled that many countries around the world had already implemented the digital transformation, even though they had highly specialized facilities.
It cannot be concluded that the government would intervene in the competences of Congress by issuing the contested bill, because the laws passed by the legislature would be complied with," she said.
The possibility of counting the ballots in Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n individually is considered
According to PREP, the difference between first and second place in the election of the governor is almost 27 percent, with 879 votes out of a total of 6074 not yet counted.
The possibility of individual counting of the ballots is a reality this year in the elections in Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n, because according to the data issued by the Programa de Resultados Electoral Preliminaries (PREP), the difference between first and second place in the governorial elections is almost 27 percent, with 879 votes out of a total of 6074 not yet counted.
In this sense, the President of the Consejo General del Instituto Electoral de Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n (IEM), Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a de los <0xC3><0x81>ngeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that just last November, the polling station had adopted a series of rules on the harmonisation of local regulations with the reforms of the states in electoral matters.
It should be remembered that Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n had not adapted his political constitution, election law, or law on electoral justice to the reforms passed by Congress, so that they had not entered into force in this round of elections.
On November 9, the Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) ruled on the constitutional complaint filed by the local legislature and judged the State Commissioner’s vote on the constitutional reforms as “invalid and unlawful” as he did not have the right to “decid or veto it”.
In an interview with Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a de los <0xC3><0x81>ngeles Llanderal, Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a de los <0xC3><0x81>ngeles Llanderal explained that, thanks to the adoption of the guidelines by the Consejo General del IEM, there is now a possibility that the local electoral authority can partially or completely count the ballots.
Under the following conditions, the votes contained in one or more electoral packages may be partially counted. The results in the minutes do not agree; the minutes on the counting and calculating of votes do not exist by file or it is not owned by the chairman of the electoral committee or there are obvious errors or changes in the minutes.
In addition, the total count of the fully completed ballots can be made if there is a difference between the alleged winner and the one in second place, which is equal to or less than one percent, provided that at the beginning of the meeting there is an explicit request from the party or coalition chairman, who is the second of the aforementioned candidates.
The vote count may also be taken in its entirety if, upon completion of the regular calculation, it is found that the difference between the alleged winner and the candidate in second place is equal to or less than one percent, provided that there is an explicit request from a representative of the party whose candidate has become second, in which case the election packages that were suspended for a partial count would be excluded.
It is worth noting that the elections in Morelia are in the same situation where, according to PREP, the difference between first and second place is almost 0.16 percent, although the votes of 129 out of a total of 923 electoral protocols have not yet been counted.
His Last Will
His ashes will be scattered across the Zapalinamé mountains, the family confirms.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés crashed this Sunday evening on Saltillo, his birthplace. On Monday, the show of the dead and a mass of the dead took place.
According to family members, the last will of the lieutenant colonel was that his ashes would be scattered over the Zapalinamé Mountains.
After an honor, the Bacio Cortés family, along with the others, returned to the capital of Coahuila on a plane of the Mexican Air Force in the event of the accident and attended the ceremony in Campo Marte.
At noon, the ash of the lieutenant colonel landed on the mourning hall, which is located on Boulevard Nazario Ortiz Garza, and where the family and friends came to.
At 5.30 p.m., his remains were examined at the Saltillo Institute of Technology, which was caused by his former classmates from the technical high school and his American football team, which Felipe Bacio belonged to during his preparation for the high school.
"He wanted to return to Saltillo and spread his ashes over the Zapalinamé mountain range, which he had always said to his family and friends," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, the pilot's sister.
From her point of view, the lieutenant colonel had fulfilled all his dreams and she believes that he had stood in the fullness of his life. "He was a successful man, extraordinary as a father and as a son, a loving brother and he always stood up for his family."
Felipe Bacio Cortés left Saltillo very young to enter Zapop<0xC3><0xA1>n Air Force School, Jalisco.
Some could not believe it because they thought it would even make him dizzy on a truck, yet he always tried to realize his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto D<0xC3><0xA1>vila Bacio remembered him as a good person. "He had hardly arrived in Saltillo, and already the whole family wanted to welcome him, as on the occasion when he brought Martha Sahag<0xC3><0xBA>n to Saltillo."
The young man remembers that even at the age of seven he had gone to Zapop<0xC3><0xA1>n to graduate his family member, so he knows that his uncle died when he did what he liked best: an airplane.
A Last Farewell
The Lieutenant-Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Bacio Cortés, under the leadership of the Governor Jorge Torres L<0xC3><0xB3>pez, was honored by the people and the government, the Mexican Army of the Sixth Military Area, the Mexican Air Force, school leaders and students of the Saltillo Technological Education Institute, where he studied in 1985 and excelled at both studies and sports.
Bacio Cortés died a few days ago when the helicopter he flew, in which the Secretary of State José Francisco Blake Mora and six other persons from the same authority also sat, crashed.
At 6.05 p.m., Bacio Cortés, a resident of Saltillo, arrived to be handed over to members of the Mexican Air Force, led by Major Jaime Martinez, on the forecourt of the barracks, where his family members, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina, his mother, siblings and others, were waiting for him.
The abandoned bodies were found on a plot at Cadereyta NL
A few hours before the discovery, military members presented to the media eleven people who had been arrested in the same town in connection with the organized crime.
Three men were found murdered by shots in different parts of the body and a mercy shot in an abandoned finca in the village of Caderyta Jiménez, Nuevo Le<0xC3><0xB3>n.
The event had taken place at mile 1.5 of the rural road from Caderyta to Santiago at the height of the municipality of El Castillo.
Several transients saw that the door of the country house, surrounded by a beige-brown wall, rose barbarously across the river.
When they looked into the house, they found about three meters further inside the bodies of three people, which they immediately reported to the competent authorities.
One was wearing a yellow T-shirt and dark pants, without shoes; next to him was another one dressed in a white top.
Nearly a meter away was the body of another person with red T-shirt and blue pants.
All three were on the stomach.
According to the information obtained locally, the three persons must have been murdered in another place, since no cartridge sleeves were found.
On the wall of the country house can be read inscriptions that one organized gang of criminals writes to another, as well as several entrances in the wall and door were found.
11 people arrested in Cadereyta
The Secretar<0xC3><0xAD>a de la Defensa Nacional presented 11 people, including a minor who was part of a criminal gang mainly in the town of Caderyta, associated with kidnappings, murder, halconeo (human-hunting) and clandestine funerals.
According to the information made public, on November 11, eight people were arrested in the Los Alveros settlement and one prisoner was released.
Three properties and a cell phone were secured, and the detainees confirmed to be members of the Los Zetas criminal group.
On November 12, at 6 a.m., military personnel found a car without license plates with two occupants on their watchdog in the village of Rancho Viejo in Cadereyta.
During the inspection of the car, the military found a long weapon, a charger and 18 cartridges.
Later, on 13 November at 2 p.m., one of her accomplices was arrested in the municipality of La Frauda, who tried to escape when the military saw them.
They are charged with clandestine funerals in the towns of General Ter<0xC3><0xA1>n, China and Caderyta.
On Wednesday, the formation of the new Italian government
The Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to introduce to him the new government that is to face the crisis that Italy has led to the brink of economic collapse.
The Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to introduce to him the new government that is to face the crisis that Italy has led to the brink of economic collapse.
A statement from the presidential palace announced that Monti, appointed on Sunday, would meet with the president, Giorgio Napolitano, on Wednesday to confirm the formation of the government.
It is assumed that he will present a cabinet composed mostly of technocrats, although it is not yet clear when the new Prime Minister will take office.
Monti said he would present to the President the results of the talks with the political parties on the formation of government.
“I want to reaffirm my absolute confidence in our country’s ability to cope with these difficult times,” the former EU Commissioner told reporters.
Monti did not explicitly confirm the formation of the government, but his comments show that the obstacles have been overcome.
The "frame is now well-stucked," he added.
Monti has managed to form a government in less than three days, which is much less time than normal, while Italy is fighting a political and financial crisis that has driven the cost of debt to an unbearable level.
The new government, led by former EU Commissioner Monti, must adopt a tough austerity package called for by Europoliticians to regain the strained confidence in Italy.
The rapid pressure on Monti was further exacerbated by the fluctuating market situation in which Italian government bonds were charged 7% interest for 10 years, which is equivalent to the situation where Greece and Ireland were forced to apply for the European bailout.
Emma Marcegaglia, president of the Italian industry association Confindustria, told the press after a meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government in every possible way."
We believe that this government is the last chance for Italy to emerge from this emergency.
Montis’ chances of success were greatly increased by the support of the PDL party of Silvio Berlusconi, who had to resign on Saturday as a result of the crisis.
"We believe that the efforts of Professor Monti are intended to produce good results," said Angelino Alfano, secretary of the middle-right party.
The support of the PDL, the largest party in Italy, is essential, because so far many of its members have spoken out against a majority of technocrats who are currently forming Monti.
Support from Parliament
The new government of Monti needs strong parliamentary support to implement the likely unpopular austerity measures.
Resistance to his efforts or delaying the reforms could once again lead to a devastating attack on financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks, with its indication that a failure of Montis is a disaster, also exerts pressure.
On Monday, Monti began his debates with political parties, trade unions and business associations, as well as with youth and women’s organisations.
The session will be closed on Tuesday evening.
Monti was appointed this Sunday by Napolitano, who, in response to the crisis, set in motion an extremely rapid change of government.
After a brief respite towards the end of last week, when it became known that Berlusconi would resign, as a result of the uncertainty about the success of the new Prime Minister, the cost of Italian government bonds once again reached critical limits.
A rescue of Italy with a national debt of 1.8 trillion euros would be too much for the current EU rescue screen.
Monti said his government must last until the next elections, which are expected to be held in 2013, despite the predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement the reforms, instead of preferring the elections.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the major parties insist that this should consist only of technicians, a reference to their concerns in view of the procedure imposed by the pressure of the financial markets.
Political sources point out that the mutual distrust and disagreements between the parties complicate the inclusion of people from political life.
Spaniards have more opportunities to play than the Ticos
Of the 22 players called from Spain, ten have over 50 international games on the hump.
On the Costa Rica side, only one of the 22 callers has 50 games behind them.
A huge difference for Costa Rica when the 22 players from both countries are compared for the friendly match, which takes place today at 3.05 p.m. in the National Stadium of San José.
While the world and European champions, the number one on FIFA’s monthly ranking, can look back on a considerable number of Class A picks, the three-color team only features defending player Michael Umana as the only one with over 50 international games.
He reached that number last Friday with the match against Panama (0-2) in Rommel Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez.
The Spanish players who play in the Liga de las Estrellas (Star League) and influential clubs of the Premier League of England have every year the opportunity to participate in numerous home games (Liga and Cup championships) as well as high-ranking European Cups such as the Champions League.
In addition, the experience with the Spanish Furie in complicated elimination matches at the Eurocup and the football world championships.
The Tico footballers, on the other hand, have few international matches as part of the Concacaf, which is on the FIFA rankings at the very bottom.
We will see how the Spanish team draws their last record: the goalkeeper Iker Casillas, who reached a par with the former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta on the last Saturday against England (Lower 0-1 in London) with 126 foreign games.
Casillas will play today against the three-color team and Spain a new record of 127 international games.
Xavi Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez, player of Barcelona Football Club, owns 106.
Casillas and Xavi even received recognition from UEFA last week, along with others from the Iberian team who had reached the magical number 100: the quoted Zubizarreta with 126 and the middle striker of Schalke, Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez, with 102.
The number 100 is also approaching Carles Puyol with 97 games.
He follows Xabi Alonso with 91, Fernando Torres with 90, David Villa and Sergio Ramos both with 81, Andrés Iniesta with 62, Cesc F<0xC3><0xA1>bregas with 61 and David Silva with 53.
From the sides of the Ticos and close to Michael Umana are the left-hand side striker J<0xC3><0xBA>nior D<0xC3><0xAD>az with 48 games and the striker Bryan Ruiz with 45.
From there, only five came on over 30 games: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez with 36 and José Luis L<0xC3><0xB3>pez with 35.
The ones with the fewest games.
Less than 30 matches are played by Spanish team Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Arbeloa (31) and Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l Albiol (31).
From the side of the national team come on less than 30 games Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest doesn’t even approach the 20’s.
While Nacho Moral has only four games and Jordi Alba has two, in Costa Rica V<0xC3><0xAD>ctor Bol<0xC3><0xAD>var only one and <0xC3><0x93>lman Vargas and Edder Nelson have not made their debut yet.
The historic goalkeeper of Spain is David Villa with 50 hits, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz scored the most goals with nine, two more than Carlos Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
The quintet included Costa Rica in its tour to celebrate its 20th anniversary
"Playing in Costa Rica is a dream come true"
In the exclusive conversation with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam says the band is prepared to give one of their best concerts next Sunday at the National Stadium.
They were expected for more than 20 years, but the band assured them that they would make a dream come true when they play in Costa Rica.
The bassist and co-founder of the group, Jeff Ament, who gave Viva an exclusive interview from Brazil last week.
The band is in the South American part of their tour to celebrate their 20th anniversary and on Sunday, the 20th, they make their only stop in Central America.
On this day they will perform at the National Stadium from 7.30 p.m. along with the band The X from Los Angeles and Las Robertas from Costa Rica.
You can read an excerpt from the conversation, the full transcript of which can be found in the online edition of La Naci<0xC3><0xB3>n.
For your Costa Rican fans, a dream come true when Pearl Jam is playing in Costa Rica: Are you aware of what that means for your fans?
Playing in Costa Rica is a dream come true for us.
This is just the second time we’ve played in South and Central America, and so far it’s been great.
I have only been to Costa Rica once for a vacation. It is such a beautiful country that we will definitely stay there for a few days.
It is exciting for us to bring our music there.
I ask you this because the fans of the band are completely devoted, they experience the days before the concert more intensely.
What do you say to your most enthusiastic fans?
Thank you for standing by our side all these years.
We took almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica. Thank you for waiting so long and we are sorry to have taken so long to get here.
Some people even think that your concert will be the biggest show of the year.
Doesn’t that put a bit of pressure on your visit?
Some of the greatest shows we’ve done in the last 21 years have taken place in the last two weeks.
We played on a few huge shows in Sao Paulo and we hope they made us fit for this concert in Costa Rica.
We really want to play there.
We love this country, we like to surf and love the jungle, and Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you get to know Costa Rica and its waves for surfing?
Many of our friends are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo, where the waves are simply unimaginable.
My friends have always gone surfing to Costa Rica and Nicaragua. Together with Mexico, these are excellent areas for surfing. In this way, about people who love surfing, we have learned about it.
With a view of the tour you have offered huge shows with many songs.
What plans do you have for the event in Costa Rica?
Since we’ve never played there, we don’t set any limits.
We will try to give the best possible show with many different songs. We want to play a few songs from each album and offer our fans a good and versatile repertoire.
You never repeat your repertoire.
Why?
I think that's partly because we have nine records and can play over 120 songs, and each one likes a different song, so the decision we're going to play isn't easy.
If we include two or three songs that we haven’t played in a long time, we can maintain our concentration better and they surprise us because they remind us the reasons why we liked these songs, otherwise they could be forgotten.
That makes the show more interesting for us and I think, therefore, also for the audience.
With this tour, you will celebrate your twenty-year history.
When you look back, is it hard for you to believe in your success?
Yeah, totally.
First of all, I don’t think any of us ever imagined playing in a great rock band, even for over 20 years, which seems like a dream.
We also continue to rely on this blessing and find it great to be able to make music together even now.
We like it and are excited to create music.
We are lucky to be able to drive to the places of the world that we have always wanted to visit.
Things couldn't stand better.
What did it mean for you to have actively participated in the birth of the grunge?
It has always been an honor to be part of this group of great bands.
We are good friends with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising and quite unusual when a movement emerges from a group of friends.
Occasionally, a band emerges from a city, but it is already unusual if five or ten groups come from the same city at the same time.
We are proud of it and feel honored to be part of the Seattle Group.
Sometimes we still play together.
Last year we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and in Canada with Mudhoney and we saw Soundgarden on their tour. We are still happy to be friends with all of them and we are honored to be part of this upcoming Seattle sound.
It’s also very unusual for a band like yours to stay with the same musicians for so long.
Yes, four of us have been playing together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago. This alone is much more time than many bands survive.
First of all, I think we all appreciate being alive and also we care about each other.
We are all close friends, which is why musical paths have opened up that give everyone the freedom to experiment.
One trusts the other and his music, and we couldn't be better off.
Your relationship with glory has not always been easy, but you have always been able to do what you wanted thanks to your success.
How do you find a balance?
The way we have grown has made it easier for us to find a balance.
We make sure not to be on tour too often, because it’s too easy to miss out on this game with huge crowds who love your music.
As long as you remember that people have come because of the music, it reminds you that you have to pay attention to the music and what it has created without being obsessed with being a famous rock star.
What memories do you have of your other project Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote very good songs and at first it was great.
We were a band for three years that had never released a record until the death of Andy (Andrew Woods).
We were disappointed to have taken so long. We are still good friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who set up the band with us. When I hear a song or see photos, I think about what an incredible man Andy was and how he made me laugh. It was always a pleasure to go to work, laugh together and talk about music.
He was an extraordinary person and we miss him.
The domestic band Las Robertas are responsible for opening the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know her works, especially Eddie Vedder, and the band have therefore chosen for the opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos from several groups and this band liked us best. That is why we are curious to see what Las Robertas can offer live. That will be exciting.
Why do you always change the text of Yellow Ledbetter when you play live?
This is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), I have no idea.
He sings it, and I think he sings the first thing that comes to mind.
Who influenced you as a bassist?
Of so many+
One of the first things I think about is Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many that I could talk all afternoon about the bassists I like.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep the grunge alive, even though it is no longer a fashion phenomenon?
I think we all don’t feel very connected with the word grunge.
When I think about it, the bands I mentioned before, such as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the others that came up at the same time, are still important today, I think that’s great because it’s worth listening to this music and bands like Mudhoney are now making better music than ever before.
At first her music was darker, now she is more positive.
Why?
That’s interesting, because I think there are a few songs on the new album that might seem a bit light-hearted, but there are also other songs like The End or Just Breathe that are classified as very dark songs, although they also have something positive in them.
Both of them came to me with tears when I heard Ed playing them, they're very dark songs.
I believe that as you get older and something traumatic has happened in your life – for example, if you lose a family member or a friend – that affects your artistic creation and your music and these two songs clearly embody that for me.
But I also think that you can be a happy person and still make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori returned to hospital for medical examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was admitted to a public hospital on Tuesday to investigate the muscle loss of his legs, his family doctor informed.
The 72-year-old Fujimori, who is serving 25 years in prison for violating human rights during his reign (1990-2000), has several illnesses, including tongue cancer, which operates four times and is under control.
Alejandro Aguinaga, a member of Congress and his personal doctor, told television that Fujimori would be examined for three days at the Peruvian hospital Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Neopl<0xC3><0xA1>sicas to determine the reason for his pain and muscle loss in the lower limbs.
Aguinaga commented that, in his opinion, Fujimori could be pardoned for humanitarian reasons, but he did not want to do so because he considers him innocent.
He has been operated four times on tongue cancer and has lost 18 kilos of weight, as well as other diseases such as severe erosive gastritis, a cyst in the pancreas, kidney stones, high blood pressure and blood circulation problems in the legs, the doctor listed.
Fujimori has been in the Direcci<0xC3><0xB3>n Nacional de Operaciones Especiales de la polic<0xC3><0xAD>a detention centre since September 2007.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the murder of 25 people by the death squad of the Peruvian army, which was secretly operating during his reign.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political relations
An official ordinance, led by Uruguayan President José Mujica and consisting of several ministers and entrepreneurs, will start their visit to Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between the two countries and discuss political issues in the region.
Mujica will meet with his Mexican counterpart Felipe Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n next Wednesday, which, according to the Uruguayan president, will be the culmination of his fully booked schedule with politicians, businessmen and a meeting with the collective of Uruguayans living in Mexico.
The meeting of both presidents in the city of Guadalajara "is suitable for exchanging information on all policy areas between the two countries," the South American country's presidential office announced on its website.
According to local media, Mujica is seeking Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n's support for the incident with France when French head of government Nicolas Sarkozy put the South American country on a list of tax havens at the G20 summit in the French city of Cannes.
In his discourse, Sarkozy threatened to exclude those countries which still appear as tax havens from the international community. This declaration was rejected by Uruguay and prompted a request from its ambassador in the European country.
Mexico has been chairing the G20 since November, a group of the world’s most powerful emerging and industrialized countries. Since January this year, there has been an agreement on the exchange of tax information to avoid double taxation with the South American country.
In recent years, the Government of Uruguay has tried to speed up the concretisation of agreements on the exchange of tax information in order to be removed from the "grey list" of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which includes countries that have not introduced all international standards for cooperation in tax matters.
At the business level, there has been a free trade agreement between Mexico and Uruguay since 2004, which has contributed to a growing exchange of goods between the two countries.
Super Mario 3D Land - Super Mario 3D Land - Super Mario 3D Land - Super Mario 3D Land
Super Mario has fought tirelessly for 25 years to save Princess Peach from the claws of the evil Bowser, but never in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he fights for the love of the girl in stereo technology.
The game, which will be released this month on the world’s retail counters, has been tailored from the start to the features of the Nintende 3DS portable console, which can be played three-dimensionally without a special pair of glasses.
"Mario is the character who has to say how stereoscopy works without glasses," said Omar <0xC3><0x81>lvarez, who is responsible for the press specializing in Nintendo in Spain at the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
<0xC3><0x81>lvarez explained that "Super Mario 3D Land" was "the first Nintendo video game developed for this console from the very beginning" because up until now, success articles such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of already existing titles.
Nintendo's spokesperson stressed that although it is three-dimensional, "Super Mario 3D Land" is an "affordable" video game that allows for a fast, fluid game.
<0xC3><0x81>lvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contained two games in one: the first part is "easy" to capture the less skilled users.
After that, the experts on the different levels of play, which are becoming increasingly difficult, can turn a "second round".
In addition, users can choose between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action in real time, but in order to overcome the obstacles without becoming a victim of the "optical effects", it is always necessary to play three-dimensionally.
This excursion of Super Mario into the three-dimensional world also means the return of the character to a portable console, which has not been the case since 2005.
With this video game, Nintendo twists the fans of the saga and repeats the recipe for success of the last editions: The must-have installer must overcome dangerously spiked platforms to free Princess Peach.
However, the player encounters news in the movements, the environment, the disguises and the enemies - and a "playable" Luigi.
Colom guarantees Portillo's extradition to the United States
Guatemalan President <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Colom announced on Tuesday that he would be extraditing former Governor Alfonso Portillo so that he would be responsible in the United States for the $70 million money laundering conspiracy.
Thus, the trial of the U.S. request for extradition of Portillo ends, so that it can be brought to justice there.
In a press conference, Colom confirmed his decision on grounds of independence from judiciary and government, taking into account that a decision-making court had already ordered extradition.
He stressed that during his administration he did not interfere in court decisions and accepted all extradition requests he was notified of.
In addition to Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroqu<0xC3><0xAD>n is extradited for murder and serious bodily injury, Edgar Estrada Morales and V<0xC3><0xAD>ctor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
Colom’s action is an act of government that takes place when all judicial and constitutional authorities are exhausted to convict the former State President (2000-2004).
According to the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court of Guatemala, Portillo must be extradited if his legal situation in Guatemala is clarified and his human rights are guaranteed.
Portillo was acquitted for the seizure of 120 million Quetzales in the Ministry of Defence during his reign. This trial preceded extradition, but the Minister objected and revived the case.
Trinijove helped 6,000 young people threatened by social exclusion
The organization was created to prevent the marginalization of young people without vocational training.
The first 25 years of life of the social welfare organisation Trinijove led to important results: in this quarter-century, 6,000 young people threatened by social exclusion were supported to find a way out of their difficult situation.
In addition, the jobs created for this social group are over a hundred.
On the occasion of the anniversary, an event was held yesterday in the former factory buildings of Fabra i Coats, where more than 300 people participated.
Trinijove was founded in 1986 in the Trinitat Vella district with the aim of helping young people with low level of education, without work, with drug problems threatened by the risk of marginality.
Yesterday’s celebration in Sant Andreu was attended by numerous managers of institutions and institutions who worked with the association during these 25 years.
The participation of political representatives from different directions at campaign times proved the impartiality of the work done by Trinijove.
In addition to the President of the Generalitat (Parliament of the Autonomous Region of Catalonia), Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol attended the celebrations of former socialist education minister Ernest Maragall and former mayor and currently left-green city councilor Ricard Goma.
Fabra i Coats’ large hall also visited the current Catalan Minister of Social Affairs and Family, Josep Llu<0xC3><0xAD>s Cleries, and the Director General of the Social Work of Sparkasse La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas stressed that Trinijove was created in very difficult times and that the present times are no less complicated, but he added that the work done so far is "a good foundation".
For the president of the Generalitat, Trinijove is an example that knows how to fight against difficult circumstances and gives people in trouble hope.
“The economic crisis is nothing new for the association and the work it does,” he said.
Occupied house where giant parties were held was cleared
The owners had occupied 11 of the 13 apartments in the building on Balmes No. 51 (Barcelona) street.
The twelve occupants left the building yesterday afternoon without any resistance.
It all points to the fact that the nightmares of the neighbours of the house No. 51 on the Balmes road have come to an end.
Twelve people voluntarily left the building yesterday at noon, which they had illegally occupied and in which they had organized huge festivals that drove the neighborhood to despair. The evacuation was carried out on judicial order without police intervention.
After the evacuation, the door lock was replaced to avoid a similar situation.
“From now on, access will be controlled,” the home administrator confirmed.
The occupants, who had occupied 11 of the 13 apartments of the building - the rest were inhabited - took the entire electrical system and part of the water supply. In addition, they had painted the walls and left all kinds of garbage, especially cans of alcoholic beverages.
On the three lower floors huge parties were celebrated, which lasted up to two days and drove the tenants to despair.
Next to the building is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which also suffered damage.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat, explained to Europa Press that their business had declined by 80% since the start of the house occupation.
The owner of the discotheque pointed out that the squatters were making their unfair competition, because they sold the drinks at three euros, while they cost 10 euros in the discotheque.
In addition, the owner of the recreation room had been indicated by the neighbors for rest disturbance, while according to their statement the noise did not come from the visitors of the disco, but from the occupants of the house and especially from the guests of the festivals that were organized there, and which, according to the statements of the angry neighbors, became increasingly longer and longer in recent weeks.
The manager of the discotheque explained that the harassment was so great that she agreed with the owner of the building not to have to pay any rent for the last nine months.
The Guardia Urbana (urban police) also confirmed that she has received more complaints from the neighbors in recent weeks.
The chairman of the PP (Partido Popular - People's Party) in the city council of Barcelona, Alberto Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez D<0xC3><0xAD>az, had asked last week to immediately clear the building and get to grips with the problems of bourgeois coexistence and the downfall of the neighbourhood.
He explained that before the summer, only one floor of the building had been occupied, but that in recent months the occupants had penetrated all the floors of the building and almost all the apartments.
In this sense, he added that "it is necessary to put an end to impunity and to intervene against the asocial actions in the building."
Yesterday, another building in the Nou Barris district was cleared by the Catalan police.
At 3.30 p.m., police approached Montral No. 35 after receiving a call from a neighbor who had been watching four people trying to enter the building.
The four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountain?
Apart from the disputes over the fees, the architects agree to the tender.
The urban tender for the 16 gates reopens the debate on the importance of Collserola in Barcelona.
In the mid-1980s, at the height of the now-disappeared Corporaci<0xC3><0xB3>n Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), this administration published its mockery of the promotion of Collserola.
The brochure described the mountain as a huge park in Barcelona city.
He was even compared in numbers to the Central Park of New York.
With the demise of the CMB in 1987, the park became in the eyes of many again the upper limit of Barcelona, because the capital of Catalonia is one of the few that does not spread in the north-south direction, but up (mountains) and down (seas).
The classification of Collserolas as a natural park plays with this idea.
The model now no longer served as the Central Park, but Yellowstone with wild boars in the role of the Yogi Bear.
So far, when the city issued a huge tender in September, consisting of 16 competitions, for further access stores to Collserola.
Undoubtedly, a gate points to the concept of a park.
Either this is the case, or someone is planning to set up gates on the land.
The question arises of itself: Collserola, park or mountain?
The tender is not only from an organizational point of view, but also in view of a reflection on the city, the topic of conversation in the mouth of all architects from Barcelona.
It is already almost a recurring topic that two members of this old caste who meet in the elevator can resort to.
And precisely this fact provides the material for one of the rare similarities between what three architects from Barcelona think about it, and some university professors who have applied for the project.
Miguel Rold<0xC3><0xA1>n, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: The tender is appropriate.
For Rold<0xC3><0xA1>n "it is necessary" to talk about the "front of the mountain" after the attack on the coast, as far as the discourse of Ildefons Cerda, who has not been carried out about the green apples.
“One should assume that Barcelona’s biggest park is the beach.
Among other things, because it is easily accessible.
Collserola is more complex," says the architect, for whom the title "Tore of Collserola" contains a "lexical trap": one must not "imagine it as access to a park, but as a confinement of areas where it is necessary to act."
Modol, like Rold<0xC3><0xA1>n and Bayona with urban planning experience, regards the proposal as an "intellectual challenge" that entails "some dangers".
Dangers arising from the "insecurity that the design of a public space today entails" following the experiences of the 1980s, which had their "swan song" in the area of the forum.
The first fear is to limit oneself to what can be built.
“Limiting something always means setting the next step,” i.e. exceeding it.
"You have to think about new urban planning tools, because the current [referring to the General Metropolitano (PGM)] plan can lead to a real disaster."
Modol, who is closer to the question, simply means that the side of Collserola, which goes towards Vallesana, "can be understood as a park that does not go towards Barcelona", for purely topographical reasons.
Modol recalls that there is already a study by the Patronat de Collserola, which should not "be on deaf ears", although he is grateful to the city administration that it has given his board the opportunity to participate in this project "from the first moment".
In addition, he notes that the proximity of the mountain to the city is the guiding letter, which allows architects to participate in the debate, although he expresses his "doubt" as to whether this technical profile should guide the multidisciplinary teams launched ("exactly the right thing," he says) "We architects should only be a tool."
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question in the title of this article is complex, as in the tender conditions a global view of Collserola is missing: "There have been 16 competitions in cross-section advertised," he says, "on the axis of the mountain sea. But there is no longitudinal perspective that looks at the area as a whole."
This, at least in his case, led him to participate in the 16 competitions.
Otherwise, the program and the definition of a project for a gate would collide with that of the architect of the gate next to it.
In his opinion, the city should absolutely guarantee that the strip is equipped directly above the Ronda de Dalt in its entire length, creating a smooth transition between the city and green zones.
Casino awards Jon<0xC3><0xA1>s Larraz<0xC3><0xA1>bal who gets free
After 72 days of silence, Casino Red’s agent freed Monterrey’s mayor’s brother from the trial that was being waged against him for alleged extortion.
After 72 days of imprisonment, Manuel Jon<0xC3><0xA1>s Larraz<0xC3><0xA1>bal is released after the Casino Red's agent has given him a pardon before the District's Second Criminal Court, which runs the trial against the Mayor of Monterrey's brother for extortion.
Following the assassination of Casino Royale, Sergio Gil Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a, the owner of Casino Red, published a series of photos and videos showing Manuel Jon<0xC3><0xA1>s, who allegedly forces him to pay a sum of money so that the city administration approves the secret operation of the betting house.
After the criminal complaint, the prosecutor’s office opened a criminal trial against the brother of the Panist mayor, who was arrested for 30 days on September 2.
After four hours with the official of the Ministerio P<0xC3><0xBA>blico 3 en Delitos Patrimoniales, he was taken to Casa de Arraigo 1 in the Barrio Antiguo of the capital.
He remained in this place 49 days after a second warrant was issued, after the official of the Ministerio P<0xC3><0xBA>blico had rejected the crimes for bribery and organized crime.
On October 19, he was transferred to Caderyta's detention centre because he had allegedly bribed the owners of Casino Red with one and a half million pesos, while he remained in the middle-security area for only a few hours, as there were murder threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to participate in the trial as an inmate of the San Nicol<0xC3><0xA1>s de los Garza city prison.
On 25 October, Jorge Y<0xC3><0xA1>nez, the District's secretary of the Second Criminal Court, issued a warrant for his arrest, stating that after the nearly two-month investigation, he had sufficient evidence to accuse Jon<0xC3><0xA1>s of paying 1.5 million pesos to the representatives of the betting house in order to open it in return.
This Monday, Casino Red’s agent, V<0xC3><0xAD>ctor Aldo Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a G<0xC3><0xB3>mez, asked the judge José Luis Pecina, the mayor’s brother, to issue the penalty, which is why he will be set free in the next few hours.
During the court hearing, Ramiro Arias, the official of the Ministerio P<0xC3><0xBA>blico assigned to the court, asked Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a G<0xC3><0xB3>mez whether he had corrected the damage and who the owner of the betting house had forgiven, but the lawyer withheld the name.
In accordance with case 197/2011, Jon<0xC3><0xA1>s Larraz<0xC3><0xA1>bal is freely spoken. Also in the following, no objections can be made to the process, and no compensation is required.
After hearing the representative of the betting house around 3.50 p.m., Larrazabal Bret<0xC3><0xB3>n was immediately set free.
The court secretary, Jorge Y<0xC3><0xA1>nez, went to the San Nicol<0xC3><0xA1>s de los Garza city prison to tell Jon<0xC3><0xA1>s that he had been acquitted and his case was filed.
He also informed him of the judicial order for immediate release.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez J<0xC3><0xA1>come announced details of the plane crash in which Secretary of State Francisco Blake and a further seven people were killed.
The Secretar<0xC3><0xAD>a de Comunicaciones y Transportes - SCT (Secretary for Communications and Transport in Mexico) informed that the investigation into the accident in which Secretary of State Francisco Blake Mora and a further seven people were killed pointed out that the helicopter, with its entire undamaged structure, had been blasted directly against the ground without the pilot having been able to initiate an emergency landing.
At a press conference, Dionisio Pérez J<0xC3><0xA1>come, Secretary of Communications and Transport, mentioned that the pilot had confirmed before the start that the weather conditions were suitable for the flight.
"The fact that the propeller wings had contact with trees at a height of 25 meters, with the helicopter losing the fuselage, seems to indicate that the helicopter had had had several ground contacts."
He also explained that the helicopter was built for 19 occupants, which is why he fulfilled all the requirements for the transportation of the personnel.
In addition, he said that no helicopter parts were found during the investigations in the area where the machine had come down.
"In the search, no aircraft parts were found elsewhere, the surcharge concerned the entire structure.
The helicopter was built for 19 occupants, which is why it met all the requirements for passenger transport.
The area has a slope of 7 to 30 degrees.
At present, it is a priority to get the results of the investigation as soon as possible, but it could take several months, perhaps even a year.
Gilberto L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Meyer, Director-General of Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliares (Secretary of Aircraft and Auxiliary Services in Mexico), assured him that the helicopter had flown from the Estado Mayor Presidential at a speed of travel when the aircraft was on board and had fallen to a soft slope.
"This information reinforces the assumption that it was a normal flight operation at the time of impact."
At a press conference, the head of the SCT, Pérez J<0xC3><0xA1>come, listed six relevant points that should be taken into account in the investigation:
Visual flight:
In accordance with the flight standards, it was a flight according to the rules of the visual flight, which means that the crew would have had sufficient visibility during the flight and on the ground.
Weather conditions:
The AICM recorded suitable weather conditions at the start, and during the onward flight towards the border area between Mexico City and the Mexico State, some deep-hanging clouds moved up.
Selected flight routes:
It is possible that the team had chosen a lower area with better visibility towards the Cuernavaca Valley because of the clouds.
Impact point:
The impact coordinates and the last radar recording of the helicopter match, and there may have been no loss of control of the aircraft or deviation from the flight route before the impact.
Dispersion of the remains of the aircraft in a limited area:
The information available to date indicates that the helicopter was impacted from a straight and lateral direction.
The pattern of the scattered aircraft remains suggests that the helicopter had burst onto the ground with its undamaged structure.
No signs of fire or explosion:
The remains of the aircraft offer at the scene of the accident do not indicate fire or explosion.
The latest results of the investigation indicate several ground contacts.
During the on-site investigations, aircraft parts were found at an altitude of 9200 feet above sea level. The terrain is sloping and has a slope of seven to thirty degrees.
The photos show the sequence in which the helicopter is likely to break.
Some information suggests that the helicopter may have had multiple ground contacts.
After a minute search in an area that went beyond the locked area of the accident site, no scattered aircraft parts could be found, which reinforces the assumption that the undamaged aircraft structure had bounced against the ground.
MSS Announces a Research Protocol to Find the Gene for Obesity
Mexico’s Social Security Institute is leading a research project to find the gene for obesity in children and adolescents, which is supported by IPN specialists.
The Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social - IMSS (Social Insurance Institute of Mexico) announced that it is leading a research project to discover the gene for obesity in children and adolescents under the title "Genetics of obesity in childhood and youth" with which the genetic markers associated with obesity are to be found.
Miguel Cruz L<0xC3><0xB3>pez, head of the Unidad de Investigaci<0xC3><0xB3>n Médica en Bioqu<0xC3><0xAD>mica (Department of Medical Research, Focus on Biochemistry) at the Hospital de Especialidades del Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI, explained that an interdisciplinary team consisting of doctors, nurses, nutrition specialists and social workers was set up.
This team is supported by specialists and students of the postgraduate programme at the Instituto Nacional de Salud P<0xC3><0xBA>blica (INSP) and at the Centro de Investigaci<0xC3><0xB3>n y de Estudios Avanzados (Cinvestav) del Instituto Politécnico Nacional (IPN).
The population is invited to participate in the study. Interested parties can come to the sports fields of the IMSS in the valley of Mexico, where tests with children and young people are carried out every Saturday from 8 a.m.
He stressed that the investigation began on the Cuauhtémoc sports ground (to the west of the state of México) and continued on the Nezahualc<0xC3><0xB3>yolt sports ground (to the east of the state of México) since October 8.
When the target is reached from 500 to 600 subjects, the study is continued on the sports ground of Independencia (in the south of the capital district) and completed on the one of Morelos (in the north of the capital district).
He explained that the aim of the study was to get to know the factors and role of genetics associated with the development of obesity and the identification of risk factors for the prevention of chronic degenerative diseases in Mexican children and adolescents.
On the occasion of the worldwide Diabetes Day, he stated that it was intended that three thousand children and adolescents aged six to 14 should fill in questionnaires related to nutrition with the consent and supervision of their parents.
They will also be asked questions about their physical activity and family history of disease to control risk factors that could result in diabetes or kidney failure.
He further explained that on the aforementioned Saturdays, the subjects measured (weight, size, waist circumference), their blood pressure were controlled and blood values such as glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin and genetic factors (trying to identify genes related to childhood obesity) were determined.
Cruz L<0xC3><0xB3>pez stressed that this study would be conducted on the occasion of the health care staff’s concern about the alarming weight gain of young people.
"The health surveys from 1999 and 2006 showed that in almost six years, the proportion of obese boys increased by 77 percent and that of girls with obesity by 47 percent.
He stated that the search for genetic markers was justified because the genetic history of the population of Mexico differed from that of other peoples.
He stated that an (e) Mexican (in) is on average 65 percent Indian-American, 30 percent European and 5 percent African descent, which is reflected in the genes associated with diabetes and obesity.
In general, he explained that the genetics of obesity are expressed in the inability to burn out the excess of energy (calories) consumed so that it is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit to the study participants was in a comprehensive study of the children, which would determine whether they had a degree of obesity or obesity.
It would even investigate the occurrence of dark skin folds in the neck and inner arm (acanthosis), which indicate the likelihood of metabolic disorders and pre-stage diabetes.
All information would be treated confidentially and communicated to parents in writing by the doctors. Doctors explain to parents all measurement results and suggest lifestyle changes that are appropriate for the prevention of diseases.
Cruz L<0xC3><0xB3>pez explained that there were three basic factors responsible for overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: lack of exercise, i.e. lack of exercise in everyday life, spending most of the day in front of the TV and using means of transport instead of walking short distances.
The high calorie intake, that is, an increased consumption of sugary drinks and carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) along with a high fat and protein intake as well as the genetics to be analyzed in this research project.
Asphalt from UNAM prevents potholes
Rafael Herrera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry at the Mexican University of UNAM, develops polymer-modified asphalt to make the mixture more resistant to weather conditions and temperature fluctuations
If the signs were taken into account from the road surface, it would not be necessary to repair almost 200,000 potholes if the rainy season erupted in the Zona Metropolitana del Valle de México (the urban area of the valley of Mexico), Rafael Herrera N<0xC3><0xA1>jera, a researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) at the University of UNAM, warned and assured that if the laying out and the containment of the potholes would be significantly reduced, the amount of the water.
In his lecture "Battle holes from a technical point of view", which he held on the occasion of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory for which he is responsible is developing asphalt modified with polymers to produce a mixture similar to the asphalt, which, however, has greater mechanical resistance both at high and low temperatures.
Herrera N<0xC3><0xA1>jera said that this type of modified asphalt should be used in areas with extremely hot climates, such as in some cities in the north of the country, to improve the behaviour of road surfaces and thus avoid the occurrence of potholes.
He explained that the asphalt - the heaviest part of the oil - is a hydrocarbon compound, one part of which has a high molecular weight - the so-called asphalts - and the other part a low - the so-called malthenes. Together, they give the road surface its characteristic elastic behaviour.
Tensile-elastic behavior of the asphalt means that it behaves like a liquid at high temperatures of almost 180° C., at 120° C., it is very viscous and almost solid at 50° C., while it becomes brittle at very low temperatures.
“This means that the resistance of asphalt on the roads is not uniform, but changes in one day depending on weather conditions and temperature fluctuations,” the chemical engineer explained.
The FQ researcher noted that the streets of Mexico City had mostly a flexible road covering, composed of six layers of material, the last three of which included asphalt.
Between the top layers there is a wear layer of asphalt, which consists of small, paved asphalt and then solidified stones.
Every single stone of this wear layer had been bathed in asphalt.
When the vehicles move on and forces are generated, this layer allows a good distribution of forces in the road surface.
“If it were modified asphalt, the forces would spread even better,” said the chemical engineer.
"Over the wear layer," he explained, "a last layer is laid out, the so-called support layer, which consists of tiny stones, i.e. sand, which was also bathed in asphalt.
Since these layers are in contact with the vehicle tires, they require a greater mechanical force than the wear layer and they must produce friction.
This road surface receives and distributes the most forces, the support layer also needs a reasonable thickness and the material it consists of must be maintained.
The weather conditions, especially humidity and temperature fluctuations, are further, important factors to consider, above all the water," he said, "because it significantly affects the behavior of the wear layer.
When the terrain becomes wet, water penetrates the layer and only passes out again, causing a softening of all the layers of the road surface and as a result, the occurrence of potholes.
When a punchhole is created, he said, "the cover layer is first removed, while the wear layer is only affected afterwards. But the damage is not immediately caused, but it is a process that would have to be maintained at the first signs by appropriate maintenance programs."
The member of the Sistema Nacional de Investigadores (National Research System of Mexico) stated that the vehicle load is another important cause of the occurrence of potholes, so the thickness of each layer of the road surface must always be in relation to the vehicle load and it must be ensured that this regulation is complied with in order to avoid frequent potholes.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that a lot of research was still waiting, for example on asphalt emulsions, which are already on the market in other countries, and with which the potholes could be repaired easily and without the use of high temperatures.
What did the candidate del Valle lack to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that affected Melina Ram<0xC3><0xAD>rez Serna did not get the crown of Miss Colombia.
El Valle gets his 14th miss title.
Valle del Cauca once again went out empty in the awarding of the crown for Miss Colombia.
This time, Melina Ram<0xC3><0xAD>rez Serna had to be content with standing on the winning podium, showing a silver crown and the band she identifies as the new Miss Colombia.
With the result obtained that night in Cartagena, where Miss Atl<0xC3><0xA1>ntico took the crown and the cedar in her own right, in 1978, the Departamento already comes to 14 miss titles and Melina joins the legion of women from Valle del Cauca, who had almost held the crown in their hands.
The big question that many people are asking today is: What was missing?
For the result corresponds to the decline of a great favorite, who had shown at every performance that she had everything she could to be the new Miss Colombia. It was not for nothing that she had been elected Queen of Police and Mejor Rosro Jolie of Vogue, titles that also the beauty queens Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro had received, and which took home the crown of Miss Colombia.
The first factor that is considered crucial for the jury’s decision to appoint her to the First Miss is that she had not convinced the answer to the question “Which book has influenced you the most and why?”, which she had been asked by Mart<0xC3><0xAD>n Murillo G<0xC3><0xB3>mez of the Carreta Literaria Leamos.
The young woman from Valle del Cauca replied to the questioner:
"I read a lot, I believe pretty much in literature, I believe it's a way of civilizing myself, ultimately I believe that the book that was the most powerful for my childhood is 'The Little Prince', a rather profound book.
It is a book of universal culture that we should all read. I am currently reading a book by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a beautiful book called Passions.
A response that encountered little reciprocity, firstly because of the concept of “civilizing” and secondly because it had not specifically explained how each book she called had influenced her.
But after the ceremony ended, Melina declared to feel calm and happy with the result: "The universe is wise, it happens what has to happen.
And for all people: Please read a little ‘The Little Prince’. It’s a great book.
Among other things, it is said that the darling of El Valle is burnt out.
A journalist from Bogota suggested that the fact that she was the preferred one, who had received all the applause and who had received all the prizes in advance (gastronomy contest Easter, audience vote on the best hand-made costume and Reina Madre), "had made the other candidates jealous, which the queen was able to stress, which therefore could not shine on the stage."
And this was noticed at her first performance in the swimsuit on the beach of the Hilton hotel and at her two elevators at the coronation ceremony.
Although she certainly appeared with both, she lacked the strength and momentum that the representatives of Magdalena and Atl<0xC3><0xA1>ntico presented.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the program "Como en casa" at the RCN channel said that the fact that Melina was crowned Miss "shows that the candidate who wins the most prizes during the competition, after all, will not become Queen".
In addition, at the end of the press, Valle went out of his way - a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle was unable to convince the jury about their interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Competition.
It will already have its reason that two days before the compilation of the international jury Lucy Doughty declared that they were looking for a woman who was committed to the social affairs of her country.
"Beauty alone is not enough for a Miss Colombia; you have to look beyond the physical and focus on the social feeling that she had already worked on projects before participating in the competition," she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle had sinned with her defects of derrire and fibrosis, which were noted in the stomach area, but this is contradictory, because the jury chose her as a candidate for 'natural beauty' with a healthy body, good eating habits and responsible physical work.
The trainer of the queens, Jorge Hern<0xC3><0xA1>n Orozco, admits that Melina did not have the best body, that there would be better, "but her problem with the fibrosis on the abdomen, which, frankly, was hardly noticeable to me, pressed her score on the last day."
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos of the journal Cromos believes that the woman’s mistake in Valle del Cauca was the surgical procedures she had undergone.
"The operations are okay, but Valle didn't know how to make them right.
Her body has never been her strong side, and this place she had to pay.”
Because of this prize, which is awarded for the first time by the National Beauty Competition, a cruel prediction emerged after the appearance in the swimsuit, which was supposed to come true at night. It was duped that Raymundo Melina had given a consolation prize so as not to let them enjoy the crown.
Whether that’s true or not, the fact is that Melina starts her reign today, not as a queen, but as a princess, a position that gives her the opportunity to represent her at the appointment of the National Beauty Competition Colombia at one of the international competitions.
However, she will go down in history as one of the queens who, despite her overwhelming appearance for Cartagena, had escaped the crown.
So was the work of the doctor who identified the body of Alfonso Cano
A lophoscopist from Cali went into history as the man who identified "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials plays a key role.
Last November, a Lophoscopist of the Investigation Unit of the Public Prosecutor's Office (CTI) from Cali entered as the man who confirmed the identity of the leader of the FARC (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia): "Alfonso Cano" by comparing the fingerprints.
Of the seven Lophoscopists in the Department of CTI, this week Eliazar Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez had a readiness service, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been involved in criminal investigations for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez worked in communities of Choc<0xC3><0xB3>, where he often had to go to the jungle for five days to reach the place where the bodies he was supposed to identify were located.
In 2000 he moved to Valle and after completing the required courses he specialized in lophoscopy, which is the examination of the skin exposed to friction, i.e. the palms and feet.
In the week of action against the so-called Alfonso Cano, Eliazar was advised to pack clothes for at least three days.
Something big was waiting for him.
Friday night he flew in the helicopter from Palmira to Cauca.
He knew that he should identify two bodies, and that there was a suspicion that one of the man who led the oldest guerrillas in the world could be, so he should take Guillermo Le<0xC3><0xB3>n S<0xC3><0xA1>enz's 10-finger print sheet (his real name).
However, when he reached the place where the body was located with the examination test, he could not identify him because of his physical appearance, because this was similar to the images he had seen in the mass media, not least.
He had no beard, was dressed like a farmer in the area, wore no glasses and was much thinner.
Fingerprints do not lie.
Armed with a magnifying glass, ink, a planter and a flashlight, Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the body with those on the print sheet.
He had seen correctly: It was "Alfonso Cano".
That same night, this Puerto Tejada-born man was in charge of telling the Minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinz<0xC3><0xB3>n, that he was actually the FARC chief.
Searching for tracks
The appreciation given to President Juan Manuel Santos Eliasar Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez at a press conference on the use against "Cano" was very important for a Dactyloscope of the Sij<0xC3><0xAD>n in Cali.
Many people do not know our work.
Dactyloscopy is an exact science with no error rate, which can be a key factor in resolving a crime.
Lophoscopists not only identify bodies, they also support investigations into murder and robbery cases and confirm the identity of the arrested persons.
When they are arrested, many offenders present false ID documents or they do not have one.
We take the fingerprints and search them in the database.
The researcher told us that in the event of a theft, he had to tear a piece of wall out of a house, because the thief had supported himself right here with his hand as he pulled out a safe full of jewelry and money.
"Walls are difficult because their surfaces are unsuitable for taking fingerprints, but in this case we were able to take the imprint of the whole hand and identify the offender who had participated in several thefts," he recalled.
With the help of fingerprints, murder suspects can also be relieved or burdened.
Recently, a dead man was found surrounded by liquor bottles.
During the investigation, it was suspected that a family member might be a suspect, and in fact a fingerprint on the bottle matched.
Although this does not guarantee that it is the killer, it is linked to the place where the crime was committed.
A CTI dactyloscopy explained that "the fingerprints would be taken from the object with chemical or physical reagents."
When they appear, a planter or band is used to take them with you.
After that, the prints are sent to Asif, which is the criminal database, or to the civil service.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians without ID papers," said the CTI expert.
He said that not everything was as it would be portrayed in the TV series SCI.
Just as not all gold, which shines, is also not all you touch, a fingerprint.
But it can still be used if you make a corresponding comparison.
The “Emperor” Challenges Authorities in New York
Hundreds of protesters crowded into tents on Zuccotti Square.
A large part complied with the evacuation order and changed its location to a nearby park.
The members of the Ocupy Wall Street movement challenged the authorities of New York City on Tuesday, when they tried again with a judicial order to enter the Manhattan Square after being cleared of the Square in the morning and had tried to occupy another place at the Big Apple.
Hundreds of demonstrators gathered in front of Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to gain access to a court order that allowed the "embarrassers" to re-camp at this spot. Meanwhile, another part of the movement held on to the evacuation order and occupied a park further north in the city, where there were nine arrests.
"Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp on the square, we will meet in another place and continue the battle with legal means to return to Zuccotti, with sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations," said Mark Bray, one of the spokesman of the Ocupy Wall Street movement.
Bray stated that the response of the "embarrassers" to the eviction of their tent camp, which had been arranged directly by Michael Bloomberg, the Mayor of New York, came to court, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order banning the violent evacuation of the square and approving the tents to the demonstrators.
In addition, the "Emperor" occupied a new park, which is located at the intersection of the centrally located Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and is owned by Trinity Church.
They were able to occupy the place for at least an hour, but after that the police arrived and arrested some of the protesters, although Bray cannot give exact numbers. He assured the Efe news agency that he had also seen several journalists with handcuffs.
The organization assures that hundreds of people had found themselves at this point, where religious leaders had also arrived as a sign of their support for the members of the movement and for mediation with the police.
Meanwhile, the Zuccotti Square (a private property site) remains closed in anticipation of a judicial hearing scheduled for this Tuesday, which aims to analyse the legality of the eviction that took place in the dawn.
Some of the demonstrators driven from the square carried photocopies of this court order with them and distributed them, even giving them some police officers who guarded the square, which resulted in "some small clashes," as Bray reported, who had indicated that some police officers had beaten protesters.
The court order prohibits the authorities from removing Occupy Wall Street members from the square as well as the application of "laws passed after the occupation and prohibits the protesters from returning to the park with their tents and other things they had previously used."
Mayor Bloomberg made it clear to the press that, because of this judicial arrangement, the reopening of the public transport space and the demonstrators had been lifted, and he pointed out that the city laws did not allow them to re-establish themselves with tents and sleeping bags in this place.
The mayor personally defended the eviction of Zuccotti Square, carried out in the morning, in which nearly 200 people were arrested, and which was decided because the protesters "violate the right."
Bloomberg stated that he had ordered the evacuation of the square because it had “transformed into a place where people did not come to demonstrate, but to break the laws and in some cases to harm other people,” because “some businesses had received threats” and the residents feared “their quality of life.”
"The eviction in the dawn was disgusting and shows that Bloomberg is basically interested in protecting the financial interests and not in protecting the interests of North American workers," added the spokesman of the movement, who accused the mayor of "not respecting the freedom of the press."
The Occupy Wall Street officials informed that they were considering organising “big actions” for Thursday, along with community organizations and unions, to commemorate the two months that the protests have already taken place since September 17.
Pamela Anderson is on the TV Christmas show the Virgin Mary
Together with Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities, she will perform on December 1 in the TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas"
Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement", lifeguard in "Baywatch", rabbit in "Playboy", the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary on a Christmas show of Canadian television.
The private television channel CTV announced today that Anderson, along with the "crooner" (ballad singer) Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities, will appear on the TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1 and will breathe life into a very special Virgin Mary.
CTV today distributed images of the television program in which Anderson - who also appears on the Internet for the distribution of a self-made porn, in which she appears together with her former husband, the drummer of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee - as the Virgin Mary with a doll in her lap, which is supposed to represent Jesus.
The scene features Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Native American origin who recently worked as a presenter on Charlie Sheen’s My Violent Torpedo of Truth show, as a child of Jesus.
CTV’s Christmas program not only focuses on Anderson and Peters, but also on the Canadian singer Bublé, who married the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato at the end of March in Buenos Aires, and who is not far from this controversy.
Recently, at one of his concerts in New York, Bublé had called North American Kim Kardashian a "whore."
Japan is reborn after the earthquake
GDP grows by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ends the spiral of free fall from early March
Since last March, the Japanese economy has been paralysed, still recovering from the devastating earthquake that erupted in a nuclear crisis, and the worst disaster Japan had experienced was World War II.
The first estimates by the Tokyo government assessed property damage at $300,000, a blow that seems to weaken despite the difficult global economic situation.
After three quarters of cases, the figures on the gross domestic product from July to September finally served to complete this chapter: GDP grew by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% to the quota raised to the year-on-year.
The value measured in the second quarter - starting in Japan in March 2012 - also represents the fastest growth since the period from January to March 2010.
The resurgence can be partly explained by the machine sale for the reconstruction of the areas devastated by the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1% compared to the 0.9% decline for capital investments recorded from January to March, the first decline after six months of unstoppable increases.
Nevertheless, the real reversal of the Japanese economy is not based solely on Keynesian shocks that use the crisis to build or rebuild infrastructures.
Japan has woken up, in particular, thanks to the development of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japanese GDP.
This variable rose by 1%, driven by growing spending on vehicles, travel and leisure.
The Stigma of the Yen
Tokyo has entrusted itself to the domestic market after the yen – the Japanese currency – turns into one of the “backward currencies” of investors fleeing the eurozone’s debt crisis and gloomy forecasts for the U.S.A., a privilege that loads like a gravestone on the accounts of export companies.
With a harder currency, products abroad are more expensive, a serious problem for a country whose economy is based on the health of major technology producers.
Toyota and Sony, for example, traced their weak business results from July to September to the listing of the yen.
While the markets continue to besiege the peripheral EU countries, the Yoshihiko Noda government remains vigilant.
“One has to pay attention to the ongoing risks, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the flooding in Thailand and the rapid appreciation of the yen,” said Motohisa Furukawa, State Secretary for Economic Policy.
The prospects are really not very exciting.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) explained that most member states had shown clearer signs of slowing down economic development in September.
The indicator, which anticipates the turning points of the global economy, revealed that the biggest economic potentials would have slowed down.
He dropped by four tenths to 100.4 points compared to the 100.8 in August.
The eurozone is even below this average, which is 100, after it has fallen by eight tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens again gives rise to doubts
Papadimos says the austerity measures would be passed, but the Conservatives will not sign a written agreement
With the increased risk premiums of the peripheral countries and widening uncertainty, Greece is also further lost in the labyrinth that leads out of the major European debt crisis.
The impression that the "consensus" of the new Greek transitional government is more of a reaction to the pressure from Brussels than a real conviction of political forces is slowly evidenced by facts.
While the new prime minister, Lukas Papadimos, pointed out yesterday that there were no alternatives to structural reforms and that the hundred days agreed upon at his appointment may be too short for their implementation, the leader of the conservative party Nueva Democracia, Antonis Samaras, assured that he would support the new austerity measures and not in any case withdraw his demand for new elections on the planned date, February 19.
"The most important task of this government is to implement the decisions taken at the October 26 summit," Papadimos assured yesterday that a parliamentary debate will open tomorrow with the vote of confidence for the new government.
A package of 24 programmes to promote employment, reform of disciplinary law for civil servants and new measures to combat tax evasion are the first initiatives.
Despite this, Samara’s statement does not dispel doubts about his stance: “We have committed ourselves to supporting the transitional government, but to nothing else.”
The conservative leader went a step too far with his challenge to the EU and the IMF, the organism that must unlock the 8,000 million that Athens desperately needs, and he made it clear that he would not approve a commitment statement on the fulfilment of the austerity measures.
But the European Commission, which is still irritated by the effects of the poker game with Papandreu referendum, reiterated yesterday that its demand should not be shaken: economic aid would not be signed if the new government and the leaders of the major Greek parties signed "a clear written agreement not as soon as possible".
Amadeu Altafaj, a spokesman for the Ministry of Economic Affairs, said that the Troika inspectors would return to Athens “very soon” to discuss with the new government “what is needed for the payment of the sixth section” of 8,000 million euros, although there is no definitive date yet.
The Greek knot still has threads for a while.
Queen Sof<0xC3><0xAD>a: “These are instruments for progress and hope”
The Queen stressed Spain's "dominant" position with regard to this type of financing
Spain "has achieved a dominant position worldwide in the role of microfinance".
Queen Sof<0xC3><0xAD>a of Spain recalled yesterday that Spain has become the world’s second donor to this means of international cooperation over the past two decades, based on the fact that it is an “instrument for social progress, justice and the hope of a better future for all humanity on the basis of trust in people”.
The Queen inaugurated the fifth World Summit on micro-credits in Valladolid yesterday. She was convinced that there would be "no doubt" that this kind of business would be "absolutely essential" to achieve the millennium goals set by the United Nations until 2015 and "in particular the goal of reducing the number of people living with incomes of less than one dollar."
Spain "continues to work" on expanding the beneficiary network "to the last corner of the world and it is carrying out this task responsibly," noted Queen Sofia, who hopes that the initiatives and contributions undertaken by the summit, which lasts until Thursday, "create new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest and especially for women" as the main beneficiaries of these loans are guaranteed.
"We have seen many successes" and "are facing many challenges."
The summit on micro-credit is not only a forum for debates, but also a platform to kick-start "two fundamental goals".
The Queen stated that it is being sought that by the end of 2015 175 million poor families should have access to these financial services and that ten million of these households will exceed the poverty line.
The concept of microcredit goes back in Spain and the rest of the world to the path initiated by Muhammad Yunus “years ago,” which Queen Sofia regards as an “act of justice and recognition.”
The father of this financial instrument described her as an "admirable idealist committed to the fight against poverty" and whose work she has known for 15 years when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to get to know the loan strategy on the spot.
This experience followed a year later the first World Summit in Washington and further meetings on the C<0xC3><0xB4>te d'Ivoire in 1999 and Canada in 2006, all of which "we have been able to see a continuous development", the Queen, whose commitment to this project brought her assessment yesterday as "family head" in Valladolid and as "sponsor of the poor".
Finally, Queen Sofia ended her talk by animating those present to participate in the debate and seek solutions in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical Commandment"
Spanish Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez pointed out that solidarity is "an ethical imperative" for the entire democratic state.
In this sense, she stressed that it was a mistake to tie development aid to times of economic booms, because it was a "permanent commitment".
Jiménez felt that the micro-credits were a “serious and rigorous policy for eradicating poverty,” and that the governments of the industrialized states now had to work “more than ever” on solidarity criteria, and should not allow the solidarity of the crisis to fall victim to.
For Spain, microcredit is one of the "most important forms of development aid".
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez, lamented "the success", "marginalized" people, "who are always in front of closed doors" to give "hope" and the Mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier Le<0xC3><0xB3>n de la Riva, welcomed those present in a city that "opens its gates, infected by the spirit of solidarity".
The CDU proposes to elect the EU president on the basis of a general vote
The first day of the Congress of Christian Democrats (CDU on Monday, November 14 in Leipzig) was for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and Chairman of the Christian Democratic Party, without any real difficulties.
The future of Europe was not originally foreseen in the programme, but has prevailed in the autumn, in particular in order to provide enough for those activists who regard government policy towards the Greeks today and possibly Italy tomorrow as too lax.
The Presidential motion proposed by the Bureau of the European Commission was adopted almost unanimously.
Of the 1001 delegates, only nine had voted against, ten had abstained.
The Standing Ovation, which lasted several minutes, which was initially Angela Merkel and a few hours later Wolfgang Sch<0xC3><0xA4>uble due to their intervention, had no doubts on the part of the three European-minded finance ministers.
The main idea of the chancellor - as well as the proposals - bears the following slogan: the answer to the crisis is "no less, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe means peace, but also because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro".
For the chancellor, "the time has come for a breakthrough in Europe".
This could be expressed by a reform of the Lisbon Treaty, which reinforces the control of the European Union, with regard to the budgetary policies of the euro area countries, but this could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of a general vote to give Europe a face.
However, this is definitely one of the proposals approved by Congress, which clearly stood by Wolfgang Sch<0xC3><0xA4>uble Pate.
Certainly, it is unlikely that the 47 will quickly agree on this revolution: Britain is opposed to the matter, and the CDU leaders believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is of the same opinion.
However, the milestone is set.
Similarly, in an overwhelming majority, the delegates rejected the proposal for the weighting of each country in the Governing Board according to the weighting of the individual economies, which obviously led to an increase in Germany’s position.
The chancellor, who is concerned with calming the climate within her party, has therefore strengthened the reference points to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but has no longer tried to win her congress at the expense of the "small" or the European countries in difficulty, who would immediately criticize the arrogant Germany.
To the extent that the European request for the significance of the "German-French friendship" devotes a paragraph, Angela Merkel does not call France on the plan.
At least not directly.
Because this reminds us that Leipzig was at the center of a bloody battle two centuries ago.
In fact, one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What does the fraud represent in the case of sick reports?
After the family benefits, UMP and the government are now tackling the sick reports.
Nicolas Sarkozy will arrive in Bordeaux on Tuesday, November 15 to seek family support and to present a speech on the topic of the fight against social fraud and economic dependence on the state, which has been recurring since 2007.
In order to accompany this attack, which is based on the desire to test the economy in a test of hardness, but on the other hand represents no less prerogatives of an axis of the right-wing presidential campaign, the majority wants to focus on employee sick leave.
First of all, with a budgetary objective: the government is looking at the introduction of a fourth day of maternity leave before considering a sick leave for private sector workers.
In good German, this means that a sick worker would lose the salary of four days without the approval of the specific company, thus at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure that, according to the daily newspaper "Les Echos", threatens to evoke anger, but would help to raise 280 million euros.
And those that went along with another measure of rather symbolic character: to grant state officials an unpaid maternity day in case of illness (so far, unlike the three maternity days in the private sector, there is no maternity period for them).
While these issues are in the discussion, the majority also rekindles the fraud issue, this time targeting the abuse associated with work absence.
"Controls will be much more important, and in addition, they will be reimbursed if required," warned Xavier Betrand on Sunday, November 13 before the RTL's microphone.
As in other cases, the impact of this report on the reality of fraudulent actions in the field of disease reports seems a little unproportionated.
In fact, this has been the subject of permanent observation since 2002 as well as political offensives that have borne the most fruit.
The French are no longer sicker than people elsewhere in Europe.
First of all, however, we are talking about the national figures.
According to the national health insurance fund CNAM, more than 237 million euros were paid out in 2006.
According to the Economic Research and Documentation Institute of Health, daily payments amounted to EUR 11.3 billion in 2008 and represented 5% of health expenditure.
This figure fell to 46% in terms of maternity leave, work accidents and 54% in terms of sick leave, which is 6.2 billion euros.
That is 2.5% of health care expenditure.
In 2010, the French received an average of only 14.5 sick days compared to the 17.8 days in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting Group.
A mean value that obscures certain differences: another, published in 2007 by Monster.com, career planning website, showed that 75% of the 40,000 surveyed French workers reported not having taken a single day of sick leave.
Another study, this time covered by health insurance, makes it clear that 37% of the sick reports in 2010 were shorter than 8 days; 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and a month, 15% between one and three months and 11% above.
Compared with their European neighbours, French workers no longer tend to be incapacitated.
A long-term study conducted in 2010 by two researchers from the French State Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) showed that between 1994 and 2001 the global absence rate (sickness or otherwise justified) was oscillating, in France between 10% and 11% against 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
The fraud in sick reports represents a disappearingly small proportion in terms of undeclared work.
With regard to the fraud, only a weak extent is achieved here.
Reinforcement of legislation since 2002 means that there are systmatic checks on sick leave that exceed 45 days.
In 2008, the CNAM (public university for the training of technicians and engineers) under 1.5 million controls found that 13% of the 285,000 short-term medical reports implemented were "unjustified or too long" in 37,050 cases.
In the systematically controlled cases of disease reporting of more than 45 days duration, less than 1.2 million 11% were counted on "unadjusted or unjustified" cases, which is 132,000.
In total, this makes 169,000 "unjustified" cases of several million workers who have claimed a sick leave.
A number which represents only a weak extent to, for example, that of the black work.
According to UMP Member Dominique Tian, author of a July case report on this issue, this represents between 9 and 15 billion euros of tax profit loss per year, i.e. more than the total cost of daily allowances, and thus significantly more than the defraud of the latter.
Papademos: Greece should introduce a new adaptation plan
Greece needs a new adjustment programme to capture its economy.
This had been announced by Prime Minister Lucas Papademos in Parliament on Monday, 14 November, adding that the one hundred days granted by his government by the Union were not enough to accomplish this task.
"In order to continue our efforts to strengthen the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new budget adjustment programme," he said in his first public address at the opening of the debate on Parliament's vote of confidence on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the Euro Summit on 27 October was the "main task" of the new government, as the country's participation in the Eurozone was "at stake", as he added.
Accordingly, M. Papademos has planned to reduce the country’s state deficit “by 9%” of gross domestic product from today to the end of the year, after that in 2010 10.6% and in 2009 at 15.7%.
The right rejects the new austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, head of the right wing, had given his approval on Monday to the measures already approved with regard to an attempt to escape the debt crisis, but sent ahead that his party would not be prepared for an additional austerity.
"We will not vote in favour of new measures," he said at a meeting of his party's New Democracy.
He had agreed to the requirements of reducing budget deficits and debt, as well as the fight against waste, but was hostile to any policy that would prevent the economic upturn.
Olli Rehn, an EU Commissioner entrusted with economic and monetary tasks, who had prevented the IMF and the EU from releasing the necessary €8 billion loan without a written guarantee from all parties over their support of the planned measures, had replied to Mr Samaras that his word would suffice and he would not sign anything under the pressure of Mr Au<0xCE><0xB2>en.
Euthanasia and accompanied free-death must be legalized, according to an expert panel
Canadians live in denial of death, according to a report by the Royal Society of Canada
The panel explained that governments, health care institutions, and doctors worked together on pain-relieving treatment to provide the best pain-relieving remedies, and this goes beyond cancer cases.
The Canadian society lives in a refusal attitude to death.
Only 9% of Canadians actually agree to talk to their doctor about conditions under which they want to die and make dispositions for this purpose.
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, which involved six experts linked to each other in various fields of expertise, including ethics, law and medicine.
This body recommends that the government amend the criminal law in such a way as to allow accompanied suicide and euthanasia, where this election is taking place, in patients who are considered to be able to make such a decision.
The experts cited a recently published survey by the independent EIU, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the globe.
Although Canada ranked 10th, the study notes that “medical death care in Canada has produced a culture in which people are afraid to cut the subject of death.”
Medical care or not: 77% of Canadians do not have access to painkillers, according to the experts appointed by the Royal Society of Canada.
And despite the majority of Canadians’ desire to die at home, 68.6% of them ultimately die in the hospital.
From a country-wide perspective, the rate is highest in Quebec with 86% of hospitalized deaths.
In the sensitive issue of euthanasia and accompanied suicide, the authors of the report come to the conclusion that the position of the federal government, which has already appealed, does not want to make any changes to the criminal law regarding euthanasia and accompanied suicide.
But now there is no evidence, according to the experts who have similarly inspected all those countries whose approach has legalized or decriminalized euthanasia and accompanied suicide, that such decriminalization would entail mi<0xCE><0xB2>brage in their application, i.e. the practice of euthanasia or accompanied suicide by incompetent or unconsenting persons.
On the contrary, there are significantly more cases of such violations especially in countries where euthanasia and accompanied suicide are not legalized, as Jocelyn Downie, co-signer of the report, confirmed in a teleconference yesterday.
"Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
“Even accompanied suicide is practiced in Canada, although it is clearly illegal here,” Jocelyn Downie explains.
Canadians support euthanasia
According to a 2010 Angus Reid survey, 85% of Canadians had already cried out in favor of euthanasia because they believe they allow people to ease their suffering at the end of their lives.
And 66% believe that the fact of legalizing euthanasia does not lead to the message that the lives of older or disabled people have less value.
For those who have already committed suicide, 41% of respondents believe that they should not be prosecuted.
As far as maintenance or cessation of funds in patients is concerned, the situation is less clear, according to the authors of the report.
Similarly, in their list of recommendations, they suggest that the criminal law should state that the removal of the funds for which a valid refusal was made should not be considered a criminal offence.
The expert panel also calls for health care professionals to be trained to respect a drop in funds at the end of their lives and to fear this without criminal prosecution.
The panel explained that governments, health care institutions, and doctors worked together on pain-relieving treatment to provide the best pain-relieving remedies, and beyond cancer cases.
Last but not least, with regard to the means of pain relief or life-affirming measures already widely used in the Canadian institutions for health care, the panel calls for them to be at least considered, since they were not used to reduce physical pain, as were euthanasia, and they referred to the same procedures.
Retention of other experts
Some experts in the field of healthcare have already made reservations about the conclusions of the expert report of the Royal Society of Canada.
RA Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, has described the attitude of the report-signing experts as, among other things, "extreme", since they do not limit euthanasia practice in patients in the final phase.
"This opens the door to a situation in which anyone who is life-tired and older than 18 years old asks another person to assist him in his suicide," said RA Deschamps, who had reviewed a summary of the report yesterday.
RA Deschamps also stressed that the authors of the report seemed to place the individual’s own responsibility above all other values involved in the social fabric of society.
But now, he says, there are "guidelines and obligations in a society".
Margaret Somerville, a health law specialist, has also expressed "a strong resistance" to the conclusions of the report, which she titled as the "Pro-Euthanasie Manifesto".
Margaret Somerville, herself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, in particular doubts the report on the non-existence of abuses in certain countries where euthanasia and accompanied suicide are legalized, such as the Netherlands and Oregon.
The King of Jordan calls on President Assad to step down
Damascus denounces a "com plot"
Syria is increasingly isolated.
The partisans Bashar al-Assads demonstrated yesterday in front of the authorities of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The diplomatic pressure on Syria’s Bashar al-Assad, who, however, opposes it thanks to Russia’s support and rejects a “com plot” directed against the country, has intensified yesterday.
Two days before Syria’s withdrawal from the Arab League, the European Union tightened its sanctions against Damascus, although Turkey and Jordan, Syria’s neighbouring countries, had taken a position in favor of President Assad’s resignation.
King Abdullah II of Jordan was yesterday the acting Arab prime minister who had called on President Bashar al-Assad to "put down his office in Syria" in which already around forty civilians and members of the government were killed.
"If Bashar had the interest of his country at heart, he would resign, but in addition, he should also create the necessary conditions for a new era of political Syrian life," the king of Jordan, neighboring Syria, said in an interview with the BBC.
Turkish diplomatic chief Ahmet Davutoglu, for his part, complained that the Turkish mediation efforts directed at the Syrian regime since the beginning of the year had not been crowned by success.
“Those in the Middle East who are not at peace with their people and cannot satisfy this must leave,” he said in reference to Syria, the neighbouring country to which Turkey is taking a steadily rougher stance.
The United States, for its part, welcomed the "enhancing of the consensus against Assad and the machinations of the Syrian regime" as a result of the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
“The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League and countries like Turkey have struck an increasingly sharp tone in the face of repression in Syria,” Mark Toner, a State Department spokesman, said in a statement.
During this time, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the government in the Dar'a region of southern Syria have been killed, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights OSDH said.
According to the NGO, two other civilians had been killed in "Ships and heavy bombings for Jobar" in the besieged city of Homs.
On the occasion of a press conference, Syrian foreign trade minister Walid al-Muallim nevertheless felt that the country "taxes towards the end of the crisis".
By the way, he has reacted strongly to the Arab League’s decision to suspend Damascus from its duties, which he considers to be a “dangerous step.”
Syria "will not yield," he added, under the guise of "the plots forged against Syria would fail."
Following the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is currently investigating a "protection mechanism for civilians" and wishes to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, the media and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Trade Minister Alain Juppé had also expressed his support for the deployment of UN observers to help protect civilians from repression by the regime, which, according to him, encapsulates itself in his "Paranoia".
A planned new meeting of the League is scheduled for tomorrow in Rabat to discuss the implementation of the plan for the crisis rise adopted on 2 November, but in particular the controversial, expected withdrawal of military troops from the besieged cities and the liberation of detained demonstrators.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov classified the Arab League’s decision yesterday as “incorrect” in order to avoid advocating possible sanctions against Damascus, although China had already advised Syria to implement the crisis exit plan.
Italy
Monti urges markets to be patient and Italy to be willing to sacrifice
Mario Monti, future Italian head of government, has demanded a little more time from the markets to form his staff and implement a program that "victims" demand to regain credit lost during the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former EU Commissioner had held a negotiation with the political parties yesterday before today’s meeting of trade unions and employers.
It was his task to convene a cabinet in parliament, which is composed relatively strictly of external technocrats.
“Monti spoke of an important programme with a number of victims,” said Francesco Nucara, MP of one of the numerous smaller parliamentary groups participating in the talks after meeting with the incumbent President of the Council.
Gianfranco Fini, president of the Chamber of Deputies, had, for his part, called for Mario Monti to put a vote of confidence in Parliament until Friday to make sure the new government has sufficient support.
The talks will culminate in the presentation by M. Monti of a list of deletions, which will undoubtedly range from a dozen ministers to the head of state Giorgio Napolitano.
M. Monti commented that yesterday’s nervousness of the stock exchange and bond markets demanded their time.
In "a democracy there are certain deadlines" to prepare a government and a government program, he stressed, under the remark that it was "certain that the markets will show themselves in a prudent and prudent manner".
His order by the President was initially welcomed by the markets, but the unrest had intensified again, especially after an unexpected industrial production decline in the Eurozone in September.
The incumbent prime minister should establish a staff consisting mainly of technocrats, although he had stressed that he would like to include "politicians".
The new government should only exist until 2013, the date of the next parliamentary elections, he estimated.
According to Gianfranco Fini, the president of the Chamber of Deputies, the new government should receive parliamentary credentials by Friday.
Since taking up his role, M. Monti has committed himself to working urgently in the interests of making Italy a "new protagonist" in Europe.
A spokesman for the European Commission, Olli Rehn, said: “Our diagnosis of the Italian economy does not change itself, taking into account the new government.”
The EU, which is convinced that Rome will not achieve its objective of budgetary compensatory measures in 2013 despite the austerity plans taken up in recent months, has, in particular, applied for new austerity measures.
Emma Marcegaglia, "Chief of the Chiefs" of Italy, who will meet on Tuesday at Monti, also insists on the need for economic growth", since a country that has no growth to show, cannot respect deficit figures".
M. Monti, known for his competence and independence as EU Commissioner (1994-2004), stands for an "epoch change" of Italy after 17 years "Berlusconism"; the "Professor" symbolizes the "challenge of trustworthiness" as well as a "other Italy", according to the editorial authors.
The great unknown here is the longevity of his staff.
President Napolitano would like to prevent early elections, as Italy now has 200 billion euros of government bonds to pay until April 2012.
Russian scientist helps Iran's nuclear program
A Russian scientist, Vyacheslav Danilenko, helped Iran develop a nuclear-weapon explosive capsule, a US NGO specializing in nuclear risks confirmed on Monday.
The Institute for Science and International Security ISIS is based on the recently published report of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents issued by this UN agency to investigate this scientist.
Last week, the AIEA announced its "serious concern" on the occasion of a "possible military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear program.
According to an in-depth study of AIEA documents by ISIS, Danilenko, who was born in 1934, had apparently worked for three decades in a Soviet military nuclear center in Chelyabinsk (Ural) since the beginning of the 1960s and was involved in the production of synthetic diamonds produced by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he was said to have left the centre to found a company in Kiev that makes "Nano diamonds".
The economic difficulties of his company had led him to contact the Iranian embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
Before returning to Russia, he then participated in an Iranian program from 1996 to 2002.
In its latest report, the AIEA mentioned "strong indications that Iran's development" of a nuclear explosives system "was supported by the work of a foreign expert who was not only highly versed in this technique, but also, as a state member of the agency announced, his entire professional career had been working directly on this technology on the military nuclear energy program of his country of origin."
Anti-Islamic crimes and crimes have increased by 50%
Crimes and crimes directed against Muslims increased by 50% from 2009 to 2010, while other racist or religiously motivated violent crimes, according to Monday’s FBI statistics, have either declined slightly over the same period or only increased slightly.
According to this data, the total number of violent crimes committed against Muslims rose from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e. by 49%, while a 13% increase in violent crimes against Catholics, a 4% decrease against Jews of crime and a global increase of 14% in anti-religious crimes and crimes.
The total number of “hate-motivated crimes” rose to 6,628 in very weak terms, including 47.3% due to racial differences and 20% due to religious differences from motivated crimes, the FBI said.
"After a weakening in 2009, it is alarming to see these crimes and crimes grow again," the human rights organization Human Rights First stressed.
"Human Rights First had long stressed that the violence directed against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, should be considered a serious violation of human rights," said Paul Legendre, the organization's executive director.
“The American government can and should do more to combat these abuses,” he added, adding that this could be done by improving the police attitude toward “hate crimes.”
The "hate crime" is a legacy of American federal law from the era of the struggle for civil rights.
This legislation was passed after the death of Martin Luther Kings to punish violent acts directed against race, skin color, religion or descent and now also involves crimes of sexual affiliation.
Twitter is changing the platform and is becoming more and more like Facebook
On Monday, the microblogging website Twitter introduced changes to the presentation of its platform, in particular to enable its users to observe the activities of those who follow their posts, which makes the service more similar to that of Facebook.
The new tab "Activity" and another "Name" allow better readable live tracking of the activities of other "Twitters", the Internet user whose messages ("Tweets") you track and who tracks your messages.
This allows you to find out if they allow you to track your messages, whether they subscribe to new posts, favor certain messages, etc.
This new Twitter menu offer had been tested by a small percentage of users before its general Internet spread on Monday "in August," Twitter spokeswoman Carolyn Penner told AFP.
Twitter was known for its little instinctive functioning, stocked with something esoteric-looking wording (RT to refer back to someone else's post). followfriday pour recommander de suivre un autre utiliseur) faisant le bonheur des initiés, s'ouvre ainsi a un public plus large avec un utiliseeur)
Users in the network debated this innovation with the help of certain "tweets" via the Internet.
“This is useless, intrusive and looks too much like Facebook,” writes @jemb123.
"The "Activity" feature will help me better track certain elements of my Flux tweeter," @dannykronstrom said.
Austria
Entry of a "Golden Budget Rule" into the Constitution
On Tuesday, the government of the Great Social Democratic/Christian Democratic Coalition in power in Austria decided to include a "Golden Budget Rule" in the constitution to reduce public deficits and also to avoid any degradation by rating agencies in Austria's top-bonity (AAA).
It was the social democratic chancellor Werner Faymann himself who had announced this decision of the outcome of the Council of Ministers, although the public Austrian public debt is at 74.6%, far above the criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty of 60%, but well below the debt level of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
“If Austria’s ability to pay had not fallen to a blow from AAA on AA+, we would have to pay three billion euros in additional interest each year,” Michael Spindelegger, vice-chancellor and Christian Democratic foreign minister, argued.
Austria also calls for the Brussels Summit of Eurozone Member States to be held on 26 October: the Heads of State or Government had then called for the inclusion of public deficit reductions by the end of 2012 as well as a return to public balance of accounts in the Constitution or by the adoption of an equivalent law.
The measure taken by the Austrian government is similar to the "German model", since Germany had been the first European country to incorporate such a "rule" into the constitution.
By 2017, the structural budget deficit should decrease by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year, and by 2017, the state’s structural budget deficit should not exceed the 0.35% limit of GDP, whereas regional states and municipalities should have balanced households.
The objective is to eliminate the budgetary debt under the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Agreement in the 2020/21 horizon.
Stronger Yen
Noda threatens new intervention in currency markets
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that if the yen continued to rise, Japanese power would again intervene in the currency markets.
“If we find excessive volatility in the yen’s exchange rate, we will intervene just as we did last time,” Noda said.
On Tuesday, the yen was once again up close to the historic levels that forced the Japanese authorities to intervene on October 31.
On that day, Tokyo had sold massive yen against dollars to lower the Japanese foreign exchange value, which is in the process of driving a new record value since 1945 against the dollar.
However, the yen has regularly risen above it, doped by purchases from investors who see the yen as a "return value" in these uncertain times of global economic downturn and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar fell below 77 yen on Tuesday, the euro slipped below the symbolic lat of 105 yen near the levels that triggered the last intervention.
Prior to the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar recorded around 120 yen, the euro more than 160 yen.
This wildfire of the Japanese motto harms the archipelago's exports, as it costs the "Made in Japan" products and reduces the income value drawn by Japanese companies from abroad, as they convert them into national currency.
"Japan is fighting for its reconstruction after the earthquake and tsunami on 11 March, which devastated the Tohoku region," said M. Noda, who fears that this cost of the yen could kill the weak recovery already in the bud.
With growth in the third quarter -1.5% compared to the previous quarter - for the first time this year, the third world economic power has regained traction thanks to the rapid export growth and consumption of the households "plombed" by the disaster.
However, the prime minister estimates that the yen’s cost does not reflect “the economic foundations of Japan.”
Finance Minister Jun Azumi, for his part, called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its Monetary Policy Committee on Tuesday, to take all possible measures to strengthen the Yen.
Hirohide Yamaguchi, deputy governor of the Institute, has, however, informed that the BoJ has already initiated "appropriate measures", stating that no additional currency loosening is to be expected on Wednesday.
On the occasion of the last meeting at the end of October, the central bank had increased its government bond purchases by 5,000 billion yen (47 billion euros) to cover the 55,000 billion yen (519 billion euros), which it had spent on various purchases of financial instruments to flood the liquidity market.
Eurozone:
Interest rates rise rapidly, stock exchanges make withdrawals
The risk of contagion of the debt crisis is constantly undermining the European key figures.
Despite the inauguration of the new heads of government in Greece and Italy, as well as the best growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of the weakened countries continue to increase.
The stock exchanges, which are still concerned about the stability of the eurozone, are also drifting a little further into negative areas this Tuesday, 15 November.
In Paris, the CAC lost 1.4% at 10 a.m. and dropped to 3,064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt fell by 0.4%, London by 0.1%.
"Due to the new tensions over the yields of government bonds in the eurozone in difficulty, global stock markets continue to issue some of their recent profits.
“Capital investors are nervous and aware of the risk of infection only too well,” said Terry Pratt, institutional broker at IG Markets, quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange, which in turn suffers from the renewed fear of market participants in terms of capacity in Europe that the debt crisis continues, had closed at a rate of 0.7%.
“Japan, like the rest of the world, has focused its eyes on Europe, and trade is moving on a limited variation corridor as long as investors have no evidence that the situation has stabilized,” says Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This resurgence of concern over the future of the eurozone is damaging the single currency that continues its bailout on Tuesday.
The euro has been at its lowest level for a month and a half.
By 10 a.m., the European currency was worth 1.3570 doller, so it dropped by 0.4%.
According to the stockbrokers, it has declined after the CDU, the party of Chancellor Angela Merkel, who had gathered in Congress on Monday, issued an application that, in particular, provides for the possibility for countries in difficulty to exit the eurozone without simultaneously leaving the European Union.
The Italian and Spanish rates are well below the 6% limit.
Loan interest rates in Italy and Spain remain at a very worrying level.
This Tuesday morning, the return on Italian bonds reached 6.85% on 10 years, the Spanish title matured to 6.2%.
These tensions in interest rates in the southern countries, but also in France, continue to feed the fears of investors.
Future Italian head of government Mario Monti called for more time from the markets to restore the situation in Italy threatened by debt paralysis.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos, in turn, confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone Summit on 27 October was "the main task" of his government.
Spain is in the visor of the markets, as the parliamentary elections take place in the country on Sunday.
The spread between the German and Spanish 10-year bonds has once again reached a new, historic high.
Expecting growth figures in the eurozone
Statistically, France recorded an economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter driven by household consumption, ergo a little better than the expected 0.3%.
However, the Federal Statistical Office INSEE had revised the base of the figures for the second quarter, with a decrease of 0.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
In fact, it is the fourth quarter that worries economic experts the most.
Germany, for its part, had a growth rate of 0.5% over the same period.
A first recalculation of the entire eurozone is expected at 11 a.m., with the EU Commission warning of the risk of a re-recession.
Energy policy:
Facts should win over dogmas
If there is an issue that cannot be dealt with on the basis of short-term considerations or emotions, this is certainly energy policy.
The availability and costs of electricity directly affect the purchasing power and the competitiveness of the companies.
It is reasonable to take an election meeting as an occasion to reflect on this issue and on the position of nuclear energy.
The debate will only bear fruit if it probes the overall economic, social and ecological consequences of the proposed options.
The French should base their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
Although there are 7 billion people on this planet, demographic evolution is driving a doubling of electricity demand by 2050, not a huge proportion of the world’s population should have to give up a vital element.
At the same time, the scarcity of fossil resources must be mitigated in order to continue to produce electricity without forgetting the imperative need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, an issue that has disappeared from the ecological debate, in order to fight against climatic irregularities.
The Fukushima accident does not alter any of these parameters.
Therefore, Germany continues to remain isolated in its decision to renounce nuclear power.
This is not the case in Belgium, which submits its decision to the need to find a substitute source capable of substitution, nor in Switzerland, which just intends to build only last-generation nuclear power plants.
The United Kingdom, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to name but a few states, continue to follow their projects with determination.
The United States, in turn, decided to join its park after Fukushima by relaunching the Three Mile Island plant, which had been shut down after the nuclear accident.
Even though the German model, which is geared towards renewable energy sources, is sometimes set as an example, the reality is contrary to the discourse.
The election in Berlin will be in the form of a reduction in the electricity price, an increase in energy dependence, particularly on Russia, due to the increased use of imported gas, an increase in CO2 emissions caused by gas and coal-fired power plants.
The totality of these unpleasant effects will become apparent within a few months.
The case of Denmark gives cause for thought.
Denmark, on the one hand, is a European leader in wind energy, from which it derives 30% of its electricity; on the other hand, it is one of the strongest users of coal and gas, used alternately with wind energy; as a result, its CO2 emissions and its electricity price are respectively 65% and 50% higher than the corresponding European average.
Thanks to the persistence of our energy policy, our neighbours pay a 40% higher electricity bill compared to our French households.
As the energy price in the globalised economy plays a key role in competitiveness as well as in the stability of industry on national soil, the French companies have an advantage in Europe because of the cheapest electricity.
Any significant reduction in nuclear power would therefore result in a strong increase in the price of energy, which would lead to the noble statements about the reindustrialization of our country and the defence of purchasing power becoming an illusion.
Surveys showed that this is a price that the vast majority of French people are not willing to pay as much as it shows resistance to the principle of this energy source.
Let’s face it, our country’s energy policy has enabled us to build an industry with 125.00 direct and 410,000 induced jobs.
Due to its strong export character, it brings a multitude of specialized small and medium-sized companies to the international markets and makes them the creators of countless jobs.
If France took the decision to step out of nuclear power, a large part of these SMEs would fall victim to it, and the annual 6 billion euros of investment goods and nuclear energy exports would shrink more and more.
Which electrician would hire an EPR designed to work for sixty years if the decline of its producer is pre-programmed?
To solve the energetic equation, one has to admit that there is just as little as a devil’s work a miracle tool for generating electricity.
The low-carbon solutions developed by Areva for the use of nuclear power and renewable energy testify to the complementarity of energy sources.
Maintaining the highest possible level of safety is an absolute imperative for nuclear power.
In France, we have a security agency that carries out uncompromising and transparent checks in existing works such as construction in Flamanville.
Their work teams, who have made a name for themselves because of their professionalism, are just obsessed with the security concept.
Within 50 years, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious incidents.
Only one, namely in Three Mile Island, has occurred under normal operating conditions; so it went without consequences for humans and the environment.
In Chernobyl, the drama was conjured up by reactor construction as well as inexhaustible human failure.
In Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident was caused by two natural disasters that never existed, causing the death of several tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will draw its lessons from this accident as it did after the two previous ones.
As a result of this approach, as well as a cooperation between the security authorities of the French and German operators and designers of nuclear power plants, the EPR is a design that enables it to resist such phenomena.
Since it is considered desirable for electrical engineers to build a nuclear power plant, a construction stop in Flamanville would be a fabulous gift to the competition of Areva and EDF by allowing them free path to take up the leadership position in the inevitable development of nuclear power.
It is essential and legitimate to look for the best energy bouquet for our country, but it would be irresponsible to have emotions, dogmas and party maneuvers dominate a debate that also determines the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or a chance for the economy?
The immigration policy led by Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from many angles - overloading of police, judicial and administrative bodies due to a policy subject to numbers, compatibility of this policy with the status of a "country of human rights", as France itself had titled itself.
Recently, the harassment of foreign students had shaped the weekly shows on the official side, the Minister of the Interior had casually announced (see Libération of 23 May) that France "did not need any talents, masons or waiters from abroad".
But this policy was rarely analyzed from an economic point of view.
There is a broad consensus on this issue between the right and the left.
On the right, the tone was struck by Jacques Chirac, who declared in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed, including over 2 million immigrated workers, should not be a problem for a country", on the left by Michel Rocard, who had explained in 1990, France "could not absorb all the poverty of the world".
The only difference is the degree of generosity.
The fear of the invasion of the national soil by hordes of Polish plumbers was shared in 2005 by both right and left.
From both camps the immigrants were perceived as a burden on the economy and French society.
The only difference is the degree of generosity that immigrants are willing to admit.
Francois Hollande is limited in his program to banalities that point out that partnership development allows us to solve our "migration problems".
This idea of immigration as a burden, as a problem, may have an impact on the elections; however, it is economically costly.
As economic experts Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron present us in a recently published work that summarizes the latest findings on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 p.), there is a broad consensus among the specialists regarding the positive impact of the immigrant flood on economic growth, wages and jobs.
Reducing immigration would defuse growth and harm the labour market situation.
The fears about the influence of migrants are based on the idea that they threaten to substitute the domestic workers, especially the less qualified ones, by exerting pressure on their wages.
Experience shows, however, that the immigrants are in fact much more complementary than the local wage earners, as they are mainly engaged in occupations in sectors that are technically unburdened.
The low-skilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract local wage earners, the more skilled among immigrants work in dynamic sectors where training is not matched to the job offer.
Positive wage effect
Just as a surgeon would have difficulty working in a country where there is a shortage of anaesthetists, this complementarity also has a positive effect between locals and migrants on the influx of immigrants on wages and the domestic labour market situation.
Giovanni Peri has calculated in this way that a 1% increase in immigrant floods will result in a included, long-term increase in real wages between 0.6% and 0.9%.
And this without taking into account the fact that the diversity of ideas and economic growth brought by immigrants is beneficial (highly proportion of native immigrants among American Nobel laureates; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants also contribute net to the social systems, in the European countries on average at around 1% of the total household.
The World Labour Organization estimates, for example, that a person who immigrates to Germany at the age of 30 brings in an average net contribution to the public budget over his lifetime (income minus expenditure) of around 150,000 euros.
Nicolas Sarkozy, at the start of his mandate, wished to bring about the missing intersections "with his teeth".
However, these said teeth, which should deter immigrants, achieved exactly the opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, now it remains to think through European democracy
Democracy is a valuable asset; it is also a sensitive asset.
The European continent should be able to remember for itself who, according to its invention in Athens more than two thousand years ago, had suffered the entire 20th century over the tragedies of the First World War, totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the Gulag, but also Francos in Spain, Salazars in Portugal and the Supreme in Greece.
Some had probably believed that it was enough to exercise the right to vote, in the most direct way possible, in order to see democracy conquer its enemies once and for all.
It has been known since Napoleon "the little one" that it was a feature of the attitude of mind.
The universal suffrage, which is the necessary condition of democracy, is not sufficient for this and can just as well become the "repressive instrument", as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot put it at the time.
No, democracy requires far more: a public space, a public mind, values, an organization, separation and control of powers, an education, enlightenment, economic and social community spirit, a jurisprudence.
The crisis in Europe in which we live is an economic crisis, but it is also a political and democratic crisis.
The change of mind of the Greek True False Referendum would have had a double-minded character in this respect: once the need for a powerful return of politics, on the other hand, but also those of the disturbing feeling of its impossibility, of its inappropriation.
This ambivalence should be considered outdated.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle have shifted today, and that the Republican soldiers, or at least most of them, are no longer aiming in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain in order to push for the success of the national referendum, which was organized according to the needs and in the wrong order.
A release for the European sole ruler or a jump with blind eyes into the void of nationalist withdrawal: a great choice for the citizen!
No, we want Hackebeil, but a collective task, out of full law, clarified and constant, an election and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal - by the way, we no longer know where to end the enumeration - as there is only one crisis, and this prevails in Europe.
It is the whole of Europe that bows to the dictates of markets and credit rating agencies, which suffers from its impotence and its lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that is humiliated at the international level.
One is concerned about the transfer of sovereignty towards Europe - it is the whole of Europe that is gradually losing its sovereignty, and thus every single one of the nations affiliated to it.
The urgency is to give people’s sovereignty back to the leadership of the European project.
Because it is up to the Europeans to reduce the burden of their debt, to free themselves from the markets and to start a future through investment.
The exit from the crisis has decisions at European level on the condition that cannot be made without total democratic legitimacy, without surely leading us to ruin.
After this proposal by Jacques Delors and the Socialists has been fought over for a long time, everyone today is pushing for European economic governance.
I agree.
But imagine this without political integration and a stronger democracy - as it advances citizens - would be another folly and another dead end.
We need to take on a new stage of European construction.
In order to create the republic in France, it was necessary to “create” republicans.
The revolution of interests alone could not do enough here.
This instruction remains valid.
We need to create a Europe that is better integrated at an economic level.
This can only be achieved by creating a more democratic Europe politically, a truly European people's sovereignty.
We need Europeans to create Europe.
"Contactless" Chip Cards Become General Goods
The World Fair for Chip Cards opens its doors on Tuesday in Villepinte near Paris with an optimistic attitude.
According to Eurosmart, the year 2011 should actually end with an 11% increase in worldwide sales of microprocessor chips (EC cards, SIM card phones), with more than 6 billion units sold.
The most important segment here is the contactless technology that enables payments in public transport or payment of purchases by simply holding the card to a reader.
Compared to the 320 million previously sold, this year 460 million contactless chip cards were to be sold worldwide!
Their market share was expected to increase further in 2012 (580 million expected units) and represent over 10% of the global chip card market (6.925 million cards).
Europe is gaining ground with regard to contactless payments after it has been lagging behind the Asia-Pacific region for a long time.
Some 26 million Visa cards are already equipped with this functionality, and 75,000 payment terminals accept it.
In France, the beginnings are rather modest: only 400,000 contactless visas have been distributed.
However, the consumer markets are making steam.
Carrefour has therefore issued 2.5 million contactless pass MasterCards this year.
In order to move at a higher speed, it is now necessary for banks to equip their customers with these cards.
“Two large French financial institutions have committed to systematically handing out bank cards to their customers in the future, equipped with contactless chips,” said Gérard Nébouy, Director General of Visa Europe France.
Banks test payment by mobile phone
However, this is only a first step on the way to the means of payment of the future: the mobile phone.
A negligible percentage of devices have so far been equipped with the NFC (Near Field Communication) technology necessary to carry out these transactions.
"They're in default".
"But they should at least experience a real upward trend next year."
“We expect to sell 80 to 120 million units worldwide in 2012,” said Marc Bertin, Eurosmart’s chairman.
But the banks are taking the initiative.
The Crédit Agricole announced yesterday the start of a test run in Caen, which will run from December to next June.
The iPhones of some 200 customers and employees are to be equipped with a capsule that allows contactless payment.
The BPCE operates a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the Société Générale had also announced yesterday that it would prepare the market launch of an offer that would allow its customers contactless payment by mobile phone.
Terrorist front understands itself, from the Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the relations between al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The long suspected relations between the terrorist group al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram seem to confirm.
On Sunday, Algerian Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel himself confirmed that Algiers had now "acquired certainty".
"The way in which both organizations and the relationships between intelligence agencies are working together in a clear way," he explained without going into further detail.
Paris seems to be doing a similar analysis.
The investigation into the kidnapping of two Frenchmen in Niger last January has sparked a clash.
Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory, kidnapped in a Niamey restaurant by supporters of the Aqmi, are said to have been killed the following day at the same time as several of their kidnappers on the occasion of an operation carried out by the French special forces.
French and Nigerian investigators want to find several phone chips in the rubble at the site that belonged to the terrorists.
Counter-terrorism
The analysis of the telephone calls leads to several interlocutors stationed in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), investigators are particularly interested in the numbers of two interlocutors: one number leads to a Nigerian who had long been in Maiduguri, a city in the north of Nigeria, the cradle of Boko Haram; the other leads to a man who is considered to be close to the Aqmi and the sect.
"This is progress, but you have to wait for more clear evidence before you can talk about an operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Harem".
"It's conceivable, though."
"It has been known for years that the sect has been attracting financial and intellectual support from Au<0xCE><0xB2>en and that it is increasingly active," said Nigerian researcher Kunle Amuwo.
In recent months, these "support services" have become increasingly apparent in their course, as have Boko Harem's speeches and operating modes, which now point to the attraction of suicide bombers and the use of ever more complex explosives that carry the same handwriting as those used by Aqmi.
The International Community, to begin with at Washington, has been putting pressure on Abuja since then to take account of the problems caused by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have, in fact, long regarded the group as a community of illuminates, which need not be given special attention.
Fast success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri, near a mosque, school and fundamentalist Iman Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram - meaning "Western education is a disgrace" in Haoussa - pursues the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim North of Nigeria.
In this middleless region, the association is experiencing rapid success.
She politicizes and insists on strict adherence to Sharia law, while her affiliated activists are engaged in the fight against the godless central government.
The activists initially target churches, bars and authorities.
In 2009, Boko Haram’s activists were particularly active in their intensified attacks against the Commissioners.
Abuja’s reaction, however, is as usual indifferent.
The army surrounds the city, counting 800 dead.
Mohammed Yusuf, who was imprisoned, was killed in prison.
As a result, the sect becomes increasingly radical and leaves its strongholds in the north.
Last Christmas, she confessed to an assassination in Jos demanding 80 lives, then another in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram is blamed for a suicide attack that occurred in the secured police headquarters in Abuja - the first of its kind.
In August, the United Nations’ local headquarters will become the primary international target.
The formation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which is supposed to lead from Mauritania to Nigeria to Somalia, has since alarmed all security experts.
While the Aqmi occupied Mali and the Niger, the Somalis of al-Shabaab operating in Kenya, Boko Harem appears to be a new threat in the center of the continent.
Last week, Alain Juppé warned against Boko Harem in Nigeria on the occasion of a conversation with President Goodluck Jonathan and showed himself ready to "share all the information".
The world of Republican presidential candidates
Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry rival in simplification and ignorance of China, Iraq, and assistance to Israel.
Can a crisis-weakened America lead a complex world with simple, not to say: simple ideas?
If you listen to the Republican presidential candidate like that, voters could almost get that impression.
For several days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and their co-workers have repeatedly made their thunderous statements and statements regarding foreign policy, traditional Republican focus.
Over China, Iran, and Israel aid fall – often in no way substantiated – slogans.
Mitt Romney, the highest-ranking member of the Grand Old Party, threatened to cite the Chinese in front of the WTO, accusing them of "currency manipulation" - a leading issue in an America that has been moved to Asia by the emigration of entire industries.
He said this would imply the launch of a trade war.
Jon Huntsman, a former ambassador to China under Obama and the only candidate who seems to have a mature vision of foreign policy, has almost cut the air with regard to his gesture flattering emotions.
He had called for a firm but constructive exchange of views with Beijing (also Obama’s current stance).
But Huntsman is not heard, as he stagnates in the depths of opinion polls.
Reagan's Image
Romney had also vowed military strikes against Iran in case the sanctions to stop the nuclear program fail.
"If I'm elected, I'll stop Iran," he said.
"If Obama is re-elected, they get the bomb".
He also promised Israel increased military assistance and accused Obama of remaining guilty of this partner’s obligations.
The entrepreneur Herman Cain, second-highest-ranked candidate, is in turn showing a disgraceful lack of documents.
Recently, he called for countering the Chinese military threat, as Beijing "trying to develop a nuclear power" - and seemed to be paying attention to the fact that China has been in possession of military nuclear weapons since 1964!
Texas governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and calls for military strikes against Iran, pretends to be willing to employ the U.S. Army in Mexico against drug cartels.
Obama’s 2009 ban on torture of suspected terrorists was also endorsed by Cain, Perry and the candidacy of Michele Bachmann.
One is far away from John McCain, the Republican candidate in 2008, an au<0xCE><0xB2>political heavyweight.
The current presidential counterparts opposed, Reagan also had simple ideas and, despite all this, won the Cold War.
They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and had to give water to his wine, as far as the topic of anti-terrorism was concerned.
They rightly insist on the failure of his na<0xC3><0xAF>ve dialogue with Iran, the premature withdrawal of his "boy" from Iraq, his indecisiveness in Libya, which also earned him the reputation of weakness.
This hostility, however, is not quite so unforced.
The population rather appreciates the positive balance of national security under Obama, which Bin Laden has turned off.
Since Iraq, it has been wary of military interventions that lead to paralysis.
And Obama surprises more appropriately by arguing that America must be rebuilt economically to revitalize its leadership.
Nord Stream, new gateway to Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream gas pipeline, which runs on the Baltic Sea seabed and connects western Europe directly with Russia, has been put into operation.
It is designed to provide gas for an equivalent of 30 million households.
The Russian gas giant Gazprom wanted to celebrate this event with splendor and glory.
Over 500 invited guests, including four heads of state and government, attended the inauguration of the new Nord Stream gas pipeline, which connects Russia and Germany directly below sea level last Tuesday on the Baltic Sea coast under orchestral sound and at the gourmet buffet.
German Chancellor Angelika Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Fillon and his counterpart Mark Rutte from the Netherlands have symbolically jointly turned the wheel of the valve, which transports Russian gas into the Western European network.
With the new gas transmission, 27.5 billion cubic meters of additional Russian gas per year will be delivered to Western Europe by a first 1,224 km long pipeline connecting the Saint Petersburg region with Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
A second pipeline, which allows a total supply of 55 billion cubic meters of gas - the equivalent of French total consumption - will be completed by the end of 2012.
And you already have the eventuality of building a third line on your own track.
For Gazprom, the timely and precise completion of this enormous building looks like a victory.
The project was highly controversial in Poland and the Baltic States.
The Nord-Stream pipeline will enable direct gas delivery to Germany, avoiding any route by third countries (Poland or Ukraine) on land.
For this reason, these two countries are losing a little of their power: it is now becoming more difficult for them to exert pressure on Russia by threatening to close access to Western European markets.
Warsaw, most engaged in the debate, was not shy away from comparing the North Stream pipeline with a "new German-Soviet pact" in connection with the alliance between Hitler and Stalin for the occupation of Poland in 1939.
This means that the issue is politically highly sensitive.
Western Europe has gained even greater security of supply through the support of this Russian project.
However, this is at the cost of de-energizing Europe, as the project has broken a gap between Western and Eastern Europeans.
In less than five years, Russia has managed to enforce its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, which have strong gas consumption and whose gas deposits are at a disadvantage.
"This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that connects us in an organic way," Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Fillon confirmed at the inauguration of the gas pipeline, pointing out the extent to which the major gas contracts are also important from a political and economic point of view.
All this explains the broad smile of the numerous Gazprom managers represented in Lubmin regarding the gas supply line.
The construction of this gas transmission is also an outstanding technique.
The underwater pipe is made of steel with concrete sheathing to protect it from ship anchors.
It rests on the seabed, about 200 m deep.
During its construction, mining fields dating from the Second World War had to be removed.
"About a hundred mines had to be carefully removed or destroyed," said Jens Müller, spokesman for Nord Stream.
In addition, increased measures had to be taken to protect the fauna and flora.
The line is a long line of metal, heavy like 242 Eiffel towers, which is not interrupted by anything over the entire length: neither valves nor maintenance stations.
A control platform was planned off the coast of Sweden, but the project managers refused, as the Swedes had little hope of seeing a Russian state company permanently settle on the level of their coasts.
“In the event of an accident, we close the gas passage in less than a minute,” Jens Müller said.
In the event of a leak, the gas located in the gas transmission thus escapes into the air.
However, this case is considered unlikely by the designers as the weld seams were estimated to withstand a leak per 100,000 years.
State monitoring of the gas transmission is ensured both by an underwater robot controlled for external observation purposes by a seagoing vessel, as well as by a device circulating inside the gas transmission.
It has the shape of a cigar, with a diameter of one meter, is introduced into the interior of the pipeline and is moved through the gas pressure.
After three full days of moving through the line at a speed of 3 meters per second, the device provides the most accurate information on possible deformations of the metal upon arrival.
The gas transmission was designed to work for fifty years without even having to undergo the slightest repair.
The gas circulation is easily ensured by pressure.
This is 200 bar at the access point, 100 bar at the exit point.
Five companies have united their forces to realize this project.
However, the pipeline remains in the hands of Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares.
Furthermore, the German companies E. ON and BASF (each 15.5%), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (each 9%) are affiliated here.
These five companies have formed a corporate community called Nord Stream, which is responsible for the construction and operation of the gas pipeline.
It is based in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then leased the entire capacity of its gas transport to this company, subject to a twenty-year renewable contract.
"Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, no matter how large the amount of gas that is actually transported is," Jens Müller said.
The financing of gas pipeline construction was secured to 30% by shareholders and to 70% by bank loans.
The total cost of work should be EUR 7.4 billion for both pipelines.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment total was 240 million.
However, minority shareholders are willing to recover their expenses, since Gazprom alone bears the liability risk.
The gas pipeline emerges from the Baltic Sea on a sandy, pine-wooded stretch of coastline near Lubmin.
The 4.5-metre-high valves form the gas exit gate.
Sensors measure pressure, temperature and other key figures of the incoming gas before it is forwarded to the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal has been supplied with a million cubic meters of Russian gas per passing hour.
At full capacity, this would be 3 million cubic meters per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine, a brand notebook.
Founded by an Italian company about fifteen years ago, Moleskine now wants to give the writing a new style again.
It has a flair of adventure, hours spent writing with candlelight.
Moleskine's notebook is easily recognizable, with its black, rectangular cover, its rubber band, the eggshell-colored sides, as aged over time.
However, the Moleskine notebook, as we know it today, was created in 1997.
Italian company Modo Modo, which is based in Milan, decided at the time to launch a differentiated design notebook.
Maria Sebregondi, then the company’s specialist consultant, is tasked with the market launch of the new product.
The notebook was inspired by an ancient production technique called Mole Skin, which refers to a cotton sack used for upholstery, for example.
This type of notebook was in high demand among writers and travelers.
“Moleskine has revived an old and almost forgotten object that was considered an icon of avant-garde artist until the 20th century,” explains Maria Sebregondi, now brand manager at Modo Modo.
Success comes.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% and established with a sales volume of 12.7 million units.
This is far from the usual production of the first few years in which only 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskine passes the Italian border and is exported to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to create a phantom image of buyers, as the notebook inspires businessmen as well as students and professionals.
Moleskine has the image of cosmopolitan, cultured and open-minded customers.
The small Italian company, which had 12 employees in its early days, now employs over 100 people and has two offices since 2008, one in Milan and the other in New York.
The company distributes its notebooks in bookstores, on internet portals such as Fnac, in small boutiques of the city centers and is committed to asserting its identity.
“We have followed the zeitgeist and his new writing needs, which persists despite the upswing of emails,” Maria Sebregondi said.
This cultural trait is accompanied by the development of the company Moleskine: Recently, the brand has launched an exposition called "Detour" in which architects and artists exhibited their own notebooks.
In August, at the Locarno Film Festival, the company also launched a leopard-patterned cover.
Moleskine benefited from its success and this cultural zeitgeist and understood how to diversify its products: bags, calendars, fillers, computer cases... The brand has the full range of articles.
In autumn 2006, Modo Modo was acquired by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, today’s Syntegra Capital, and thus opened a new chapter in the history of Moleskine.
Why does the unemployment rate of disabled workers remain at such a high level?
About 19% of people with disabilities are looking for a job.
Today begins the "15th week of work for the disabled".
Despite a targeted public policy introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate among disabled people is always twice as high as the average: 19% versus 9% of the total population.
Disheartening?
"No," emphasizes <0xC3><0x89>ric Blanchet, Director General of the Adapt Association, which organizes the "Week of Work for the Disabled."
“The progress made within fifteen years is considerable.”
"At that time, the unemployment rate was not twice, but three times as high."
"Nevertheless, there's still a lot to do."
However, it has to be said that for the disabled, there are still numerous obstacles before they get a job.
It is more common for the elderly: 37% are older than 50 years (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% of them do not have a high school diploma and there are only 10,000 disabled among the 2.3 million students with higher education degrees.
In the end, long-term unemployment is also very widespread: 53% among the disabled compared with 38% on the overall average.
In short, there are so many criteria that make it difficult to start working again and that form the "core of the problem", says Christian Grapin, Director General of Tremplin, an association founded in 1992 that helps companies to recruit disabled workers.
So much for the actual brakes.
Remains the unspoken, the mental attitudes, which, while certain, but still slowly progress.
A study conducted in April by the association IMS-Entreprendre for the journal La Cité stated that the managers surveyed have “a weak level of knowledge regarding disabled people” that is “overrepresented” by people in wheelchairs, mentally or intellectually disadvantaged.
As a result, private companies with more than 20 employees still have a long way to go in order to achieve the employment target of 6% of disabled workers, which was laid down in a 1987 law.
These latter figures, dating back to 2008, refer to a quotient of 2.6%.
“We are now at around 3%,” reports Pierre Blanc, Director General of Agefiph, the organization that is tasked with collecting contributions from companies that violate this law.
The proof: the number of "fees paid" establishments has decreased, as has the sum of the amounts paid between 2007 and 2011, from 59,000 to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 law, which provides for contribution increases, created a strong pressure on the companies," said Pierre Blanc.
"But this improvement also expresses a real insight, especially in the large groups of companies."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of the establishments between 20 and 49 employees employ disabled workers, while companies with 100 to 199 employees employ 82%.
Hazard: "What luck"
Even before they offered the "Blue Tuesday evenings (20:45) the forehead, Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens had not concealed their pleasures that brought them the game of friendship.
It would be too far-fetched to claim that there had been a secret agreement between them, but the picture speaks symbolic volumes.
Sitting side by side on the stage of the Stade de France, George Leekens and Eden Hazard could have made peace.
Five months after the temperamental gesture of his attacking player against Turkey, the Belgian national coach had reaped nothing but praise for his person.
"I am very pleased with Eden, his progress and the fact that he is Belgian".
"I want to look forward," the native Liller assures himself.
As for the contrast between his portrayal in Club and Nationalelf"It's a unit that justifies everything."
"In Lille I am all year round, which is not the case in Belgium".
"It's time for me to get started".
Hazard will come to Saint-Denis, brought in Friday night against Romania regarding the match against France, to finally "shine".
However, without neglecting the note of "pleasure".
He has been firing the French national team since the age of 7 and led his victorious campaigns between 1998 and 2000.
“I was always supported,” he said.
This inevitably helps to reinforce the "unique" character of this encounter even more.
So much in advance:"Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) will be there," he said.
"We just walked across the road".
"To play against them means great luck!"
Leekens, for his part, sounded with kindness "Stolz".
"The pride of performing a gala match".
"Stolz" also to confirm - in his capacity as "neighbors" - that France "has again become a very high-level team", and that little more than a year after the trauma of Knysna.
“Laurent Blanc did a damn good job,” he said enthusiastically.
Although Belgium will be missing in the next European Championship, the technician is very likely to see the plane share with the Blues (the French national elf) ... towards Brazil in 2014.
"We little Belgians are coming out big," he stressed.
"We're about to plan a thing, the players are ambitious, they're hungry."
"You will notice this in the upcoming games". The game against France included.
Portugal very confident
The Portuguese team of Paulo Bento is looking forward to the return match against Bosnia at 22:00 this Tuesday in Lisbon with great optimism.
Both teams had missed the point of play.
"At the end of these 90 minutes we will be a happy team and above all a happy country".
Paulo Bento is already seen in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is not the slightest hint of doubt that "La Selec<0xC3><0xA7>ao", his national team, for which he has been responsible since September 2010, will qualify for the 2012 European Championship.
For Portugal, this means only 90 minutes of happiness.
But there is a match to play, and to serve off an opponent, namely Bosnia.
Given the backlash (0-0) on Friday in the hell of Zenica, it seems obvious that the dice have not fallen yet.
Portugal clearly dominated the game for more than an hour, but the team was unable to put down the important stamp that would have taken the pressure off it.
"This is a good result, but it carries some risk because we haven't scored an away goal."
At home, however, in their brightly shining Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced to beat themselves in front of an audience that should be just as hot at the game, even if the game was naturally announced as "very scarce," said the optimistic, yet clairvoyant Bento.
“We expect a very tight match, but we are completely convinced that we can win the upper hand,” explained the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
“We still have a 50% chance of being there at the 2012 European Championships,” said Carlos Queiroz, the successor.
The draw on Friday in Bosnia forces the Portuguese to score and win a goal.
A draw can already suffice for Bosnians, who also need a gate.
“This is a good result, but it carries some risk because we haven’t scored an away goal,” Bento said.
“We will compete against a team that has high technical qualities and has players with many individual qualities,” he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese intended to exert maximum pressure on the Bosnians at the beginning in order "to give them no time to think."
A good idea, provided that it is put into practice this time.
