Politicians in Wales fear to "like fools"
There was dismay among certain members of the Welsh National Assembly over a proposal that their title should be changed to MWPs (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
It has arisen because of plans to change the name of the Assembly to Welsh Parliament (the Welsh Parliament).
AMs from across the political spectrum are concerned that the name change could give rise to ridicule.
A Labour party member said his group was concerned because "it rhymes with Twp and Pwp".
To readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means silly, and pwp means shit.
A member of the Plaid Cymru party said that the group as a whole "was not satisfied" and had proposed alternatives.
A Welsh conservative said that his group was "open" to the name change, but noted that there is only a short verbal leap from the MWP to the Muppet (foals).
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced in the same way as the letter u is pronounced in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently putting together a bill on the introduction of name changes, said: "The final decision on denominations that Members of Parliament will receive, of course, is up to the Members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh National Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation of the proposals, with broad support for calling the Assembly a Welsh Parliament (Welsh Parliament).
With regard to the title of the AMs, the Commission preferred Welsh Parliament Members or WMPs, but the MWP was given the greatest support in a public consultation.
AMs are apparently proposing alternative options, but the struggle to reach agreement can prove difficult for the President of the Assembly, Elin Jones, who is expected to put together a bill on the changes within a few weeks.
The reform bill contains other changes to the way the Assembly works, including rules on the disqualification of AMs and the composition of the committee system.
The AMs get the final vote on what to call them when the bill is debated.
Macedonians hold a vote to change the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The vote is being held in an attempt to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour constitutes a claim on Greece's territory and has long protested against Macedonia's attempts to become a member of the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov is opposed to the vote and says he will undermine the vote.
Supporters of the vote, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply a price paid to become a member of the EU and NATO.
The clocks in St. Martin's are silent while the churches in Harlem are fighting
“The older people I spoke to said that in the old days there was a bar and a church on every corner,” Mr Adams said.
“Today, there are none of the parts.”
He said it's understandable that the bars are disappearing.
“People are socializing in other ways these days,” he said.
“Bars no longer make up the neighborhood’s living rooms, where people enter on a daily basis.”
In relation to churches, he worries that the money raised to sell assets won’t last long and that they are “early or later back where they started.”
He adds that churches could be replaced by apartment complexes that are full of the kind of people who do not help the neighborhood’s recurring retreats.
“The overwhelming majority of people who buy condos in these buildings are white,” he says, “and it breathes further into the development where these churches eventually close completely because it is unlikely that most of the people who move into the condos will become members of the churches.”
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis – the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin’s a decade later.
The original Methodist congregation moved out in the 1930s.
A black congregation that had worked nearby took over the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation under John Howard Johnson, who headed a boycott of stores on 125th Street, one of the primary shopping streets in Harlem that would not hire or promote blacks.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but when Father Johnson's parishioners made plans to restore the building, they ordered the bell game.
Priest David Johnson, father Johnson's son and successor in St. Martin's, proudly called the game "the bells of the poor."
The expert who played the clock game in June called it something else: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first clock game in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger clock game at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr Merriweather said that St. Martin's did not find a replacement for him.
What has unfolded in St. Martin's over the past few months has been a complicated tale of architects and entrepreneurs, some of them obtained by church leaders, others by the diocese.
The Congregational Council – the parish’s leading body, consisting of leading laymen – wrote to the diocese in July about concerns that the diocese would “try to push forward the expenditure” to the congregational council, even though the congregational council had not been involved in hiring the architects and contractors that the diocese sent in.
Some members of the congregation complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark injures 13-year-old on diving trip after lobsters in California
A shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy on Saturday when he dived for lobsters in California on the first day of the lobster season, officials say.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and then along with a group paddled over to him to help him out of the water.
Hammel says that he thought it was just enthusiasm to have caught a lobster, but then he realized that the boy was shouting, "I was bitten!
I was bitten!”
"All his collarbones were torn up," said Hammel, he saw when he came to the boy.
"I cried that everyone should come out of the water, 'There's a shark in the water!'" added Hammel.
The boy was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is reported in critical condition.
It is not known what kind of shark was attacked.
Lifeguard Larry Giles said at a media briefing that a shark had been seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was not considered a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to his upper torso.
Officials closed access to the beach on the stretch from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for safety reasons and to conduct investigations.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to take on the beauty market in the UK
Sainsbury's competes with Boots, SuperDrug and Debenhams with rows of beauty products with special assistants in the style of department stores.
As part of a major effort to capture the UK’s beauty market, which has a value of <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion and continues to grow as fashion and home products decline. The larger ranges of beauty products are tested in 11 stores around the country and launched in several stores next year if they prove to be a success.
The investment in beauty products takes place as supermarkets look for new products for shelves that were previously used for televisions, microwaves and home products.
Sainsbury’s says they double their range of beauty products to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, which are introduced for the first time.
The existing assortments from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees also get more space with branded areas in the style of those seen in stores like Boots.
The supermarket also relaunchs a range of boutique makeup, so the majority of products are suitable for vegans – something increasingly required by younger shoppers.
In addition, the Fragrance Shop is testing stalls in two Sainsbury's stores, the first one opened in Croydon in southern London last week, and the second one opens in Selly Oak, Birmingham later in the year.
Online shopping and a development against the purchase of small amounts of food daily at local merchants means that supermarkets need to do more to get people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, director of Sainsbury's, has said stores will look like department stores, as the supermarket chain takes up the fight with the discount chains Aldi and Lidl by introducing more non-food services and goods.
Sainsbury's has introduced Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and has also introduced a number of Habitat outlets since they bought both chains two years ago. These initiatives have strengthened their grocery sales and have made purchases more profitable.
The supermarket’s previous attempts to update beauty and pharmacy departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint effort with Boots in the early 00's, but the collaboration ended with a dispute over how to distribute profits from pharmacies in supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold their pharmacy chain with 281 stores to Celesio, who owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 three years ago.
According to the strategy, Lloyds will play a role in the plan by adding an additional range of luxury skin care brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, said: "We have changed the appearance and decor of our range of beauty products to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be available to give advice.
Our range of brands is designed to suit all needs and the engaging environment and practical locations mean that we are now a compelling destination that challenges the old way of shopping.”
Peter Jones 'racing' after Holly Willoughby withdraws from deal to <0xC2><0xA3>11 million
Dragons' Den star Peter Jones left "racing" after television host Holly Willoughby withdraws from deal to <0xC2><0xA3>11 million with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby does not have time for their home product and accessories brand Truly.
The company was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
This Morning host, 37, went on Instagram to announce that she is leaving the project.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragons’ Den star Peter Jones furious after she pulls out of their lucrative lifestyle fire at the last minute – to focus on her own new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was “racing” when the popular TV woman at a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, said her new deal – worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million – meant she no longer had enough time for their home product and accessories brand Truly.
The company had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was tipped to double Willoughby's estimated wealth of GBP 11 million.
Willoughby, 37, went on Instagram to announce that she left Truly while Jones flew out of the UK to one of his vacation rentals.
One source said, "Truly was one of Holly's top priorities.
It should have been a long-term project that she would be dealing with over the next few decades.
Her decision to withdraw surprised everyone involved.
No one would believe what happened on Tuesday, it was so close to launch.
There is a warehouse full of goods in the headquarters in Marlow, which is already ready for sale."
Experts estimate that the announcement from This Morning host, which is among the UK’s highest-earning stars, could cost the company millions due to large investments in products – ranging from pillows to candles to clothing and home products – and the potential for further delays in its launch.
It can also be the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have had a close relationship with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined as Chairman of the Board in March.
The two couples go on vacation together, and Jones owns 40% of the shares in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will be M&S brand ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin as ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We couldn't comment on his business efforts."
Hard talk, "and then we fell in love"
He laughed at the criticism he would get from the news media to make a comment that “is not worthy of a president” and to be so positive towards the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in his parody of a news host.
"I gave up nothing."
He noted that Kim is interested in a meeting more after Trump proclaimed their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards nuclear disarmament of North Korea.
But negotiations on nuclear disarmament have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea’s top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see a “equivalent response” from the United States in relation to North Korea’s initial anti-denuclear action.
He noted that the United States is instead continuing with sanctions aimed at keeping the pressure running.
Trump adopted a more optimistic view of the speech at his election meeting.
“North Korea is doing very well,” he said.
“There was a war with North Korea.
Millions of people could have been killed.
Now we have a wonderful relationship.”
He said his attempts to improve relations with Kim had produced positive results — ending rocket tests, helping release hostages, and repatriating earthly remains from U.S. military personnel.
And he defended his unusual approach to Kim.
“It’s so easy to behave stately, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this packed arena, we’d have about 200 people standing there,” Trump said, pointing to the group right in front of him.
Indonesian tsunami and earthquake ravages island and kills several hundred
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, non-governmental organizations were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 per cent of the population of Lombok were homeless, no national emergency was declared, which is a prerequisite for the call for international relief.
"In many cases, unfortunately, it has been clear that they are not requesting international assistance, so it is a bit challenging," Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is putting together a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet certain that foreign employees will be able to work in the field.
Mr Sutopo, spokesman for the national emergency preparedness, said that Indonesian officials assessed the situation in Palu to see if international organisations would be allowed to contribute to the emergency response.
Because of the earthquakes that Indonesia is constantly being subjected to, the country is very poorly prepared for natural disasters.
Tsunami refuges have been built in Aceh, but they are not a common sight on other coastlines.
A warning had been issued in Palu, but apparently a tsunami is missing, and it has probably affected the death toll.
Even under the best conditions, it is challenging to travel between Indonesia’s many islands.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that has been in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the new accident site.
President Joko Widodo made Indonesia’s inadequate infrastructure a central point in his campaign, and he has spent a lot of money on roads and trains.
However, Mr Joko's administration has been plagued by a lack of funding in line with the election campaign next year.
Mr Joko is also experiencing pressure from underlying sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands removed from their homes when Christian and Muslim gangs fought on the streets with machetes, bows and arrows and other primitive weapons.
See: Liverpool’s Daniel Sturridge equalizes last minute against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a defeat in the Premier League to Chelsea with a score in the 89th minute Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received an episode from Xherdan Shaqiri a little 30 metres from Chelsea's goal, while his team was behind 1-0.
He pricked the ball with his left foot before making a high shot at the farthest pole.
The ball flew high above the field to the top right corner of the net.
The ball dropped over a jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
“It was just about getting into the position of grabbing the ball. Players like Shaq always try to get as far as possible, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw that Kante came, and I made a single touch. I didn't think much about it and just took the shot."
Chelsea led 1-0 at the semi-finals, after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The Chelsea attacker returned with his heel to Mateo Kovacic before speeding up the midfield and sprinting into Liverpool's half of the field.
Kovacic made a quick one-two on the midfield.
He then made a long episode that led Hazard into the field.
Hazard ran from the defense and finished against the farthest post with a shot with his left foot past Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will compete against Napoli in the Champions League group game at 15:00 on Wednesday at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea play against Videoton in UEFA Europa Leaguge at 15 Thursday in London.
Death toll from tsunami in Indonesia rises to 832
The death toll from Indonesia’s earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, the country’s disaster preparedness early Sunday.
There were reports of many trapped in the rubble from buildings that fell after the earthquake, which measured 7.5 on the Richter scale. It hit Friday and created up to 6 meter high waves, spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.
The city of Palu, which has over 380,000 inhabitants, was covered with rubble from collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man suspected of murder after woman stabbed to death
A murder investigation has started after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
The 44-year-old was found with stab wounds at 7:55 a.m. at Grayson Mews on John Street, a 32-year-old man arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have called on people in the area who saw or heard something to step forward.
Police Assistant Brian O'Hagan said: "We are in the early stages of the investigation, but I would like to encourage everyone who stayed near John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard something suspicious about contacting us.
I would also encourage everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something with dashcam, to contact us, as they may have information that may be essential to the investigation."
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman whose body was found is from the Birkenhead area and that she was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who think they know the woman have arrived on the spot to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation continues, and police say they are in the process of informing the victim’s relatives.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to get into his apartment, but is told by the police that no one is allowed to enter the building.
He was stunned when he heard what had happened.
Residents are now told that it takes several hours before they can get back in.
A police officer was overheard telling a man that the entire area is now considered a crime scene.
A crying woman arrives.
She keeps repeating, "It's so terrible."
At 4 p.m., there were two police cars inside the lockdown and another car just outside.
A number of police officers stood within the lockdown and monitored the apartment complex.
Anyone with information should write a message directly to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 and inform log 247 on September 30.
Parliament's statue of Cromwell will be the latest memorial to be struck by discussion on "rewriting history"
The removal would be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of so many of England’s cultural and religious artifacts carried out by his fanatical, puritanical followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's proposals as "madness" and an "trying to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of statues that the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace at Westminster would be a target.
The image storm during the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell is sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft’s stunning depiction of Cromwell is a testament to 19th-century attitudes and part of the historiography of a figure that many still believe is worth paying tribute to.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of Parliament against external pressure, in his case pressure from the monarchy.
Whether this is an accurate depiction is subject to ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is one recognizable figure representing one side of the struggle.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and remembering."
Dr<0xC3><0xA6>bergris attacks and kills Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only under his surname "Yuan", was found dead with an overt artery and smeared in blood near a pig path on the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
A pig farm is preparing to give pig injections of vaccines at a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He had reportedly traveled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning the cousin found him dead and discovered that a door to the pig path next door was open.
He said that in the pig's path there was a big worm with blood in his mouth.
A forensic study confirmed that the 250 kg pig had bitten the farmer to death, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and injured," said the cousin, who goes by the surname "Wu", in a quote from Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4.40 a.m. Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousins.
A market leader told Evening News that the pig had been locked away to prevent it from attacking others while police collect evidence at the scene of the crime.
It is reported that Yuan’s family and market authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
It belongs to the rarities, but there have been previously recorded cases where pigs have attacked humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts and left the man with serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a pig of 295 kg masted a Welsh farmer against his tractor, into his wife frightened the animal away.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a "trigger".
“They’re just doctors.
The naps, they're very curious... they're not going to hurt you.
You just have to treat them with respect,” he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa are expected to cause heavy rain in much of the southwestern United States.
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa will become weaker as it moves across the cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will provide heavy rain with floods in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States over the coming days.
Rosa had a win of 38 m/s, a Category 1 hurricane, at 10 a.m. Sunday (Danish time) and was located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, a low-pressure outlet is forming over the Pacific Ocean, moving eastward toward the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it begins to push tropical moisture north into the southwestern United States.
Rosa will give up to 254 mm of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then the tropical moisture will interact with the low-pressure outlier coming closer, creating heavy rain in the southwestern United States in the coming days.
Locally, 25 to 101 mm of rain will create dangerous storm surges, liquid precipitation, and possibly landslides in the desert.
The tropical moisture will create rain with up to 51 to 76 mm of rain per hour locally, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 51 to 101 mm of rain is expected in parts of the southwestern United States, especially over large parts of Arizona.
There is a high probability of storm surges with rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
It would be a very bad idea to move out into the desert on foot when there is a risk of tropical rain.
Heavy rain can turn canyons into rushing rivers and thunder will create powerful local winds and create dust blasts.<0x3C>/seg>
The approaching low-pressure outlier will provide heavy rain along the coast in parts of southern California.
There is a risk of a total rainfall of over 13 mm, which can result in smaller amounts of liquid precipitation and smooth roads.
This would be the region’s first rainfall in their rainy season.
Spread tropical rain showers will approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday and spread more late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the Four Corners area on Tuesday and will continue on Wednesday.
In October, there may be large temperature fluctuations throughout the United States as the Arctic becomes cooler, but it remains fairly warm in the tropics.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
There is a good example of dramatic temperature differences through the central United States on Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of almost 11 degrees between Kansas City in Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa.
Over the next few days, the remaining summer heat will try to build up and expand again.
Large parts of the central and eastern United States are expected to experience a warm start in October with temperatures above 26 degrees from the southern plains to parts of the northeastern regions.<0x3C>/seg>
There could be up to 26 degrees in New York City on Tuesday, which would be around 10 degrees above average.
Our long climate outlook indicates that there is a high probability of temperatures above average in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people attended the Brett Kavanaugh hearing.
More than 20 million people watched Thursday’s gripping testimony from the nominee to Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of a sexual assault that allegedly took place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television stations.
At the same time, the political struggle continued with stations that interrupted the mainstream programs to tell about Friday's late development: an agreement that was put together by Senator from Arizona Jeff Flake, who allowed the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she is 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh in drunken state was grumbling at her and trying to take her clothes off for a high school party.
Kavanaugh said in an emotional testimony that he’s 100 percent sure it didn’t happen.
According to Nielsen, it is likely that 20.4 million people saw it on Friday.
The company recorded average ratings on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
There were not immediately available ratings from other stations that showed it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble measuring how many people see programs in offices.
To put it into perspective, it’s a ratings figure that corresponds to a game during the NFL playoffs or the Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose opinion-driven hosts have strongly backed up the appointment of Kavanaugh, was at the top of all stations with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the hearing that lasted all day, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was caught for open CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning, while protesters shouted at him as he tried to take an elevator to the hearing of the judging committee.
He stood with a downward look for several minutes while being scolded out, and CNN broadcast live.
"I'm standing right here in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?"
He was told, "You have so much power, and so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office had issued a statement, saying before the elevator closed that he would have more to say at the hearing of the committee.
All the television stations covered live a few hours later, when the judging committee was to vote on whether Kavanaugh’s nomination should proceed to a vote for the entire Senate.
But Flake said he would only vote for under the conviction that the FBI would investigate the charges against the nominee in the following week, which Democrats, who are outnumbered in the Senate, had requested.
Flake was partially convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and a number of senators afterwards, Flake made his decision.
Flake's election had an impact because it was clear that Republicans would not have votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
UK prime minister accuses critics of “legitimate politics” with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "doing politics" with Britain's future and undermining national interests, in an interview with the Sunday Times.
UK Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview alongside Theresa May on the front page of the newspaper, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson made her attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit and said that a proposal that Britain and the EU should collect each other’s tariffs was “totally ridiculous.”
Shooting at Wayde Sims: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson, suspected to be behind LSU player's death
Police have arrested a suspect for shooting at Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and imprisoned under suspicion of manslaughter, Baton Rouge police said.
Officials released video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the match.
Police found the glasses at the scene of the crime and said they found Simpson's DNA, the CBS subsidiary WAFB reported.
After questioning Simpson, the police said he had confessed to the shooting at Wayde.
His bail is set at $350,000, the lawyer reports.
The East Baton Rouge Parish coroner issued a preliminary report Friday that said the cause of death was a wound from a gunshot that went from head to neck.
The police department says a task force from Louisiana State Police, the state police laboratory, Southern University police and citizens of the area have assisted with the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU sports director Joe Alleva thanked the police in the area for their "care and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 198 cm forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, the basketball coach at LSU, Will Wade, said the team is "crushed" and "in shock" over Wayde's death.
“That’s the kind of thing you’re always afraid of,” Wade said.
Volcano spy ash over Mexico City
Ash, sprayed from the Popocatepetl volcano, has reached the southern neighborhoods of Mexico’s capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Center on Saturday warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after activity in the crater occurred, and 183 gas and ash spills were recorded within 24 hours.
The center monitored the rumble and tremors over several laps.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash on car windows in neighborhoods in Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noticed increased activity in the volcano, located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital, since an earthquake measuring 7.1 on the Richter scale shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of the anniversary of the vote on independence
Six were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday, after protesters seeking independence clashed with riot police as several thousand participated in rival demonstrations marking the first anniversary of Catalonia’s polarizing vote on secession.
A group of masked separatists held back unarmed officers, threw in and powder paint, and created dark dust clouds on streets that would normally be full of tourists.
There were also fights later in the day, where the police used their staff to keep the fighting down.
For several hours, independence groups shouted "Nothing forgotten, nothing forgiven", and were greeted with unionist demonstrators shouting "Long live Spain".
14 people were treated for minor injuries that occurred during the protests, the local press reported.
The mood remains high in the independence-minded region one year after the October 1 vote, which was declared illegal from Madrid but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
Voters overwhelmingly voted for independence, but voter support was low, and those who opposed the secession boycotted the vote in a big way.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop the holding of the vote during violent clashes at polling stations across the region.
Independence groups had camped the night to Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration was held, but was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer dared to hope that Catalonia could achieve independence.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying out for the opportunity to vote, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Although they gained a narrow, but important, victory in the regional elections in December last year, the Catalan independence parties have fought to maintain momentum, and many of their best-known leaders have either moved into exile or sit in detention and await judgment for their role in holding the vote and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, recorded the protests on his phone in support of police and said the conflict was created by politicians on both sides.
“There’s going to be more and more tension,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who has been awaiting his trial since last year, announced that he would run for the European Parliament next year.
"The line-up as a candidate in the European elections is the best way to distance ourselves from the setback in democratic values and the subjugation we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after house hit by car
Three men, 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car several times bumped into a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 19.30 BST.
Police Inspector Bob Blemmings said there was damage to the gates and the building itself.
A crossbow may also have been fired at the car at some point.
Shooting from Menga gives Livingston a 1-0 victory over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured victory
The promotion surprised the Rangers and gave Steven Gerrard his only second defeat after 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's shot made the difference when Gary Holt's team moved up side by side with Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's team has not won in the league this season and will face the leading team Hearts, after which they are eight points, next Sunday.
Before that, Rangers will receive a visit from Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, in turn, expands their undefeated streak to six games, and head coach Holt has still not been defeated since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston misses chances against cash outage
Holt's team should have been ahead long before they scored, and their direct play style created big problems for Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but delivered across the finish line, after which Alan Lithgow inevitably hit outside the finish line, after he slipped in to hit Craig Halkett's transverse header in front of the finish line.
The home team was happy to let the Rangers play in front of them because they knew they could give the undefeated problems in dead-ball situations.
And it was under those circumstances that the important goal came.
The Rangers did a free kick, and Livingston took advantage of an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson together created the layout for Menga, who made a touch and scored from the center of the field.
At the time, Rangers had dominated ball possession, but struggled to get through the home team's defenses, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was virtually not challenged.
That pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced a rescue from Kelly.
Scott Pittman's shot was averted with the feet of Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgow shot outside the frame during another of Livingston's dead-ball situations.
There were ongoing deliveries into Livingston's field, but were averted, and two demands for a penalty kick – after Halkett's tackle on the substitute Glenn Middleton and one by hand on the ball – were rejected.
"Fenemental" from Livingston – analysis
BBC Scotlands Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal effort and strong result for Livingston.
Everyone played great and exceeded the expectations of their upward journey.
Their playing style and squad have largely remained unchanged since their return to the best league, but much of the honour must go to Holt for the way he has strengthened the team since he stepped in.
There were many heroes.
Halkett was fantastic and led a well-organized defense, and Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their toes throughout the game.
Rangers lacked dog inspiration.
They have sometimes been really good under Gerrard, but they played below level.
Their endings lacked sharpness – only once they uncovered the home team – and it’s a great wake-up call for Rangers, located in the middle of the scoreboard.
Erdogan receives mixed reception in Cologne
There were smiles and blue skies on Saturday (29 September), when Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve relations with the two NATO members.
There has been disagreement over areas such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's approach to the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a new, large mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
The police held for security reasons a crowd of 25,000 from gathering in front of the mosque, but plenty of supporters appeared nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of Erdogan opponents – many of them Kurdish – also noted and denounced both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to accept the country.
The competing protests reflect a controversial guest seen as a hero by some German Turks and mocked as an autocracy by others.
Accidents on the road in Deptford: Cyclist dies in collision with car
A cyclist has died in a collision with a car in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford in the southwestern part of the city around 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped, and there were rescuers on the spot, but the man died on the spot.
The accident occurs a few months after another cyclist died in a collision with a car whose driver escaped from the scene, on Childers Street, about 1.6 km from Saturday's accident.
The Metropolitan Police said police were working to identify the man and inform his relatives.
Roadblocks have been set up, bus routes have been rerouted, and motorists are encouraged to stay away from the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Officers Injured During Insurgency
Six prison officers have been injured in a high-security prison, according to the Prison Office.
There was a riot in the HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire around 9.30 a.m. BST Sunday, and the riots are still ongoing.
Specialized "Tornado" officers have been brought in to deal with the riots involving eight inmates and taking place in one wing of the prison.
Officers were treated for minor facial injuries on site.
A prison service spokesman said: “Specially trained prison staff are deployed to deal with the ongoing riots in HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and are clear that those responsible are reported to the police and may end up spending longer behind bars."
HMP Long Lartin has over 500 inmates, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison inspector was treated in the hospital after being attacked by an inmate.
And in October last year, unarmed officers were called to prison to deal with serious riots where employees were attacked with billiard bullets.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with storm surge (dry areas may benefit)
It is rare for a tropical low pressure to hit Arizona, but this is most likely to happen at the beginning of next week when the remnants of Hurricane Rosa move across the desert landscape of the southwestern United States, creating a risk of storm surge.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings of storm surges for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a direct route across Phoenix on Tuesday with arrival late Monday with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix pointed out in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones had maintained tropical storm or low pressure status within 320 km of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 64 km of the Arizona border.
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict 51 to 102 mm of rain with isolated volumes up to 152 mm in the Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Other areas of the southwestern desert landscape, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to get 25 to 51 mm with the possibility of 102 mm locally.
For those outside the risk of storm surges, Rosa’s rain can be a blessing because the region is affected by drought.
Flooding is a very serious matter, but it is likely that some of the rain will benefit because the southwestern United States is currently experiencing drought.<0x3C>/seg>
According to the U.S. drought monitoring, just over 40 percent of Arizona experiences the least extreme drought, the second-highest category,” reports weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa is expected to hit land on the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.<0x3C>/seg>
Rosa still has hurricane strength on Sunday morning with maximum wind speed of 38 m/s and is located 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and moving north at 19 km/h.
The storm meets cooler waters in the Pacific Ocean and therefore descends in strength.
It is therefore expected to hit Mexico with tropical current on Monday afternoon or evening.
The rain over parts of Mexico can become strong and pose a high risk of flooding.
"A total of 76 to 152 mm of precipitation is expected from Baja California to the northwestern Sonora with the possibility of up to 254 mm," weather.com reported.
Rosa will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early in the morning Tuesday as a tropical low, which will then move up through Arizona and into southern Utah late Tuesday evening.
“The primary expected danger from Rosa or the remnants of it is very heavy rain in Baja California, the northwestern Sonora and the southwestern desert area of the United States,” the National Hurricane Center reported.
The rain is expected to create life-threatening storm surges and liquid falls in deserts as well as landslides in mountain terrain.
Attacks in Midsomer Norton: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested under suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found wounded in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton around 4 a.m. BST Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital where his condition is reported to be stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested during the night in the Radstock area, police say in Avon and Somerset.
Officials have urged anyone who may have mobile footage of the incidents to come forward.
Trump says Kavanaugh was under the “evil and anger” of the Democratic Party
“A vote on Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the reckless and monstrous tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh has been subjected to the “evil, anger” of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified in front of Congress on Thursday, strongly denying Christine Blasey Ford’s emotional accusations that he sexually assaulted her several decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also gave testimony at the hearing on his charges.
The president said on Saturday that the “American people saw the skill, quality and courage” at Kavanaugh that day.
“A vote on the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote that confirms one of the most skilled legal minds of our time, a lawyer with a fantastic past in public service,” he told a group of supporters in West Virginia.
The president referred indirectly to the nomination of Kavanaugh, while talking about the importance of Republicans appearing at the polls in the midterm elections.
“In five weeks is one of the most important choices of our lifetime.
You can't vote for me, but you actually vote for me," he said.
"That's why I travel around and fight for amazing candidates."
Trump argued that Democrats are on a mission to “fight and block.”
The first important procedural vote in the Senate on the nomination of Kavanaugh is expected to take place by Friday, a person high placed in the Republican party told CNN.
Hundreds killed by Indonesian earthquake and tsunami, death toll grows
At least 384 were killed, and many of them washed away by huge waves hitting the beach when a major earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said Saturday.
Hundreds of people were gathered for a beach festival in the town of Palu on Friday, when up to six meters high waves hit the coast at dusk, sucking many to death and destroying everything on their way.
The tsunami occurred after an earthquake measuring 7.5 on the Richter scale.
“When the tsunami occurred yesterday, people were still doing activities on the beach. They didn’t immediately run and became victims,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia’s disaster preparedness BNPB, during a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come alone, the towed cars, tree trunks, houses, it hit everything on land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had moved through the open sea by 800 km/h before it hit the coast.
More people managed to survive by climbing trees to escape the tsunami, he said.
About 16,700 were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
The disaster preparedness has published aerial photographs showing many destroyed buildings and shops, distorted and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
The coastal town continued to shake up on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes could be felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia’s Board of Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released during Friday’s major earthquake was about 200 times more powerful than the atomic bomb thrown over Hiroshima during World War II.
The city is geographically located at the end of a long, narrow bay, and it may have made the tsunami bigger, the board said.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of a number of victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 had been injured and 29 reported missing.
Nugroho said the death toll and damage could be greater along the 300 km long coastline north of Palu, the Donggala area closer to the earthquake epicenter.
The communication "was completely paralyzed without information" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
“There are over 300,000 people living here,” the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that their employees and volunteers are heading for the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, but it could get much worse," they said.
The board was criticised from many fronts on Saturday for not reporting that a tsunami had hit Palu, but officials said the waves had come within the time the warning was issued.
In amateur footage shared on social media, one can hear a man on the top floor of a building desperately shouting warnings about the tsunami coming closer to people on the street below.
Within a few minutes, a wall of water hits the coast and carries buildings and cars away.
Reuters could not confirm the authenticity of the footage immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power failure that cut off communications around Palu and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military has begun sending cargo planes with emergency aid from Jakarta and other cities, authorities report, but there is still a strong need for food and basic necessities among the evacuated.
The city’s airport has been reopened, but only for relief work, and remains closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is expected to visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami is more than 800.
It's really bad.
World Vision employees from Donggala have safely come to Palu city, where employees seek shelter under tarpaulins that are set up in the courtyard at their account. They came past areas with extensive destruction on the road, Doseba said.
“They told me they had so many broken houses,” he said.
It's really bad.
Even when relief organisations began the hard work of putting relief work back on hold, there were complaints that foreign relief workers with extensive expertise were prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian legislation, financial aid, supplies and employees from abroad may enter only if the area where the accident occurred is declared a national disaster area.
It hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still a disaster at the provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, an Indonesian Red Cross spokesperson.
"When the government says 'OK, it's a national disaster', we can open for international assistance, but there's no status yet."
On the second night in Palu after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, friends and family held on to the missing people in the hope that their loved ones would become the miracles that light up the gloomy tales of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled up by a sewer.
On Saturday, rescue workers released a woman who had been trapped under rubble for two days with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandano, the coach of the Indonesian paragliding national team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other of those caught at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were among his students.
“As a paragliding veteran, I have my own emotional burden,” he said.
Mr. Gendon told how, in the hours following the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel circulated in paragliding circles, he had desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the participants in Palu, who were attending the festival on the beach.
His messages, however, resulted in only one gray fly leg instead of two blue.
“I think that means the messages weren’t delivered,” he says.
Twenty takes $26,750 while filling up ATM in Newport on the Levee
Twenty-seven stole $26,750 from a Brink's employee who was completing a cash machine in Newport on the Levee, according to a Newport police press release.
The driver of the car had emptied the ATM in the entertainment complex and prepared to deliver more money, Detective Assistant Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press release.
While he was busy, another man "run up behind the Brink's employee" and stole a bag money that should have been delivered.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, according to the press release, but police did not indicate how many people were involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about the identity of the thieves should contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Kanye West has changed his name to Ye.
He announced the shift on Twitter Saturday, where he wrote: "The creature formerly known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for a while and used the name as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change takes place ahead of his performance in Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande on the show, who canceled for "emotional reasons," the show's creator said.
The name is an abbreviation of his current artist name, but West has previously said that the name has religious significance for him.
“I think ‘ye’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you’,” West said earlier this year, discussing his album title with radio host Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
It went from Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye – which is a reflection of our good, bad and confused sides, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.”
He is one of a number of famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs has switched between Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he reported that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
One of West’s former collaborators, JAY-Z, has also switched between small and large letters and changed whether the hyphen is included.
Mexico's AMLO vows not to use military force against civilians
Mexico’s newly elected President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country is approaching the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliatory action against students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he "never would use the military to oppress the Mexican people."
Troops shot at a peaceful demonstration on the square on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 at a time when left-wing student movements took root in many places in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly state grants to students and opening more free, open universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities draw young people into criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double funding for artificial intelligence
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount it spends on research in the field, investor and AI user Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple, said.
The comments come after various parts of the U.S. government have given announcements on artificial intelligence. However, the U.S. still lacks a formal strategy for artificial intelligence.
However, China introduced their plan last year and aims to take first place in innovation in artificial intelligence by 2030.
“It would be a good idea to double the research budget for artificial intelligence as all other countries are so far behind the US, and we are looking for the next big breakthrough in AI,” Lee said.
Doubling the budget could double the chances of the next major achievement in artificial intelligence being achieved in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee published the book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" this month at Houghton Mifflin Harcourt and is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the most prominent companies in the field of artificial intelligence in China, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on a system of artificial intelligence that beat the highest-ranked American Othello player, and later became head of Microsoft Research and director of Google's department in China.
Lee acknowledged previous technology competitions supported by the U.S. government, such as the Robotics Challenge, held by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when a new competition will be coming so that the next visionaries can be identified.
“Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to obtain government grants,” Lee said.
“It’s not China that’s picking up the academic leaders, it’s the big companies,” Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have employed star students from universities to work with artificial intelligence.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could also help the U.S. strengthen its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I think that PhDs in artificial intelligence should have automatically offered work permits.
China’s Council of State issued its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
China’s National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people at academic institutions in a way similar to the National Science Foundation and other state organizations’ distribution of money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a joint center for artificial intelligence, which will involve partners from industry and research, and the White House announced the foundation of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
The NSF is currently investing over $100 million a year in research into artificial intelligence.
However, U.S. legislation seeking to establish a National Artificial Intelligence Security Commission has stood still for several months.
Macedonians hold a vote to change the country's name
The Macedonian people voted on Sunday to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia", a measure that would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece, which has blocked Macedonia's attempts to gain membership of the EU and NATO.
Greece has a province called Macedonia and maintains that the name of its neighbouring country to the north constitutes a claim on Greek territory, and has therefore used their veto after Macedonia has sought admission into NATO and the EU.
The two governments entered into an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents believe that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia’s primarily Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that he will not take part in the vote and a boycott campaign has raised doubts as to whether the vote will constitute the 50% required for the vote to be valid.
The question on the ballot read: "Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that it is a price worth paying to create access to associations such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged as a result of the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote on the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the EU umbrella, because it means safer lives for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
The vote is not legally binding, but enough Members of Parliament have said that they will respect the result of the vote and assert it.
The name change would require a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission said that at 1 p.m. no irregularities were reported.
But voter turnout was only 16 percent compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, with 66 percent of registered voters voting.
"I voted today because of my children. We belong in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Macedonia's Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko took part in the vote in Macedonia on a change of the country's name, which would open up for membership of NATO and the EU, in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small stage and pulled up chairs in front of tents set up by those who would boycott the vote.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we will achieve membership with a raised forehead, not by the back door," Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want us like Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of European-Asian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership would provide a much-needed investment in Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of over 20 percent.
“I think a large majority will vote for because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after giving his vote.
He said that a “yes” result would be a “guarantee of our future”.
A poll released last Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Political Research indicated that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would take part in the vote – less than the required voter turnout.
Another poll conducted by Macedonian television channel Telma TV indicated that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
In order for the vote to be valid, the voter turnout must be at least 50 percent plus one vote.
If the vote fails, it will be the first major political loss for the pro-Western government since it took place in May last year.
See: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero fights through the entire Brighton defense and scores
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling fought the Brighton defense in Manchester City's 2-0 victory Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy with his scoring, which came after 65 minutes.
The Argentine attacker received a midfield delivery at the beginning of the sequence.
He quickly ran past three Brighton defenders before he swung out on the open field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green jerseys.
He fought past one defender, and subsequently ran from several on the edge of Brighton's field.
He then made a pass to the left and found Sterling.
The English forward used his first touch in the field to give the ball back to Aguero, who used his right boot to outsmart Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot on the right side of the net.
"Aguero is struggling with some problems with his feet," City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We were talking about him playing about 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at that moment.”
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the immediate lead in the Premier League game.
The goal came after 29 minutes.
Aguero received in that sequence the ball deep inside Brighton's territory.
He sent a nice delivery along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane took a few touches before taking Sterling to the farthest post.
The Sky Blues forward poked the ball in the net just before it slipped past the goal.
City competes against Hoffenheim in the group game in the Champions League at 12:55 on Tuesday at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to tease Rockies
Nationals are eliminated from playoff participation, so they didn’t have much to fight for.
But the always competitive Scherzer hopes to take the pitch Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there is still the opportunity to participate in the playoffs for the Rockies, who have played a game more than the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies were at least stuck in a wild card slot with a 5-2 victory over the Nationals on Friday night, but still have their first division title for good.
"Although we have nothing to play for, we can go to the game knowing that the atmosphere would be at its highest among the audience here in Denver and that the opponents would play at the probably highest level I'm going to face this year.
Why should I not be anxious to play under these conditions?”
The Nationals have not yet announced the starting line-up for Sunday, but will probably put Scherzer in as a pitcher in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would be the first man on the pitch for the 34th time, trained his pitch Tuesday and would pitch on Sunday, which is usually his rest day.
The right-handed player from Washington is 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump Holds Election Meeting in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation surrounding his election to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while talking about the importance of Republicans appearing at the polls in the midterm elections.
"Everything we've done is at stake in November.
Five weeks from one of the most important choices of our lifetime.
It’s one of the big, big – you can’t vote for me, but you actually vote for me. That’s why I travel around and fight for amazing candidates,” he said.
Trump continued, "You can see this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, you can see it happening right now.
And they're determined to get power back with all available means, and you can see how vicious, how disgusting they are.
They don't care who they hurt, who they're going to run over to get power and control. That's what they want, power and control, but we won't give it to them."
The Democrats, he said, have as a mission "strive against and block".
"And you have seen it over the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "wrathful and wicked and disgusting and lying."
He mentioned the Supreme Democratic Senator on the Senate Judiciary Committee Dianne Feinstein by name, which triggered the loud bow from the audience.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, uh, what?
No, no, wait, wait, it was really bad body language, the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer a big party.
They are intolerant to those who express their opinions.
When Momentum’s activists in my local party voted to censor me, it wasn’t really a surprise.
I am just the latest in a large number of Labour MPs who have been told that we are not welcome – just because we have made our views known.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, received a similar treatment because she took a strong stand against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship measure was about criticizing me because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
In relation to the importance of responsible economic policy, in relation to national security, in Europe, ironically similar problems that Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders in.
The call to the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday stated that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
For most of my eight years as a local Member of Parliament, Friday night meetings have just been like that.
Today, unfortunately, the tone of many meetings is not so, and the promise of "friendly, gentler" policies is far back in the past if it ever got started.
It has become more and more clear that dissenting views are not tolerated in Labour and that all opinions are weighed down as to whether the leadership of the party can accept them.
It started shortly after Jeremy became the leader when colleagues, with whom I previously thought I was sharing a political stance, began to expect me to make a U-turn and take positions that I would otherwise never have agreed with – whether it was about national security or the EU’s internal market.
When I say my opinion in public – and it really doesn’t matter what I say – I follow a long line of gross messages on social media that call for rejection and contradiction of the mid-term policy and tell me that I shouldn’t be a member of Labour.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments directed at me are usually political.
I have deep respect for the professionalism and willingness to fight with colleagues who are oppressed every day with sexism or racism, but still struggle further.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is where abuse has usually become.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that Labour should create a tolerant culture.
But in reality it is no longer a spacious organization and with every vote of no confidence or change in the selection rules, the party is narrowing down.
I’ve been given a lot of advice over the last two years that if I put a lid on myself and I’m not that loud, then I’m going to “get it done”.
But that’s not why I went into politics.
Since I joined Labour 32 years ago when I was in school, I was provoked by the failure of the Thatcher government, which had left our classroom in a state of decline, and I set out to create better public services for those who need it most – whether as a city councilor or government minister.
I have never hidden my policy, even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been in any way confused about my political positions and disagreements with the current leadership.
To those who tabled the resolution on Friday, I would say that when the country rolls forward to Brexit, which will harm households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the need to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour leader.
But the one message I have is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to the local voters, whether they are members of Labour or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of restitution or political fitness will deter me from acting on the basis of what I believe is your interest.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Undefeated Ayr becomes top team
Two late scores may have made the final result to draw a not entirely truthful picture, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved the victory in this fantastically entertaining match of the day in Tennent's Premiership.
They are now at the top of the scoreboard and are the only undefeated team of ten.
In the end, it was just as much their superior defense as their better utilization of the chance that carried the home team, and coach Peter Murchie had the absolute right to be satisfied.
“Our struggles have been demanding so far, and we are still undefeated, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "Respect to Ayr, they took advantage of their chances better than us."
Grant Anderson's scoring after 14 minutes was followed by a successful kick from Frazier Climo and brought Ayr in front, but a yellow card to Scottish national team player Rory Hughes, who was awarded for the fight by the Warriors, gave Melrose an advantage, and Jason Baggot made a score that was not followed by a kick.
Climo expanded Ayr's lead with a penalty kick just before the semi-leg, scoring and then getting a solo score, so that 17-5 stood for Ayr at the break.
But Melrose began well in the second half, and Patrick Anderson's scoring, followed by a kick from Baggot, reduced the score difference to five.
There was then a long interruption because Ruaridh Knott had suffered a serious injury. He was carried out of the field on stretchers. When the game was resumed, Ayr extended the lead with a score from Stafford McDowall and a follow-up kick from Climo.
Acting Ayr captain Blair Macpherson then got a yellow card, and again Melrose took advantage of their extra man with a score from Bruce Colvine without a follow-up kick after a period of intense pressure.
However, the home team came back, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card to tackle Climo without the ball, MacPherson could after a line-out score behind the forward Ayr cluster.
Climo followed up with a kick inside the poles and followed up with a more almost straight after the game was resumed, after Kyle Rowe intercepted David Armstrong's box kick and sent winger Gregor Henry off for the home field's fifth scoring.
Still Game star looking for new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran seems to be taking the step to the restaurant industry after it emerged that he has taken the directorship of an authorized restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he writes and is the main character in with his partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo have announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the series' last, and Kiernan seems to be planning a life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, but a source suggested to Scottish Sun that Kiernan would be part of Glasgow's "growing market for restaurants".
"The sea is ours": Bolivia's domestic state hopes court will reopen route to the Pacific
Sailors patrol around the Navy headquarters, encased in rigs, in La Paz.
On public buildings there is a sea blue flag.
Fleet bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon River are overpainted with the motto: "The sea is ours, it is a right.
It’s a duty to take it back.”
Throughout Bolivia, the memory of a coastline lost to Chile in a bloody conflict over resources in the 19th century is still strong, and so is the longing to sail the Pacific again.
The hopes may be at their highest for decades, while Bolivia awaits a ruling from the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of voting.
“Bolivia has momentum, a sense of community and clarity, and naturally awaits with a positive look at the outcome,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the decision of the International Court of Justice on large screens across the country and hope that the Hague court will agree that Chile, after decades of discussions, is obliged to negotiate to grant Bolivia sovereignty over an area with access to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic native president, who faces a controversial election campaign next year, also has a lot at stake at the ruling Monday.
"We are close to returning to the Pacific," he promised in late August.
But analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will take the Bolivian party – and that there would be no major change if it did.
The UN Assembly, which is based in the Netherlands, has no power to hand over Chilean territory and has stipulated that it cannot determine the outcome of possible discussions.
That the International Court of Justice passes judgment only six months after the final arguments were heard indicates that the case was "not complicated," said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And instead of promoting Bolivia's case, the last four years may have given way.
"The case of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian leadership," Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
Morales’ warlike rhetoric has eliminated the remaining Chilean benevolence, she said.
Bolivia and Chile will at some point continue the discussions, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the Court’s decision-making was abnormally quick.
On Monday, Bolivia will have "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "end an era of 139 years of disagreements and gain benefits for both parties," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents, used the maritime problem as a political crutch.
“Bolivia will never give up access to the Pacific,” he added.
"The verdict is an opportunity to see that we have overcome the past."
North Korea says there will be no nuclear disarmament unless it can rely on the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never denuclearize their nuclear weapons unless they can first rely on Washington.
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to abide by promises made at a summit in Singapore between rival leaders.
US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be facing a relaunch of locked-down nuclear diplomacy over three months after the meeting in Singapore with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it is a “desirable dream” that continued sanctions and U.S. opposition to a declaration that ends the Korean War will ever bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is reluctant to declare, as long as Pyongyang has not taken significant steps against disarmament.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a summit.
But there is widespread skepticism about whether Pyongyang is serious about abolishing an arsenal that the country most likely sees as the only thing that can guarantee their safety.
Pompeo is planning a visit to Pyongyang next month in preparation for a new summit between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris reveal the latest collections of great headwear that you will soon be able to buy in local stores
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or block the sun completely, you will find the answer here.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne lifted the catwalk veil for a collection of extra-large headgear as part of their SS19 collection. The collection impressed at Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical hats have dominated on Instagram this summer, and the two designers have sent their eye-catching creations down the catwalk.
The most impressive work by Valentino was a sumptuous one with a feather-like wide shadow covering the heads of the models.
There were also other extra-large accessories, including watermelons with jewels and even a pineapple – but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had sewn lips that resembled Hannibal Lecter more than haute couture.
One creation resembled diving gear with snorkel and mask, and others resembled a melted waffle ice cream.
And if you continue the big fashion statements, you are lucky.
Style scouts predict that the huge hats could come to stores near you.
The giant hats arrive in the heels of "La Bomba", the straw hat with a 60 cm wide shade, which is seen on everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand, behind the most impractical hatred spread across social media, has sent a new great creation down the catwalk – a beach bag in straw that is almost as big as the model that showcases it.
The orange bass bag with bass fringes and a white leather handle was the most eye-catching in the Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect to see big hats and beach bags in regular stores next summer. The designer has had so much influence that it becomes hard to ignore the demand for huge-size accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Scotland’s independent schools have many great academic achievements behind them, and it is still in 2018 with another series of outstanding exam results, which are also enhanced by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other efforts in the local community.
With up to 30,000 students around Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to deliver the best level of service to their students and parents.
The independent schools try to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen career and their place as global citizens.
As an education sector that can put together and implement a tailor-made curriculum, we experience that modern languages remain a popular topic in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it hits his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it hits the heart.”
It’s an important reminder that we can’t just stick to English when we want to build relationships and trust among people from other countries.
We can see on the latest exam results this year that languages are highest in the statistics with the most passed exams in the independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students studying foreign languages received the high grade A.
The data collected by SCIS's 74 member schools showed that 72 percent of students received grade A in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who studied German, 69 percent of those who studied French, and 63 percent of those who studied Spanish also received an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important competences that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Language is now perceived as subject choice on the same level as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent schools’ pens and elsewhere.
A 2014 study by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills found that among the reasons why employers were unable to fill vacancies, 17% had a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming more and more important in terms of preparing young people for their future careers.
More job opportunities will require language skills in the future, and these skills are essential in a globalized world.
No matter what career the young people choose, if they have learned another language, they have a great advantage in the future with a lifelong skill like this.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically give a multilingual person a head start to competitors.
According to a YouGov poll of over 4,000 respondents in the UK in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation, and French is the only language spoken by a multi-digit percentage, 15 percent.
Therefore, it is important to invest in language teaching for those who are children today.
When you can speak multiple languages, especially languages from developing countries, children are given a better chance of finding meaningful work.
In Scotland, there is a difference between schools in which languages are taught.
A number of schools focus on the more classic modern languages, while others teach languages that are expected to be most important to the UK when looking forward to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter what your child is interested in, there will always be a number of languages to choose from at independent schools with teachers who are specialists in the field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to delivering a learning environment that prepares children and gives them the skills required to succeed, no matter what the future holds.
At present, it cannot be denied that languages continue to be really important for the future of the country in a global business environment, and that must be reflected in the education.
Modern languages should be regarded as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, this diversity and this award to Scotland’s youth.
I'll faut bien le faire.
John Edward is head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron makes his debut for Lakers Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans who want to watch LeBron James play his first game for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday's opening game before the start of the season against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
It is not yet clear how many minutes he plays.
"It's going to be more than 1 and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James would most likely not play the entire game.
After training earlier in the week, James was asked about his plans in relation to the Lakers' scheduled six games before the start of the season.
“Where I am in my career, I don’t need to fight before the start of the season to get ready,” he said.
Trump's Election Meeting in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump begins a string of election meetings tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It’s Trump’s first out of five scheduled election meetings next week, including meetings in Trump-friendly places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the vote to confirm Trump’s appointed judge to the vacant seat of the Supreme Court is suspended, Trump is trying to support the upcoming midterm elections because Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when the votes are cast in November.
When is Trump’s voter turnout in West Virginia tonight, and how do you see it online?
Trump’s election meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, will be held at midnight (Danish time) on the night between Saturday 29 November and Sunday 30 November 2018.
You can watch Trump’s election meeting in West Virginia online via livestream on YouTube.
Trump will most likely talk about this week's hearings on Brett Kavanaugh, who has been nominated to the Supreme Court. The hearings were tense due to charges of sexually abusive behavior, and the expected Senate vote on confirmation is suspended for a week while the FBI is investigating the charges.
But the primary goal of this strip of electoral meetings is to create momentum for the Republicans facing a difficult election in November.
People from President Trump’s campaign team said the five polls next week aim to “create energy among volunteers and supporters when Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives,” according to Reuters.
“Congress control is so important to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible, now that we are entering the busy campaign time,” a Trump campaign spokesman, who would not be quoted by name, told Reuters.
Tonight’s voter turnout is held at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling and is expected to attract Trump supporters from “Ohio and Pennsylvania and be covered by Pittsburgh media,” according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month Trump has visited West Virginia, the state he won by over 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia's Republican candidate for the Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who is behind the polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president needs to step up to give him a boost in the polls,” said Simon Haeder, who deals with political science at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA has shown battle spirit and tries to keep hope alive ahead of Sunday's single duels
After three one-sided rounds, Saturday’s four-man duels were perhaps what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging momentum is a completely invented sports concept, but a concept that players believe in – not least in competitions like this one.
Where would they say there is momentum now?
“They led by six points, and now it’s four, so we probably see that as a bit of momentum,” said Jordan Spieth, before he held the fort.
Of course, Europe has the advantage: they are 4 points ahead, and there are 12 more points to play about.
However, as Spieth says, Americans feel that they have little wind in the sails, and there are plenty of encouraging things to focus on, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both can boast three points out of four possible.
Spieth has been sharp from tee to green and sets a good example for his teammates.
The high cheers rose as the round continued, and Spieth hit an important put, which secured victory in duel four, although he and Thomas had been two strokes behind after two duels.
His put, which secured them the fight at hole 15, was met with a similar scream – the kind of scream that shows he doesn’t think the American team is out of competition yet.
“You just have to find the inner strength and focus on your own fight,” Spieth said.
That’s all the players have left now.
18 holes where you can make a difference.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, without a doubt the biggest story from the Ryder Cup.
Europe's strange but sympathetic couple have scored four points in four games and appear flawless.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't get a bogey Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogeys Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes Friday morning.
The series and the way the energy seems to flow on both to and from the wild crowd show that it is the ones that will be the hardest to beat on Sunday. And it would undoubtedly be very popular if a potential European victory is cemented by Fleetwood or Molinari when the sun goes down over Le Golf National.
At least synchronously on each of their holes.
However, it is too early to talk about European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made a brief trial against Sergio Garcia, the morning in the four-man duels, when he formed a couple with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two double bogeys on the first nine holes dug the Spaniard and the Swede into a hole they were never close to getting out of.
On Sunday, no one can help you out of your hole.
The battles with four balls and two teams of two players are so fascinating to watch closely because of the interactions between the pairs, the advice they give, the advice they don’t give, and the way the strategy can change quickly.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has created a significant lead before the last day, but the four-man duels have also shown that Team USA has the fighting spirit that some, especially in the United States, have doubted.
Europe leads 10-6 ahead of last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe has a big advantage before the last day at the Ryder Cup, after coming out of Saturday's fourballs and foursomes with a lead over the United States of 10-6.
The well-playing duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the way with two wins over a troubled Tiger Woods and have so far scored four points at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn's European team, trying to win the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an inaccurate American team in the morning's fourballs and won the series 3-1.
The United States gave more resistance in foursomes, they won four games, but were still behind.
Jim Furyk's team will need eight points in Sunday's 12 single matches to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European debutant to have won four points in a row, and he and Molinari, who together have been nicknamed "Molliwood", are after a sensational weekend the only second pair in Ryder Cup history to have won four points in their first four games.
They smashed Woods and Patrick Reed into fourballs and then elegantly defeated a discouraged Woods and American debutant Bryson Dechambeau with an even more impressive 5&4.
Woods, who fought his way through the first two games on Saturday, had little brilliant glimpses, but now he has lost 19 of his 29 games in fourballs and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose was well rested for the morning fourballs and returned to partner Henrik Stenson in foursomes and won a 2-1 victory over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – the third in the world.
Europe, however, has it all, as they want it, on an easily windy day southwest of Paris.
Triple major winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas showed the way for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They won a tough 2-1 victory over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourballs and later returned and defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in foursomes after losing the first two holes.
It has only happened twice in Ryder Cup history that a team has fought back after being behind by four points before the singles matches. However, as Furyks currently has the trophy, they only have to get a draw to keep it.
After being second best for two days, however, it seems that they cannot master a counterattack on Sunday.
North Korea says it won't dismantle unilaterally if there's no confidence
North Korea’s foreign minister told the UN on Saturday that continued sanctions reinforce their distrust of the United States and that the country will not abandon their nuclear weapons unilaterally under such conditions.
Ri Yong Ho told the world-wide organization’s General Assembly that North Korea had shown “significant goodwill” over the past year, for example, by stopping nuclear and missile tests, winding up an area for nuclear testing, and vowing not to further develop nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“We have not seen a similar reaction from the United States,” he said.
“Without confidence in the United States, there is no confidence in our national security and under such conditions, there is no chance that we ourselves will take the first step and dismantle unilaterally.”
While Ri reiterated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's opposition to a "phased" approach to nuclear disarmament, where North Korea would be rewarded if they took gradual steps. But his speech seemed important, as it did not unambiguously reject unilateral disarmament, as has otherwise been the case from Pyongyang.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first ever summit between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, where Kim promised to work “nuclear disarmament on the Korean peninsula,” while Trump promised to guarantee North Korea’s security.
North Korea has called for a formal end to the Korean War, which took place in 1950-53, but the United States has said Pyongyang must first abandon its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also shown opposition to softening international sanctions against North Korea.
“The United States insists on ‘nuclear disarmament first’ and expands the pressure of sanctions to achieve their purpose by coercion and even opposes ‘the declaration of the end of the war’,” Ri said.
“The perception that sanctions can bring us to our knees is a wishful dream among people who don’t know who we are.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions reinforce our distrust.”
Ri did not mention plans for a summit between Kim and Trump, as the U.S. leader highlighted at the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: “If nuclear disarmament were to be negotiated with South Korea and not the United States, the negotiations would not be so tight.”
Nevertheless, the tone of Ri’s speech was very different from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that the firing of North Korea’s missiles against the U.S. mainland was inevitable, after “Mr. Evil President” Trump called Kim a “rocket man” on suicide mission.
Last year, Trump threatened the United Nations with “total destruction” of North Korea, but this year he praised Kim for showing courage in terms of disarmament, but said that there is still much to be done and that the sanctions need to remain until North Korea decommissions.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn’t have a schedule for these actions, but said, “It doesn’t matter if it takes two years, three years, or five months.”
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, however, told the United Nations Security Council on Thursday that: “The Security Council must maintain the sanctions with conviction and without error until we achieve the total, final, confirmed nuclear disarmament.”
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously increased economic sanctions against North Korea in an attempt to stop Pyongyang’s missile and nuclear weapons program.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and subsequently said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for another meeting.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times during the year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said progress had been made, while North Korea just hours after accused him of making “gangster-like demands.”
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to close a missile facility as well as a nuclear complex if the United States took "similar steps."
He said Kim had told him that the “similar steps” he required were the security pledges Trump made in Singapore, as well as moves toward a normalization of relations with Washington.
Students at Harvard take the course to get enough sleep
A new course at Harvard University has given all undergraduate students more sleep. The purpose of the course is to counter the growing macho culture where studying all night kept up with large amounts of caffeine.
One researcher has shown that students at the world’s best university often have no idea the first thing about taking care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, has taken the course, which, he believes, is the first of its kind in the United States.
He got the idea for the course after giving a presentation on what effects sleep deprivation has on learning.
"When the presentation was finished, a girl came up to me and said, 'Why am I only getting this to know now that I'm on the candidate?'
“She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course, which is offered for the first time this year, explains to students how good sleeping habits can improve one’s academic and sporting performance as well as one’s overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and CEO of the University’s health field, says the university has decided to offer the course after finding out that students were in severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The hour-long course consists, among other things, of various interactive exercises.
In one of the exercises there is a picture of a dorm room where students have to click on coffee cups, curtains, running shoes and books to gain knowledge about the effects of caffeine and light, and how one’s athletic performance is affected by sleep deprivation, and how important good sleeping habits are.
In another part of the course, participants hear about how sleep deprivation over a long period of time increases the risk of heart attacks, blood clots, depression and cancer.
Participants are encouraged to think about their daily habits by clicking on different icons on an interactive map of campus.
“We know it won’t change students’ behavior right away.
But we think they have the right to know it – just like you have the right to know how cigarettes affect health,” adds Professor Czeisler.
The pride that is in taking an "allnighter" still exists, he says, adding that modern technology and increased pressure on students have led to sleep deprivation being a growing problem.
The “secret weapon” against stress, fatigue and anxiety is good and sufficient sleep, he said – it even counteracts weight gain because sleep deprivation makes the brain think that one is starving, why they are constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemical and physical biology, helped last year Professor Czeisler organize the course when he took one of his courses on his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and made him work on making it a general course throughout the university.
He hopes that the next step will be for all graduates to be offered a similar course before continuing their education.
Professor Czeisler recommends students set an alarm so that they know when to go to bed and when to get up. This can raise awareness of the harmful effects of the light from electronic screens, which can move at the circadian rhythm and make it harder to fall asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Goals from Menga lowers Gerrard and co.
Rangers suffered another defeat on the field when Dolly Menga's goal meant that Steven Gerrard's incoherent team had to thank for a 1-0 defeat in Livingston.
The team from Ibrox were looking for their first win on the field since the 4-1 triumph at St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team only gave Gerrard the second defeat in 18 games as a coach. Thus, there are eight points up to Hearts in the first place of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga hit seven minutes before the break, which an uninspired Rangers team could not respond to.
The Rangers now go down to sixth place, while Livingston climbs up to third place after Hibernian with only the goal score in difference.
And there could be more bad news on the way to the Rangers, as line judge Calum Spence had to be treated after being hit in the head by a thrown object, which seemed to come from the outfield section.
Gerrard made eight changes to the lineup that reached the Betfed Cup semi-finals by toning past Ayr.
Holt, on the other hand, placed with the same 11, who shaved a point off Hearts' lead last week, and he would have been delighted to see his sharp team exhausting opponents across the field.
Rangers had the ball the most, but Livingston was more effective.
They should have scored two minutes inside the game when Menga's first-ever episode sent Scott Pittman against Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder's attempts passed.
A free kick in depth from Keaghan Jacobs found his way to Captain Craig Halkett, but his defender Alan Lithgow kicked past the rear post.
The Rangers, however, took control, but played more on hope than ability in the attacking game.
Alfredo Morales was not satisfied, at least, when Judge Steven Thomson denounced the Colombian's appeals for a penalty kick, when he and Steven Lawless clashed after a quarter of a game.
Rangers managed only two shots on goal in the first half, but former Rangers goalkeeper Liam Kelly did not have problems with Lassana Coulibaly's headshot and Oviedo Ejaria's domestic shot.
Although Livi’s opening in the 34th minute was somewhat random, it must be said to be deserved for their efforts alone.
Again, Rangers could not handle a dead-ball situation in depth from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who took the time to find Menga, who could easily kick it in the goal.
During the break, Gerrard replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, which almost immediately gave the paw when the winger sent the ball in to Morelos, but the well-playing Kelly ran from his position to block.
However, Livingston forced the team to play on their premises with many long balls up the field from Lithgow and Halkett.
Holt's crew could have expanded the lead in the final part of the game, but McGregor rejected Jacobs with a secure hand before Lithgow headed alongside the goal.
Rangers' replacement Glenn Middleton again appealed for a late penalty kick after being wiped out with Jacobs, but Judge Thomson also looked here the other way.
Yearbook: The inventor of the geiger counter
And now a page from the yearbook "Sunday Morning": 30 September, 1882, 136 years ago today – if we T<0xC3><0x84>LLER... – was the day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger invented a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that would eventually lead to the apparatus known as the geiger counter.
The Geiger counter has become an integral part of both science and popular culture, as can be seen in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", in which Roy Rogers and Dale Evans played the leading roles as Bondish scientists:
Man: "What in the world is that?"
Rogers: “It is a geiger counter used to find radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms that the radioactivity of the minerals makes.”
Evans: “Stop it, now it’s over!”
"His" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before he would have turned 63.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” cancer cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” cancer cells and kill them
Vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells as part of treatment
The method consists of extracting immune cells from a patient and changing them in the laboratory
They can then "see" the protein that is common to many cancers and where they are injected again
A test vaccine is promising in patients with a variety of cancers.
When a woman with ovarian cancer was treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells, the cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method consists of extracting immune cells from patients and changing them in the laboratory so that they can "see" the protein called HER2, which many cancers have, and then inject the cells again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "makes several cancers to develop," including breast, ovarian, lung and intestinal cancers, explains Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to taking immune cells out of patients and “teaching” them to attack cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a specific type of leukemia.
Kanye West gave Trump-friendly speech wearing a MAGA hat after his SNL performance.
It didn't go well
After an incoherent appearance in the Saturday Night Live studio, Kanye West was booed off when he paid tribute to US President Donald Trump, saying he himself would run for president in 2020.
When he had played the third song of the night Ghost Town wearing a Make America Great Again-casket, he began a thunderbolt against the Democrats and maintained his support for Trump.
“I often talk to white people who say, ‘Why do you like Trump, he’s a racist?’
But if I worried about racism, I would have long since moved from the United States,” he said.
SNL started the evening's show with a sketch with Matt Damon, where the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony in the Senate Judiciary Committee on Christine Blasey Ford's assault charges.
Although the footage was not shown, comedian Chris Rock Wests uploaded the tirade on social media.
It is uncertain whether Rock attempted to exhibit West by posting the footage.
West also complained to the public about poor treatment backstage due to his headgear.
"They bullied me backstage.
They said, 'Don't go out there with that hat on.'
They bullied me!
And they said I had fallen deeply," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see how deep I've fallen?", saying that he would put his Superman cap on because it means that "You can't decide what to do. Do you want progress in the world?
Try it with love.”
The audience bushed at least twice of his comments, and the SNL staff seemed to be embarrassed, Variety said with a comment from a person present: "There was a tom stillness in the study."
West had been booked as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose then-girlfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days before.
West confused many by performing with the song I Love It, while he was dressed like a Perrier bottle.
West received support from the leader of the conservative group, TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest people: THANK YOU FOR NOT LETTING THE CUE OF THE POOL."
Talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West is just "as he is, and that's just fine."
"But I choose NOT to reward a person (by buying his music, his clothes or supporting his "art"), who embraces and exudes an ideology that is harmful to society.
He's allowed.
And so do we,” she added.
Prior to the show, the rapper had announced that he has taken the name change to "the entity officially known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name, following Diddy, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Rap co-star Snoop Dogg has the name Snoop Lion, and the recently deceased music legend Prince changed his name to a symbol and then to The Artist Formerly Known as Prince.
Accusation of attempted murder after stabbing at Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man on Friday was stabbed with a knife at a restaurant in eastern Belfast.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The accused is expected to be brought before the Belfast Court of Appeals on Monday.
The charges are reviewed by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington longs for toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for swinging swords in the role of Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor longs for the stereotypical macho hero and says that such TV characters mean that young men often feel they have to be hard to be respected.
Kit told the Sunday Times Culture that he believed that “something went wrong” and asked how to tackle the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who was recently married to his Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie at 31, admitted that the problem lies with him "very much on his mind".
“At the moment, I have a lot on my mind – where have we gone wrong in the city with masculinity?” he said.
“If we look at the current problems, what have we learned young men in their upbringing?”
Kit believes that television can be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to the very masculine characters.
He continued: "What is innate, and what is acquired?
What is it that young men learn from television and on the street that makes them feel like they should be men in this way?
I think that’s one of the big questions of our time – how do we change that?
It is obvious that something has gone wrong for the young men.”
During the interview, he also admitted that he will not make sequels to Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, saying that he is "done with battlefields and horses".
Kit starred from November in a remake of Sam Shepard's True West, which is the story of a film director and his brother who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that he considers meeting his wife Rose to be the best thing about the entire Game of Thrones experience.
“I met my wife because of this series, so it has given me my future family and shaped my life forever,” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, whom Kit's character, Jon Snow, falls in love with, in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The couple was married in June 2018 at Leslie's family's country estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has published a 14% increase in the number of citizens with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people in the country have been affected, according to health authorities.
In the second quarter of 2018, alone, 40,000 new cases were recorded.
The vast majority of the new cases were sexually transmitted, which is a new trend.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China due to infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people receiving HIV in this way has been reduced to something near zero, Chinese health authorities say at a conference in Yunnan province.
In a year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexually transmitted HIV is an acute problem in China’s LGBT community.
In 1997, homosexuality was legalized, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be a widespread phenomenon.
Studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men marry women sooner or later because of the country’s conservative values.
Many cases of infection are due to the lack of use of contraception in these conditions.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised free and equal access to HIV medicine as an attempt to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies staff leaked data on Republican senators and thunders against "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
A member of the House of Representatives Maxine Waters denied in Saturday’s allegation that a member of her staff has shared personal information about three Republican senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the allegations stemmed from websites and supports from “the far right.”
“Lies, lies, and more terrible lies,” Waters wrote in a Twitter post.
The published information allegedly contained home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina as well as Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of whom are from Utah.
The information was posted online on Thursday by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate hearing on allegations of sexual assault against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak happened after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative support sites such as Gateway Pundit of RedState announced that the IP addresses indicated that the information had been posted by Waters' people, after which they published information about a member of Waters' staff.
“This unsubstantiated accusation is completely untrue and a direct lie,” Waters continued.
"Member of my staff, whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false accusations, is in no way responsible for this leak of information.
This unfounded accusation is completely untrue and a direct lie.”
Waters' announcement quickly received criticism online, including from former press secretary of the White House Ari Fleischer.
"It's an angry denial," Fleischer wrote.
“That suggests she doesn’t have the right temperament to be a congressman.
If you are accused of something you haven't done, don't get angry.
You must not be defiant.
You must not question the prosecutor's motives.
You have to keep your temper.”
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Kavanaugh, who was criticized for being too angry at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate aiming to take Waters' place in the midterm election, also made his views known on Twitter.
“Great, if that’s true,” he tweeted.
In Waters' official statement, she says that her staff has contacted "the relevant authorities and the law enforcement regarding these fraudulent allegations."
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are found," she continued, "and that they will be held legally responsible for their actions, which are destructive and dangerous to everyone and everyone in my staff."
Review of Johnny English Strikes Again – Surprising Spy Comedy with Rowan Atkinson
It has become the norm to look for a Brexit angle in all recent films with a British ice cap, and it also seems relevant to the latest action comedy in the Johnny English series, which started back in 2003 with Johnny English and reappeared in 2011 with Johnny English - born again.
Will the dare, sarcastic self-sacrifice, about how much we are struggling with, become the country's new export opportunity?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English with the rubber face and the big eyes has been given his permission to make roars again—again. His name signals more than anything else that he is a comical invention aimed at places where the cinema visitors do not speak English.
He is, of course, the blunt secret agent, who, despite his desire to be a smooth gentleman, has a bit of Clouseau, a knife tip Mr. Bean and a proper clap of him, who performed a single tone for the Chariots of Fire song at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
He is also originally based on the worldwide and international lug pants that left chaos in his wake after Atkinson portrayed him in Barclaycard's television commercials.
There are some good moments in this latest shot on the tribe of JE.
I loved when Johnny English approached a helicopter wearing a medieval armor, and the propellers sounded against his helmet.
You can see Atkinson’s talent for physical comedy, but the humor feels quite overwhelming and strangely superfluous, especially now that more “serious” film series like 007 and Mission Impossible also offer compelling comedy as an ingredient.
The humor seems to be aimed at children rather than adults, and for me Johnny English’s crazy adventure is not as inventive and focused as Atkinson’s silent film follies in the role of Mr. Bean.
The point of departure for the film is that Britain is in serious trouble.
An internet hacker has infiltrated England’s top secret spy network and revealed the identities of all the English agents in the field of horror for the responsible agent – a unfortunately very small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last chance for a pompous and combative Prime Minister who is already suffering a complete meltdown in political popularity: Emma Thompson does her best with this Teresa May-like character, but there is not much to work with in the manuscript.
When her security advisers inform her that every active spy has been revealed, she is forced to retire someone.
And of course it is the clumsy Johnny English, who is now a school inspector at a high school, but who secretly teaches how to become a secret agent. There are some funny sequences here when English stands for some kind of School of Rock education in espionage.
English rushes back to a crisis meeting at Whitehall and reunites with his hard-tested former right-hand Bough, who is again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to an overenthusiastic but well-meaning submarine captain – a role Vicki Pepperdine played.
Thus, the Royal Intelligence Service's all-important Batman and Robin are back when they meet Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatale, Ophilia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is swindling close to letting himself be embroiled by charismatic and eerie tech billionaire Jason Volta – played by Jake Lacy – who claims to be able to solve England’s computer problems.
English and Bough start their furiously risky escapades: disguised as servants, they set fire to a distinguished French restaurant; they create chaos as they smuggle themselves aboard Volta’s luxury yacht; and English creates pure ragnarok as he tries to use virtual reality glasses to familiarize himself with Volta’s house.
All the guns are fired in the final sequence of the film, but no matter how well-meaning and energetic it is, there is a sense of child television about it.
Pretty mediocre.
And as I couldn’t help but think of the other Johnny English movies: Can the English film industry not give Rowan Atkinson a role that gives his talent justice?
Labour rejects barring plans for four-day working week with unchanged pay to the British
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour is said to be considering a radical plan so that the English can settle for a four-day working week, but get paid for five.
The party will reportedly have business leaders using their artificial intelligence (AI) savings to give employees an extra day off.
This would mean that employees would have three days of weekends without going down in wages.
Sources say that the idea would be consistent with the party’s economic goal of pulling the country in a more favorable direction for the workers.
Trades Union Congress supports the idea of a four-day working week as a way for workers to benefit from a changing economy.
An experienced member of the Larbour Party told The Sunday Times: “A political proposal is expected to be made public by the end of the year.”
"It's not going to happen in a day, but a four-day working week is a goal that fits with the party's approach to changing the economy to the benefit of the workers and to the party's overall strategy for industry."
Labour would not be the first to support such an idea when the Green Party proposed a four-day working week during the 2017 parliamentary election campaign.
However, the target is not supported by the Labour Party’s unanimous vote.
A spokesman for the Labour Party said: “A four-day working week is not the party’s policy and is not under consideration in the party.”
Labour shadow finance minister John McDonnell used last week’s party meeting to record his plans for a socialist economic revolution.
McDonnell says he is determined to relinquish power from “anonymous directors” and “exploitors” in utilities.
The shadow financier's plans also cast doubt on whether the current shareholders of water utilities will get their money back, as a government with Labour at the head could "counterbalance" them on the basis of immoral acts.
He also confirmed plans to get workers into corporate boards and to create including owner funds, which will distribute 10 percent of private companies’ share value to employees, who will receive up to <0xC2><0xA3>500 annually.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell 60 Minutes if FBI investigation of Kavanaugh could change their voice
The FBI investigation into allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week, raising the question of whether the FBI finds could cause Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview that aired on Sunday, 60 Minutes journalist Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could dig something up that could make them change their minds.
Kennedy seemed to be more open to the idea than his South Carolina colleague.
"Yes, of course," Kennedy said.
“When I went to the hearing, I said that I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened – after the accusations came out – and said, “Did you do that?”
He was steeled, determined, and unambiguous.”
Graham's voice, on the other hand, seems to be chiseled in stone.
"I have decided on Brett Kavanaugh, and other things would require a very violent accusation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know Brett strongly denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of those she mentioned could confirm it.
It happened 36 years ago.
I can't see it needing to change anything."
What is the Global Citizens Festival, and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
On Saturday, New York hosts the Global Citizens Festival – an annual music festival with a very impressive selection of artists and an equally impressive goal; to put an end to the world’s poverty.
The Global Citizens Festival will receive tens of thousands of people for the seventh time on Central Park’s large lawn, where they can look forward to concerts with Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes. At the same time, the festival will raise awareness of the real goal of ending extreme poverty in 2030.
Launched in 2012, the Global Citizen Festival is an expansion of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy organization fighting to end poverty by increasing the number of active opponents.
To receive a free ticket to the event (if you don’t want to pay for a VIP ticket), concertgoers must perform a series of tasks or “actions”. For example, do volunteer work, write to a world leader, make a phone call or any other meaningful action that can raise awareness about the goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been, now that they have 12 years left to achieve the goal?
Does the idea of rewarding people with a free concert real change, or is it just another case of so-called “clicktivism” – i.e., that people feel that they make a difference by signing a petition online or making a Twitter post?
Global Citizen reports that since 2011, they have registered more than 19 million “actions” from their members aimed at different goals.
They believe that these actions have spurred world leaders to make binding targets and policies that are equivalent to more than $37 billion, which by 2030 are expected to have affected more than 2.25 billion people.
At the beginning of 2018, the group listed 390 goals and actions that had become due to their actions, which ran into over $10 billion, which had already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that these funds have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
One of the main objectives is The Power of Nutrition, which has been launched in England and is a collaboration between investors and strong people. They strive to "help children live out their full potential" and promise $35 million to address nutrition problems in Rwanda after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the help of the English government, donors, other countries’ governments and world citizens like you, the social injustice with malnutrition can become a footnote in the history books,” said the ambassador for The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, to the audience at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that the government of England has now promised funds to improve the nutrition of mothers and children after receiving more than 5,000 calls online. This project, Power of Nutrition, will help five million mothers and children with nutrition counseling.
In response to one of the website’s frequently asked questions, which reads: “What makes you think we can put an end to extreme poverty?”,
Global Citizen wrote: “It’s going to be a long and hard fight, and sometimes we’ll stumble and make mistakes.
But as with the civil rights movement and the anti-apartheid movements, we will succeed because we are stronger together.”
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are among the performers at this year’s festival in New York. Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman are to be hosts.
U.S. can use its fleet to “block” Russian energy exports, says U.S. Home Secretary
"If necessary," Washington may use its fleet to prevent Russian energy from entering the market, including in the Middle East, U.S. Home Secretary Ryan Zinke reveals to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s interference in Syria – especially where they operate at the invitation of the legitimate government – is a pretext to expand the sale of their energy.
“I think they are in the Middle East because they want to sell energy, just as they do in Eastern and Southern Europe,” he said.
And according to him, there are both methods and resources to prevent it.
“With our fleet, the United States has the opportunity to ensure that there is free passage on the seaways, and if necessary, we can also block them, so we ensure that their energy does not enter the market,” he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants at a meeting held by the Consumer Energy Alliance – a nonprofit organization that considers itself the “voice of the American energy consumer.”
He compared Washington’s approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, saying that they are essentially the same.
“The economic opportunities relative to Iran and Russia are about exploiting and replacing fuel,” he said, referring to Russia as a “one-trick pony” whose economy relies on fossil fuels.
These statements come after the Trump administration has aimed to increase European exports of liquefied natural gas to replace Russia, which is by far the cheapest choice for European consumers.
To achieve this, Trump administration officials, including Donald Trump himself, have tried to convince Germany to withdraw from the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 management project, which, according to Trump, has made Berlin the “prisoner” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the 11 billion-expensive Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is expected to double its current capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is purely an economic project.
The Kremlin believes that Washington’s strong opposition to the project is an expression of unequal conditions of competition and is simply due to economic considerations.
“I think we share the view that energy should not be a tool to exert pressure and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose a supplier,” Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said at a subsequent meeting in Moscow with U.S. Energy Minister Rick Perry in September.
The position of the Americans is met by criticism from Germany, which has confirmed its participation in the project.
Germany’s leading industrial organisation, BDI, has asked the United States to interfere outside the EU’s energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem with a third party interfering in our energy supplies," said the head of BDI, Dieter Kempf, after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren “considers strongly” to run for president in 2020, Massachusetts senator says
Senator of Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren "considers strongly" to run for president after the midterm election, she said Saturday.
During a council meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering running.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and repair our political system, and that requires a woman in front,” she said.
“After November 6, I will strongly consider running for president.”
Warren made his opinion about President Donald Trump known during the city council and said that he “leads the country in the wrong direction.”
“I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren has been voiced in his criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren wrote: “Of course, the FBI must investigate the matter before the vote.”
However, a Thursday poll shows that the majority of Warren’s own backcountry doesn’t believe she should stand up in 2020.
According to a poll by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe, 58% of “probable” voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not stand.
32% supported the possible candidacy.
The poll showed greater support for former Governor Deval Patrick with 38% for and 48% against a possible line-up.
Other high-profile Democratic candidates discussed in the 2020 presidential election include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden announced his final decision in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin mentions Track Palin’s PTSD at a voter meeting for Donald Trump
The 26-year-old Track Palin was a year in Iraq after joining the army in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
“What my own son is going through after he’s returned home allows me to relate to other families who feel the consequences of PTSD and other injuries that our soldiers return home with,” she told the crowd at a Trump election meeting in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in space" and said of his son and other war veterans that "they have changed and become harder. They go and think whether there is respect for it, their colleagues on land and in the air and all other members of the military have done for the country."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and was charged with domestic violence against a woman, to prevent the notification of domestic violence and to be in possession of a weapon in an intoxicated state, said Dan Bennet, a spokesman for the Wasillas police.
18 states and D.C. support opposition to new asylum law
18 states and the District of Columbia support a legal objection to a new U.S. law that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and the D.C. delivered a party-independent statement in Washington Friday in support of an asylum seeker who opposes the law.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace vs. Sessions trial filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal law has not been published.
She states that her partner "and his violent sons, who are gang members," had abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
The state prosecutors supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of US asylum seekers tribes, who land with far-reaching problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum law overturned a decision made by the U.S. Immigration Board in 2014, which allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to seek asylum.
The District of Columbia prosecutor, Karl Racine, said Friday that the new law "looks away from decades of state, federal, and international law."
"Federal law requires all asylum applications to be settled on the basis of relevant facts and circumstances, and such an obstacle goes against that principle," the party-independent statement states.
The lawyers also argued in the statement that the law of rejecting immigrants harms the U.S. economy, as they are more likely to become self-employed and "provide the necessary labor force."
In June, Justice Secretary Jeff Sessions deprived immigration judges of the right to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
“Asyl is offered to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear on the basis of race, religion, nationality or membership of a given social group or political standpoint,” Sessions said in his June 11 bill.
It has never been intended that asylum should solve all the problems – or just all the serious problems – that people all over the world face every day.
As the death toll doubles, attempts to find survivors in Palu become desperate.
For survivors, the situation only got worse.
"It's very tense," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, comforting her little fever-stricken boy at an evacuation center in the ruined city of Palu.
"Every minute the ambulance comes in with corpses.
We need clean water.”
The residents now returned to their ruined homes to sort through soaked belongings and save what they could find.
Several hundred people were injured, and the hospitals, which were also affected by the 7.5 earthquake, were unable to follow suit.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who broke his back and shoulder, were located outside Palus Military Hospital, where patients were treated outdoors due to severe aftershocks.
He got tears in his eyes when he told how the violent earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor he shared with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save ourselves.
I was masted up against a broken wall, I think," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was going to a wedding in the city.
"I heard my wife calling for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they are safe.”
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of Unhealthy Methods and Propaganda Ads
A week after a Chinese newspaper brought a four-page ad in an American newspaper that hit the drum for the benefits of an American-Chinese collaboration, the U.S. Ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump referred Wednesday to China Daily’s paid entry into Des Moines Register – Iowa’s best-selling newspaper – after accusing China of interfering in November 6 congressional elections.
US officials told Reuters that Trump’s accusation of Chinese interference in the U.S. election marks a new phase in Washington’s escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to announce to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are now locked in an escalating trade war, where they have repeatedly imposed tariffs on each other’s imports.
China’s retaliatory duty in the trade war was to hit exporters in states like Iowa, which supported Trump’s Republican party, Chinese and American experts believe.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China former governor for a number of years in Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural food to China, said Beijing has damaged U.S. workers, farmers, and businesses.
Branstad wrote in a leader in Sunday's Des Moines Register that China "raises the use of the unethical methods by running propaganda ads in our own free press."
“By spreading propaganda, the Chinese government takes advantage of the proud American tradition of freedom of expression and press freedom by running a paid ad in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
"In the kiosks here in Beijing, on the other hand, you will find only a few dissenting voices, and you will not get a fair picture of the Chinese people's differing views on China's worrying economic direction, as the media is under tight control by the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers failed to publish" his article, although he did not say which one.
Republicans alienate women ahead of midterm elections with Kavanaugh case, analysts warn
While many top Republicans support and defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh against allegations of sexual assault, analysts warn that they will experience a backlash in the upcoming midterm election, especially from women.
The case has put the feelings in the boil, and most Republicans have already announced that they would like to see the voting process continue.
"This can't be done about," Grant Reher, professor of political science at Syracuse University Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article Saturday.
Reher said he doubts that Republican Senator Jeff Flakes (Arizona)'s request for an 11-hour FBI investigation will soften anger voters.
“Women don’t forget what happened yesterday — they don’t forget it tomorrow or November,” Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, told The Hill on Friday.
On Friday morning, during a Senate demonstration, the protesters shouted, "November is coming!" when Republicans, who control the court committee, chose to proceed with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Professor Christine Blasey Ford.
“The democratic enthusiasm and motivation will reach new heights,” the independent political commentator Stu Rothenberg told the news media.
“People say it has already reached a high level; that’s right.
But it can reach even higher, especially among women swing voters in the suburbs and younger voters – 18-29 years old – who rarely vote, despite not liking the president.”
Even before Ford’s public accusations of the Supreme Court nominee’s sexual assault, analysts had pointed out that it could be a setback if Republicans continued the nomination.
“It has become a worse mess for Republicans,” said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, at the start of last week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about the committee’s vote or the final result, or about Kavanaugh being held accountable; it’s also about how Republicans have handled this and how they’ve treated her,” said Guy Cecil, president of Priorities USA, a group that supports Democrats in being elected.
But the Americans seem to have shared attitudes about who they should believe in after the testimony from Ford and Kavanaugh, where the latter has a bit more on their side.
A new YouGov poll found that 41% of respondents believed in Ford’s testimony, while 35% said they believed in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said they believed Kavanaugh was either likely or certainly lying during his testimony, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
At the request of Flake, the FBI is now investigating the allegations made by Ford and at least one other, Deborah Ramirez wrote to The Guardian.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh was fully abusing her when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee showed his genitals to her for a party when they both studied at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the internet plans to create a new internet and compete with Google and Facebook
The inventor of the Internet, Tim Berners-Lee, is launching a new company to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The technology legend’s latest project is called Inrupt and is a company based on Berners-Lee’s open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who has access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners Lee joked that the plan with Inrupt is "world domination".
“We have to do it now,” he said of the startup.
“It’s a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid’s technology so that people can create their own “personal online data collection” or a POD.
It can include contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and professional tools.
It is as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were available in a single browser at the same time.
What is unique about the personal online data collection is that it is entirely up to the user to decide who can access the specific information.
The company calls it “personal empowerment through data.”
The idea with Inrupt is, according to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, to pool resources, processes and capabilities to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some project contract software developers and a community of volunteer programmers.
From this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on Inrupt’s website.
Berners-Lee says he and his team don’t talk to Facebook or Google about whether to change everything completely, so all their business models suddenly become redundant.
“We don’t ask for your permission.”
In a post on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt’s “mission is to offer commercial energy and an ecosystem that can ensure the integrity and quality of the new Internet built on Solid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he started the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an important voice in the so-called net neutrality debate.
As Inrupt launches, Berners-Lee will still be the inventor and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic about the next period of the Internet,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Victims of the Victoria Cross from World War I are honored
The English Church’s only priest, who won the Victoria Cross by fighting during World War I, is celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Wann won the Order on September 29, 1918, during the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But he was killed four days later by a sniper and was never told that he had won the highest English military order.
On Saturday, a memorial stone was unveiled by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northhamptonshire.
Michael Vann, one of his grandchildren, said that it was "incredibly symbolic" that the stone was revealed exactly 100 years after his grandfather's order-winning achievement.
According to the London Gazette, Lieutenant Colonel Vann on 29 September 1918 led his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a very thick fog and under heavy fire from machine guns and artillery."
He later ran to the front line and led his people forward with the "greatest man's courage" before attacking an artillery officer and unharmed three guns alone.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – just one month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann of 72 said his grandfather's actions were "something I knew I could never live up to, but that makes me humble."
He and his brother James Vann also made a wreath after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann stated that he "felt very honored to participate in the parade" and added that "the support of all these people emphasizes the true heroism."
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, but instead got Gurli Gris
Imagine that you’ve stayed up all night to see the star-studded Bellator 206 and then are refused to see the main event.
There were 13 games on the program from San Jose, including six games on the main program, and they were shown throughout the night in England on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald got ready to meet, the viewers in England were somewhat surprised when the transmission switched to show Gurli Gris.
Some were unimpressed after they had stayed awake until early morning for this very fight.
A fan on Twitter described the shift to a children's cartoon as "a kind of sick joke."
"According to the legislation, this content was not appropriate at 6 a.m., so they had to switch to children's programs," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president, when asked about the broadcast.
"'Grisen Gurli', yes."
Bellator’s CEO, Scott Coker, said they will work to include English viewers in planning ahead.
“When thinking about the re-release, I think we can make it work,” Coker said.
"But it's six o'clock Sunday morning over there, and we won't find a solution to that until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on the case.
Believe me, when I was changed, I got a lot of messages, and they weren’t all friendly.
We tried to fix it, and we thought it was a technical mistake.
But it was actually the legislation.
I can promise you it won't happen next time.
We just had five games instead of six, like we usually do. We tried to give our fans something extra, and then we went over time.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley Has 'Minded' Over Sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he felt less valued than everyone else in his upbringing due to his sexuality, but that motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said that it didn’t matter to him until he came to the major classes that “everyone isn’t like me.”
When he was on Radio 4's first Desert Island Discs with Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about gay rights to give others "hope."
He also said he was less likely to win the Olympics after becoming a parent.
The usual host on the radio program, Kirsty Young, has taken a few months off due to illness.
Daley was a guest on Laverne's first program and said he felt "less worth" than anyone else in his upbringing because "it was not socially accepted to like boys and girls."
He said, “To this day, the feelings of feeling worth remembering and feeling different have been the things that have given me the strength to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was “something,” he said, so he didn’t disappoint everyone when they got to know his sexuality.
The double Olympic bronze winner has become a high-profile LGBT champion and used his participation at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal for a decriminalization of homosexuality in several countries.
He said he spoke out because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without negative consequences, and he would give others "hope".
The triple world champion said he had been “surprised” when he fell in love with a man – the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married last year the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, but said the age difference had never been a problem.
He said it’s hard to find someone of the same age who has experienced similar ups and downs when you go through so much at such a young age – he went to his first Olympics at age 14 and his father died of cancer three years later.
The couple became parents in June to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that "all his perspective" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, it would be all about winning a gold medal," he said.
“But there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.”
His son has the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he would die, and one of the last things he asked was if they had got tickets to London in 2012 – when he would be on the front row.
"I couldn't tell him he wouldn't be there at the time.
I held his hand when his breathing stopped, and it first dawned on me that he was not immortal when he stopped breathing and was dead,” he said.
The following year, Daley participated in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
“I just knew that was what I had dreamed of my whole life – diving in front of a home audience at the Olympics. There was nothing that could beat that feeling,” he said.
It was also the inspiration for his first song choice – Proud of Heather Small – which had meant a lot during the start of the Olympics and still gave him goose bumps.
Desert Island Discs will run on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 a.m. BST.
Unsharp Mickelson on Ryder Cup bench on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson sets a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th game in the Ryder Cup, but he must do something about the form if it's not going to be a sad mileten.
Mickelson, who sets a record for the 12th time being in the competition, which takes place every two years, was put on the bench by Captain Jim Furyk due to Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being in the center of events for the United States as usual, the five-time grand winner had to act cheers and practice his game in the hope of correcting the spires.
Even at the height of his career, he had the most straight drive, which is why the 48-year-old is not a perfect match for the course at Le Golf National, where the long rough often punishes wild shots.
And if the pitch wasn’t a big enough mouthful, Mickelson will face the ever-exact winner of the British Open Francesco Molinari, who has teamed up with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans starting the 12 single games start strong, Mickelson’s fight can be crucial.
Furyk did not express surprising confidence in his teammate.
“He understood his role completely today, gave me a pat on my back, put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He has a great faith in himself.”
He is in the Hall of Fame and has given so much to these teams in the past – and also this week.
I didn’t think he would play two games.
I thought he was going to play more, but that’s how it went, and that’s how it should be.
He wants to be out there like everyone else.”
On Sunday, Mickelson beat Nick Faldo's record for most games played in the Ryder Cup.
It could be the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never quite matched his individual performance.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 defeats and seven draws, although Furyk said his presence contributes with something indefinable.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, witty, he likes to stick to people, and he's good to have in the holdroom," he explained.
"I also think the younger players had fun playing against him this week, which was fun to watch.
He contributes much more than just the game.”
European captain Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn knows that great leadership can quickly disappear
European captain Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn knows from experience that a solid lead before the last day of Ryder Cup's single show can quickly become nerve-wracking.
The Dane made his debut in 1997 in Valderrama, where a team led by Seve Ballesteros had a lead of five points over the Americans, but was just about to be picked up before the finish line with a victory of 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a nice lead in Valderrama, we had a nice lead in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we only won exactly," says Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn after seeing the 2018 team win both 5-3 Friday and yesterday for a total lead of 10-6 at Le Golf National.
The story tells me and the rest of the team that it's not over.
It's gonna have to be full garbage tomorrow.
Go out and do everything right.
It's not over until you have the points on the board.
We have a goal, and that is to try to win the trophy, and that is where our focus is.
I’ve always said that I focus on the 12 players on our side, but we’re also aware of what’s on the other side – the best golfers in the world.”
Satisfied with the performance of his players on a difficult track, Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn added: "I don't take any of this for granted.
Tomorrow is a whole new challenge.
Tomorrow it’s the individual performance that counts, and that’s something completely different.
It’s great to be out there with a partner when it’s going well, but when you’re out there alone, you’re tested on all parameters as a golfer.
That’s what players need to understand – get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you have to leave your partner, for he will also bring out the best in himself.”
Jim Furyk, who hopes for better individual performance than in the partner game with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Furyk himself has experienced coversions on the last day, first on the winning team in Brookline, before he lost when Europe made the "Miracle of Medinah".
“I remember every word,” he said when asked how captain Ben Crenshaw had spoken to his players before the last day.
“We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you want to have a good start, as you saw at Brookline, as you saw at Medinah.
Once momentum has found a direction, it puts a great deal of pressure on the midterms.
We put our team together in relation to it and put the players on the pitch in the order we feel. We're trying to create magic tomorrow."
Thomas has been given the task of trying to lead the backlash and faces Rory McIlroy in the top game, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter and the other Europeans play in the first half of the order.
"I chose this group of players in this order because I think it ensures us all the way through," Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn said of his choice of single players.
Germany's new warship is postponed
The German Navy's newest frigate should have been ready in 2014 to replace warships from the Cold War. But the Germans must wait at least a year more due to technical problems and an escalating price, local media writes.
The deployment of the largest ship in the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg class of frigates, "Rheinland-Pfalz", is postponed until the first half of 2019 according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which quotes a spokesman from the military.
The ship should have been part of the fleet in 2014, but delivery problems have plagued the ambitious project.
The four ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, which the fleet ordered back in 2007, will replace the aged frigates of the Bremen class.
About them you know they want a powerful cannon, a wide range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles as well as stealth technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Another important feature for the latest frigates is a minor need for maintenance: it should be possible to keep the frigates away from home ports for up to two years.
But the repeated delays mean that the advanced warships – which are said to make Germany appear an overseas power factor – will already be obsolete when deployed.
The failed F125 frigate created headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to take the ship into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the fleet delivered a ship back to the shipbuilder after delivery.
Not much was known about the reasons for the return, but German media mentioned a number of crucial "software and hardware failures" that made the warship useless in combat situations.
Software failure was of particular importance, as the ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class must be controlled by a crew of 120 sailors – that is only half the crew of the older Bremen frigates.
It also turned out that the ship was too heavy, which reduced its performance and limited the fleet’s ability for future updates.
The 7,000-ton Rhineland-Palatinate is said to be twice as heavy as similar ships used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to hardware failures, the price of the project, which includes training the crew, is also becoming a problem.
It is said to have reached a staggering €3.1 billion (€3.6 billion), with an initial price of €2.2 billion.
The problems with the latest frigates are becoming even more important in the light of recent warnings that Germany’s naval force is shrinking.
Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German government’s defence committee, admitted earlier this year that the fleet “run out of ready-to-use ships.”
The official said the problem has grown over time because the old ships were taken out of use without being replaced.
He regretted that none of the frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class were ready to become part of the fleet.
National Trust sneaks into the secret life of bats
New research from an area in the Scottish Highlands tries to reveal how bats use the landscape when hunting.
The hope is that the findings will shed light on the behaviour of the unique, flying mammals and will help in the work of future conservation efforts.
The study is conducted by scientists from the Scotland National Trust and follows common bats, dwarf bats, long-eared bats and water bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment is placed in carefully selected locations in the area to record the activities of the bats during the season.
Data is also collected by NTS staff and volunteers using handheld detectors.
In-depth analysis of the sound recordings will reveal the frequencies of the bat calls and show which species does what.
To produce a detailed landscape picture of their behaviour, a report and a map of the habitat are made.
Nature conservation advisor to NTS Rob Dewar hopes that the results reveal which areas of habitat are most important and how they are used by the different species.
This knowledge can help determine the benefits of habitat conservation efforts such as the establishment of meadows and how best to preserve forest areas for bats and similar species.
The number of bats in Scotland and the UK has fallen dramatically over the last 100 years.
They are threatened by buildings and urban expansion projects that affect the owners and restrict their habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a danger, as can fly traps, chemical treatment of building materials and attacks from pets.
In fact, bats are not blind.
But because they primarily hunt at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes.
They use an advanced echolocation technique to find insects and fly around obstacles.
NTS, which is responsible for the preservation of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, takes bats very seriously.
They have ten trained experts, who often collect data, inspect nests, and sometimes take rescue actions.
The organization has even made Scotland’s first and only dedicated bat sanctuary in the area around Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight out of ten of Scotland’s bat species.
The area's manager, David Thompson, says it's an ideal territory for them.
“Here at Threave we have a really good area for bats,” he said.
"We have old buildings, a lot of old trees and all the good habitat.
There’s a lot you don’t know about bats, so working here and elsewhere can help you understand what they need to thrive.”
He stresses the importance of looking for bats before doing maintenance work on properties, as the destruction of a single nest can kill up to 400 females and young, thus risking an entire local population being wiped out.
Bats are protected, and it is illegal to kill, bother or disturb them or their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish project manager for the Bat Conservation Trust, has urged the public to give a hand.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many of the species we have, we don't know how populations develop."
Ronaldo dismisses rape charges while lawyers sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has called rape charges against him “fake news” and says that people “will promote themselves” by using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German news media Der Spiegel, who brought the allegations.
The attacker from Portugal and Juventus has been accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
It is alleged that he has paid her $375,000 to keep it a secret, Der Spiegel wrote on Friday.
A few hours after the allegations had been made public, 33-year-old Ronaldo spoke to his 142 million followers on Instagram Live and criticized the information for being “fake news.”
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news," Ballon d'Or's five-time winner told the camera.
“They will promote themselves by using my name.
That's normal.
They'll be famous by saying my name, but that's part of the job.
I’m a happy man and everything is fine,” the player added, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel because of the charges they have called "an unforgivable disclosure of suspicions about the privacy sphere".
Lawyer Christian Schertz says the player would seek compensation for “moral corruption in a class similar to the accusation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.”
The incident allegedly took place in June 2009 in a room at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anal, according to the filed report in the Clark County, Nevada, city court.
Mayorga claims that Ronald fell on his knees after the alleged incident and said he was "a good guy 99% of the time" gripped by "the one percent".
The court documents allege that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that there was consent to it.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had her injuries photographed in a hospital, but that she later agreed to an agreement outside the court because she felt "fear of retaliation" and worried about being "publicly disgraced".
The 34-year-old now says she will reverse the deal, as she is still deeply affected by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo faced a change from Manchester United to Real Madrid when the incident was due to take place, and this summer he switched to Italian club Juventus for €100 million.
Brexit: Britain ‘will forever regret’ losing car manufacturers
Britain “will regret it forever” if it lost its status as the world’s leading car manufacturer after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "disturbing" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily lower production at the Burnaston factory near Derby.
"We need a deal," Clark said.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that longer waiting at the border in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
The Burnaston factory, which produces Toyota’s Auris and Avensis, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the EU.
“As I see it, production will stop at our factory if Britain smokes out of the EU at the end of March,” said Marvin Cooke, CEO of Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, express fear of leaving the EU without an agreement on cross-border trade.
For example, BMW says they will close their Mini factory in Oxford one month after Brexit.
The main concern of the car manufacturers has to do with risks with the supply chain in the event of a withdrawal without agreement.
Toyota’s production runs on a tight schedule, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, problems could arise at the border, which, according to the automotive industry, could lead to delays and lack of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to store more than a day’s production at the Derbyshire factory, and then production would be stopped,” the company said.
Clark says Theresa May’s Chequers plan for future negotiations with the EU is “composed to precisely avoid these checks at the border.”
“We want the best deal that not only allows us – as I call it – to enjoy our current success, but to seize this opportunity,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today program.
“The opinions of Toyota and other manufacturers point out that we need to be able to continue what has been successful supply chains.”
Toyota could not say how long production would have stopped, but in the longer term higher prices would reduce the competitiveness of the factory, which will ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years and is a joint trustee at the factory, says that his members are becoming more and more concerned: "My experience tells me that as soon as these jobs disappear, they will not come back."
A government spokesman said: “We have proposed a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
Trump’s meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, the White House says
Donald Trump’s important meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could “be postponed one more week” as the countdown around Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein looks at the special prosecutor Robert Mueller over his shoulder during his investigation into Russian election interference, connections between Trump’s supporters and Russia, and the president’s possible obstruction of justice.
Whether Trump will fire the deputy justice minister and thereby risk Mueller’s independence has been a gossip topic in Washington for months.
The New York Times wrote earlier this month that Rosenstein was considering wearing a microphone to record talks with Trump and the opportunity to depose the president via the 25th paragraph.
Rosenstein denied the news.
But last Monday he went to the White House, and the rumor was that he would quit.
Instead, a meeting was held Thursday with Trump, who was then in the UN headquarters in New York.
Trump said he would "prefer not" to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was delayed to avoid a coincidence with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, where Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who have accused him of sexual assault, were to testify.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, delaying the Senate election.
Trump press secretary Sarah Sanders was on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked at the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "There is no set date. It could be this week. I can also imagine that it could be pushed a week with everything going on in the Supreme Court.
But we have to see, and I like to always keep the press up to date."
Some journalists would challenge this claim: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said the lack of press meetings was not due to TV journalists playing for the gallery, but added, "I don't disagree that they're playing up to the camera."
She then said that the direct contact between Trump and the press will be increased.
"The president accepts more questions from the press than any president before him," she said, adding without quoting a source, "We've looked at the numbers."
Press meetings will still take place, Sanders said, but “if the press has the opportunity to ask direct questions to the President of the United States, it is infinitely better than talking to me.
We are trying to give you a rich opportunity, and you have seen us do it over the last few weeks, and it is going to be in the place of the press meeting when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump often accepts questions when he leaves the White House or attends open hearings or press meetings with high-ranking guests.
Press meetings with Trump alone are rare.
This week in New York, the president showed why when he made an improvised and sometimes mysterious figure in front of the journalists present.
Minister of Health contacts EU staff in Scottish health care following Brexit concerns
The Minister of Health has written to the EU staff working in Scotland’s NHS to express the country’s gratitude and desire for them to stay after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than half a year before Britain withdrew from the EU.
The Government of Scotland has already committed itself to paying for applications for permanent residence for EU citizens working in its delegated public sector.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: “During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on withdrawal have continued, and it appears that decisions are expected for autumn.
But the British government has also increased its preparation for a possible Brexit without an agreement.
I know it must be a very uncertain period for all of you.
That is why I would like to repeat how much I appreciate the effort each employee has made, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from and outside the EU come with valuable experiences and competencies that strengthen and improve health care work to the benefit of patients and the community.
Scotland is your home and we want you to stay.
Christion Abercrombie suffers acute surgery after head injury
The lineback from the Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, was acutely operated after suffering a head injury in Saturday's 31-27 defeat to Vanderbilt Commodores, reports it from Tennessee's Mike Organ.
First coach of Tennessee State, Rod Reed, told reporters that the incident occurred before the break.
"He went out to the sidelines and just fell over there," Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sidelines before putting him on a stretcher and taking him into further investigation.
A Tennessee State spokesman told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie's operation at Vanderbilt Medical Center was over.
Harris added that there are “no details about the type or extent of the injury yet,” and Tennessee State is trying to figure out when he suffered the injury.
Abercrombie is studying for the second year and is starting his first season in Tennessee State after a shift from Illinois.
He had five tackles on Saturday before he left the game, giving him 18 tackles this season.
Foreign buyers are charged higher stamp duty when buying houses in the UK
Foreign buyers are charged higher stamp duty when they buy a property in the UK. The extra money, according to the Conservative Party, must help the homeless.
This move will dampen Corbyn’s success in attracting young voters.
The higher stamp duty will hit those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Ministry of Finance expects it to raise <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year for the homeless.
Theresa May will today propose that foreign buyers be charged a higher stamp duty when buying properties in the UK, for the benefit of the homeless.
The move will be seen as an attempt to counter Jeremy Corbyn’s success in attracting young voters with promises of cheaper housing and pursuing those with the highest income.
The increase in the stamp duty will affect people and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK, and the income from this must be used for the government’s struggle to ensure that everyone has a place to sleep.
The additional fee, which is added to the current stamp duty and the higher levels introduced two years ago on multi-home purchases and purchases for rent, can reach up to 3 %.
The Ministry of Finance expects it to raise <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13% of new buildings in London are bought by people living abroad, which causes prices to rise and makes it harder for first-time buyers to get a foothold in the housing market.
Many rich areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become "ghost cities" due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new bill comes weeks after Boris Johnson proposed a cut in the stamp duty to make it easier for young people to buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping property prices up by buying reasons they don’t use. He asked May to drop quotas on cheap housing to solve Britain’s “shameful housing situation.”
Corbyn has proposed an eye-catching range of housing reforms, including control of rental prices and the removal of the landlord's ability to put people on the street if they comply with the lease.
He will also strengthen the ability to build public housing.
May said: "Last year I said that I would use my presidency to restore the British dream; that life will be better for every generation.
And that means repairing our non-functioning housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
But it is not as easy for foreign companies and people living outside the UK to buy housing as it is for hard-working Britons.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home has become too distant, and the unworthiness of sleeping on the street is still too widespread.”
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to become Scotland's coach"
The head of Sunderland, Jack Ross, says his "ultimate goal" is at some point to become Scotland's coach.
The shot at 42 takes on the challenge of reviving the club from the North East, which now has third place in League One, three points from the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after looking back at St Mirren in the Scottish Premiership last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
“I played a game with the B team, and that’s it,” Ross told BBC Scotland’s Sportsound.
"But I grew up seeing Scotland at Hampden with my father when I was a child, and it has always drawn in me.
However, that option would only come about if I was successful in training clubs.”
Ross' predecessors as coach for Sunderland are Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic coach says he had no concerns about following such established names in such a large club and had previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Now I measure success by saying, 'I can get this club back in the Premier League.'
Based on the structure and facilities of this club, it undoubtedly belongs in the Premier League,” he said.
“It’s not an easy task, but I’ll probably only see myself as successful here if I can get the club back there.”
Ross is only three years into his career as a coach after a period as an assistant coach at Dumbarton and a 15-month failure as part of Heart's coaching staff.
After that, he helped Alloa come back after being relegated to the third-best row and transformed St Mirren from the downing threat to title winners the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did during his career playing for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a real crossroads," he recalls of the time in Alloa.
“I honestly thought the coaching was right for me, more right than being a player.
It sounds strange because I did it well, made sense and had some success experiences.
But it can be hard to play.
There are many things you need to go through on a weekly basis.
There is still that kind of stress and pressure as a coach, but it just feels right.
I have always wanted to train, and now I do it. I have not been more comfortable with myself throughout my adult life."
You can listen to the full interview at Sportsound on Sunday 30 September at Radio Scotland between noon and 13.00 BST.
The best time for a beer is Saturday at 5.30 p.m., according to the study.
The heatwave this summer has increased earnings for England’s pubs, but has put restaurant chains under greater pressure.
Sales in pubs and bars rose by 2.7% in July, while sales in restaurants have declined 4.8%, figures show.
Peter Martin, a corporate consultant at CGA who has collected the figures, said: “Continuing sunshine and England’s unexpectedly long World Cup has meant that July follows the June pattern, where the pubs experienced 2.8% sales, except that the restaurants are hit harder now.
The 1.8% drop in restaurants in June only worsened in July.
Pubs and bars with a focus on the sale of beverages made it clear best and experienced progress corresponding to the decline of restaurants.
Pubs with a focus on food suffered in the sun, but not as much as the restaurants.
It seems that people just want something to drink.
Across pub and bar chains, sales of beverages increased by 6.6% per month, while food declined by 3.3%."
Paul Newman, who analyses the service industry, said: “The results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
When it comes to sales on the out-of-home market, weather and major social or sporting events are the biggest factors.
It is no surprise that restaurants are still struggling, even though a 4.8% year-on-year decline in sales will hurt a lot in addition to rising costs.
The long, hot summer couldn’t come at a worse time for the food industry, and only time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we’ve had in August will provide a much needed respite.”
The total increase in sales for pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7% in July, which shows the decline in new brands.

Every fifth child has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents.
One in five children – up to 11 years old – have secret accounts on social media that they hide from their parents and teachers, according to a study.
A study of 20,000 school students in grades 4-9 reveals growth in “fake Insta” pages.
The news has increased the fear that sexual content will be posted
20% of students said they have a “main account” that they can show their parents
One in five children up to 11 years of age create social media accounts that they hide from adults.
A study of 20,000 4th grade students reveals massive growth in “fake Insta” accounts – a reference to the Instagram image sharing service.
The news has increased the fear of sexual content being posted.
20% of students said they have a “main account” that they can show their parents while they also have private.
A mother who fell over her 13-year-old daughter's secret account saw a teenager urging others to "rape me."
The study, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) for private schools, found that 40% of 11-18-year-olds had two profiles, half of which admitted to having private accounts.
The head of HMC, Mike Buchanan, said: “It’s frightening that so many teenagers are tempted to create online profiles where their parents and teachers can’t find them.
Eilidh Doyle will be the voice of the athletes on the board of Scottish Athletics.
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the board of Scottish Athletics at the governing body’s annual general meeting.
Doyle is Scotland’s most winning athlete, and President Ian Bettie described the shift as a good opportunity for those who make decisions about sports to benefit from her great 10-year experience at the international level.
"Eilidh enjoys great reputation in the athletic world in Scotland, the UK and the rest of the world, and we are confident that the athletics in Scotland will be able to benefit from getting her on the board," Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I will try to be the voice of athletes, and I hope that I can contribute and help set a direction for sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won two of his four Olympic gold medals in the 200- and 400-meter races at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, and who is now often a commentator for the BBC, could not go after a transitory ischemic attack.
On Twitter, he wrote: “A month ago, I was hit by a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that time would show if I would get on top of it and to what extent.
It’s been hard work, but I’m totally healthy, have learned to walk again and do agility exercises today!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!”
Advertising for breast pump that compares mothers with cows, gets mixed reception online
A breast pump company has shared opinions online with an advertisement that compares nursing mothers with cows that are milked.
To mark the launch of what is said to be “the world’s first silent breast pump,” the tech consumer magazine has released a sarcastic music video-inspired advertisement to show the freedom the new pump gives mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a costume filled with hay, to a song in which it bla. reads: "Yes, I milk myself, but you see no tail" and "If you hadn't noticed it, this isn't yvere, it's my breasts."
“Pump it out, pump it out, I feed my child, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my baby.”
However, the advertisement, which has been published on the company’s Facebook page, has caused controversy online.
With 77,000 views and several hundred comments, the video has received a mixed reception from viewers. Many say that it makes fun of the "treasures" of the milk industry.
"Very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they must become pregnant and give birth before they can produce milk, except that their babies are stolen from them shortly after birth.”

Another wrote: "Understandably traumatic for both mother and child.
But why not use them to advertise a breast pump to mothers who are allowed to keep their children?”
Another added: "What an insensitive advertisement."
Others defended the ad. A woman admitted that she thought the song was "incredibly funny."
“I think it’s a brilliant idea.
If I still breastfed, I would have had one.
Breastfeeding made me feel exactly like a cow.
The advertising is a bit crazy, but I took it for what it was.
It’s a brilliant product,” he wrote.
Another commented: “It’s a fun advertisement aimed at mothers pumping milk (often in their workplace or in toilets) and feeling like ‘coughs’.
It’s not an advertisement that praises or criticizes the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, the women reveal that they have danced with the discreet pumps in their bras.
The concept behind the advertisement is based on the fact that many women who are breastfeeding say they feel like cows.
The Elvie pump is completely silent, has no tubes or hoses and fits discreetly in a nursing bra, giving women the freedom to move, keep their children and even go out while pumping.
Ana Balarin, partner and director of Mother, wrote: “The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between nursing mothers and dairy cows, we wanted to focus on the challenges of breast pumping, while in an entertaining and recognizable way we showed the freedom that the new pump can provide.”
This is not the first time the Elvie pump has made headlines.
In London Fashion Week, a mother went to two catwalks for Marta Jakubowski while she was using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children secretly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has exploded, although the number of border guards has not changed. This is partly due to a tougher rhetoric and the Trump administration’s tougher laws that make it harder to place children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors have been undocumented immigrants themselves, and they have feared their opportunity to stay in the country by standing up and welcoming a child.
The return risk rose in June when the authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of the household would provide fingerprints and that this data would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs enforcement official, testified to Congress that they had arrested several people seeking to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The administration later confirmed that 70 % of the detainees had pure criminal records.
Close to 80% of those who are either sponsors or members of sponsors’ households reside illegally in the country, and a large part of them are foreign criminals.
So we're still chasing those people," said Albence.
In an attempt to deal with children's cases more quickly, the authorities have introduced new rules that require some of them to appear in court within one month of their detention. Previously, it was within 60 days, says aid workers.
Many people use video calls instead of coming up and speaking their case for legal residence to an immigration judge.
Those who are judged unjustified to stay are deported quickly.
The longer children remain in custody, the higher the likelihood that they will experience anxiety or depression, which may lead to violent outcomes or attempted escape, says the aid workers and in reports that have emerged from the system in recent months.
People who advocate for better conditions say that these risks are more pronounced at larger facilities like Tornillo, where size makes it harder to keep an eye on whether a child is suffering.
They added that relocation to a tent village without mental preparation or the opportunity to say goodbye to friends can accumulate traumas that many are already struggling with.
Syria announces U.S., French and Turkish “occupational forces” to withdraw immediately
When Syria’s foreign minister, Walid al-Moualem, spoke to the UN General Assembly, he asked Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, said that the stay of foreign forces in the country is illegal and under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and they will "be met by similar means."
"They must withdraw immediately and without conditions," he said to the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the war on terror is “almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and more millions have fled their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to "fight this crucial war until we have purged all Syrian territories" for both terrorist groups and "illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, primarily training and advising Kurdish and Syrian-Arab forces opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in the war-torn country.
In the area of refugees, Moualem said conditions were good enough for them to return home, after which he accused "some Western countries" of "spreading unfounded fears" that caused the refugees to disappear.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to help facilitate these repatriations,” he said.
“They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian matter.”
The US and the EU have warned that no aid will be provided to rebuild the country until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Syria to establish a buffer zone in the last major rebel-controlled city of Idlib has created an opportunity to continue political talks.
Due to the agreement between Russia and Turkey, a major attack by Syrian forces supported by Russia was avoided against the province where three million live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had “clear deadlines” and expressed hope that military action will go after jihadists from the Nusra Front, a group of al-Qaeda’s originators, who “will be wiped out.”
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of the new committee soon to outline a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for an election.
Moualem has set the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that the work of the panel should be limited to "examining the legislation of the current constitution", and warned against interference.
That's why Trump won another presidential term.
From that logic, Trump is likely to be re-elected in 2020 unless the impeachment and scandals end his presidential term ahead of time, which many liberal viewers are probably hoping for.
In what will undoubtedly be "The most dramatic end to a presidential term ever!"
Currently, there are no signs of eye fatigue.
Since 2014, best-time ratings have nearly doubled for CNN to 1.05 million and nearly tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in best broadcast time compared to 1.7 million viewers four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBC’s The Rachel Maddow Show has the most viewers with up to 3.5 million in evenings with big news.
“It’s a spectacle that people are attracted to because it’s not something we understand,” Neal Baer, head of the ABC drama Designated Survivor, said of a head of the cabinet who becomes president after an attack destroys the Congress building.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy writer and author behind "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club," has another theory.
She remembers a taxonomy in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her that he would vote for Trump.
“Why?” she asked.
“He said, ‘Because he makes me laugh,’” Scovell said.
The chaos has entertainment value.
But unlike all other television programs, the stories coming from Washington can determine the case between Roe and Wade, whether refugee families can be reunited and the health of the world economy.
Changing the channel is only the most privileged ones.
And yet it’s about more than being an enlightened citizen when you see six-hour panel debate, where experts discuss Bob Woodward’s use of “deep background” when he wrote his book “Fear”; Paul Manafort’s ostrich leather jacket at $15,000 (“clothed with hubris,” wrote The Washington Post) and the implications of Stormy Daniels’ vivid descriptions of Trump’s anatomical.
I will never see Super Mario in the same way.
“Some of what makes it feel like a reality show is that he’s giving you something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of “Pawn Stars,” about the Trump show’s rotating crew and daily surprises (shame on N.F.L., praise to Kim Jong-un.)
But if you miss a paragraph, you're off.
When I got to Fleiss this week, it was 26 degrees outside his home on the north coast of Kauai, but he sat inside and saw MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not force himself away; not with Brett Kavanaugh, who was to be heard in the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the Supreme Court's future was to be decided.
"I remember when we did all these crazy shows before, and people said, 'That's the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right."

Large sums find way to the close midterm election to the House of Representatives
It is not surprising that the 17th District of Pennsylvania receives large sums of money. As a result of the equalization of two "Congressional Districts", two members of Congress are fighting for the same seat.
This recently relocated suburb of Pittsburg is creating problems for Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another special election last spring.
Lamb opposes another sitting congressman, Republican Keith Rothfus, who now represents Pennsylvania's 12th district, which overlaps sharply with the new 17th.
The cards were redone after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old district was unconstitutional in favor of Republicans.
The struggle for the new 17th district has started a struggle for financial resources between the major parties’ committees, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a high-waiting election in March's special election for Pennsylvania's 18th District.
The seat has been in the hands of Republicans for over ten years, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political commentators give Democrats a small advantage.
The United States considered punishing El Salvador for support to China, but changed its mind
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing with few protests from Washington.
Trump had a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela from Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until partners threw out Trump’s leadership team.
State Department officials decided to call senior U.S. diplomats back from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama after “the recent decision to no longer recognise Taiwan,” said Heather Nauert, State Department spokeswoman in a statement earlier this month.
But only El Salvador was punished. They received about $140 million from the United States in 2017 for drug control, development and financial support.
The proposed penalties, which include cuts in financial aid and restrictions on entry permits, would have been painful for the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder statistics.
As the internal meetings progressed, North and Central American officials postponed a summit on security and economic development, which should have continued last year’s meeting, which was considered a step towards preventing immigrants from coming to the United States.
But in mid-September, top officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place anyway, thus dropping the consideration of punishment to El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence will speak to the conference scheduled for mid-October to send a signal of the importance that the Americans place in the meeting, diplomats said.
And the three American emissaries secretly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without new harsh demands or punishment from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Bolton did not want to comment on the details of the case described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats who would like to talk about internal considerations if they remained anonymous.
Their descriptions were confirmed by an outside analyst who is close to the administration and who also spoke out on a condition of anonymity.
Know the story
The next obstacle could very well be the special prosecutor Robert Mueller’s report on Trump’s possible obstacle to the investigation, for which there is considerable and publicly available evidence.
Mueller is said to be also directing his investigation into whether Trump’s campaign was secretly cooperating with Russia on the attack on the election.
If Congress were to come into new hands, Trump will likely be held accountable as he prepares to meet voters again and, in time, of course, a jury of his felons.
There are many uncertainties, and I do not claim that Trump’s finality is inevitable – and so are his counterparts in Europe.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we must all make choices that will affect how long the battle will continue.
In 1938, German officers were ready to step in with a coup d'état against Hitler if only the West could have resisted him by supporting the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and did not seize the opportunity to avoid the years-long carnage thereafter.
It is about such turning points that the axis of history is turning, and the inevitable march of democracy is taking or taking off.
In the United States, we are now facing several of these turning points.
What do we do if Trump fires the man who decides the future of Mueller's investigation, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein?
Rosenstein's seat has been warm since the present newspaper could announce that he had proposed last year to make covert recordings of the president and challenged his suitability for office.
According to Rosenstein, The Times' production is inaccurate.
“How do we respond if F.B.I.’s recently requested investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is suspended or not properly conducted – or if he is approved to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And, more importantly, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we fail these trials, it will be a long winter for democracy.
But because of what I learned in Prague, I believe we can do it.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy’s homeland.
She survived, immigrated to America and sent me 60 years later to light the Sabbath lights on the table with the garden cross.

Graham Dorrans of Rangers is optimistic ahead of the match against SK Rapid Wien
Following the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, the Rangers will have good chances to advance from Group G of the Europa League with a win against the Austrians.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his season debut before the 2-2 game against Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use the result as a stepping stone for something even bigger.
“It was a good point for us, because Villarreal is a good team,” said the 31-year-old.
"We went to the fight with the belief that we could bring something home and we got a point.
Maybe we could have gone home, but overall it was probably a reasonable result.
They were probably the best in the first half, but we came out in the second half and were the best team.
Thursday will be another big European night.
We hope to get three points, but it will be difficult because they got a good result in the last match. But with the audience behind us I am sure we can put pressure on them and get a good result.
The past year has been tough because of everything that has happened to my injuries and the changes in the club, but the mood is good now.
The team is good, and the boys really enjoy it.
Hopefully we can drive on now, put last season behind us and succeed."
Anxiety over retirement savings makes women sleepless
Despite the fact that the study participants had a firm idea of how they wanted to be cared for, only a few talked to the family about it.
About half of the participants in the Nationwide study reported that they discussed the cost of long-term care with their spouse.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
“Most people want a family member to take care of them, but they’re not doing anything to initiate the conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of the nation’s life insurance business.
That's how you get started.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to take care of you if you don’t tell them about your wishes in good time.
Use your counselor and family to discuss where and how you will receive care. These choices can be crucial factors for the cost.
Ask your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you figure out how to pay for the expenses.
Long-term care can be financed, among other things, by means of a traditional long-term care insurance, life insurance with cash payment or self-insurance with your own funds – as long as you have finances for it.
Get the legal documents sorted: Take the legal battles in the run-up.
Get a mandate so that you can get a trusted person to handle your medical treatment and make sure that doctors and nurses comply with your wishes, in case you can’t communicate yourself.
Also consider an economic power of attorney.
In that case, you appoint a trusted person who can make financial decisions and make sure that your bills are paid if you do not have the opportunity to do so yourself.
Don’t forget the little details: Imagine that one of your aging parents urgently needs medical attention and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medicine and allergies?
Get all these details down in writing, so you're ready.
“It’s not just a question of the economy – who are the doctors?” asked Martin.
"What medicine?
Who cares about the dog?
Get the plan in place.”
Man shot several times with air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air rifle on his way home from a trip to town.
The victim was in the 1940s and was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon when he was shot in the chest, mid-floor and hand.
Officers describe the shooting, which took place around 2:30 a.m., as "completely random."
The victim did not see the perpetrator.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and police are urging witnesses to stand up.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a massive earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, noting the authorities who expect the number of people killed to increase.
As the communication routes are out of play, relief workers have not been able to receive information from the regency Donggala, an area north of Palu, which is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the earthquake hit.
Here are some facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi province and is located at the bottom of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, which in 2017 had an estimated population of 379,800.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami hit.
Donggala is a regency that stretches over more than 300 km of coastline on the northwestern part of the island of Sulawesi.
The regency, which is an administrative region under a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the cornerstones of the Central Slavic economy, especially in the coastal area of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but takes place mainly in Morowali, which is the coast opposite Sulawesi.
According to Indonesia’s Disaster Center, Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times over the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
In 1996, Donggala was hit again by a tsunami that killed nine people.
Indonesia is seismologically located on the so-called fertilization in the Pacific and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years have been:
2004: A massive earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia’s Aceh province in northern Sumatra triggered a tsunami on 26 December that struck 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, including over half of those in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit Sumatra's west coast at the end of March and only in April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake measuring 6.8 struck south of Java, Indonesia’s most densely populated island, triggering a tsunami that swept south coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of 7.6 struck near the city of Padang, the capital of western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: An earthquake measuring 7.5, struck one of the Mentawai islands out of Sumatra and triggered a tsunami of up to 10 meters, destroying dozens of villages and killing about 300 people.
2016: A superficial earthquake struck Pidie Jaya's reign in Aceh, spreading devastation and panic as the population was reminded of 2004's deadly earthquake and tsunami.
There was no tsunami this time, but more than 100 were killed by the collapsing buildings.
2018: Heavy earthquakes hit Indonesia’s tourist island Lombok and killed more than 500 people, mainly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily left thousands of tourists stranded.
Sarah Palin's oldest son charged with domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaskan governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested for violence.
Twenty-nine-year-old Palin from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, obstruction of domestic violence, and opposition to arrest, according to the report released Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, he took the phone from a female acquaintance when she tried to report the alleged crime.
Palin is in custody in the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility with a $500 security security deposit, KTUU reports.
He was brought to trial on Saturday, where he declared himself “clearly not guilty,” reports the network.
Palin is charged with three Class A offences, which could lead to a prison sentence of up to a year and a fine of $250,000.
He has also been charged with a Class B offense, which could lead to a one-day prison sentence and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged with crimes.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
The case is pending at Alaska's Veteran's Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, having prevented the notification of a violent crime in the home, as well as possession of weapons in an affected condition in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of giving her a blow in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after explaining her son’s violent behavior with PTSD as a result of his posting in Iraq.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake on Friday struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
The earthquake measured 7.5 and triggered a tsunami that destroyed hundreds of homes.
The area is without electricity and communication routes, and the number of dead is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck just south of central Sulawesi, which is northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
On social media, videos circulate that show the moment when the earthquake strikes.
Hundreds of people were gathered at a beach party in the town of Palu, when the tsunami broke against the coast.
Public prosecutors try to get terror suspect in NYC sentenced rare death penalty
Public prosecutors are trying to get the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, suspected of the terrorist attack in New York City, which killed eight people – a rare punishment that was last convicted of a crime in the state in 1953.
30-year-old Saipov allegedly used a rental car from the Home Depot construction market in October to carry out an attack on a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, where pedestrians and cyclists who got in the way were swept down.
As a basis for the death penalty, the prosecutors must prove that Saipov "willfully" killed the eight victims and "willfully" caused serious personal injury. This is required by the declaration of intent for capital punishment in New York's southern district.
According to the legal document, the death penalty is a possible result of both of these charges.
Several weeks after the attack, a state jury was able to present Saipov for a 22-point indictment, including eight charges of murder in connection with gangster activity, typically used by public prosecutors in cases of organised crime, and an allegation of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required “extensive planning and preparation,” the prosecutors said, describing Saipov’s execution as “inhospitable, vicious, and depraved.”
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused personal injury, bodily injury and loss to families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," the statement reads.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It’s been a decade since New York’s southern district last raised the defendant in a death penalty case.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers, but ended up receiving life imprisonment in September 2009.
In 1953, Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being convicted of espionage on behalf of the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
The Rosenberg couple were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov came from Uzbekistan and, according to the court documents, showed no signs of remorse in the days and months following the attack.
According to police, he told investigators that he was okay with his actions.
According to the indictment, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to commit the attack by watching ISIS videos on his phone.
He also asked for the ISIS flag to be hung up in his hospital room, police said.
He has pleaded guilty to 22 charges.
David Patton, one of Saipov’s public defenders, announced that they were “of course disappointed” by the prosecutor’s decision.
"We believe that the decision to go after the death penalty and not accept a confession and lifelong imprisonment without the possibility of release will only prolong the trauma for all those involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defenders had previously asked the prosecutors not to go after the death penalty.
Conservative Minister Says NIGEL FARAGE Should Take Over Brexit Negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the people's army" during a demonstration at today's Conservative meeting.
The former Ukip leader stated that politicians could “mark the pressure” from the Eurosceptics – after one of Theresa May’s own ministers had stated that Farage should take over negotiations with the EU.
Private Conservative MP Peter Bone told the Birmingham demonstration that Britain would have “been out now” if Farage had been a Brexit negotiator.
May’s challenge in terms of gathering in the deeply divided party is underlined by the fact that conservatives remain participating in a separate demonstration against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is fighting to keep his compromise plan on track under attack from both Brexiteers, Remainers and the EU.
Her allies insist that, despite the setback, she will continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels – forcing the Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package or "chaos".
To the Leave Means Leave demonstration in Solihull, Bone announced that he would scrap the Chequers plan.
He explained that he should have included Farage and given him responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had the responsibility, we would have been out now," he said.
Wellingborough minister added: “I will fight for Brexit, but we have to scrap Chequers.”
On the background of his EU resistance, he said: "We did not fight world wars to be anyone's subordinate.
We will decide our own laws in our own country.”
Bone declined that public opinion should have changed since the 2016 vote: "That the British people should have changed their minds and would like to stay in the EU is completely wrong."
Conservative Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns also attended the demonstration and told reporters: “I’m just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The Chequers plan is unpopular in the broad population, the opposition does not vote for it, it is unpopular in our own party and among our activists who are actually on the street and get us elected.
Now drop Chequers, and start listening."
As a senior remark to May, she added: “Premier ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises.”
Farage told the rally that politicians should be able to “mark the pressure” if they fail to make the decision from the 2016 vote.
“Now it’s a matter of trust between us – the people – and our political class,” he said.
“They will betray Brexit, but we are gathered to tell them that we will not let them go.”
In a message to the enthusiastic audience, he added: “You must make sure that the political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit, can feel the pressure.
"We are mobilizing the people's army here in the country that gave us the victory in Brexit, and we will not stop until we have become an independent, self-governing and proud Britain."
Meanwhile, the marches continued through Birmingham before a two-hour parade in the city centre.
Dispersed activists waved Conservative Against Brexit banners after the group’s proliferation this weekend.
Labour colleague Lord Adonis laughed before the meeting about the security issues with the Conservative Party app.
“It’s the people who claim they control the IT systems and technology of Canada, the border controls, free trade without borders in Ireland,” he said.
“It’s all to laugh.
“There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren "considers strongly" to run for president
Senator Elizabeth Warren, a member of the House of Representatives, "considers strongly to run for president" after the November midterm election.
According to the Boston Globe, the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future at a council meeting on Saturday in western Massachusetts.
Warren, who has often criticized Donald Trump, will try to win re-election in November against state Republican candidate Geoff Diehl, who co-chaired Trump’s Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
I wonder if she will challenge Trump in 2020.
The meeting in Holyoke on Saturday afternoon was her 36th meeting with voters in the City Hall since Trump took office.
One participant asked her if she was planning to run for the presidential election.
Warren replied that it’s time for “women to go to Washington and repair our political system, and that requires a woman in front.”
Arrest in case of shooting at LSU's Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana announced on Saturday that a suspect was arrested on Friday for the shooting of Wayde Sims, the LSU basketball player.
Baton Rouge police announced that 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson had been arrested Friday at an ET news conference at 11 a.m.
On Friday, they released a video of the shooting to ask for help identifying a man on the footage.
20-year-old Sims was shot and killed near Southern University early Friday.
"Wayde Sims was hit by bullets in the head and died from the injuries," police chief Murphy J. Paul said in a statement.
Wayde intervened to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and confessed to having been present, in possession of a weapon and having shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without any problems and is now in police custody of the East Baton Rouge district.
Sims was a two-meter high third-year student who grew up in Baton Rouge. Last season he played 32 games, started in ten and played an average of 17.4 minutes and made 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russia’s grand prix: Lewis Hamilton is close to the World Cup, after team orders give him victory over Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the Mercedes team's orders would play a crucial role in the race.
From the lead position, Bottas got a good start and was close to slowing Hamilton down when he defended his position in the first two turns and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel ran in the pit as the first, leaving Hamilton to fight with traffic at the back of the field, which should have been crucial.
The Mercedes car went into pits a while later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton came back in front as the Ferrari driver, after some wheel contact, reluctantly had to leave the inderban after a double defense at the third turn.
Max Verstappen started from the back row and was seventh after the first round on his 21st birthday.
After that, he led a large part of the race, as in an attempt at a quick finish, he failed to change tires to take Kimi Raikkonen's fourth place.
He had to pitch in the 44th inning, but could not increase the pace of the last eight innings, which is why Raikkonen secured fourth place.
"It's a tough day because Valtteri did it wonderfully all weekend and was really a gentleman when he let me get by.
The team did an incredible job to secure both first and second place,” Hamilton said.
Really bad body language
President Donald Trump taunted Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday because she insisted she had not leaked the letter from Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sex assault.
At a poll in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention the testimony that Ford had given in front of the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead said that the events in the Senate showed that people were "evil and disgusting and dishonest".
“The one thing that could happen, and the beautiful thing that has happened in the last couple of days in the Senate, when you see that anger when you see people who are angry and malicious and disgusting and dishonest,” he said.
"When you look at statements and leaks, and then they say, 'Oh, it wasn't me.
It wasn't me."
Do you remember that?
Dianne Feinstein, was it you who leaked it?
Remember her answer... Was it you who leaked the document—"Oh, uh, huh?
No, no.
I haven't leaked anything."
Hey, just a minute.
If we've leaked... no, we haven't leaked anything," he added in an imitation of the senator.
Feinstein received the letter of Ford’s accusations against Kavanaugh back in July, and it was leaked earlier in September – but Feinstein denied that the leak came from her office.
“I haven’t hidden Dr. Ford’s accusations, and I haven’t leaked her story,” Feinstein told the committee.
"She asked me to keep the letter confidential, and I did."
But her denial was not well received by the president, who said at Saturday’s voter meeting: “I tell you it was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn’t, but it’s the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
During the president's continued defense of the nominated judge to the Supreme Court, who has been accused of sexual assault by three women, Trump proposed that Democrats use the accusations to benefit their own cause.
“They are not shunning funds in their efforts to take power back.
You can see the cruelty, the disgustingness, they don't care who they're going to drum up to get power and control," the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars vs. Belfast Giants 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars did well again after Friday's lost Elite League match against the Belfast Giants by winning the return match 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants quickly got ahead with two goals with attacks from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie equalized at home before Dwyer again brought the Giants in front.
Francois Bouchard equalised for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory by two more goals.
It was the third Elite League defeat of the season for Adam Keefe's team, who came from behind to defeat Dundee 2-1 in Friday's game in Belfast.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the sides, where the Giants went out as victors in the previous three games.
Dwyer posted in the fourth minute at 3:35 from an assist from Kendall McFaul with David Rutherford as an assist when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In a busy lead period, Sullivan brought back the home team in the game at 13:10, before Matt Marquardt was behind Cownie's equalization at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants got ahead at the first break when he made his second goal at the end of the first period.
The home team regrouped, and Bouchard again equalized with a nice goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran worked together to help Nielsen lead Dundee ahead for the first time in the game late in the second period, and he secured the victory with the team's fifth goal halfway through the last period.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their five games, are home to Milton Keynes for their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controller died to ensure that hundreds of air passengers escaped earthquakes
A flight leader in Indonesia is hailed as a hero after he died to ensure that a plane carrying several hundred passengers safely landed on the ground.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a major earthquake on Friday struck Sulawesi Island and triggered a tsunami.
Powerful aftershocks still ravage the area, and many are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Although 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung’s colleagues fled for life, he refused to leave his seat in the swaying control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He remained in his place to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway, was safely in the air.
He jumped out of the control tower because he thought it was collapsing.
He later died in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said his decision may have saved hundreds of lives.
We got a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a major hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"We're broken," he added.
Authorities fear that the death toll could reach several thousand, and the country’s disaster preparedness announces that there is limited access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
"The death toll is expected to rise because there are still many bodies in the ruins, and it is not possible to reach them," said spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Up to six meters high waves have destroyed Palu, which holds a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft fly in emergency aid and supplies.
The 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, told Sky News: “Every minute comes a new ambulance with several bodies.
There is a lack of clean water.
All the shops are looted.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is working hard to help the survivors, but we don’t know what to do.
It’s already a tragedy, but it can get much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country’s military: “I ask all of you to work around the clock to carry out all the tasks associated with the evacuation.
“Are you ready?” he said, according to CNN.
Indonesia was hit by an earthquake in Lombrok earlier this year, killing more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini says missing man after plane crash in lagoon
The airline behind the plane that crashed into the Pacific Ocean lagoon in Micronesia now says a man is missing, even though it had previously been reported that all 47 passengers and crew members had been evacuated from the sinking plane.
According to a press release, Air Niugini said Saturday afternoon it could not locate a male passenger.
The airline announced that it was working with local authorities, hospitals and police to try to find the man.
The airline has not returned to requests for more information about the passenger, such as age and nationality.
Local boats helped save the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water during landing at the airport on Chuuk Island.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline says that six passengers remained in the hospital until Saturday and that they were all in stable condition.
It is still not clear what caused the crash and the exact sequence of events.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both say the plane landed in the lagoon in front of the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane flew past the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane landed on very low water.
“It was really lucky,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and other passengers could go in water to life to get to the emergency exits on the sinking plane.
He said the crew panicked and shouted, and that he had suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy stated that sailors working to renovate a nearby quay also helped in the rescue work by using a rubber boat to haul people ashore before the plane sank at about 30 meters depth.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network show that 111 people have died in accidents with PNG-registered airlines over the past two decades, but that Air Niugini has not been involved in these accidents.
Analysts determine the timeline for the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecutor’s office closed its evidence on Saturday during the appeals case for a man accused of burning a woman alive in 2014.
Analysts at the U.S. Department of Justice, Paul Rowlett, testified for several hours as expert witnesses in data analysis.
He described to the jury how he used telecommunications to piece together the course of the 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said he received location data from several different mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, which was contrary to his previous claims, writes The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was close to Chambers' cell phone at the time he had claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, police visited Sanford.
Sanford sat down at the witness counter on Saturday and said he was out of town that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he lied because my truck was in Nashville.
Another disagreement was that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
The mobile data showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that at some point after Chambers' death, Tellis had deleted Chambers' text messages, calls, and contact details from his phone.
"He erased her from her life," Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its procedure on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the jury to vote later that day.
The High Breed: What Is Political Hip-Hop?
A hip-hop trio would like to challenge the negative view of the genre by giving their music positive messages.
The High Breed of Bristol believes that hip hop has moved away from its origins with political messages and social problems.
They will return to the starting point and make political hip hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently received a revival in the UK due to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
Babysitter in New York sues couple after firing with "racist" sms
A New York nanny sues a couple for discriminatory firing after being sent a text message by a mother who complained that she was "still a black person".
The couple denied that they were racists, but compared the lawsuit to "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, who is the mother of two, expressed her dismay at finding out that the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, was black when she appeared on her first working day in 2016.
“NOTEEEEEEEJ, NOT ALREADY A SORT PERSON,” Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she came to send it to Giselle Maurice, even twice.
When she discovered her mistake, Plasco-Flaxman Giselle fired Maurice and said that their former nanny, as from African-American, had been bad for her work, and that she instead expected a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Giselle Maurice was paid for her one-day job and sent home in an Uber.
Now, Giselle Maurice sues the couple for compensation for the firing and compensation of $350 a day for the six months she was supposed to have lived with the family, even though this was agreed without a contract.
"I want to show them that you can't allow yourself to do such a thing," she told the newspaper Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple have defended themselves that they are not racists and that the firing of Maurice was justified because they were afraid that they would not be able to trust her after insulting her.
"My wife had come to send her something she wouldn't have said.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists,” Joel Plasco told The Post.
"But would you leave your children to someone whom you had been rude to, even if it had happened by mistake?
Your baby?
Quite frankly."
Plasco compared the lawsuit to "extortion" and that his wife had given birth two months before and was in a "very difficult situation".
“Are you really looking for someone like that?
It’s not very friendly,” the investment advisor added.
Although the trial is still ongoing, the International Court of Justice has already written off the couple on social media and shamed their behavior and logic.
New letter reveals Paddington publisher feared readers could not relate to a talking bear
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was admitted to publication, said of the letter: “It’s hard to imagine being the one reading it for the first time before it was published.
It’s fun to read now when you know how popular Paddington became.”
She said that her father, who worked as a cameraman on the BBC before he was inspired to write the children's book about a small clothing broom, would have been optimistic, even if his story was rejected and that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was "bittersweet" after his death last year.
She describes Paddington as a "very important part of our family" and says that her father was modestly proud of his success.
“He was a quiet man, and he didn’t like to brag,” she said.
But because Paddington was so real to him, it almost felt like you had a child who achieved something: You’re proud of them, even though it’s not really your merit.
I think he saw Paddington's popularity that way.
Although it was his work and his imagination, he used to say that it was Paddington's fault."
Saying goodbye to dying daughter over the phone
After landing, her daughter was taken to Hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where doctors unsuccessfully tried to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to say that it was really bad and that she probably didn't survive," Mrs Ednan-Laperouse said.
"Then I got a call from Nad that she would die within the next few minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
So I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
We'll see you soon.
See you later.
The medicine she had been given to keep her heart moving slowly lost its effect.
She was dead shortly before, and now her body shut down.
I just had to sit there and wait for it to happen.
I couldn’t scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to try to get together.”
Finally, the grieving Ednan-Laperouse boarded the plane with the other passengers, who did not know what she was going through.
“No one knew,” she said.
"I bent my head, and the tears kept running.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane I had an overwhelming sympathy for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Sorrowing Women Try to Stop Suicide Shoppers
Two women who have lost relatives to suicide try to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have set up cards on a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers where you can get help.
Davis' son Tyler was 13 years old when he suffered a depression, and 18 when he committed suicide.
“I don’t want any parent to experience the grief I experience every day,” she said.
45-year-old Sharon Davis said her son was a promising cook with an infected smile.
“His smile was familiar to everyone.
People said his smile lit up the room.”
However, he stopped working before he died because he was really bad.
In 2014, it was Tyler’s 11-year-old brother who found him when he took his life.
Sharon Davis said, "I'm always afraid it's spreading."
Sharon Davis made the cards to "tell people that there's someone out there that you can contact and talk to, even your friends.
Don’t go with your thoughts yourself – you have to talk to someone.”
Sharon Davis' longtime girlfriend, Kelly Humphreys, lost her boyfriend for 15 years, Mark, shortly after his mother died.
“He didn’t say anything about him being sad or depressed or anything,” she said.
“Some days before Christmas, he started to change.
He was really far down on Christmas Day, and when the kids opened their presents, he didn’t have any eye contact with them at all.”
She said that his death was very traumatic for them, but that they have to get through it: "It has created a hole in our family.
It has torn us apart.
But we all have to go on and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future is still unresolved while the FBI begins investigation
“I thought that if we could actually get something like what he was asking for — a limited-time survey — we might get a bit of a consensus,” Flake said Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee was “falling from the hind” in the middle of the locked-in partisan situation.
Why would Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not have the FBI conducting their investigation?
Their reluctance is due to the timing.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away, on November 6, and if the Republicans, as expected, fail, they will be weakened in their efforts to get the man they would like to have elected to the country's highest judicial office.
George W. Bush has called senators to get them to support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Bush and thus met his wife Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI completes its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still not known if Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would give Vice President Mike Pence the decisive vote and elect him to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean defectors 'falls' under Kim Jong-un
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean lawmaker.
Park Byeong suction referred to data from the South Korean Merger Ministry and said there were 1,127 defectors last year compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park mentioned that stricter border controls between North Korea and China and higher numbers due to human smugglers contributed to the changed numbers.
Pyongyang has not made any official comments.
The vast majority of defectors from North Korea are eventually offered citizenship in South Korea.
The South Korean government says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the Korean War ended in 1953.
Most people flee via China, which has the longest border adjacent to North Korea, and which is easier to cross than the heavily guarded demilitarized zone between North and South Korea.
China considers the defections to be illegal immigrants and not refugees, so they are often forced to return home.
The relationship between North and South Korea – which is technically still at war – has improved significantly over the past few months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to talk about the stranded negotiations on nuclear disarmament.
This happens after the historic June meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed to work towards a nuclear-free Korea on an overall level.
North Korea’s Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed US sanctions for the lack of progress.
“Without confidence in the United States, there is no faith in our national security, and in such circumstances it is excluded that we will degrade on our own,” Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he is unfit for the Supreme Court
Chairman of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called Brett Kavanaugh, who has been nominated to the Supreme Court, "hysterical" and said his temper was not fit for the Supreme Court.
Pelosi’s comment came in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman had behaved that way, you would have called her hysterical," Pelosi said of his reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally rejected the allegations that he had committed a sexual assault on Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
In his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, and when he talked about his family and his years in high school, he almost cried and was crying.
He also denounced the Democrats in the committee and called the accusations against him "grotesque and coordinated character courage" arranged by the left, who were angry that Hillary Clinton did not win the presidential post in 2016.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's statement proved that he could not sit in the Supreme Court because it showed that he is biased towards the Democrats.
“I think he has disqualified himself with the statements and the way he went after the Clintons and Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi was asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if he was confirmed and if Democrats get a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I would say that if he doesn't speak the truth to Congress or the FBI, he's not fit to sit in the Supreme Court, but certainly rather in the court he's sitting in now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently serving as a judge in the Washington D.C. Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh’s possible decisions in connection with Obama’s health reform or the Roe v. Wade abortion case because he is considered a conservative judge.
During the hearings, Kavanaugh did not answer questions as to whether he would reverse certain previous Supreme Court decisions.
"It must not happen that a hysterical, preconceived person should contest a job as a judge and expect us to say 'yes, it's not just wonderful,'" Pelosi said.
Women need to use it.
It's a fair outcome, several months and years of anger, and she can't get it out without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's abnormal, do you think?"
She continued: "I got a lot of support from a woman who was a boss who said that she was crying when she got angry, but that she developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and started crying, she would say to the one she was talking to: "You might think I'm sorry because I'm crying.
But I'm angry."
And then she just kept going.
And I thought it was brilliant.”
Tears are allowed as an expression of anger, partly because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories is from one of my first jobs in an office with an excess of men, where I often cried out of anger, where I was taken by the neck of an older woman – a cold boss that I had always been a little afraid of – and pulled out on the stairs.
“Never let them see you cry,” she said to me.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They will think that you are sorry, and they will accept that they got rammed on you.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a member of the Colorado Democratic Congress, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Hart was revealed to have an affair on a boat called Monkey Business and resigned as a candidate, Schroeder was really frustrated and came to the conclusion that she could as well herself stand up as a presidential candidate.
"It wasn't a very well thought-out decision," she said laughing to me 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the run-up, and they certainly did not need another candidate.
Some called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Because it was late in the election campaign, she was behind with fundraising, so she promised she wouldn’t participate unless she raised $2 million.
The battle was lost in advance.
She discovered that some of her supporters, who gave $1,000 to men, only gave her $250.
“Do they think I’ll get a discount?” she thought.
When she gave a speech that she wouldn’t stand up, she was overwhelmed by emotion – gratitude for the people who supported her, frustration at the system that made it so difficult to raise money and reach out to voters instead of voters, and anger at sexism – that she got a lump in her throat.
"You could think I had a nervous breakdown," Schroeder recalls how the press reacted to her.
“You would think I was sponsored by Kleenex.
I remember thinking, what are you going to write on my gravestone?
“She was crying?”
How the U.S.-China trade war could benefit Beijing
The opening elves of the trade war between the United States and China were loud, and although the battle is far from over, discord between the countries can be an advantage for Beijing in the long run, experts say.
US President Donald Trump fired the first warning shot earlier this year by imposing tariffs on important Chinese export goods, such as solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest escalation this week of new customs duties affecting goods worth $200 billion applies in principle to half of all goods imported into the United States from China.
Beijing has been reciprocating every time, most recently by imposing customs duties of 5-10% on US goods for $60 billion.
China has sworn to follow the U.S. all the way, and the world’s second largest economy probably won’t yield after just now.
If it causes Washington to withdraw its demands, it means they give in, but for China’s president, Xi Jinping, it will be far too embarrassing to bow to the United States.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards correctly, the American pressure in the trade war can have a positive effect on China in the long run by making the two markets less dependent on each other.
“A quick decision in either Washington or Beijing can create a breeding ground for an economy that can get out of control in both countries, and it’s actually much more dangerous than it was thought,” said Abigail Grace, a research associate focusing on Asia at the think tank Center for New American Security.
Syria is 'ready' to receive refugees, Foreign Minister says
Syria says it is ready for refugees to return and asks for help to build the country destroyed by the more than seven-year war.
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in the country were improving.
“Today, the situation is more stable and secure thanks to the successful fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government has continued to control the areas destroyed by terrorists and is working to restore a normal state.
All conditions are now in place for refugees to return to the country they were forced to leave because of terrorists and the unilateral economic sanctions that hit their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since 2011 when the war began.
Another six million people still in the country need emergency aid.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian government would welcome help to rebuild the ravaged country.
But he stressed that the government would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that helped support the uprising.
Europe secures Ryder Cup victory in Paris
The European team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup and defeated the US team 16.5 - 10.5 in Le Golf National outside Paris.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a single Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the trophy back when Captain Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn's team reached the 14.5 points it required to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who had a hard time in most of the tournament, shot his drift in the lake at par 3 on the 16th hole, causing him to lose the match against Francesco Molinari.
Italian Molinari managed well in all rounds and became 1 out of a total of 4 players who have received 5-0-0 since 1979, when the tournament's current format started.
American Jordan Spieth was sent out with 5&4 of the lowest ranked European player, Danish Thorbj<0xC3><0xB8>rn Olesen.
No. 1 on the world rankings, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter from England, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
The veteran with eight Ryder Cups in his luggage, Spainrd Sergio Garcia, became the tournament's most winning European with 25.5 career points.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t do it.
It's been a tough year.
I am very grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I'm really happy to get the trophy back.
It's a team effort and I'm glad I could help," Garcia said after the European victory.
He sends the torch to his compatriot John Ram, who fell American golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in a single match on Sunday.
"I'm incredibly proud to have beaten Tiger Woods. I followed him as a child," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a Ryder Cup history of 13-21-3.
It’s a fun statistic for one of the best golfers ever to win 14 major titles, surpassed only by Jack Nicklaus.
The American team had trouble finding the form throughout the weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who had a solid game throughout the tournament.
The American captain, Jim Furyk, said after his team’s disappointing performance: “I’m proud of the boys because they were fighting for the cause.
There was still time this morning when we gave Europe a counterplay.
We lost.
Hats off to Thomas.
He's an excellent captain.
All of his 12 players played really well.
We will regroup, and I will work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee, and then we will move on.
I love the 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to lighten the hat.
We were defeated.”
Algae bloom update: Concentrations decrease in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows that there is a general decreasing algae concentration in parts of Tampa Bay.
