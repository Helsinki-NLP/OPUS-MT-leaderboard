Fire in French chemical work deleted
The fire in a chemical plant which is considered particularly dangerous in the city of Rouen in northern France has been wiped out. The prefecture of Normandy announced this on Friday. The fire broke out on Thursday at night. No one was injured in the incident. The fire department was in use with around 200 fire extinguishers.
The Fire Could Be Stopped
Neighbors were called not to leave their homes. Buildings within 500 meters were evacuated, schools and kindergartens remained closed on Thursday. In the chemical plant on the banks of the Seine, additives for lubricants are manufactured. The factory belongs to Lubrizol of the US billionaire Warren Buffett and is subject to the so-called EU Seveso Directive, which imposes particularly strict safety requirements.
About 400 people work in the plant. The chemical factory already provided headlines in the past - for example, when in 2013 the gas methanethiol escaped through a leak and the environment smoked widely after lazy eggs. In 2015, after an operating accident, about 2,000 litres of mineral oil flowed into the city's wastewater system.
Woman quits her job to look for her missing bitch 57 days ago
For two months a woman from Washington was looking for her missing dog - and announced her job extra. The seven-year-old Border Collie had left the hotel room during a short vacation in Montana. 57 days were missing from the bitch every trace - but Carole King did not give up.
"It was terrible. I got sick," said Carole King to the Daily Inter Lake. She and her husband had left Katie in the hotel room while they went to dinner. When they returned to the hotel, Katie disappeared. They were looking for the animal, but without success.
Donner had a dog panicked
In the hope that Katie could still stay somewhere in the hotel, Carole King went to the reception. "The employee says, "She left about four and a half hours ago," Carole King recalls to "Daily Inter Lake." When the automatic door opened, Katie was immediately out. Probably a loud thunder had panicked the dog.
With flyers and calls in Facebook groups, the Kings were looking for their beloved dog. But out of days were weeks. "I never gave up. I never lost hope," said Carole King to the "Daily Inter Lake", who announced her job as a postman to continue her search for Katie.
"The Tears Filled"
57 days after Katie’s disappearance, Carole King got a call: a man reported himself and said that Katie was in his yard. But when King arrived, Katie had already disappeared again. She looked for the neighborhood and suddenly stood her bitch under a tree. “I just hugged her. I didn’t want to let her go,” King said, “Daily Inter Lake.” “The tears flowed. The people stopped in their vehicles, got out and hugged us. I think the whole neighborhood knew that we had found her”.
Losses at the Bundeswehr: Machine guns disappear without a trace
Friday, 27 September 2019
Six MG3 machine guns are still missing.
In recent years, the Bundeswehr has lost many weapons and tens of thousands of ammunition, including three machine guns. In most cases, the remains are unclear. The opposition speaks of a "frightening" dimension.
At the Bundeswehr, weapons and ammunition are disappearing again and again - many of them have been without trace. Since the beginning of 2014, the troops have recorded the loss of 39 weapons, 39 weapons parts and almost 20,000 ammunition. This is due to a list of the Federal Defence Ministry, which the editorial network Germany reports on.
According to the paper from the Office of State Secretary Peter Tauber of the CDU, two weapons, one weapon part and 3474 ammunition have been resurfaced. The weapons and weapon parts that have been still missing include six MG3 machine guns, eleven G3 rifles, four G36 rifles, six P8 signal pistols and two P8 pistols. In addition, 30 MG3 machine guns are missing.
The scope of arms and ammunition losses in the Bundeswehr was "anxious", said left-wing member Martina Renner. This was all the more true, since in the course of investigations there was hardly anything to be found again. The left-wing politician spoke of a "necessary balance sheet". Renner criticised that the listing was not recognizable as to whether under the lost ammunition there were also those who had been found in connection with the investigations against the suspected Federal Armed Forces officer Franco A. "And that although a supporter of Franco A. was recently condemned for the possession of this ammunition," Renner said.
Oil tanker "Stena Impero" left Iranian port
More than two months after its establishment by the Iranian authorities, the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" left the port of Bandar Abbas on today's Friday. As ship observation data from Refinitiv showed, the tanker set in motion and left the Iranian port. Port Rashid was indicated as a destination port in the United Arab Emirates.
The tanker had already been released by the Iranian government on Monday, but he remained initially in Iranian waters. From the shipping company it was said that an official message from Tehran would be expected.
On July 19th, the "Stena Impero" was accused of violating security regulations by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards on the Hormuz Sea Road. However, it was believed that Iran was reacting to the controversial, temporary fixation of an Iranian oil tanker in front of the UK-based Gibraltar.
Hormuz road is one of the most important maritime roads in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf to the Indian Ocean. Most of the global oil export is shipped through the seas. The tensions in the region have intensified immensely in recent months. Trade shipping has been brought into conflict between the USA and Iran. There have been several incidents with tankers and drones.
Merkel appreciates the courage of the people during the Peaceful Revolution
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel has acknowledged the commitment of the people in the GDR, who went on the road 30 years ago during the Peaceful Revolution. In autumn 1989 brave citizens would have weakened the then GDR regime, said Merkel at a ceremony of the Thuringian CDU Group on the upcoming day of German unity in Erfurt. The Chancellor reminded us, among other things, of the occupation of the Stasi-Central. "The state security was taken by terror," she said.
Musk strives for delivery record
Tesla's quarter may hold a record. Despite the delivery boom, there were last losses at the electric car group.
New York.Tesla-Chef Elon Musk has given his electric car group a strong boost on the stock exchange with the prospect of new record numbers. "We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries," Musk wrote in an e-mail to Tesla employees published by the industry blog "Electrek".
Demand was strong, so Tesla could book 110000 orders, it continued in Musk's newsletter. The challenge was to quickly bring the cars to the customer. Tesla had to offer as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
Investors liked this: Tesla’s shares went out of the trade with a plus of over six percent. The price has not increased that strongly for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered well 95000 cars and thus reached its previous best value.
Musk needs records to achieve its high targets. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360000 to 400000 cars. Six-digit numbers must be produced for this in the current and upcoming quarter. The most affordable Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the boom, there were last losses.
Puzzle solved: That's why we can't tickle ourselves
A kind of brake in the big brain prevents people from tickling themselves. Scientists at Humboldt University in Berlin found out with the help of experiments on rats, as they announced on Thursday evening. Progress has also been made on the question of why children are so fiercely resisting the tickling, only to demand more.
Finally, it has also been shown why the arrival of a tickling hand alone triggers laughter before the touch. This is due to a deep layer in the big brain, which already triggers laughter when the kitzel is expected.
According to the data, earlier research showed that rats react with "laughs" in the ultrasound field when they are tickled by humans. This "laugh" is mediated by the part of the big brain, which serves the central processing of haptic perception.
Smile is suppressed during self-contact
So far, it has been assumed that the brain can distinguish between self-contact and touch by others - that is why people cannot tickle themselves. However, the Berlin researchers found in the experiments on rats that the laughter as well as the activity of the affected area of the grand brain will be suppressed during a self-contact. This is also true if living beings themselves wash themselves. During the foreign touch and tickling by the scientists, the activity in the brain and the impulse was to be laughed but intensified.
But if the self-contact and the touch of others at the same time happen, the laughter is also suppressed. This indicates that the brain of the rat cannot distinguish between self-contact and touch by others. The new findings suggested that humans cannot tickle themselves because the self-contact activates a brake in the big brain.
The rats were also trained to tickle themselves. Thus, they sometimes broke off this initiation in the experiment, showed flight behaviours or fearsome rigidities. This ambivalence is the same as the behavior of the children. The ambivalence of the tickling is a behavioral reaction that is the same in rats and humans.
Disaster averted: Great Fire in French Chemical Works deleted
The fire in a chemical plant in Rouen, which is considered to be particularly dangerous, was extinguished in the city of Rouen in northern France. The prefecture of the Normandy of the AFP news agency announced on Friday. The fire broke out on the night of Thursday.
According to the authorities, no health-threatening substances should have been withdrawn. The samples taken give no cause for concern, as Prefect Pierre-André Durand said at a press conference on Friday morning. No one was injured in the incident. The fire department was in use with around 200 fire-fighting vehicles.
Schools and kindergartens were closed
Residents were called not to leave their homes. Buildings within 500 meters were evacuated, schools and kindergartens remained closed on Thursday.

Brexit: Johnson criticized by his own sister
The Prime Minister’s sister commented on Boris Johnson’s speech at the first session in Parliament after the forced break on Wednesday evening. The Prime Minister threatens to take the country out of the EU on 31 October without agreements, Brussels should not respond to his demands for changes to the Brexit Agreement. However, how he wants to achieve this is unclear.
The Prime Minister said of Cox, who had worked for the UK to remain in the European Union, "The best way to honor Jo Cox's memory and restore this country to one another would be to leave the EU." Cox had been murdered by a right-wing extremist in 2016 during the referendum campaign.
Monument to attacks by Oslo and Utöya is revealed
More than eight years after the attacks in Oslo and Utöya with 77 deaths, a memorial in honor of the victims will be unveiled on Saturday in Norway. The monument "Jernrosene" (German: the Iron Roses) consists of about 1,000 iron rose replicas. They remind of the roses that had been laid by thousands of people in the days and weeks after the attacks before the Cathedral in Oslo.
At the same place the project of the artists Tobbe Malm and Tone Karlsrud is now to be revealed - the roses were forged by people from all over the world, including survivors and members of the victims. Among others, Crown Prince Haakon and Crown Princess Mette-Marit are expected to open.
On July 22, 2011, right-wing terrorist Anders Behring Breivik first set off an auto-bomb in the Oslo government district and, following the Utöya Island, killed dozens of participants in a holiday camp of the youth organization of the Social Democratic Workers' Party.
Iran Releases British Tankers
The UN General Debate did not bring a solution in the Iran conflict. But now there is less of a problem. The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" in Iran could go back to sea. It could be a puzzle in the peace plan of Iranian President Ruhani.
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero", which has been held in the streets of Hormus in Iran since mid-July, is back in international waters. After being released by Iranian authorities, the ship is on its way to Dubai, as the shipping company Stena Bulk announced.
The "Stena Impero" had left the port of Bandar Abbas and the crew now went to Dubai for medical examinations, said Reederikef Erik Hånell. By midday the ship had left the Iranian waters. "Good that it is over," he said to the Swedish TV station SVT.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in London called the vessel illegal. "This is part of a pattern of attempts to affect the freedom of the seas. We are working with our international partners to maintain shipping and international law," said a communication on Friday.
The Iranian Revolutionary Guards had set the tanker under the pretext of failing to comply with regulations on the law of the sea in the Persian Gulf on 19 July. Seven of the 23 crew members had already been released at the beginning of September. The remaining 16 crew members were doing well in the circumstances, said Hånell. They had behaved professionally in the face of the difficult and excruciating situation over the past ten weeks. The shipping company was now working to bring them back together with their families as soon as possible.
The British government suspected a reaction to a similar incident in the British Gibraltar following the establishment of the "Stena Impero": At the beginning of July, a supertanker with oil from Iran, which was supposed to have been destined for Syria, had been put on the chain. According to the delivery, the authorities violated EU sanctions against the country of war Syria. The British had received the indication of the ship from the United States.
Iran spoke of "piratery" and threatened with consequences. In the middle of August, the "Adrian Darya-1" was finally released. Conceptions that it was a trade deal to free the "Stena Impero" rejected London vehemently.
Hormus road is one of the most important maritime roads in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Most of the world’s oil exports are being shipped through the oceans. The tensions in the region have been enormously exacerbated in recent months. Trade shipping has been brought into the conflict between the US and Iran. There have been several incidents with tankers and drones.
The US alone had come out of the international nuclear agreement in 2018, which would prevent Iran from building a nuclear bomb and at the same time end its political and economic isolation. Since then, the US government has been putting pressure on the leadership in Tehran with massive economic sanctions against the country in order to force a more stringent and extended agreement on other areas. Iran has resisted the pressure so far.
Because of the dispute over the "Stena Impero" and other incidents involving tankers in the Persian Gulf and oil rigs in Saudi Arabia, the US is working on a coalition to protect the military of merchant ships in the region.
Iranian President Hassan Ruhani had presented a plan for security and peace in the streets of Hormus at the UN General Assembly in New York. With the initiative "Coalition of Hope" for the Persian Gulf, Iran, together with the Arab Gulf States and without foreign protection powers, wanted to ensure the safety of shipping in the Persian Gulf.
India is building a better future with its protectionist economic policy.
India would have been predestined to be a "war profiter". In view of the penalties imposed on Chinese producers by US President Donald Trump, foreign producers in the People's Republic are being forced to relocate. In a UBS survey, financial leaders of Asian companies who are considering relocating their production from China to another country call India one of the preferred alternatives. Of course, this does not only have to do with the uncertainties of the Chinese-American trade war. With a huge pool of young workers and an internal market of 1.3 billion consumers, India seems to have created a more important role to play in the globally divided production chain.
But now India itself has become Trump's focus. Depreciating from Haudegen in the White House as the "Kingdom of Customs", America withdrew the trade discounts for 2000 products from the emerging country at the beginning of June. The USA is prohibiting India high tariffs and demanding better market access for agricultural goods, mobile phones, spirits, motorcycles and more.
On the world map of the trade wars, however, the frictions with India are only a sideshow. Moreover, America sees the world’s largest democracy also through the security-political spectacles. Delhi and Washington combine the concern about China’s power claims in the South Indian Ocean. Against this background, an American penalty auction against India is unlikely to take place. India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has just entered a second five-year term, is therefore likely to weigh in safety.
The problem lies, however, in another place: the empirically hardened thesis that open markets are accelerating economic development has a difficult situation in the socialist Republic of India. Also under modi. Its reformist spirit is mainly aimed at the bureaucratic madness that suffocated any entrepreneurial spirit in the multi-ethnic state for too long. Companies are now receiving faster building permits. They benefit from a better energy and transport infrastructure, and a more gripping insolvency and bankruptcy law creates the prerequisites for liquidating companies with high debts more quickly.
The success of these efforts can be seen and measured in the relevant rankings. In India, from economic optics, much has been turned to better use in the first five years of operation. However, this does not apply in trade policy. Of this, the national conservative government even created new barriers to protect internationally low-competitive companies from foreign suppliers.
In the West, modi depends on the Nimbus of the energetic reformer, who radically renews his agriculture. This impression is due not least to the fact that the charismatic Prime Minister knows only too well what vocabulary Western managers like. At the core, however, the "India First" lawyer never withdrew from a protectionist economic policy, which prevents Indian companies from being forced to abandon anachronistic processes and thus become fit for global competition. Businessmen who survive thanks to the closure of their industries belong to the tribal voters of Modi's nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party and cling to this short-sighted policy.
Confirmation by Jacques Chirac on Monday in Paris
According to a report, former French President Jacques Chirac will be buried in Paris next week. The former head of state will be buried on Monday at Montparnasse Cemetery in the south of the French capital, reported the AFP news agency calling on the Chiracs family. The funeral will take place in the narrow family circle. For Sunday, a public funeral was scheduled in the Paris Invalidity, as media reported.
Conveyed to its competitors: Dabo is the first secret hero of the World Championship on Athletics
The world’s top was long overdue when the cooled Khalifa International Stadium was playing heartwarming scenes. In the first run of the men over 5000 meters, Jonathan Busby from Aruba began to wave dangerously. He could hardly hold himself on his feet 300 meters from the finish line, running in an unhealthy position, when Braima Suncar Dabo suddenly stopped him from the West African country of Guinea-Bissau and dragged him to the finish of the last half stadium round. However, the forces were still sufficient to stop the running watch after the finish run. As if the scene had not been curious enough.
"I just wanted to help him. Everyone in this situation would have done the same," said Dabo after the race in Mixed Zone, when he completely unexpectedly attracted the attention of the gathered journalists. He left first, didn't want to talk about his heroic act at all. After all, he wanted to set up his personal best time and when he noticed that this would be difficult, he only wanted to help a fellow sufferer. And anyway, he would only be proud to represent his country, which was invited by the World Cup. Under normal circumstances he wouldn't even have to start. "I am proud to run here for my country," he said.
He did this with emphasis on the evening - and much more intensely than he would have thought. Because this heroic act will be remembered. Zumal Dabo even left his competitor Busby in the goal and voluntarily took the last place - by the way, well over five minutes after the Ethiopian Selemon Barega, who won this prelude. In the end, everything had nothing to do with it, because the busby, which came into the goal with much help, was disqualified at the very end of the World Athletics Association.
Dabo, who lives in Portugal and studies there in Lisbon, had started to set up a personal best time at the World Cup in Doha. According to official data, he managed at 18:10.87 minutes, but he was still disappointed: "I wanted to run 17:55 minutes. I was already under 18 minutes". However, only in training, best times do not count.
Millions of worms: Egyptians equip themselves for wild protest day
In Egypt security measures have been reinforced in the run-up to possible government-critical protests. In Cairo city centre there was an increased police presence on Friday. Several subway stations remained closed, streets around the central Tahrir square were blocked.
Already in the past few days, the police had strengthened their street controls and partially searched pedestrian phones for news and photos related to the protests. Hundreds had been arrested according to two non-governmental organizations.
Adversaries of Al-Sisi
Last weekend there had been protests with hundreds of participants in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura against the government of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, the critic of corruption and mismanagement. There had been no such open protest against the political leadership in Egypt for years. The Egyptian construction contractor and actor Mohammed Ali living in exile in Spain, who played the demonstrations with video messages on Facebook, called for a "millionth march" in central places in the country today. Ali demands a "people's revolution". The man is not a "good man" for most young Egyptians, because he was a sub-contractor for the army, but his messages arrive.
The number of arrests in connection with the protests continued to increase, according to two observer groups. The Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF) counted more than 1,570 arrests by Friday. The Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights (ECESR) and the Human Rights Watch (HRW) spoke of more than 2,000 arrests. Independently, these numbers could not be confirmed at first. The government confirmed and did not comment on the figures either.
Random arrests
Many people had been "wildly arrested" "only because they were "at the wrong place at the wrong time", HRW announced under appeal to lawyers arrested. According to their lawyers, the accusations against the arrested range from "proliferation of false information" to membership in a "terrorist association". In Cairo, Alexandria and other cities, security forces interviewed and searched in uniform, but also in civilian clothing, according to HRW information also arbitrarily passersby.
HRW also criticised the censorship in the North African country. Thus, the government blocks websites and online services in Cairo to stop further protests against Sisi.
Online Dealers: Shipping Dealers Should Donate Returns Easier
For online dealers, many returned parcels are lost. Around 20 million returns end up on the garbage. However, there is an alternative.
The Ministry of Finance has shown online dealers like Amazon and Zalando a way to donate returned products instead of destroying them.
While companies could not be exempted from the VAT on donations in kind, the Ministry stated on a question by the Green Federal Party, which the newspapers of the Funke Media Group reported on Friday. However, dealers could set the market value of unsold returns at such a low level that they would have to pay no or only little VAT.
Scientists at the University of Bamberg had determined that the federal citizens would return every sixth package when ordering on the Internet. About four percent of the goods - about 20 million products - would then end up in the garbage. They would be donating the companies additional money according to the current legal situation, because the financial authorities would evaluate donations in kind like a turnover that would be subject to VAT.
The Green Group leader Katrin Göring-Eckardt called on Minister of Finance Olaf Scholz (SPD) to clarify with a decree that companies can evaluate non-commercial products accordingly and donate free of charge to non-profit organisations. The companies should be able to rely on not to be punished for donations. This applies not only to online sales, but also to other shops from fashion stores to the construction market.
Banksy art for auction: There was never a better time to sell this painting
The well-known work of Streetart-Star Banksy, "Devolved Parliament", will soon be auctioned.
For Branczik, Banksys' work underlines "the re-establishment of the oldest parliamentary democracy in the world into the basic attitude of animals and tribes". From Saturday, the painting is to be exhibited at Sotheby's in the British capital until it is to be auctioned on October 3rd. It is estimated at 1.5 to two million euros.
The work was first exhibited in 2009 at the Bristol Museum in the South West of Great Britain, where Banksy lives. This year the artist had once again exhibited the painting – at the same time as the original Brexit date on March 29. On this occasion the work, formerly called "Question Time", was renamed "Devolved Parliament".
The picture could change the owner for a million dollars.
Most recently, on Wednesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson, at the first meeting of the House of Commons, after the lifting of a forced break imposed by Johnson by the Supreme Court, delivered a hard exchange with the opposition. Johnson wants to make the twice-dated Brexit on 31 October, if necessary, even without agreement with the EU.
It is not the first time that Banksy, whose identity is still unknown, interferes in the Brexit debate. In Dover in the southeast of England, he painted an image that represents a man who breaks a star of the European flag with a chisel. The work sees thousands of truck drivers and other visitors every day when entering the United Kingdom.
Brexit debate is like a "walk in the park"
In his opinion, the violent verbal attacks by British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Brexit opponents in Parliament do not contribute to a climate of hatred. Compared to the election campaign before the 2016 Brexit referendum, the current controversy is a "walk in the park", said Dominic Cummings on Friday at a book show. "We enjoy it. We will leave (from the EU) and we will win".
Johnson had harshly attacked Brexit opponents in Parliament in the past few days and accused them, among other things, of "treasoning" against the people. Accusations that he could put the MPs in danger because they could become, for example, the target of murder threats, he dismissed as "Humbug".
Cummings said that the only way to return to peace was if the MEPs finally respected the British's decision to leave the EU. It is not surprising that people were upset that Britain had still not left the EU three years after the referendum.
In view of the charged atmosphere, on Friday even the bishops of the Church of England called for restraint. "We should speak with respect," it said in an explanation. "And we should also listen".
Pakistan's Prime Minister Khan calls for uno intervention in Kashmir
With an emotional appeal, Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan once again called on the United Nations to intervene in the Kashmir conflict at his first appearance before the UN General Assembly.
Otherwise, another war between the nuclear powers of Pakistan and India would be likely, Khan said on Friday at the Uno-General debate in New York. "If this goes badly, one hopes for the best, but be prepared for the worst." The United Nations would have been responsible for Kashmir. "You should have prevented this."
Since their independence from British colonial rule in 1947, India and Pakistan have waged three wars, two of them around the divided region of Kashmir. Both nuclear powers each dominate a part of Kashmir, another part of China. At the beginning of August, India had withdrawn the Indian Kashmir region from autonomy and thus increased tensions in relation to Pakistan.
Not even a bottle of water
The demonstrators in Cairo demand the overthrow of the Egyptian President al-Sisi.
Against the current protests in Egypt, the government reacts with a hard hand. It allows sharp munitions to shoot at the population, over 2,000 arrested join the prisons to the 60,000 political prisoners who are already in there. Protesting has never been harmless in Egypt. However, since the takeover of General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi in 2013, the state apparatus does everything to avoid a scenario like at the time of the Arab Spring.
But one of the triggers for the protests in 2011 was the bad economic situation. Poverty, lack of perspective and the feeling of being suffocated by one’s own government drove millions to the road. And this is a problem that the regime of el-Sisi is not able to handle, no matter how hard it is against opponents. The situation has even worsened.
Today, every third party lives in Egypt below the poverty line. Since 2016, the currency has lost more than half of its value, the inflation rate is ten percent. If you want to buy a bottle of water in the supermarket, you have to decide who will finance it: Nestlé, Coca-Cola or the military. The latter is not only responsible for repression but also the largest economic player. The military builds streets, houses, football stadiums, produce food and much more. That was already before el-Sisi. With authoritarian regimes, the Egyptian people have a lot of experience, even the dilemma in the supermarket is an old one. Critically, it will always be when large parts of the population have trouble providing themselves with a bottle of water at all.
Tüv tests in terminal: BER-Chef: No more "showstoppers" for capital airport
Two months has been checked to see if the complex system braid works in conjunction with BER fire protection. The operators are satisfied with the process. However, the Tüv is not yet ready at BER.
Following large-scale Tüv tests at the terminal of the future capital airport, the operators confirmed the planned opening in October next year. This is certain, the Supervisory Board head Rainer Bretschneider said after a meeting of the Control Board.
Airport Manager Engelbert Lütke Daldrup spoke of a successfully completed test, but also said that there were still shortcomings in the terminal. "We have many detail topics, but we don't have a real showstopper." He assured the schedule until commissioning still contains buffers.
However, there is evidence that the time reserve is not likely to be too large anymore. The construction production declaration is now due to be submitted to the building office during the first quarter of 2020, which was scheduled for this autumn at the beginning of the year.
Hundreds of defects in power cables still need to be fixed; the Tüv wants to examine them until February. "To create the conditions for the take-up of the flight operation, intensive work must continue to be done on the resolution of the defects," said a written communication.
Lütke Daldrup said that in many cases it is about missing evidence, less about new cables. There is not yet any release for all the duvets on which the cable stairs hang. The airport manager expects this to be available until the end of the year.
In addition, the fire protection at the transition to the station below the terminal is not yet working satisfactorily. The problems had led the project three years ago into another crisis. This time it is about smoking aprons that come down in a fire like a canvas so that the smoke does not spread. They are driving too far down. 36 engines have to be replaced. Then there are supposed to be new attempts with hot gas smoke at the beginning of the year.
Problems with fire protection and other tree meadows as well as planning errors have delayed the opening of the airport for years. Originally, it should be operational in 2011. Since the beginning of 2006, costs have increased from two billion to around 6.5 billion euros to the opening next year.
Since passenger numbers in Berlin have increased significantly since then, the managers are planning to expand the airport. That is why it is expected to take place at a special meeting of the Supervisory Board on 18 October, as the Chairman Bretschneider announced.
The airport company is now looking for two new managing directors. Finance Manager Heike Fölster will change to Deutsche Bahn at the end of the year, Staff Manager Manfred Bobke-von Camen will retire next year, as Bretschneider said. He thanked Fölster. She put airport finances on her feet.
Chemnitz: Machines exploded for drugs - Police arrest man
He needed money for drugs - and chased several vending machines into the city of Chemnitz! Now the perpetrator is finally in jail!
Over the past two years, the number of cigarette and parking ticket machine explosions in Chemnitz and the region has increased sharply. A million damage has been caused!
After two detonations at the end of May, the police seized a 33-year-old German on Bürgerstraße and on Further Straße in Chemnitz.
Police spokesperson Andrzej Rydzik: "In the course of investigations into the production of explosive explosions in force with a particularly serious case of theft conducted by the Chemnitz criminal police, not only this suspicion against the 33-year-old was confirmed."
Faced with the new evidence, the 33-year-old Chemnitzer now confessed a total of eight acts.
The police spokesperson: "With the loot, he apparently financed his drug addiction." The bomber had blown up parking ticket machines on the Bürgerstraße between 20 August 2018 and 31 May 2019 alone four times.
The total damage caused amounts to at least EUR 60 000!
The automatic bomber is now under investigation, and the police investigation against him continues.
It is conceivable that he was also responsible for further automated explosions in Chemnitz and neighbouring districts.
AUA takes over Eurowings flights from Vienna
The Lufthansa Group is reversing its strategy for Vienna Airport. Amidst the price struggle with cheap flyers such as Lauda, Wizz Air, EasyJet and Level, the Lufthansa subsidiary AUA takes over "the commercial control of all Eurowings flights from Vienna", confirmed on Friday a press speaker from Austrian Airlines versus the APA. Previously, "AviationNetOnline" had reported on this.
The Vienna base of the Lufthansa Eurowings flyer will be de facto dissolved. Of the current seven Eurowings aircraft, four remain in Vienna. From January 2020, AUA will take over the "WetLease", including Eurowings personnel. In Salzburg, three Eurowings jets will be stationed, which will fly from Salzburg and Innsbruck as charter machines to holiday destinations. Routes from Vienna to Germany will be taken over by Eurowings Germany.
The Eurowings base in Vienna will be integrated into the AUA hub and the network planning, the speaker said. Flight times should be coordinated on connecting flights. On the one hand, the aim is to strengthen the hub of Vienna and, on the other hand, to expand the decentralised traffic from the federal states.
As AviationNetOnline writes, Eurowings in Vienna only serves as "Production Company" for the Group sister AUA. For example, Barcelona and Rome would be operated with AUA flight number, but mainly with Eurowings device. Although the onboard product should be adapted to that of Austrian Airlines, the pilots and flight attendants would come from Eurowings. According to the report, Eurowings flights started under AUA flight number are no longer handled in Terminal 1, but as the AUA in Terminal 3.
After the Niki-Pleite, a price struggle broke out at Vienna Airport. The Ryanair subsidiary Laudamotion only announced on Thursday that the fleet in Vienna would be increased to 16 aircraft next summer. The Irish low-cost flyer will send four Ryanair machines, including crews, to Vienna, also in the so-called "Wetlease", which criticised the union as a bypass construct to the collective agreement.
Ryanair's Chief of Staff Michael O'Leary's statement that Lauda will have overtaken the AUA in five years' time, replied on Friday's AUA Chief Executive Andreas Otto: "We will remain number one at the site, in five, six or ten years".
Queen Single Princess Beatrice is engaged
Beatrice, Eugenie, William and Harry: As children, the cousins were the best friends. Now the last of the four married. Beatrice is engaged!
Wonderful news from the British Royals: In the early month of Italy holidays, Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi (34) is said to have stopped at the hand of his friend Princess Beatrice (31). This was announced by the palace on Thursday.
"We are delighted to announce our engagement. We are both so happy to start this adventure together and can hardly expect to actually be married," the couple, who have been together since October 2018, announced in the official announcement.
And on: "We share so many similar interests and values and we know that in the years to come this will be very helpful."
Sister Eugenie took the pictures
The official engagement photos took her sister, Princess Eugenie (29), and also published them on her Instagram account.
A royal feast
The wedding is scheduled to take place in 2020. More information about the date, place and everything else will be announced by the palace in the coming months.
However, it is certain that the marriage of the number nine of the British throne and the real estate mogul will be a celebration similar to that of Eugenie on 12 October 2018 with Jack Brooksbank (33).
Study on Causes of Heart Disease
Smoking, overweight, unhealthy diet - there are risk factors for cardiovascular disease. But what really triggers a heart weakness or an attack? Hamburg researchers now want to look at the genetics of 9000 healthy and sick people.
About the analysis of the heritage of 9000 people, Hamburgers and Swiss scientists want to find out more about the causes of cardiovascular diseases.
The research project is the largest of these in the German-speaking region, the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) announced on Friday. The Kühne Foundation supports the project with 12.5 million euros. From Switzerland, the High Mountain Hospital of Davos, which belongs to the Foundation, and the University Hospital of Zurich are involved.
Obesity, smoking and unhealthy diet are among the main influencing risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. Genetic factors determine the risk. However, the interaction between genes and external influences is not sufficiently known. Now the scientists want to compare the complete heritage of 8000 healthy people with that of 1000 former patients of the University Heart and Vascular Center at the UKE.
Currently, in more than 4,000 of the approximately 20,000 relevant human genes, possible disease-causing changes in DNA - so-called mutations - were known, it was called by the clinic. Every year about 200 are added.
The goal of the five-year project is to develop new options for the prevention, detection and treatment of heart rhythm disorders, heart weakness and heart attacks. The data could also be useful in the research of other public diseases, says Stefan Blankenberg, Head of the University Heart and Vascular Centre. New findings on the interaction between heart and brain, heart and kidney as well as on cancer are possible.
The chairman of the Kühne Foundation, Klaus-Michael Kühne (82), also stressed that there was a strong desire to use the data for research into other diseases. So far, the Davos Foundation hospital has been treating allergies. Now, a Center for Cardiovascular Precision Medicine should be established on the medical campus there and a professorship for bioinformatics should be created. In order to justify his commitment, the logistics entrepreneur living in Switzerland said that he had been operated three years ago at an open heart in Hamburg and was very grateful.
The biosamples of the healthy participants come from Hamburgers, who also participate in the "Hamburg City Health Study". With 45.000 subjects, according to the clinic, this is the largest local health study in the world. In the process of genetic decryption, the scientists strictly respected the protection of the anonymized data. It is a petabyte (1000 terabyte) of data, said Holger Moch from the University Hospital in Zurich.
Today, according to UKE, a human heritage can be deciphered within 24 hours. The actual cost of this is 1300 euros. The first gene sequencing worldwide, the results of which were published in 2001, has cost several hundred million euros. The study is scheduled to start on 1 October, and all 9000 samples are to be analysed by the end of 2020.
Nigerian police freed hundreds of abused boys
In Nigeria, the police have liberated more than 300 tortured and abused boys from a Qur'an school. According to information from residents, security forces searched the school in the northern Nigerian city of Kaduna and discovered the partially minor victims, as police spokesperson Yakubu Sabo said. "The victims were abused. Some of them reported being raped by their teachers," said Sabo.
The boys had been held under the pretext of being taught in the Quran and "improved". Indeed, the guards had been held by their teachers under "the most degrading and inhumane conditions", said Sabo. About a hundred pupils, including children of nine years of age, had been chained in a small space.
According to the Qur'an School, it has been reported for about ten years. Residents would have alerted the authorities to repeated irregularities in the institution. Parents would have been shocked when they were taught about the conditions in the Qur'an School, said Sabo. They had not known about the suffering of their children. The operator and six employees were arrested according to the police.
In the predominantly Muslim north of Nigeria there are many private Koran schools. They replace the often inadequate state institutions. The people in the region suffer from frequent attacks by armed gangs. According to the UN refugee aid agency, therefore, over 40,000 people have fled across the border in the neighbouring state of Niger in the last ten months.
Chained and tortured: Nigeria's police release 400 children from school
Police officers in a school in northern Nigeria have liberated almost 400 students from terrible conditions. "Many of them were chained and some had visible injuries that indicate torture," said police spokesman Yakubu Sabo in Kaduna City.
There the children had been discovered on Thursday after a clue in an Islamic school. The conditions there had been "unworthy" and the officials arrested the headmaster and six teachers after the liberation action.
The children, all boys, had been kept at their school like slaves and put on chains. Some had been sexually abused. Television pictures showed debilitated and injured students in a recognizable poor health condition.
World football election: Other allegations after Messis and Klopps Kür
Football "Signature not valid"
Jürgen Klopp, Lionel Messi and Megan Rapinoe awarded
With a gala in Milan, the world football club Fifa is the best player, the best player and the best coach of the year. Lionel Messi is the sixth honor and thus the record.
After Nicaraguan captain declared that he had never voted in the World Football election, accusations came to the Fifa from other countries. Egypt was not valued at all - with a curious justification.
In recent years, much of the Fifa has proved to be justified: the World Cup awards, the dubious plans of its President Gianni Infantino, the general behaviour of various corrupt officials. However, the FIFA World Cup election has so far been unsuspected of running unsurely - if we do not accept that the qualified national trainers and the national team captains of the member associations often vote for sympathy rather than objectively.
But after Nicaragua's captain had already complained that he had not voted at all, there are now further inconsistencies: Egypt complains that the voices of National Trainer Hossam El-Badry and Captain Mohamed Salah were not taken into account. In fact, they do not appear in the official and publicly available voting list.
The Fifa apologizes for the fact that "the signatures on the electoral forms were in capital letters and therefore not valid". One had contacted the Egyptian association several times to clarify the situation - without reply.
Sudan’s Trainer Also Surprised
While the situation in the case of Egypt is understandable, the Sudanese Federation states that Trainer Zdravko Lugasic did not vote as it was finally judged: with Lionel Messi in first place, Virgil van Dijk on two and Sadio Mané on three. According to Fifa, however, the vote was just as successful, with signatures and official stamp of the Sudanese Federation.
He also made accusations to Nicaragua's captain Juan Barrera: "Have not voted for the #TheBest2019 Awards. All details about my voice are wrong, thank you," he wrote. In his case, it was assumed that the Nicaraguan Football Association simply voted in his name.
The association now came to the news on Friday: True, but of course there was no intention. The completed electoral documents were "miserably" marked with the name and signature of Juan Barrera, the captain of the Nicaraguan selection, it was stated in a message from the association. However, the second captain Manuel Rosas actually chose. "We take responsibility for the administrative error", it was stated in the communication. However, both Rosas and team coach Henry Duarte had voted for Messi, "just as it is in the official list of FIFA".
The other cases now allow the Fifa to examine in an investigation, but emphasizes that the election process was supervised externally by the consulting firm PriceWaterhouseCoopers. As long as Lionel Messi remains undisputed winner of the World Football Choice - and Jürgen Klopp World Trainer of the Year.
Ukraine affair: Ranghohe Republicans speak for official investigation
Two ranked Republicans have openly voted for an official investigation against U.S. President and party friend Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important," said the Republican governor of the U.S. state of Vermont, Phil Scott. "Where that leads from here, the facts are determined by the facts that are determined." He wants to know more about the whistleblower affair before action is taken. An impeachment procedure can lead to the resignation of the president.
Scott said he was not surprised by the revelations. These had shown that Trump had repeatedly asked Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj to investigate the activities of the democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden in Ukraine. Scott said Trump was watching Biden "since years".
The Republicans have so far held back with criticism of Trump because of the Whistleblower affair, and few have shown dissatisfaction. Scott’s comments are now a first sign of this in Trump’s party. Virginia’s moderate governor had already repeatedly opposed Trump’s policy, for example against the relaxation of environmental regulations and the tightening of immigration regulations.
As another senior Republican, Charlie Baker, Governor of Massachusetts, also spoke out for the investigation. "It is a deeply disturbing situation," said Baker. "The right approach and responsibility for Congress is now to investigate the matter and go to the bottom of it."
Scott and Baker, as governors of U.S. federal states, have not formally participated in the trial against Trump, which is decided in Congress. Their comments are therefore symbolically important. Nevertheless, the first senators of the Republicans have also expressed themselves critical of the situation. In the midst of Romney, for example, who represents the state of Utah in the second Chamber of Parliament, said that the case was "extremely disturbing, deeply disturbing".
The affair could lead to the launch of an amnesty trial against Trump, and the Democrats in the House of Representatives have announced an investigation. They accuse him of abuse of power for the purpose of foreign influence for their own political benefit.
There is no precise timetable for the withdrawal procedure. With its majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could try to make a so-called impeachment. However, the decision to withdraw from office was taken in the Senate, where Trump’s Republicans have the majority. Therefore, the prospects for success of such a procedure are low. So far no US President has been removed by an impeachment procedure of the Office.
Were torturers on the board of Rackete's Sea Watch?
Three men were arrested in Sicily, reportedly raped and murdered in Libyan refugee camps.
The German captain Carola Rackete (31) was arrested in June after she had illegally controlled the port of Lampedusa with the rescue ship "Sea Watch 3" and 53 Libyan refugees on board. After violent protests and international criticism - also by Austrian Federal President Alexander van der Bellen - her house arrest was lifted after a few days by an Italian judge.
New serious accusations against rackete are now being made. Three men accused of torture in Libyan refugee camps could have arrived in Italy with the "Sea-Watch 3". Suspects have been arrested in a reception camp in Messina (Sicily) after migrants had recognized their tormentors in Italy. "We can't rule this out, but we don't have any secure information to do so ourselves," said "Sea Watch" spokesperson Ruben Neugebauer of the German press agency.
The police said in mid-September that the suspects in the North African country had raped, tortured and even murdered. They were Mohammed C. (27) from Guinea, and the two Egyptians Hameda A. (26) and Mahmoud A. (24). "The migrants were systematically harassed and subjected to atrocities - through repeated and constant physical violence," said the communication.
NGOs and relief organizations now point out that they cannot know exactly who is coming to the ships. "We cannot scan who the people are. They come without passports," said Neugebauer. Torture is one of the main reasons why people flee from Libya. It is therefore quite likely that even perpetrators are on the ships. "It is therefore very important that this is being followed up."
Italy's legitimate ex-Minister of Interior Matteo Salvini immediately apologized to Rackete, who is still being investigated in Italy for aid to illegal immigration.
Musk strives for delivery record at Tesla
Tesla-Chef Elon Musk has given his electric car group a strong boost on the stock exchange with the prospect of new record numbers.
"We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries," Musk wrote in an e-mail to Tesla employees published by the industry blog "Electrek".
Demand was strong, so Tesla could book 110,000 orders, it continued in Musk's newsletter. The challenge was to quickly bring the cars to the customer. Tesla had to offer as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
Investors liked this: Tesla’s shares went out of the trade with a plus of over six percent. The price has not increased that strongly for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered well 95,000 cars and thus reached its previous best value.
Musk needs records to achieve its high targets. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars. Six-digit numbers are required for this in the current and upcoming quarter. The most affordable Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but the profit margins are low. Despite the boom, there were last losses.
U.S. Budgetary Disputes: Only Bridge Financing Again
The new financial year will begin in the United States on 1 October without a proper budget. The Senate has followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and has decided on transitional financing until 21 November.
Although the US Congress and President Donald Trump agreed in August on an increase in spending ceilings for the financial years 2020 and 2021, the United States is once again in the absence of spending plans before the new fiscal year beginning on 1 October. On Thursday the Senate has followed the House of Representatives and has decided on a transitional financing (CR) until 21 November. Without such a decision it would have come to a shut-down on Monday at midnight, a partial closure of the federal administration. President Trump still has to put the decision into effect.
Shutdown averted
For the time being, the federal administration will now be financed at the level and according to the priorities of the spending plans for the financial year ending on Monday 2019. This is because the Congress has not agreed in due time on the 12 spending laws that allocate the funds to the various departments and authorities. Therefore, the federal administration cannot benefit for the time being from the spending framework, which has been extended for the new financial year from 1.3 bio. to 1.4 bio. $.
The Democrats have completed ten of the twelve laws in the House of Representatives, where they have the majority. However, the spending laws reflect the priorities of the Democrats who have little chance in the Senate dominated by the Republicans. Conversely, the Senate also has ten of the twelve spending plans more or less prepared, which are hardly majority.
In the Senate, the Republicans are apparently trying to force $12 billion for the construction of the wall, one of President Trump’s major priorities. The Democrats are interfering with the wall construction plans and their financing, which is actually intended for other military buildings and projects. The dispute over the construction of the wall was already escalated in December 2018 and led to a 35-day shut-down.
At the Wall, the ghosts separate
At present, it is unclear how the parties intend to approach this issue. More likely than an agreement on all twelve spending laws in the next seven weeks, an extension of transitional funding beyond November 21st is not excluded.
Against the background of the ongoing inability of Congress to agree in time on the twelve spending laws, and the consequent risk of a shutdown gain ideas to automate the process of popularity. Template p. 1877 to avoid shutdowns would automatically continue the financing of the federal administration at the previous year's level, stop the travel activities of parliamentarians and keep their wages back until the new annual spending plans are in place.
France allows artificial fertilization for lesbians and singles
In France, artificial fertilization is to be open to women and lesbians living alone in the future: the Paris National Assembly voted by a large majority for a government bill that allows all women to use in vitro fertilisation, which should increase the demand for anonymous sperm donations.
The presentation still needs the consent of the Senate. In the three-day emotional debate critics in the right camp had warned that in the future many "children without a father" could grow up. The French Bishops' Conference is also against the innovation.
The new regulation is the core element of a bioethics law that advocated health minister Agnès Buzyn as a "opportunity" for society. It depicts the modern family in which there are children with only one parent or with homosexual parents. According to its idea, the cost of artificial fertilization for all women is to be borne by social security.
Fertilization with sperm further prohibited by dead husband
In Belgium, Spain and the United Kingdom, artificial fertilization "post-mortem" is allowed. In Germany, there were cases in the past in which women in vain complained about the release of the sperm of a deceased person. The opponents of the advance in Paris argued that such a fathered child would then suffer a "very severe fate".
Many members of the government party La République en Marche (The Republic on the Move, LREM) of President Emmanuel Macron and members of the opposition had, on the other hand, declared themselves in favour of artificial fertilization with the sperm of the deceased partner. They stressed that a widow would be imposed a "double grief" if her husband's death left her child's wish unfulfilled.
The initiators of the now failed amendment consider it unfair that a widow can in future be fertilised with the sperm of an unknown person, but not with her own partner.
So far, artificial fertilization in France is allowed only heterosexual couples who cannot witness children. They must be married or live together for at least two years. Buzyn had already announced in the summer that the leniency would continue to be prohibited.
In Germany, artificial fertilization is theoretically open to all women - it is often difficult for single or lesbian couples.
Compensation for climate: Calls for air tax for universities are becoming louder
A lot has been flown to the universities, so the country will continue to have a climate tax there. Rectors say they have no money for it. But now they are also under pressure internally.
The universities should also limit themselves when flying. Photo: dpa/Julian Stratenschulte
The debate on climate tax on flights from universities and universities before the summer break is coming to an end. After the Regional Rectors’ Conference had skeptically responded to a corresponding advance from the Green-Black Coalition, the plans now receive support from the universities. In a joint statement, the PhD students from six Baden-Württemberg universities and a educational college for compensation for service flights. This was the first step "necessary", at the same time there had to be a wide debate on the avoidance of flights, it says in their opinion. The initial cabinet decision planned in July is still on ice, because the CDU has still not approved the presentation of the Greens.
Russia again arrests North Korean fishermen
According to the FSB, the prisoners were alleged to have fished illegally in Russian waters. Ten days earlier, 161 fishermen from North Korea were already arrested. At that time, there was a gunfight between the border guards and the boat crew. Three Russians and a North Korean were injured, the fisherman later suffered his severe injuries. This time, however, there had been no injured, it was said.
The Communist North Korea suffers from chronic food shortages. The North Korean fishermen were therefore on the move in Russian territorial waters. There, Russia’s coastguard operates according to its own data to protect its marine biological resources patrols.
30.000 squid confiscated
During the re-checks, 30,000 squid had been discovered and confiscated on the boats. In addition, the data were confiscated after three fishing boats and two motor boats and taken to Nachodka and Posjet at Vladivostok.
Russia’s fisheries authority had not issued fishing licences to the North Koreans this year, even after complaints from local entrepreneurs. According to the media, thousands of fishermen from North Korea have been arrested there for some time this year.
The head of the association of Russian fishing companies in the Far East Primorje region, Georgi Martynow, also recently complained of high ecological damage caused by North Korean fishermen. They fished with narrow-mash synthetic nets banned in Russia. With them also small creatures would be taken out of the sea. Furthermore, the nets would simply be disposed of in the sea, where they needed 200 years to be destroyed.
In the future, only 18,000: USA lowers the upper limit of asylum
The "most generous nation in history": Donald Trump, here at a meeting with elected police representatives in the White House.
The richest country in the world is firing itself against those seeking protection: as confirmed by the Washington Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the ceiling for the legal recruitment of refugees is further reduced. In the future, particularly threatened believers and Iraqis are to receive asylum.
The US government wants to reduce the already historically low border for the admission of new refugees once again. In the 2020 marketing year, which runs in the United States from October 2019 to September 2020, a maximum of 18,000 people are to be left in the country, as the U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs said. In the already almost completed marketing year, the limit is still 30,000 people.
The government of President Donald Trump has drastically reduced the willingness to accept protection seekers from all over the world in recent years. Under the previous government of Barack Obama, the reception limits were much higher.
The indicated ceiling of 18,000 refugees would be the lowest since the launch of the U.S. refugee programme in 1980. Nevertheless, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs described the United States as "the most merciful and generous nation in history", a formulation that strongly recalls the language use of the current U.S. President.
A "responsive approach" to refugees is aimed at allowing refugees to return to their homelands to help rebuild them, said Trump. For his hard course in migration policy, he is very much in agreement with supporters, but there is also massive criticism.
One major issue is the border with Mexico that Trump wants to lock down. In order to finance the construction of a border wall, Trump had imposed a national emergency. Whether there is a temporal link between the current measure and the current domestic policy developments in the US capital is unclear. Trump is currently under pressure because of the Selenskyj affair and a possible threat of withdrawal.
In the future, the U.S. government intends to focus on the establishment of two refugee groups, people who are persecuted for their faith - and Iraqis who have helped the U.S. military in the country and are thus in danger, as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs states. However, from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador, a maximum of 1500 refugees are to be admitted.
The US wants to see people from this "northern triangle" of Central America requesting asylum in other countries. Against this background, the United States has only concluded with Guatemala and now also with El Salvador and Honduras Migration Agreements to curb immigration at the US South border to Mexico.
Court orders the release of Orang-Utan from Zoo
An Orang Utan female has been transferred to a human monkey collection centre in the United States at the request of the Argentinean court from the former Buenos Aires Zoo. Born in the Rostock Zoo in 1986, "Sandra" was granted the rights of a "non-human person" and therefore was forced to be released. The animal was taken to Dallas by direct flight on Thursday evening, but not as a passenger, but in the cargo room, as lawyer Andrés Gil Domínguez explained.
Since the 53 kilograms of heavy human apes are unable to adapt to wild life, they will live in the open enclosure of the Center for Great Apes in Florida. There are already 21 other orang utans and 31 chimpanzees, among them "Bubbles", formerly pet of Popstar Michael Jackson. However, before entering Florida, "Sandra" still has to endure a 40-day quarantine in the Sedgwick County Zoo in Wichita in the U.S. state of Kansas.
After her birth in Rostock, "Sandra" spent some years in the former Ruhr-Zoo in Gelsenkirchen before being transferred to Buenos Aires in 1995. In 2014, the process of "Sandras" fundamental rights by animal conservationists contributed to the conversion of the Buenos Aires Zoo into an ecopark. By 2023, a research and education centre is to be established there to preserve biodiversity.
Record for Swiss Extrembergsteiger: 550 meters in 46 minutes
The Extrembergsteiger Dani Arnold has succeeded in a new Husaren ride in the Italian Alps at almost 3000 metres high.
Without net, double ground or other aids, the Swiss conquered the 550-metre-high north wall of the Great Tin in a new record time.
Dressed with jeans, T-shirt and only supported by absolute dizziness, Arnold needed 46 minutes and 30 seconds for the ascent. Thus he subdued the old best brand by almost 19 minutes.
Arnold is now a record holder at the Free Solo Speed on four of the six most important European north walls.
Nike benefits from new online marketing strategy
Despite the trade conflict with China, the US sports product manufacturer Nike has recorded a significant profit increase. Net profit increased to 1.4 billion dollars (almost 1.3 billion euros) in the end of the quarter. This is 25 percent more than in the previous year’s period, as the Group announced on Tuesday. This is mainly due to the new marketing strategy “Nike Direct”, with which the Adidas competitor directly addresses its customers online.
Sales rose to 10.7 billion dollars in the three-month period until the end of August. Nike’s sales figures increased with an increase of 22 percent in China. Thus, the Beaverton Group in the U.S. state of Oregon also benefited from its approach to directing itself to consumers via the Internet or smartphone apps in the People’s Republic.
Head of Finance Andy Campion announced that Nike would continue the "digital transformation" of the sports goods manufacturer with strategic investments and thus expand its competitive advantage. Investors were pleased to respond to the quarterly figures - the shares of the sports goods manufacturer increased by more than five percent.
Lifelong Stadium Ban on Racism in Italy
Because of racist comments about football pro Juan Jesus of AS Rome, the association from the Italian capital has imposed a lifelong stadium ban on a fan. The defender Jesus from Brazil had been insulted by the fan on Instagram. Jesus then published the private news and asked his club to take action."@oficialasroma You already know what to do with such a fan. #NoToRacism. Proud of being who I am," wrote the 28-year-old who plays with AS Rome since 2016.
The club responded on late Thursday. He had reported the fan’s account to Instagram and the police. Moreover, the Roma supporters should never visit a game of the club again, the club wrote on Twitter.
Racism is a problem in Italian football. Regularly, Italian fans scan racist insults against black players of rival teams. "We cannot have racism in society or in sports. In Italy, the situation has not improved, and that is very serious. You have to identify the responsible ones and throw them out of the stadiums," said Fifa President Gianni Infantino on the weekend. The occasion of the speech were racist songs at the first league party between Atalanta Bergamo and the AC Florence last Sunday.
But there had also been last discussions about the supporters of Juventus Turin. The Italian authorities have now won 38 randling fans of record champion Juventus Turin with stadium bans. Four of them should no longer enter the stadium for a period of ten years, the police have announced. For the rest, bans of four to seven years apply.
The fans are associated with ongoing investigations against twelve leaders of ultra-fan groups in the Juventus area. Among other things, the twelve are accused of severe extortion, money laundering and private violence. The club had launched investigations with an announcement last year.
According to Italian media reports, the ultra leaders are supposed to be behind the black trade with tickets. They would have "controlled military" the ticket trade for the fan basket and should have blackmailed Juventus employees to get on cheaper cards.
Generation Z: Are they really different from Generation Y?
Millennials are narcissistic, generation Z is political - whole vintages are conceived with catchy names. If you look more closely, the awards are full of contradictions. So how well do these labels describe the individual feelings of young people?
"The crabs are coming!" This call officially launched on September 21st at the Gucheng Lake in Gaochun, introducing the opening event of the 19th China Gaochun Gucheng Lake Crab Festival, as announced by the public relations department of the Nanjing Gaochun District Committee.
Gaochun, who forms the southern foothills of Nanjing in Jiangsu Province, is one of the national environmental zones. The city is the first international "Slow City" in China and here is also the Chinese seat of the international "Slow City" movement. The city has, ecologically speaking, ideal conditions with a mixture of "30 percent mountains, 20 percent water areas and 50 percent fields". Gaochun's great natural environment offers its inhabitants all the conditions to become rich.
The people in Gaochun have already started breeding crabs in the early 1990s. Over time, the crab industry has developed into a distinctive industry that has generated high incomes and has become an important part of Gaochun’s economic development. In recent years, Gaochun has actively pursued a large-scale, ecological and scientific development of crab breeding and a technology-based breeding of crabs. And the city has taken care of promoting more efficiency in agriculture and farmers’ incomes.
In recent years, Gaochun has pushed forward a reform to "distribute power, optimize administration and public services" and carefully set up the service network for "permits under one roof, a team for law enforcement, a network for services, a platform for credit allocation" which aims to fully optimize the environment for permits, services and development.
Gaochun takes full advantage of the advantages offered on the ground by connecting to southern Jiangsu and southern Anhui, using the development zone and its position as international "Slow City" as markers to house intelligent high-end production plants, biomedical and medical technology companies, energy storage and environmental protection, the cultural and health sector, as well as organic farming companies leading the "3+2" sector. At the same time, Gaochun has promoted the development of a national, all-territorial tourism area and tourist sites of national importance. This has included the ecological and cultural resources of the Gaochun countryside, the state of the buildings for civil services and public services, the "Tourism +" and "+tourism" sectors, and the development of cultural tourism at a high quality level. It is worth looking forward to the future of Gaochun.
Conflict between Iran and USA: Ruhani speaks of the end of sanctions - Trump contradicts
Iranian President Hassan Ruhani spoke of an alleged offer by the United States to lift sanctions after his return from the UN General Assembly. In return for talks with the Tehran leadership, the United States had put an end to all sanctions, explained Ruhani on his official website.
US President Donald Trump, however, contradicted the Iranian counterpart on Twitter: "The Iran wanted me to lift the sanctions imposed on him so that there would be a meeting. I said, of course, no."
Ruhani describes the situation as follows: Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron had been present in New York and had insisted that a meeting should take place. "And America says I will lift the sanctions," added Ruhani. The type of sanctions that should be terminated has stood for debate. "And they have clearly said that we will lift all sanctions."
However, this advance had not been made in an acceptable way, Ruhani criticised. In view of the current sanctions and the "poisoned atmosphere of maximum pressure", no one could predict the outcome of negotiations.
At the beginning of the week, Chancellor Angela Merkel met with Ruhani in New York. The background was the hope of the Europeans to save the nuclear agreement negotiated with Russia and China with Iran. This was intended to prevent the Islamic Republic from developing nuclear weapons. France’s President Emmanuel Macron, like Merkel on the margins of the UN General Assembly, expressed the hope that Ruhani would meet with U.S. President Donald Trump.
Heavy earthquakes near Istanbul - almost 200 aftershocks
After the Western Turkey was shaken by two earthquakes within a short period of time, the fear of a disaster grows. 34 people were injured at the earthquake on Tuesday. Since the earthquake the day before, there have been almost 200 aftershocks, said Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay on Friday.
14 schools in Istanbul were closed for security reasons. Hundreds of buildings were thus damaged. The magnitude 5.8 earthquake had shaken the Marmara region before Istanbul on Thursday and triggered panic in the million metropolis. Now the government wants to set up a Commission to prepare the country better for earthquakes in the future, Oktay announced.
In the past 20 years, Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for earthquakes, said Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu. In the city itself, the latent danger is ignored over and over again. Every year, poorly built houses collapse - including murbe made by the many smaller earthquakes that regularly shake Istanbul.
City planners like the well-known architect Mücella Yapici have been warning for years that large open spaces, registered as a refuge in the centre, have long been built. It was not until the 20th anniversary of the Gölcük Bezeg in August that the Istanbul Civil Engineering Chamber warned that an estimated one million buildings in Istanbul were not earthquakeproof.
The epicenter of the earthquake of Thursday was in the Marmara Sea in front of the district of Silivri and at about seven kilometres deep, as the disaster protection authority Afad announced. A minor aftershock caused even greater panic on the streets a few minutes later.
The Istanbul mayor Ekrem Imamoglu told on Twitter that injured or damaged persons had not been reported at first. TRT showed people running out of houses in panic. Students were taken out of the buildings in the district of Silivri for security reasons. Some students were crying as seen on pictures.
Istanbul is considered particularly vulnerable to earthquakes. Under the Marmara Sea is a section of the so-called North Anatolic Disorder, which marks the border between the Eurasian and Anatolic Earth Plates. Turkey is repeatedly shaken by earthquakes. One of the most deadly was the earthquake in 1999 near Istanbul. At that time, more than 17,000 people were killed.
Researchers fear that an earthquake of 7,1 to 7,4 might threaten strength. But when it comes to the earthquake, it is unclear. During the earthquake on Thursday, the West of the country and Istanbul met again.
Companies design emergency plans, private people have packed so-called go-bags with all the needy standing next to house doors, and schools teach children how to behave when the earth is shaking. When the next big quake comes, be unclear.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said after his return from New York that eight people had been injured. Some buildings had suffered slight damage. Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu followed the developments of the Istanbul Disaster Coordination Centre (Akom). According to this report, two mosque minarets crashed into the districts of Avcilar and Sariyar.
Warning of aftershocks in Istanbul
In the social networks, many users of panic reports. Buildings wobbled. Schools and hospitals were evacuated. Telephone lines were interrupted. It was more violent than that of Tuesday, writes one user. The head of the Turkish Red Crescent, Kerem Klinik, warned against aftershocks via Twitter. He called people to stay away from buildings that had suffered visible damage.
According to the date of the quake, official information is given at 13.59 (local time). According to CNN Turkey, only a few minutes after the first quake, there was a post-shock, which was indicated with a magnitude of 4.0 on the judge scale.
It was only on Tuesday that a magnitude 4.6 earthquake shook the Turkish Marmara region - it was to be felt until Istanbul. Also its epicenter was located in the Marmara Sea west of the million metropolis, the disaster protection authority told Afad already on Tuesday.
It was not the only earthquake that caused headlines on this Tuesday: Pakistan was also hit by a severe earthquake.
Researchers assume that sooner or later there could be a catastrophic earthquake in Istanbul - the tension between the tectonic plates is extremely high. Scientists believe that it will eventually unload - and cause massive damage.
Earthquake researcher Sükrü Ersoy expects the earthquake to be a warning now. This would have made it more likely, he said to CNN Türk. "These could be the signs of a major earthquake," says Ersoy to the broadcaster. "The great quake will also come sooner or later."
A few weeks ago, there had been an incident - the quake caused great concern in Istanbul too. In Albania there had been a violent earthquake only a few days ago - there were 68 injured. Also on Lake Constance this year the earth had trembled.
Parliament: New fuel in Ukraine
Two fragile documents provide for new fuel in the Ukraine affair for possible abuse of power by U.S. President Donald Trump. On the way to a possible withdrawal process, the US democrats see themselves strengthened: the complaint about Trump filed by an anonymous informant and his controversial phone call with the Ukrainian president is an important indication for investigations against the president. Trump himself sees himself once more as a victim of a "witch hunt". He also doubted the credibility of the whistleblower.
United States: Passenger of United Airlines locked in toilet - Flight diverted
Because a passenger had been detained in the board toilet, a flight was diverted from United Airlines. The toilet door had been blocked during the flight from Washington to San Francisco in 1554, the airline informed according to the U.S. media.
In the event of an unplanned port of call on Wednesday evening (local time) in Denver, the woman could finally be released from the narrow cabin. She had been locked in for about an hour, U.S. media wrote under appeal to other passengers. To continue towards San Francisco, the passengers had to change the machine.
In a video that is distributed on the Internet, according to the US media of Flight 1554, you can see how several people are trying to free the woman. "We are currently working on opening the door, ma'am. We'll get you out soon, okay?" said a man in it. The airline apologized to all passengers. At first it was open whether the woman was getting compensation.
The cockroach: inspired by Kafka: Ian McEwan writes Brexit-Roman
How does a writer like Ian McEwan deal with the entire Brexit Chaos? He writes a book about it - and his protagonist is unmistakable.
Inspired by Franz Kafka's famous story "The Transformation", British success author Ian McEwan (71) has written a book about the Brexit Chaos in the UK.
The novel "Die Kakerlake" (Original: "The Cockroach") will appear in German on November 27, the Diogenes Verlag (Zurich) announced. It is about the transformation of a man named "Jim Sams", who was ignored or hated in his former life, but now at once is the most powerful man in Britain. He sees it as his mission to put the people's will into action and is determined to let nothing stop him and no one.
McEwan was quoted as saying: "When Parliament is closed, so that the government cannot be challenged at a critical moment, if ministers are blatantly lying like once the Soviet leaders, when Brexitians in high positions plead the disaster of a no-deal - then a writer has to ask himself what he can do. There is only one answer to that: write." From McEwan it was only in the spring of the novel "Machines like me" that appeared about artificial intelligence.
Kafka's first published story in 1915 is about Gregor Samsa, who wakes up one morning and sees himself "turning into an enormous monster," is gradually excluded from family and society and finally perishes. "Ian McEwan bows down to Kafka to describe a world that is headed," said the Diogenes publishing house.
EU invests EUR 9.5 million in Austrian railway infrastructure
11,200 wagons in Austria and Hungary receive whisper brakes to reduce noise pollution by freight trains. In addition, sections of the railway connections between Graz and Györ and Wiener Neustadt and Sopron are modernised and electrified.
According to the EU authorities, this is to make travel more comfortable and reduce CO2 emissions.
Thomas Cook: All trips cancelled until 31 October
The German tour operator Thomas Cook cancelled all travels until 31 October 2019 one day after his insolvency request. Travel could not be made "for insolvency reasons", the company announced on Thursday evening.
This also affected bookings by the Thomas Cook Signature brands, Thomas Cook Signature Fines Selection, Neckermann Travel, ÖGER TOURS, Bucher Travel and Air Marin, which have already been paid or fully paid. As it stands for travel starting from November 1, 2019, the company left open. In agreement with the insolvency insurance, the further procedure was examined.
Thomas Cook in Germany had fallen into the trap of the British parent company and had made a proposal on Wednesday for insolvency. The company, including Neckermann Travel, Öger Tours and Bucher Travel, employs about 2,000 people in Germany.
Insurers want to return money to hotels from now on
On the other hand, from this Friday, hotels abroad, which currently house Thomas Cook vacationers, are to receive money from Zurich insurance. According to Zurich, payments to the hotels are linked to the condition that holidaymakers are no longer asked for extra payments.
Based on the booking information and without presenting separate invoices, hotels in the resorts are now expected to receive 50 percent of outstanding payments, as a Zurich spokesperson from the German press agency said. "This applies immediately and on condition that Thomas Cook travellers are not immediately required or otherwise required to pay individual hotel bills from these hotels," said spokesperson Bernd Engelien.
The insurance thus responded to reports from hotel guests who, according to their own information, had been forced to pay their own accommodation on site. Some had therefore to put more than 1000 euros on the table. The German Travel Association (DRV) and the Federal Association of Consumer Centres had strongly criticised this.
How many hotels are affected will be coordinated with the insolvency travel provider on Friday, said the insurance spokesperson. According to the information of Thursday, 70 000 Thomas Cook holidaymakers from Germany were still on their way. Zurich Germany has secured holiday and return travel of Thomas Cook customers.
Insolvency managers want to try to continue the three Thomas Cook companies in Germany and find a solution for the future.
However, the now announced payouts to hotels by Zurich insurance only help the travellers who are currently on the move. It looks bad for Thomas Cook customers who only want to fly on holiday. On the late Thursday evening, the company announced that all travels would be cancelled by 31 October. This also applies to those bookings that have already been paid.
As it stands for travel starting on 1 November 2019, the company left open. In agreement with insolvency insurance, the further procedure was examined, it said. Basically, the insurance company is also responsible for Zurich. The sale of new travel is stopped. dpa
The company refers to the insurer Zurich, which can be represented by the company Kaera. Customers could inform themselves on the Kaera website about the possibilities of reimbursement of the travel price and claim their claims via a web form.
Prince Harry Destroys Explosive Mine in Angola
For a long time, Prince Harry has continued Lady Diana’s commitment. In Africa, he is now walking directly on the tracks of his mother.
In Angola, British Prince Harry lit and destroyed a bomb mine with a blue splitter vest.
Close to a camp of the British Halo Trust at the place of Dirico, he set up the ignition circle on Friday morning in front of running TV cameras. At a safe distance, the explosive body exploded in the savanna landscape without causing damage. Although the Halo Trust alone has destroyed more than 100,000 relics of the decades of bloody conflict in the African country, there are still more than 1000 minefields that threaten the population.
On the fifth day of his African trip, Harry wanted to walk directly in the city of Huambo in the footsteps of his mother Diana (1961-1997). With the same warlord who once accompanied his mother, he wanted to take the path she was going. The pictures on which Princess Diana walked through a cleared minefield in 1997 had gone around the world. She also had support for the Halo Trust.
Harry (35) and his wife Meghan (38) have been on a ten-day African journey since Monday, starting in the South African tourist metropolis Cape Town.
Stocking Brexit negotiations: The danger of a no deal remains acute
In fact, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had made a clear determination: with him there will not be a third postponement of Brexit negotiations. But what statements are of eternal duration for the polarizing British. The recent judgment of the Supreme Court in Great Britain floats like a Damocles sword over the blondhead. His suspension of Parliament in order to be able to complete his Brexit course until the date of departure was cancelled at the beginning of this week. And a law passed by Parliament obliges Johnson to effect an extension of bilateral talks by 31 October in the event of failed negotiations with the EU. However, Johnson had been categorically excluded.
Boris Johnson still thinks deal possible
But the pressure does not seem to go by Johnson either. Meanwhile, when visiting a hospital, he made indications that in the event of a non-agreement, he supported an extension of the negotiations by the end of October:
You know, we'll stick to the law.
At the same time, however, we are confident that we will leave the EU on 31 October.
And best with a deal. I am cautiously optimistic that this will work.
And the time is running out for the Brexit negotiators in Brussels. About six weeks later, the EU and the British negotiators have time to prevent Britain from leaving the European Union without agreements. However, the recent talks again have not achieved any breakthrough. An agreement until the end of October seems rather difficult to imagine. If the British Prime Minister does not break the law, a further postponement of the withdrawal date will come into force. However, the opposition does not trust the Prime Minister’s words. It fears that Johnson could somehow enforce the Brexit in the event of a no-deal.
US authorities: Other deaths from e-cigarettes
The number of deaths associated with the use of e-cigarettes in the USA has increased to twelve. In addition, 805 confirmed and likely injured persons have reported in this context, the US Health Authority has reported CDC. According to a study in the "New England Journal of Medicine", there have already been more than 900 people affected, about 500 of them confirmed. The cause of lung damage is still completely unclear. In Europe, no similar increase in lung damage has been known. Complaints seem to be limited to users in the US.
Fear of new protests in Egypt is growing
Millions of times the videos of Mohammed Ali were shared in online networks. The construction contractor and actor living in Spain called for a "people's revolution". For today's Friday, he called for further protests against President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and the Egyptian military, to which critics accuse corruption and mismanagement. Ali hopes mass demonstrations with one million participants at central places in the country.
The security authorities are in any case alarmed. In Cairo’s centre there was already an increased police presence. Several subway stations remained closed, streets around the central Tahrir square were blocked. Already in recent days the police had reinforced their road controls and the phones of pedestrians partially searched for news and photos related to the protests.
On September 20, the demonstrators also gathered around the Tahrir Square.
Last weekend there had been protests in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura with hundreds of participants. There had not been such an open protest in Egypt for years. Accordingly, the security forces responded to it. According to the Human Rights Watch (HRW), nearly 2,000 people have been arrested since the past week. Many of them have been arbitrarily arrested - only because they were "at the wrong time in the wrong place", HRW reported arrests under appeal to lawyers.
The organization also criticised the censorship in the North African country. Thus, the government in Cairo blocks websites and online services to stop further protests against al-Sisi. The general has ruled the country since 2013 after overthrowing the democratically elected Islamic President Mohammed Mursi. Thousands of Islamists, government opponents, bloggers and activists have been arrested and partially sentenced in recent years.
"Ocean Change": Arved Fuchs of Greenland expedition back
The Polar researcher Arved Fuchs returned from his Greenland expedition on Friday. On his arrival in the port of Hamburg he was welcomed by Skipper Boris Herrmann, climate activist Greta Thunberg, who had brought the racing yacht "Malizia" over the Atlantic Ocean.
With a team of scientists, Fuchs has investigated and documented the consequences of global warming on his sailing ship "Dagmar Aaen" on the coasts of Iceland and Greenland in recent months.
The Fridays for Future movement was a blessing, said the Polar researcher. He had been waiting for years for the young generation to speak. It has been known for decades that the earth is warming up. Nevertheless, many acted as if there were a planet B.
"What happens on the sea often happens under public exclusion," said Fuchs. He and his team wanted to inform people about the effects of global warming and the spillage of the seas. During the expedition, among other things, they were measured with a drone of Greenlandic glacier ice and fished with nets for microplastics.
In the context of the Hamburg Climate Week, the Polar researcher from Bad Bramstedt was awarded the "Seadevcon Maritime Award" for his "Sustainable and Respectful Use of the World Seas". "For all of us who are at the heart of the survival of the oceans, Arved Fuchs is a great example," said Skipper Boris Herrmann at the award ceremony. "He is a witness of the changes that have taken place in the Arctic over the last decades."
Expensive Spaghetti in Rome: Tourists paid for noodles 430 Euro
430 euros for two plates of spaghetti with fish in a simple restaurant near the Engelsburg in Rome: that seemed to be too much for two Japanese tourists. The bill with 80 euros of tip money was paid by the two women, but they sent the receipt on Facebook, which triggered heated reactions.
"These cases harm Rome's reputation. We ask the police to consider whether this is a fraud," demanded a spokesman for the Federation, the Association of Travel Guides in Rome, according to the Roman daily Il Messaggero (Friday Edition).
Prompt came the reaction of the owners of the restaurant. The Japanese women not only ordered spaghetti but also fresh fish, the local owner justified themselves. However, this is not to be taken from the bill. Also a tip of up to 20 percent of the bill is normal, said the host.
A call in Ukraine, and everything is broken? US President Donald Trump could actually be confronted with a process of removal after the turbulent revelations of the past few days, the Democrats want to examine this with their investigation in the House of Representatives as soon as possible - the speech is from weeks until a decision is made.
At the beginning of the scandal there is supposed to be the telephone call with Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj. The accusation of the Whistleblower, who has finally made the conversation out of concern for national security and for the democracy of the United States public with his complaint, is monstrous: The president has misused the power of his office to instrumentalize the government of another country for an influence on the elections in 2020. He has exploited Ukraine’s dependence on extortion, thus forcing them to become active against a political opponent.
The core of this project is also to be understood in the now published note of the conversation with Selenskyj, although it does not represent the full text. However, the telephone call of 25 July is only an episode of a much larger story, in which the center beside Trump stands above all his personal lawyer: Rudy Giuliani.
From the public's point of view in May 2019, the story begins when the New York Times of Rudy Giuliani's travel plans report to Ukraine. He wants to meet with the newly elected president Selenskyj in Kiev, and the lawyer himself knows very precisely that his intentions are delicate. "We do not interfere in a choice, we are involved in an investigation into what we have the right to do," he says. He may think it is inappropriate, but "there is nothing illegal". Giuliani wants investigations to be pursued in Ukraine, for which there is hardly a basis - "because this information will be very, very helpful to my clients and could prove helpful to my government."
The lawyer and former mayor of New York seems to have infected himself with right-wing conspiracy fantasies that are fixed on Trump's counter-candidate in the 2016 election: Hillary Clinton had conspired with actors in Ukraine, critics at the time said to construct an occasion for Russia's investigations in the United States. However, this accusation was never taken seriously.
It is precisely the investigations that Trump will talk about on the telephone with Selenskyj so prominently in July. The version of Giulianis and the President states that the former Vice-President and currently promising candidates for the presidential candidate of the Democrats, Joe Biden, had forced the government of Obama to resign the former Ukrainian attorney general Viktor Schokin, as Ukraine’s commissioner, to stop the investigation of the gas company he was responsible for, in whose supervisory board his son Hunter Biden was working. Biden senior had extorted Ukraine financially to cover up the corrupt actions of his family.
In fact, the process was different. When Joe Biden demanded that the Ukrainian prosecutor go, the investigations against the gas company had already been completed, Hunter Biden was never directly affected by it. Schokin was also deeply accused of corrupt behaviour himself, the US government was by far not the only Western partner who insisted on his dismissal. Moreover, the Obama government even explicitly supported the investigations against the company.
Disorders at Instagram Facebook and Whatsapp: Social media are down
Users worldwide report massive disruptions to Instagram and Facebook. Thus, Germany, Great Britain and Spain are particularly affected. On the website allestragen.de, users report that Facebook has not been loading again and again since about 3:30 p.m.. Also Instagram issues the error message that content could not be loaded. Also, Whatsapp seems affected by the disturbance, although not to the same extent.
Instagram and Co. frequently affected by disturbances
It’s not the first massive crash this year. Already in March and July, the services had failed for several hours. And as in previous cases, users use Twitter this time in particular to make their anger air.
Polish scientists rescued in Antarctica
Three Polish scientists have been rescued by the Chilean Air Force from the ice of Antarctica. They were on the way by a tugboat and several miles from their base when their engine failed. They were lucky in the accident - less than an hour needed the Chilean rescue helicopter for the rescue.
Eduardo Mosquera, commander of the 4th Chilean Air Brigade:
"At 9:30 we received the message, just before ten we started, and good 20 minutes later we were over the hose boat".
Poland has been operating on King George Island since 1977 the Henryk Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station, 19 scientists are working there. The frozen researchers were safely brought back to their research station.
Caution: Smartphone NOT Wirelessly Charge
Practical but Harmful
Inductive technology via Qi-standard is extremely practical, but should not be used anyway.
Since several new smartphones have recently come into the market, which support wireless charging and sell very well - first of all the new iPhone-11 models, we would like to call a study from the beginning of July into memory. The wireless charging of mobile devices is extremely practical, but not necessarily recommended.
Higher temperature increases battery
Researchers warn against the wireless charging of smartphones. According to the findings of the University of Warwick, this is extremely harmful for the devices. The far greater heat development is due to this. If you load a mobile phone normally by cable, the battery heats up to 27 degrees within three hours. In the case of wireless charging, the researchers have always measured more than 30 degrees even with the perfect alignment of the smartphone on the charging pad. If the mobile phone is slightly next to the coil, the temperature rises even higher. In addition, the wattage of the charging pad increases, which in turn drives the power consumption up.
Capacity and lifetime
According to the researchers, the temperature is a crucial factor for the durability of batteries. Every single degree plays a role. When charging with higher temperatures, the battery not only pays for capacity, but also does not last for so long. Thus, the lifetime is less. The researchers therefore advise always to charge the smartphone by cable. Since a battery exchange with modern smartphones is always associated with high costs, this is likely to be a helpful tip. Apple has even increased the cost of a battery exchange once more – for all iPhones.
Practical
The technology is extremely convenient: simply put the device on a suitable charging pad - these are already installed in many restaurants, airports, hotels and cars - and the battery is charged without annoying cable salad and laborious plug-in crumbs. Since Qi (is for inductive energy transmission) is a global standard, where exceptionally even Apple is involved, there are few restrictions. However, according to the researchers, the technology should only be applied in exceptional cases.
Everest-Stau-Photographer: 13 eight-thousanders in six months
A Nepalese climber has climbed within just six months 13 of the 14 highest mountains in the world. Nirmal Purja (36) had reached the top of Manaslu in Nepal and thus set a record, his expedition organizer announced.
The former soldier wants to climb every 14 eight thousand in seven months. Purja calls his project "Mission Possible". He has already made international headlines: From him comes a viral photo of climbers who stand on Mount Everest Snake in spring.
The image of the mass wave triggered a debate about stronger security measures on the 8848 meter high mountain and the highest summit of the earth. In May eleven climbers had died on the climb within a few days.
A problem for Purja could be the rise of the 14th eight-thousander: Currently, Chinese authorities are blocking the Xixabangma mountain in Tibet. As a reason for this is mentioned among other things bad weather. At the beginning of the week Purja wrote on Twitter that Nepal’s government wanted to talk to China to allow him to ascend.
Four dead elephants discovered in Sri Lanka
Among the dead animals was also a pregnant elephant cow, a police officer told on Friday. "We suspect that the elephants were poisoned".
The four cadavers were found in a protected area near the famous and many tourists visited the former fortress of Sigiriya. According to the police officer, the animals were probably between 15 and 25 years old. An autopsy was ordered to determine the cause of death.
In Sri Lanka, almost 200 elephants are killed every year. The perpetrators are often farmers on whose land the animals had previously kept themselves harmless. At the same time, about 50 people are killed by elephants every year. This happens mostly when the animals move through nearby their habitat.
According to Sri Lanka, it is estimated that only about 7,000 elephants still live. The death penalty is theoretically the result of their killing.
United Kingdom oil tanker leaving Iran
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" leaves the port city of Bandar Abbas more than two months after his arrest by Iran. This was announced by the shipping agency Bandar Abbas according to the news agency IRNA. The Iranian Revolutionary Guards had set the British flag tankers under the pretext of disregarding regulations of the law of the sea in the Persian Gulf on 19 July.
Management of Thomas Cook in Criticism
The responsible Economic Committee of the House of Commons wants to examine thoroughly the fate of the travel giant Thomas Cook. This should be about the salary packages of the Board of Directors as well as the question why the British government did not want to make a financial contribution to the company that is struggling for survival. "Our interest is in the supervision of the company as well as in the control of external auditors," said the committee chairman Rachel Reeves in London. "We are obviously dealing with a bad example of management greed."
According to experts, genes are overestimated in colon cancer risk
The role of genes in the family increased intestinal cancer risk has apparently been overestimated so far. Researchers at the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) Heidelberg come to this conclusion in a recent study. Other risk factors such as family dietary habits are probably more difficult to accept. This has consequences for the calculation of the individual intestinal cancer risk, the DKFZ scientists stress.
Elon Musk increases Tesla shares
Musk wrote this in an e-mail to Tesla employees published on Thursday (local time) by the industry blog "Electrek". Demand was strong, so Tesla could book 110'000 orders, it continued in Musk's newsletter.
The challenge was to quickly bring the cars to the customer. Tesla had to offer as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
Investors liked the information: Tesla’s shares went out of the trade with a plus of over six percent. The price has not increased that strongly for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered well 95’000 cars and thus reached its previous best value.
Musk needs records to achieve its high targets. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360'000 to 400,000 cars. Six-digit numbers are required for this in the current and upcoming quarter. The most affordable Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but the profit margins are low. Despite the boom, there were last losses.
Does the British Government want to circumvent Brexit law?
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is concerned about whether he is looking for the possibility of circumvention of the law last passed by Parliament against an irregular Brexit. On a similar question, he simply said to journalists on Friday that his government would comply with the law.
The law provides that the government must request a postponement of the withdrawal date should no agreement be reached with the EU until mid-October. Johnson criticises this as a "capitalisation law" which makes negotiations with the EU difficult.
The former British Prime Minister John Major had on Thursday expressed the suspicion that Johnson could try to use "political harassment" to circumvent the law. Johnson could use a procedure that would postpone the entry into force of the law to the post-EU period.
Johnson said he was seeking a treaty with the European Union. "We are confident to leave the EU on 31 October, and the best way is by agreement."
Iran seems to be driving up uranium enrichment
Iran's President Hassan Rohani has increased the pressure on the European Contracting Parties in the dispute over the rescue of the historic nuclear agreement. "Unfortunately, the European States show inability or lack of willingness to take concrete action," said Rohani on Thursday at a press conference on the margins of the UN General Assembly in New York. In the event that they do not comply with their promises, he put forward "further steps" away from the agreements of the 2015 laboriously negotiated agreement.
The background is the conflict over the international agreement to prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb, which contained in return the commitment to Tehran to normalize economic relations. In 2018, the US alone went out of the agreement to force Iran to change course in the Middle East policy considered aggressive. President Donald Trump’s government wants to negotiate a new agreement with tougher conditions and is now again subject to severe sanctions against Tehran. Iran recently reacted with a resumption of the limited uranium enrichment in the treaty.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed in a report that the Islamic Republic is now using or has prepared for use with uranium installed at the beginning of September. According to IAEA data, Iran is also preparing to build more than 300 further centrifuges.
Perhaps the Europeans are not willing to carry their part of the deal and therefore left the Iranians alone with the costs and the burden of oppressive US sanctions, Rohani suspects. However, there will still be further talks that hopefully will bring a solution.
Rohani continues to deny Iran's involvement in attacks in Saudi Arabia
However, after an attack on an important oil plant in Saudi Arabia in mid-September, Germany, France and the United Kingdom followed on Monday the US assessment that Tehran was responsible for the attack. Originally, the Huthi rebels in Yemen, supported by Iran, had known themselves to the attack, but what was considered a false confession by the United States. "We have nothing to do with this," Rohani confirmed his position on Wednesday.
"Those who make such accusations must provide evidence of this," said Rohani. However, the European leaders would not have been able to do so during the talks with him during the UN General debate. Instead, they would only have insisted that the rebels in Yemen could not carry out an attack like this. Rohani had met with Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson in recent days.
Prior to possible talks with US President Trump, Rohani called on the government in Washington to change to a policy of "dialogue and rationality".
Comet from other star crossed solar system
Astronomers are currently observing a comet from the depths of space. This has been achieved before. The comet allows conclusions to be drawn on other solar systems.
What was initially only a guess is now confirmed: An interstellar guest crosses through our solar system. The comet from the depths of space was named after its discoverer on 2I/Borisov and has aroused the interest of astronomers around the world.
The far-reaching comet was discovered on August 30 by amateur astronomer Gennadi Borissow at the Margo Observatory in Crimea - with a self-built telescope of 65 centimetres in diameter. Follow-up by various observatories not only confirmed that it was an unknown comet, but also showed that it was not from our solar system.
2I/Borisov is only the second interstellar object after 1I/'Oumuamua of 2017, which was sighted during a flight through our solar system.
2I/Borisov offers astronomers the rare chance to get close insights into a strange solar system before he disappears on never again. First observations show that the interstellar comet resembles our own system, as reported by the astrophysical institute of the Canary Islands. "The current speed of the comet is high, about 150,000 kilometers per hour, which is at this distance well above the typical speeds of objects orbiting the sun," told Davide Farnocchia of the US Space Agency Nasa in a communication.
According to the analyses, the comet is on the way on a so-called hyperbola track that takes it out of our system - and clearly interstellar origin, as the International Astronomical Union (IAU) announced. It is also responsible for the designation and categorisation of celestial bodies. In honour of its discoverer, the interstellar tail, which was initially led under the catalogue number C/2019 Q4, got the name 2I/Borisov, the first part of which indicates that it is the second interstellar object discovered in our solar system.
The astronomers are lucky: Unlike 1I/'Oumuamua, 2I/Borisov has already been sighted in the approach. Thus, the researchers remain for many months for investigations. "The object will reach the greatest brightness in mid-December and then be seen by April 2020 with medium-sized telescopes," explained Farnocchia. "After that, it will only be observed by October 2020 with larger, professional telescopes."
Several observatories have already contacted the visitor. Thus, a team around Karen Meech from the University of Hawaii, who had already led the characterization of 1I/'Oumuamua, set the diameter of the celestial object at 2 to 16 kilometres in a first study. Pictures of the Gemini Observatory in Hawaii show a clear sweep of the comet.
Researchers at the Astrophysical Institute of the Canary Islands (IAC) have already won a first so-called spectrum of the interstellar tail, which provides a kind of fingerprint of its chemical composition. "The spectrum of this object is similar to that of comets of our solar system, and this indicates that its composition must be similar," said IAC researcher Julia de León. This observation suggests that comets in other solar systems could form themselves through similar processes as in ours, added de León's colleague Javier Licandro.
The discovery of two interstellar visitors within just two years suggests that these objects could open up a new way to explore certain processes in other solar systems. However, as often as such trip visits are, it is still difficult to estimate. One of the next interstellar visitors might start a planned satellite mission of the European Space Agency Esa.
The agency intends to station the three-part space probe "Comet Interceptor" (German, for example, comet catcher) at a waiting position at 1.5 million kilometres from Earth by 2028. According to Esa Science Director Günther Hasinger, it is expected to either wait on an unspoiled, fresh comet from our own solar system or on an interstellar visitor such as 1I/'Oumuamua.
First landing on Beijing's new mega-airport Daxing
Just before the 70th birthday of the People's Republic, it is time to do so: On the new mega-airport in the south of the Chinese capital, a first passenger machine of China United Airlines has landed, a special honor for the captain and crew.
By 2022, around 45 million passengers will be sold annually at the new airport, and by 2025 it will be 72 million. China’s President Xi Jinping personally announced the opening of the 450 billion expensive project. China’s most recent prestige project is also called “Seasters” because of its six-armed building structure.
The complex has four runways and runways, which are later to be extended to seven and is equipped with the world’s largest automatic air traffic management system. A new subway transports passengers to Beijing city centre in just 20 minutes.
Already during the construction, the Chinese had been told several times that Berlin could learn from Beijing. The opening of the capital airport in Germany, which has been in construction since 2006, has been postponed again and again. In Beijing, on the other hand, a first passenger machine landed after four years.
New supersonic aircraft is scheduled to fly in 2030: in four and a half hours from London to Sydney
From London to Sydney in just four and a half hours - this is what the UK Space Agency is dreaming of. It is intended to make possible this flight, which is planned for the 2030s at the oversound rate, a special drive (Synergetic Air-Breathing Rocket Engine, Sabre), developed by the company Reaction Engines from Oxfordshire, the U.S. station CNN quoted the agency. "This is the technology that could definitely achieve this," said Head of the Agency Graham Turnock to the broadcaster. "We are talking about the 2030s for commissioning, and the work is already very advanced."
In order to advance the project, the British Space Agency wants to work more closely with the Australian. A flight from the British capital to the Australian metropolis currently takes about 20 hours. As the only supersonic aircraft for passenger transport, the Concorde had covered the New York-Paris route from 1976 to the end of its operation in 2003, taking three to three and a half hours. In 2000, an accident occurred at the launch of a Concorde at Paris airport Charles de Gaulle, where all 109 passengers were killed. Last year, the US aircraft manufacturer Lockheed Martin announced plans to develop a supersonic aircraft together with the US space agency Nasa, the "X-Plane". Virgin Galactic also has such developments in the program.
"Sabre will make the world smaller with its high-speed point-to-point transport," writes Reaction Engines, among other things, on its homepage. The Sabre drive could be used for efficient travel at a speed of Mach 5 - which means five times as fast as the sound. Furthermore, such planes are also used outside the Earth atmosphere and thus enabled the "next generation of truly reusable frame-driving devices".
Rebellion in Washington: Trump wants to track down anonymous tippers in Ukraine
In the Ukraine affair about possible abuse of power by the US President, Donald Trump wants to track down possible leaks in the White House.
"I want to know who gave the Whistleblower the information," said Trump on Thursday in front of employees of the United States Embassy at the United Nations in New York. The person concerned was almost "a spy" and had been dealt with in the past "a little different" than today.
This was considered an intimidation attempt against tippers. The event was not actually public. However, several U.S. media distributed audio recordings of the speech on Friday. Democrats responded indignantly to the President’s statement.
On Tuesday, the Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives had announced preparations for the removal of Trump. Their accusations were based mainly on the written complaint of an anonymous intelligence officer, who raised serious accusations against Trump and his government headquarters. On great public pressure, the signs of the informant had been made public on Thursday.
As part of his work, the Whistleblower wants to receive information from several government officials, according to which the U.S. President "uses the power of his office" to achieve that another country interferes with the US election in his favor in 2020.
At the centre of the allegations is a controversial phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj at the end of July, in which Trump encouraged his colleagues to investigate what could harm his political rival Joe Biden. This is about earlier business of Biden's son Hunter in Ukraine and alleged efforts to protect his brother from Ukrainian justice. Biden is in the lead in the run-up to the democratic presidential candidate for the 2020 election.
The Whistleblower also accused the White House of being blinded by Ukraine's telephone: leading government officials would have tried to keep the exact wording of the conversation under the ceiling. As usual, an electronic word protocol had been made. However, this was removed from a commonly intended database after the consultation of lawyers from the White House and was stored in a specially protected system. So far, only a rough conversation protocol has been published.
The identity of the informant is not publicly known. The "New York Times" reported that it was supposed to be a CIA employee.
Trump once again questioned the credibility of the source on Friday. In a series of tweets on the subject, the president wrote, among other things, that the "so-called whistleblower" had distributed information from the second hand that would have turned out to be inappropriate. Therefore, there might be no tippers or spies at all.
As Trump expressed himself in New York about those who were supposed to have given the Whistleblower information, however, provoked outrage. The president of the US House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, responded worried and complained that Trump’s statement once again lacked the integrity of the government.
In the House of Representatives, several investigations against Trump and its surroundings have been taking place in various committees for months. In the light of Ukraine’s allegations, the Democrats are now pushing forward investigations with new strength in order to launch a possible withdrawal process against Trump.
"The Whistleblower has given us a roadmap for our investigation," said the head of the Secret Service Committee in the House of Representatives, Adam Schiff. Trump attacked ship forcefully, accused him of misrepresentation and again demanded the resignation of the committee chairman. Trump regularly insulted ship and had already demanded its withdrawal months ago.
More than 300 former U.S. government officials from the security and foreign policy field, who were working mostly under democratic but also under Republican Presidents, took part in a statement published on Friday behind the inquiry launched by the Democrats for a possible withdrawal process. If the allegations were confirmed, Trump would be "scrupulous abuse of power" it said.
There is no precise timetable for the further proceedings. With its majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could try out a so-called impeachment procedure. However, the decision to withdraw from office was taken in the Senate, where Trump’s Republicans have the majority. Therefore, the chances of success of such a procedure are low. So far, no US President has been deprived by an impeachment procedure of the Office.
VW Works Council: Jobs are "sleaking" mined
The VW brand’s plans to further reduce costs in production could be at the expense of manufacturing in Germany and Europe. This concern is driving the motor manufacturer’s works council. The brand wants to reduce its annual factory costs by two billion euros from ten billion euros by 2023. Of this, 500 million euros are to be saved this year.
The "Future Pact" negotiated between the company and the works council in 2016 already provides for the reduction of 14,000 jobs in Germany alone by 2020. In principle, a job can only be dismantled by the car manufacturer if it is shown that the associated activities are no longer necessary. Moreover, an employment guarantee is valid until 2029.
However, as our newspaper now learned from works councils, jobs in production, which are not actually available, are being "sleaked" over another route - that is to say past the official course. Thus, free-working regular jobs would often not be resettled.
In these cases, the works council has no means of enforcing restocking. Meanwhile, in many places, there are no staff who are increasing the density of labour, the concerns about the gradual bleeding out of the vehicle plants would be greater. This also increases the fear that vehicle production could gradually be withdrawn from Germany and Europe, because it is cheaper in other parts of the world. VW only said: "An adjustment of the volume of employment is made as agreed socially compatible along the demographic curve."
The VW brand wants to standardize production even more globally and control new projects centrally. It also aims to reduce costs and accelerate decisions – the aim is to increase productivity and thus competitiveness. Head of Production Andreas Tostmann said at a conference of managers in Berlin: "We are well advised to make ourselves firm in times of uncertainty from Brexit to the threatening trade war between the USA and China."
In this way there are already successes: for example, this year production costs per vehicle would decrease for the first time since 2013 compared to the previous year. In front of journalists Tostmann said that the production time for Golf 8, which is to be presented in Wolfsburg on 24 October, would be reduced by 1.1 hours. Exact production time figures do not mention VW, according to information from our newspaper, it is at Golf 7 round
20 hours.
In our region, the main plant Wolfsburg is the only VW factory in which vehicles are produced. Braunschweig and Salzgitter plants produce components. For Wolfsburg, VW-intern applies the rule of thumb that 800,000 cars must be built there each year to make the plant profitable. In 2018, however, the utilization in Wolfsburg was only around 700,000 vehicles – due to the falling diesel demand and the problems in switching to the new consumption and exhaust test method WLTP.
As Production Manager Tostmann announced last year, however, in Wolfsburg "perspective" should roll a million cars from the band. This should allow the bundling of the golf production in the main plant - because the Zwickau plant is refitting to the location for the e-auto-production of the golf production.
In addition, the SUV Tiguan and Tarraco (Seat) will be produced in Wolfsburg. However, the sales figures of Golf and Tiguan have recently fallen. Therefore, the expectations are now on the Gulf 8. Despite all the efforts to build e-mobility, the Wolfsburger bread and butter car is supposed to remain for the first time.
Forced by Voodoo to Prostitution: Traffickers convicted
Young women from Nigeria have been sworn in, thrown into the Ruhr area and forced into prostitution. Six suspected traffickers have to go to prison for this.
Six suspected Nigerian traffickers were sentenced to probation and prison sentences of up to eight years and three months on Friday in Bochum. The accused had thrown young Nigerian women into the Ruhr area and forced prostitution. In order to force their obedience, the Nigerian women who left the country had to take a ritual oath before a voodoo priest.
The victims were between 17 and 22 years old. They were brought over the Mediterranean with the help of Libyan locks in tugboats. However, the dream of a better future did not come true. In Germany, they were distributed to various brothels to deal with the alleged lock costs of an average of 25 000 euros.
The accused - four men and two women - had admitted the encroachment and subsequent distribution of the young Nigerian women to brothels in the trial. "The work made women physically and psychologically difficult," said Judge Isabel Hoffmann at the verdict. "Some of them were correctly opposed."
The judgments are based on professional and gang-based encroachment by foreigners, trafficking in human beings, coercion and heavy forced prostitution.
Ufo calls for negotiations with Lufthansa
FIm's ongoing dispute with the Lufthansa Group has once again threatened the flight attendants union Ufo with strikes.
If the company does not return to the negotiating table, the union will be "informed on 14 October about the work-fighting measures in the LH Group," said UFO's Chief Executive Officer Daniel Flohr on Friday. Lufthansa and her daughter Eurowings have been refusing to conduct collective negotiations with UFO for months. This also concerns the question of whether the union has legally terminated collective agreements with Lufthansa.
On this point, Ufo now sees itself strengthened after a decision by the Labour Court of Frankfurt. Lufthansa wanted to see that the collective agreements had not been terminated. The court rejected the applications. The company confirmed the decision and tried to appeal against it. "That a second court sees the matter completely differently, I consider it unlikely," said Ufo Board of Directors Flohr.
In August, Lufthansa had also submitted a request to the Landesarbeitsgericht Frankfurt to have the Ufo's status as a trade union reviewed in court. The company argues that the union had not established a representative board for months and was therefore unable to fulfil its role as a collective partner.
Prior to this, there was a fierce leadership dispute in the divisional union, during which numerous members of the board and the council resigned, including the long-standing trade union leader Nicoley Baublies. Due to the doubt of their leadership, the UFO had suspended an initial vote on the strike of the cabin staff at Eurowings at the end of July.
Facilitated entry: Saudi Arabia announces new visa system
Until now, Saudi Arabia has not been known as an international tourist magnet. But that is supposed to change now. The country on the Persian Gulf wants to introduce new visa regulations.
With a new visa system, Saudi Arabia will in future attract more international tourists. By 2030, the number of international and local visitors will increase to 100 million per year, the tourism commission announced.
"The opening of Saudi Arabia to international tourists is a one-historical moment for our country," said Ahmad Al-Chatib, chairman of the Tourism Commission.
Saudi Arabia is so far difficult to reach for tourists. Visas are usually only for short business trips, religious pilgrimages or visitors with relatives in the desert state. With the new rules, the ore-conservative kingdom hopes for more revenue from the tourism business. According to its own statement, Riad wants to reduce its dependence on oil trade.
In mid-September, several rockets and drones had met two of the most important oil plants in eastern Saudi Arabia: the country’s largest oil refinery in Abkaik and the Churais oil field. In the following, national oil production broke down dramatically, oil prices rose. It is likely to take several weeks until the Kingdom’s oil production reaches its old level again.
Justin and Hailey Bieber are in preparation for wedding party
Singer Justin Bieber (25) and his wife Hailey (22) are preparing for their wedding feast. The model posted several party photos in their Instagram stories on Thursday (local time) where she can be seen in the white wedding look. Reality-Star Kendall Jenner (23) and others had organized a bachelor party in Los Angeles according to the People magazine.
Justin posted several colorful, including banana printed suits on Instagram and asked his followers: "Help me choose my smoking for the wedding." According to media reports, the celebrity couple wants to marry church on the weekend.
The Biebers gave themselves the yes word in a New York office a year ago. There had not been a big party at the time.
In an interview with the Australian Vogue, Hailey recently said that the two had found a common level after initial problems: "If you don't want to compromise, you can't have a relationship."
Two deaths in plane crash in the Czech Republic
Two people were killed in the crash of a small plane in the west of the Czech Republic. The wreck had been discovered on Friday in a forest area near the city of Mecin (metchin), the police informed. The dead were a 38-year-old woman and a 64-year-old man.
The authorities had been looking for the machine since Thursday evening after the crew had given an emergency signal via GPS. A military helicopter was also in use in the search. The cause of the accident still needs to be determined. The crash is about 30 kilometers south of Pilsen (Plzen) and 100 kilometers northeast of Regensburg.
Half of the European tree species are threatened with extinction
In addition to pests, diseases, alien species, non-sustainable logging and the growth of cities cause the threat, the IUCN World Conservation Union reported in Brussels on Friday. It has examined the stocks of all 454 species of trees known in Europe. 265 of these are not found on any other continent. Of these 265, 58 percent are threatened. 66 are already at the highest level of risk and thus before extinction.
The IUCN divides endangered species into six categories: from "potentially endangered" to "at risk", "severely endangered", "from extinction" and "death in nature" to "death". Overall, it lists more than 28,000 species of animals and plants worldwide as being at risk.
Ebersche and wild horse chestnuts threatened
In Germany, Ebereschen (Sorbus) was particularly threatened, said one of the authors, David Allen, the German Press Agency. "Most people are threatened because the populations are small or because of the transformation or weakening of their habitats."
It also looks bad for the wild usual horse chestnuts. Since 2017, they have been considered "dangerous", level two of the IUCN scale. The biggest threat besides a mushroom is the Balkan Miniermotte. Since the 1980s it has spread across the whole continent and has hardly any natural enemies. IUCN estimates the number of wild horse chestnuts (Aesculus hippocastanum) in Europe to be less than 10,000. Not taken into account in this assessment are the trees in cities, parks and avenues.
Species of shrubs and moss also in danger
The IUCN scientists also created new European Red Lists for molluscs, shrubs and moose. More than a fifth of the molluscs and moose and almost half of all species of shrubs are threatened, according to the IUCN. This is mainly due to the destruction of the wild, to introduced species, agricultural practices and climate change. Soft animals such as snails played a key role in the recycling of nutrients in the soil and are an important source of food for birds and other animals.
"This report shows that the situation is precarious for many overlooked and underestimated species, species that form the backbone of the European ecosystem and contribute to a healthy planet," said Luc Bas, IUCN Director of the European Office. "We need to limit the human impact on our ecosystems and make the protection of these species a priority."
Earthquake before Istanbul: 34 Reported injured
In the recent earthquake in Turkey, 34 people have been injured. According to the data, there were no deaths. Hundreds of people had to leave their homes, 14 schools in Istanbul had been closed for security reasons, said Turkish Vice-President Fuat Oktay on Friday.
Hundreds of buildings were thus damaged. Since the quake of the day before, there had been almost 200 aftershocks. On Thursday, the magnitude 5.8 earthquake had shaken the Marmara region in front of Istanbul and triggered panic in the million metropolis.
Now the government wanted to set up a Commission to better prepare the country for earthquakes in the future, Oktay announced. In the last 20 years, Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for earthquakes, said Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu.
Istanbul is considered particularly vulnerable to earthquakes. Below the Marmara Sea lies a section of the so-called North Anatolic Disorder, which marks the border between the Eurasian and Anatolic Earth Plates.
One of the hardest quakes was one of the strength 7.6 in 1999 near Istanbul. The epicenter was then located in Gölcük southeast Istanbul. More than 17,000 people died.
Already on Tuesday, a earthquake of 4.6 had shaken the region around Istanbul. The authorities called on the inhabitants to stay away from damaged buildings.
Super Bowl 2020: Jennifer Lopez (JLo) and Shakira perform in the half-time show
The Latin pop singers Jennifer Lopez and Shakira will lead the half-time show of the next American football finals Super Bowl. This was announced by the singers on Twitter. "Greater won't be," Shakira wrote to a photo of herself and Lopez. She is furiously excited to stand on the super-bowl stage. On February 2, 2020, it will be in Miami.
Jennifer Lopez explained that since 1996 she has dreamed of performing at the Super Bowl - then she saw Diana Ross flying into the sky at the mid-term show. "Now it is even more special because the NFL lasts 100 years and I will perform with another Latina." She could hardly expect "to show what we girls can do on the biggest stage in the world."
Shakira pointed out in a statement that she felt honored to stand on one of the world's largest stages alongside another artist and to represent Latinos and Latinas from the United States and around the world. "And then also on my birthday!" The main sponsor of the event wrote on Twitter that it was the first time that the two "kingdoms" were on stage together.
Shakira is from Colombia. Jennifer Lopez was born in New York, her parents come from Puerto Rico.
Fight against falling audiences
The Super Bowl is the highlight of the American football season. The game and the half-time show are among the most viewed TV broadcasts in the United States. Even if you have recently dropped viewers, this February the spectacle in the United States attracted the least viewers for more than ten years. Nevertheless, there were still almost a hundred million people on average.
In the run-up to the mid-term show of the last Super Bowl, there had been an uproar: According to media reports last February, Topstars such as Rihanna, Pink and Cardi B did not want to appear in the dispute about dealing with Quarterback Colin Kaepernick. Finally, the pop group Maroon 5 led the half-time show - the criticisms were not very friendly.
Kaepernick, then quarterback of the San Francisco 49ers, had gone to his knees in the season 2016/17 before NFL games at the national anthem from protest against police force and racism. With his protest Keepernick triggered a movement, numerous players took over the gesture. This caused great excitement, US President Donald Trump attacked the most African American football stars sharply. Keepernick himself has been without unity since March 2017 and has no more NFL party. He accuses the clubs of not wanting to hire him for political reasons.
Cook-Pleite: Hotels get money from insurance
According to a press report, some banks are likely to pay off the travel provider Thomas Cook’s debts. It threatens high depreciation on outstanding bonds and loans. Credit Suisse is also affected, writes the Financial Times in its Friday issue.
According to the report, banks such as Barclays, Morgan Stanley, UniCredit or Credit Suisse would probably have to make a total write-down of up to 1.8 billion pounds (about EUR 2 billion) on their books.
The creditors of bonds would have to take in depreciations ranging from £900 million to £1 billion and the lenders between £550 and £825 million. The amounts actually depreciated are more likely to be at the upper end of the range, an expert told the sheet.
How great the losses of the creditors will be at the end will be, after the insolvency proceedings have ended. A person close to this process did not give too much hope. For example, the approximately 40 aircraft of Thomas Cook in Great Britain were "old" and many of the properties were in bad locations. Most of the money could probably be recovered with the sale of the airport slots as well as the Thomas Cook brand, it continued.
Rackete was said to have brought suspected murderers to Italy.
Sea Watch Captain Carola Rackete may have brought men to Italy who were supposed to have tortured and killed people in Libya. "We cannot rule this out, but we do not have any information to do so ourselves," said the spokesman of the refugee organization Sea-Watch, Ruben Neugebauer, the news agency dpa.
Other migrants would have recognized the three men in Italy. They are accused of having raped, tortured and killed people in Libya. The suspected perpetrators had been arrested in the reception camp in the Italian Messina. New builders stressed that the refugee organisations could not check who they had on their ships. "They come without passports".
On June 29th, Carola Rackete had brought illegal migrants to the port of Lampedusa and hit a ship of the Italian financial police. On that day, the three suspects must also have arrived there. The captain is under investigation for aid to illegal immigration.
U.S. Government Warns Against Huawei
The head of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Ajit Pai, warned the Federal Government not to trust the Chinese network operator Huawei.
We believe that the risks are too great," said Pai to the "Handelsblatt" with a view to building the new 5G mobile network.
China has a "national security law" which obliges every company "under Chinese law" to comply with the instructions of the security agencies.
The current law also prohibits companies from informing third parties about such requests," continues the FCC Chief. This makes it very difficult to have confidence in the integrity of technical equipment and services.
In the meantime, the Federal Government has agreed to require suppliers to provide a "declaration of trust".
Berlin initially wanted to try to control the risks, for example with technical solutions, reports the "Handelsblatt" under reference to its own information.
Pai doubts that this is possible. The 5G technology does not only consist of the hardware:
Especially the software is important to keep the devices up to date. This software consists of billions of lines of program code that change over time," said Pai.
It is "very difficult to imagine" that a government authority, "no matter where, would be able to check every single update in real time to detect security risks," continues the FCC chief.
To the Chinese company Huawei, he proposes close contacts with the Chinese state apparatus:
The employee company, which allegedly belongs to the company, is not necessarily independent of the government," said Pai to the "Handelsblatt.
The US had evidence that government employees were placed within the company. Pai was recently in Berlin for talks to advertise for the position of the US.
Chemical factory in northern France burns: schools closed
During the night, residents hear explosions. A giant fire wall illuminates the sky over a northern French chemical factory. The fire is erased after hours - the cleaning work could take days.
After a fire in a chemical factory in the North French city of Rouen on Thursday, the schools and kindergartens remain closed in the region.
In twelve municipalities the institutions would not open on Friday, the responsible prefecture informed. The Ministry of the Interior had asked the citizens to stay as far as possible in buildings and not to expose themselves to smoke. There were no injured ones. Farmers and breeders were called to bring their animals inside, to protect their food and to stop the harvest for the first time.
The fire could be completely wiped out on Thursday evening, as the prefecture announced. There is still a risk that after the erasure the smell spreads, according to the prefecture on Twitter. According to the prefecture, 240 firefighters and 90 policemen and gendarmen were in use.
A giant black smoke column had previously risen from the chemical factory. French media reported on huge flames and explosions in the factory of Lubrizol, manufacturing the supplement for oils. The production plant is a few kilometres from the city center.
The factory in Normandy belongs to the so-called Seveso category of hazardous sites, which are particularly monitored. In 1976, in the Italian Seveso near Milan, a devastating chemical accident occurred.
The prefect of the region of Normandy, Pierre-André Durand, told the news station BFMTV that at first no "high toxicity" was found in samples. However, a contamination of the nearby Seine could not be excluded. In the river dams against pollution had been built up, the prefecture explained.
The fire broke out at 2:40 in the early morning, the authorities reported. The cause remained unclear at first. Rouen is a regional metropolis and lies at the Seine between Paris and the port city of Le Havre.
French Minister of Finance: "Germany must invest and now must invest"
French Minister for Economic and Financial Affairs Bruno Le Maire has called on Germany to invest more in order to boost economic growth in the euro area.
Germany must invest and now, the sooner the better," said Le Maire on Thursday evening at the presentation of the French budget for the coming year.
The economy in the eurozone was weakening, the Minister warned.
We must not wait until the economic situation gets worse in order to make the necessary decisions".
Action would have to be taken by those states that have budget margins for more investment, said Le Maire, among other things, with regard to Germany.
France does not have these margins, the Minister added, and referred to the high level of government debt in its country, which is more than 98 percent of gross domestic product. French sovereign debt must be "stabilised" and "reduced", said Le Maire.
In recent years, France has repeatedly appealed to Germany to increase public investment to boost the European economy. In return, German politicians have repeatedly called on France to address its budget deficit.
The French budget for 2020, presented on Thursday, provides for tax relief of more than EUR 9 billion for households.
In this way, the French government reacts, among other things, to the protests of the Yellow West movement. The re-indebtedness is expected to fall to 2.2 percent, according to the expected 3.1 percent this year.
Is he still trying to trick?: Johnson takes a question about Brexit tactics
British Prime Minister Johnson strongly criticises the "Capital Act" passed by Parliament.
Parliament is back, a law prescribes the British Prime Minister to avoid a chaos Brexit. Critics, however, fear that Boris Johnson could still use a loophole. Addressed to this possibility, however, the Tory politician deviates.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is concerned about whether he wants to enforce an irregular Brexit - despite the law last passed by Parliament, which should prevent it. Johnson merely said to journalists that his government would comply with the law in force.
The law provides that the government must request a postponement of the withdrawal date, should no agreement be reached with the EU by mid-October. Johnson criticises this as a "capitalisation law" which makes negotiations with the EU difficult.
The former British Prime Minister John Major said on Thursday that Johnson could try to use "political harassment" to circumvent the law. The Prime Minister could use a procedure that would postpone the entry into force of the law to the time after EU withdrawal. Johnson said he was striving for a treaty with the European Union. "We are confident to leave the EU on 31 October, and the best way is by agreement".
Johnson's chief consultant Dominic Cummings stated in the meantime that he felt the political struggles around Brexit as a "walk in the park" and was confident that the desired EU exit would still come about: "We will enjoy that, we will win, we will leave (Note: Red.: from the EU), don't worry," said Cummings of the British newspaper "Telegraph".
Cummings, who led the Brexit campaign "Vote Leave" during the 2016 election campaign, is now acting as head of the British government headquarters Downing Street. He is supposed to be behind the uncompromising policy that has led the Prime Minister into an impeccable situation.
"The Polaroid Diaries" by Linda McCartney
Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan or Janis Joplin - they all stood in front of Linda McCartney's camera, which has become one of the huge rock photographers. But it doesn't always have to be the big glamour. The photo book "The Polaroid Diaries" (bags) dives deep into the very private world of the McCartney family.
Paul McCartney, who was married to her from 1969 to Linda's death in 1998, was visibly proud and moved when he presented the picture volume "The Polaroid Diaries" in mid-September at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. Among the illustrious guests were Ringo Starr, Stella McCartney, Olivia Harrison and Pretender's wife Chrissie Hynde.
After the launch event, McCartney wrote to Instagram: "#ThePolaroidDiaries is a glimpse of the life of an extraordinary family from the period before Instagram, a celebration of the legacy of LindaMcCartney as an engaged artist and the instant magic of the Polaroid film."
With Linda McCartney, who had studied art history at the University of Aizona until she found out about photography, the camera was always there. Thousands of Polaroids made it, some hundred of them are now being released for the first time in "The Polaroid Diaries".
They are portraits, still life, landscapes, several hamsters, a sheep in the kitchen and other interiors from the early 70s to the late 90s. "She wanted real moments," writes art critic Ekov Eshun in his foreword. And of course, one is always at the heart of it: her husband Paul - as you may never have seen him.
He then dances on his shoulders with his daughter Mary, telephones in the bathrobe with a bag on his head or wears unshaped moonboats. Certainly, the McCartneys were an extraordinary family, but beyond the headlights on their farm in southern England or in Scotland also led a quite normal life. Mary McCartney said according to BBC that she had slept as a baby in a bed that her father had made from old potato boxes. And it has not always been cleaned up with the McCartneys.
Like hardly another medium, the Poloraid camera captures the instant moment. The photos of Linda McCartney are certainly a kind of family diary, but they are much more than pure snapshots.
It's about the deciding click: you have to recognize when a great photo happens before you. And then you have to take it in exactly the right moment," said Paul McCartney. "If you cut it two seconds later or two seconds earlier, it can be a completely different picture." And Linda would have had the gift to always catch the right moment. "She just knew she had it," said Paul in the Eshun essay.
There the light, the composition, the picture cut-out and the colors, which makes "The Polaroid Diaries" not only an entertaining picture book for Beatles fans, but in addition to all the anecdotals is also a great aesthetic pleasure, where landscapes already seem like abstract paintings. The perfect addition to the newly created Beatles album "Abbey Road", which appeared exactly 50 years ago.
"We will continue to buy oil and gas from Iran"
Turkey wants to continue importing oil and gas from the neighbouring country despite the US sanctions imposed on Iran. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in an interview published on Friday that Turkey could not stop oil and gas imports from Iran.
We will continue to buy our natural gas from there," said Erdogan in New York, where he had attended the UN Assembly.
However, Erdogan admitted that Turkey had problems in importing Iranian oil, as some companies had "retired due to US threats".
Nevertheless, Turkey "will continue our relations with Iran particularly on this issue and on many other issues," said the Turkish President, who repeatedly criticised the US sanctions against Iran in the past.
The US has been pursuing a policy of "maximum pressure" against the Islamic Republic since its withdrawal from the international nuclear agreement with Iran. According to the US Iran secretly pursues a nuclear program and does not adhere to the agreement.
Their sanctions have led to the collapse of Iranian oil exports and a serious economic crisis in Iran. In recent months, tensions in the Gulf region have increased considerably.
US government wants to restrict the reception of refugees
The U.S. government wants to drastically restrict the reception of refugees. On Thursday, the U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that the annual ceiling of a resettlement programme should be reduced from 30,000 to 18,000 refugees, which is a cut of 40 percent.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that while the US would continue to see itself committed to supporting refugees, the most important task would be to protect and serve US citizens. Currently, the US immigration system was overburdened.
In the future, the US government wants to focus on the establishment of two refugee groups: people who are persecuted for their faith - and Iraqis who have helped the US military in the country and are thus in danger, as indicated by the Foreign Ministry's declaration. However, from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador, a maximum of 1500 refugees are to be admitted.
In the 1980 programme, refugees from UN camps are selected around the world and relocated to the United States. The ceiling of 18,000 refugees for the 2020 budget year would be the lowest in the history of the programme. Already the current ceiling of 30,000 is a lowest value. As the predecessor of US President Donald Trump, Barack Obama, left the White House, the number was almost 85.000.
Aid organizations reacted horribly to the announced lowering of the upper limit. "This is a very sad day for America," said the head of the International Rescue Committee, David Miliband. The US would continue to harm its leadership role in protecting the most vulnerable people in the world.
Trump is trying to restrict immigration into the US - legally and illegally - strictly. According to its own data, the US government expects 350,000 asylum applications for the next financial year. These figures are separate from the resettlement programme.
Donald Trump - "Getting close to a Spittl"
U.S. President Donald Trump has accused the whistleblower of spying in the whistleblower affair. Whoever has suspected the informant who accused him of abuse of power has "come close to a tip," said Trump according to a recording of a private event on Thursday in New York. This is reported by several U.S. media in agreement.
Trump therefore spoke to staff of the U.N. Mission. When asked about the person who informed the Whistleblower about controversial transactions in the White House, he replied, "That comes close to a tip." Then Trump added, "Do you know what we did in old times when we were smart? Right. The spies and betrayal, we used to deal with it a little differently than we do now."
The observers considered the latter remark to be a possible allusion to the death penalty. The Democrats strongly criticised Trump’s comments and accused him of intimidation of witnesses. Furthermore, it was an attempt to impede a congress inquiry into a possible withdrawal procedure against him, the chairmen of the Committees on Foreign Affairs, Secret Services and Supervisory at the House of Representatives wrote.
The Whistleblower accuses the president of having misused his office in order to ask another country to intervene in the US elections in 2020. In particular, it is his controversial phone call with his Ukrainian counterpart Wolodymyr Selenskyj in the summer: In the conversation Trump advised him to launch investigations against his possible democratic challenger Joe Biden and his son Hunter in Ukraine. Trump denies any misbehaviour.
It is still unclear who both the Whistleblower and its informants are. However, as the New York Times reports, the Whistleblower is supposed to be an analyst of the CIA's foreign secret service.
Refugee boat known: Baby and toddlers drown in Aegean
Time and again, people try to get across the Aegean Sea from Turkey to Greece. The often too small boats were regularly known. At the fall of a tugboat, seven migrants have now been killed – including five children.
Before the Greek island of Chios, seven migrants died at the fall of a tugboat. Among the victims of the death, there was also a baby and four other children, reported the Greek Coast Guard. Four children, three women and five men could thus be rescued from the floods from the occupation of a passing ferry.
The local news portal of Chios, Alithia.gr. The migrants had broken out of Turkey in the morning. They had tried to reach the small island group of Inousses in the northeast of the island of Chios. Inousses is located between Chios and the Turkish mainland.
So far, it is not known from which countries the migrants come. Currently, hundreds of migrants from Turkey transfer to the Greek islands in the east of the Aegean, mostly in much too small boats. Last year, according to the UNHCR report, 174 people were killed on this route.
The Who Cancels Concert
A U.S. concert of the rock band The Who has found an early end because of the inhumanity of lead singer Roger Daltrey. In the middle of the performance on Wednesday evening (local time) in Houston, his voice failed to serve. Daltrey told the audience at the eighth song, "I think I should let it go as long as it's still running".
Lead guitarist Pete Townsend apologized and added that Daltrey "can't really speak right now." Townsend promised to get to his expense at a restitution concert. However, an appointment is not yet fixed.
For Friday in Dallas and for Sunday in Denver, The Who said no. They are to be picked up at a later date. The 75-year-old Daltrey and his 74-year-old bandmate Townsend are the only remaining founding members. The British cult band formed 55 years ago.
Rental stopped abruptly: WeWork causes real estate markets to tremble
In New York, WeWork has risen to the largest office tenant.
Within a few years, WeWork is rising from small startup to driving power on the world’s most expensive real estate markets. But now the company is in crisis. Owners must fear billions of revenues.
The crisis of the office owner WeWork threatens to disrupt the balance in the largest real estate markets in the world. The company had recently divested founder Adam Neumann as manager, moved the planned stock exchange and started selling subsidiaries and values such as the private jet for executives to gain financial room for the coming weeks and months. In addition, among other things, the British "Financial Times", WeWork has stopped closing new rentals with immediate effect. This means that in New York and London, among other things, the largest tenant of office space suddenly reports off the market.
WeWork rents large office space in the long term and rents it in some small units to members in the short term. This can be individual freelancers, small startups or entire departments of large corporations. So far, WeWork is burning money with this business at breathtaking speed. Last year, the company incurred a loss of $1.6 billion, with sales of $1.8 billion. This year alone, rental costs are expected to have increased to an estimated $2.5 billion by renting new large areas. In order to limit the loss, the new business management is now supposed to have pulled the emergency brake and stopped renting new areas with immediate effect.
According to the Financial Times, WeWork has now concluded leases with maturity of up to 15 years, with commitments of over 40 billion dollars. These huge liabilities could not only become a problem for the company itself and its investors, but also for entire real estate markets.
According to calculations by economist Dan Alpert of the Cornell Law School in New York, WeWork in Manhattan, one of the most expensive real estate markets in the world, has rented almost 300,000 square meters of office space in the last 24 months. WeWork’s new contracts alone made sure that the demand for offices in New York was greater than the new areas on the market at this time. Without WeWork’s expansion, office teaching in the US metropolis would have increased at this time, as Alpert wrote in the “Business Insider”. Similarly, in London, where WeWork now operates several dozen offices in the best location.
Even in the British capital, the balance on the real estate market could shift without any further expansion of the aggressive startup. Among other things, WeWork is the main tenant, in a Deka office house purchased last year by Sparkasse fund provider for almost EUR 100 million in the center of the financial metropolis.
Many landlords have converted their properties to the requirements of WeWork with high investments. If WeWork fails to make its business model profitable soon, property owners would probably have to write off some of the expected billions of income. Access to the - anyway scarce - reserves of WeWork do not have them despite the long-term lease contracts. Because the rental of the individual locations of WeWork usually takes place through each of the extra-founded subsidiaries, so-called Special Purpose Vehicles, for which the parent company is only liable in close limits.
Russia again arrested numerous North Korean fishermen
The Russian Coast Guard has once again taken action against North Korean fishermen. In recent days, a total of 262 more wilders who had fished illegally in the waters have been arrested, according to the Interfax agency, the Russian Homeland Intelligence Agency (FSB) announced on Friday.
Only ten days ago, 161 fishermen from North Korea were arrested. Previously, the border guards had been shot and three of them were injured. This time there had been no casualties, it was said. Communist North Korea suffers from chronic food shortages.
The North Korean fishermen were therefore on the move in Russian territorial waters. Russia’s coastguards are on their own for the protection of their marine biological resources patrols. At the re-checks, 30,000 intensive fish were discovered. In addition, the data were confiscated after three fishing and two motorboats and taken to Nachodka and Posjet near Vladivostok. According to the agency Ria Novosibirsk, the coastguard found a total of over 8,000 infringements in 2018.
The Russian fishing authority had not issued fishing licences to the North Koreans even after complaints from local entrepreneurs. According to the media, thousands of fishermen from North Korea have been arrested there for some time in 2019.
The head of the association of Russian fishing companies in the Far Eastern region of Primorje, Georgi Martynow, also recently complained of high ecological damage caused by North Korean fishermen. They fished with tight synthetic nets banned in Russia. With them also small creatures would be taken out of the sea. In addition, the nets would simply be disposed of in the sea, where they needed 200 years to be destroyed. Even the ships themselves do not comply with hygiene and technical regulations.
According to Moscow, three members of the Russian Coast Guard had been injured during the arrests last week. According to the FSB, a similarly wounded North Korean died later from his injuries. On that 17th September, Russian border guards first arrested a North Korean boat and then a second after it opened the fire.
USA prohibits the entry of former President Castro
The U.S. government has banned the entry of former Cuban President Raúl Castro and his children. The U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs explained this in a communication on Thursday with Castro's participation in "gross human rights violations". As head of the Communist Party of the Caribbean state, he has a system in which thousands of Cubans are arbitrarily arrested and there are more than 100 political prisoners.
As Chairman of the Armed Forces, the brother of the dead leader of the revolution Fidel Castro was also involved in human rights violations there by the support of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. "The disregard of human rights and the use of violence by the Cuban regime to support the previous Maduro regime is responsible for the ongoing crises in Cuba and Venezuela," said U.S. Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo.
President Donald Trump had banned entry on Wednesday, among others, against members of the Venezuelan government and the military. In Venezuela, for months, there has been a bitter struggle for power between the government and the opposition. The United States has imposed a series of sanctions on Maduro’s government to force him to kneel and help the opposition leader and self-appointed interim president Juan Guaidó to power.
Cuba is considered one of the closest allies of Maduro. The Socialist Caribbean island receives oil from Venezuela in exchange for the services of sent doctors. According to the US and the Venezuelan opposition, Cuba has also sent numerous secret service agents to Venezuela to help the government in the repression of government opponents.
New Climate Protests by Fridays for Future
A week after the largest international climate protests so far, thousands of people want to go on the road again today for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement is again planning actions and rallies in dozens of countries around the world. Due to the shift in time, it is expected that New Zealand and Australia will start before the protests move across Europe to North America. There, climate activist Greta Thunberg wanted to attend a major conference in Montreal, Canada. Demonstrators also wanted to gather in front of the White House in Washington.
How great the worldwide appeal will be on this Friday after the record participation of the previous week, is relatively unclear. Thunberg himself was good things. "Last Friday over four million people have stretched out for the climate. This Friday we do it again!" she wrote on Twitter. So far, there have been 6383 actions in 170 countries during the strike week, she added.
Especially in Germany, last Friday’s attendance was very large. According to estimates of Fridays for Future, a good third of all worldwide demonstrators – around 1.4 million – participated in the protests in 575 German cities. According to a list of the movement, rallyings were planned in at least 65 cities. Among them in metropolises such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller municipalities and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland on Sylt, people want to go on the road for climate.
At the age of 15 in August 2018, Thunberg had stood before the Swedish Parliament to ask the politicians of her country to make a stronger commitment to climate protection. The Fridays-for-Future movement emerged within a short period of time. The climate protests mainly involve students and students, but increasingly also scientists and other adults.
Together, they demand more ambition from politics in the fight against global warming and the threat of climate catastrophe. According to the Paris Climate Agreement, global warming should be reduced to less than 1.5 degrees compared to pre-industrial times.
Thunberg had arrived in New York about a month ago after a two-week Transatlantic Tour with a high-sea racing yacht, where she had recently participated in United Nations climate protests and summits. On Monday, she gave an emotional speech to the UN, in which she spoke insistently to the heads of state and government of the earth. In her home Stockholm, on Wednesday, she was awarded the alternative Nobel Prize of the Right Livelihood Foundation for her commitment to climate protection.
Russia prohibits smoking on the balcony
People in Russia will no longer be allowed to smoke on the balcony. This is a change in fire protection. "This also applies to smoking," said a spokesman for the Ministry of Emergency on Thursday in Moscow, according to the Tass agency. The ban is due to enter into force on 1 October.
Whoever still smokes must therefore expect a fine of 3,000 rubles (42,46 euros). If the cigarette is to ignite a fire, the penalty will be higher. According to the Ministry, the ban also includes burning candles. Also, grilling meat spears on the balcony is no longer allowed.
Battle Against Cybercriminals - Investigators Eliminate Servers
In the fight against crime on the Internet, German investigators have for the first time selected a large server provider for illegal transactions in the Darknet.
A total of 13 perpetrators are suspected of hosting numerous websites via the internationally operating criminals as an operator of a data centre in a former NATO bunker in Traben-Trarbach on the Mosel.
This was announced by the Attorney General in Koblenz. Seven suspects were arrested on Thursday evening for a major action. Darknet is a shielded part of the Internet.
Customers of the suspects are said to have been among others the operators of the world's second largest darknet market place for drugs, "Wall Street Market", which investigators had broken down in spring. According to the Attorney General, the attack on 1.25 million Telekom routers at the end of November 2016 was also controlled via a server in the cyberbunker.
It was said that such a host had been removed in Germany for the first time. A webhost provides the infrastructure for an Internet presence.
The access action with the support of special units such as the GSG9 had included searches in Germany and in neighbouring countries. It had been the result of almost five years of investigations. In the afternoon the investigators want to inform about further details.
New global climate protests by Fridays for Future
A week after the largest international climate protests so far, thousands of people want to go on the streets again today for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement again planned actions and exhibitions in dozens of countries around the world.
In Germany, protests are planned in at least 65 cities, including in metropolises such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller municipalities and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland on Sylt. Climate activist Greta Thunberg wants to participate in a major conference in Montreal, Canada.
Climate protests ? Who are Thunberg's hindmen?
Justice and courage are high virtues, even in the 21st century, in a world full of war and smoke factories that warm the climate. All the more amazing is the fact that a 16-year-old girl keeps the power of this time in front of the mirror. But what is behind it? Is it helpful or clever marketing of a climate activist? Historical mastery or manipulative tactics for his own sake?
On the one hand, Greta Thunberg sets the masses in motion and brings young people up for a better climate-friendly world. Historically, it is not the first time in Europe that a young person manages to gain a collection of children and young people for himself. Already in 1212, a child named Nikolaus from Cologne felt chosen to work for a fairer world. At that time, he also gained a crowd of young people and persuaded them to cross the sea to get to the promised land, just like Greta Thunberg recently made his way to America with a sailboat.
But is there a shadow side to this? Why does it need a share called "We don't have time" to save the world? In addition, Greta Thunberg has rich PR managers on her side. By the way, her mother has published a book that has sold itself far-reaching thanks to the daughter in the spotlight. Also, old proven followers of Greta Thunberg were a little upset about the last PR show, or the trip by boat was probably too thick for some successors. This is also not unfounded, because the action came into effect very well in the media worldwide and there is a lot of money flowing thanks to the impressive action.
Here the spirits are now divorced: Is it morally right to enrich themselves financially when saving the world? Is it still authentic if certain groups of people work together with stockbrokers during the world rescue operation? No matter what position is ultimately taken in the process of getting a critical and reflective point of view is increasingly important in a democratically shaped society, because democracy lives from different opinions and discussions. Therefore, it can make sense to critically question even seemingly pious projects by certain trend-setters.
Comet discovered: Interstellar guest crosses through our solar system
A strange comet is crossing our solar system right now.
The assumptions of the astronomers have confirmed: a strange comet crosses our solar system at the moment - it is only the second of its kind.
Garching/Washington - Long the researchers have only suspected it, but now they have certainty: a comet from another star crosses our solar system at the moment. He was baptized after his discoverer 2I/Borisov and employs astronomers worldwide.
2I/Borisov: Comet discovered by amateur astronomers in Crimea
The said body was discovered by an amateur astronomer named Gennadi Borissov in Crimea. He looked at the sky with a self-built telescope and further follow-up confirmed his first suspicion. It is actually an unknown comet that does not come from our solar system. It is only the second of its kind that was seen during the flight.
The great opportunity for astronomers is now to catch insights into a strange solar system from close proximity. Apparently, the comet resembles that of our own system, as reported by the astrophysics Institute of the Canary Islands. According to the International Astronomical Union (IAC), the comet is clearly interstellar in origin and is currently moving on a so-called hyperbola train that takes it out of our system.
Comet has been sighted before the flight - and can be observed for several months
But before it is so far, the astronomers can closely observe it. Unlike its predecessor, 2I/ Borisov has already been sighted in its approach, which means that it can be explored from the earth for many months. "The object will reach the greatest brightness in mid-December and then be seen with medium-sized telescopes until April 2020," explains Davide Farnocchia from the US Space Agency Nasa. "After that, it will only be observed with larger, professional telescopes by October 2020."
The predecessor of the new visitor: 1I/2017 U1 "Oumuamua".
First insights into Comet 2I/Borisov raise hopes in science
According to the first findings, the comet is estimated at 2 to 16 kilometres in diameter. At the same time, the celestial body seems to be similar to our comets - because as IAC researcher Julia de León puts it, the spectrum of the tail is similar to ours. This observation suggests that comets in other solar systems could form themselves through similar processes as in ours, added de León's colleague Javier Licandro.
However, the observation goes beyond individual knowledge. The fact that two such objects have already been discovered within just two years may allow a new way to explore certain processes in other solar systems.
The researchers are constantly occupied by asteroids. It was only recently that a giant asteroid crashed past the earth and approached her dangerously.
"Absolutely reprehensible": Rachel Johnson horrified about brother
To Boris Johnson it becomes more lonely. First, his younger brother leaves the cabinet, now his sister conjures up the warring language of the Prime Minister as "no taste". It is not the brother she knows.
"Capitalization", "Fraud", contract": Prime Minister Boris Johnson is under pressure and is constantly getting up - at least verbally. During Question Time in the House of Commons this Wednesday, this was a massive outrage of the opposition, and in the meantime more critics have reported themselves: dozens of bishops and his own sister Rachel Johnson.
The well-known journalist and author told sender Sky News, her brother, to use words like capitulation, as if the opponents of an EU withdrawal were to be "hanged, pulled, quadrupled, tarred and feathered." She felt that this was extremely reprehensible. She did not recognize her brother's version again, said Rachel Johnsons, who had taken part in the elections to the EU Parliament for the anti-Brexit party "Change UK".
She particularly insisted that her brother Jo Cox mentioned, an EU-friendly House Member who had been murdered by a neonazi a few days before the 2016 resignation referendum. Their memory could best be honoured by passing through the Brexit, Boris Johnson had said in the House of Commons. "It is very tasteless to refer to a member who was murdered by someone who called 'Britain first'," now criticized Johnson's sister. The perpetrator had obviously come from the extreme right-wing camp, who felt strengthened "by this kind of language".
The widow of Cox, too, strongly criticized the Prime Minister. "It makes me sick when Jo's name is used like that," he tweeted. The best way to honor them is to stand up passionately and decisively for what one believes - no matter what one's opinion is. But never should one "damon the other side". He also complained that an atmosphere had arisen in which attacks had become more likely.
It was only a few weeks ago that Boris Johnson, younger brother Jo, had resigned his office as Secretary of State and his mandate as a Tory Member. "I have been torn between loyalty to family and national interest in recent months - it is an insoluble tension," Jo Johnson explained.
Johnson's language also met with strong criticism in the Church. As the "Times" reports, all 118 bishops and archbishops of the Church of England criticize the language that is "not worthy of this country". In a joint statement they said: "In the past days, the language, both in debates and outside Parliament, has not been acceptable. We should speak with respect."
Shakira and Jennifer Lopez perform at the Super Bowl
The NFL is a strong sign in the year of its 100-year existence: In the half-time show of the upcoming Super Bowl, two women perform with Latino roots, promising "an explosion of fun and energy".
Latina Power at the Super Bowl: The Superstars Shakira (42) and Jennifer Lopez (50) will deliver the mid-term show at the upcoming final of the U.S. Football League NFL. This was announced by the organizers on Thursday (local time).
"I feel incredibly honored and humble to represent the Latino community in addition to JLo, because it has an incredible strength in the United States," Shakira reported in a video.
The final of the American football league, which will celebrate its 100th birthday next year, will be held in Miami on February 2. Many people live in the metropolis at the southern tip of Florida with Latin American roots. Shakira ("Waka Waka") comes from Colombia, Lopez ("On the Floor") is Puerto Rican origin.
"I love the Super Bowl to stage two women this time - and two Latinas," said Lopez. This sends an important message to all Americans and the world. It promises for the show "an explosion of fun and energy".
The 50-year-old was born in New York after her parents emigrated from Puerto Rico. In the 2000s she landed great hits with songs like "Waiting For Tonight" or "Let's Get Loud" and later also published songs in Spanish. Lopez also works as an actress and is shown in the drama "Hustlers" in German cinemas from November.
Shakira became known in Colombia as a star of a telenovela and singer. She made her worldwide breakthrough in 2001 with her first bilingual album and the single "Whenever, Whereever".
The announcement of the half-time guests is expected with excitement in the United States every time. This year, many are also regarded as political gestures. Finally, the country is deeply divided, not least by President Donald Trump's immigration policy.
The Super Bowl is the largest U.S. sports event and at the same time a huge advertising spectacle. Musicians such as Justin Timberlake, Beyoncé, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Madonna, Bruno Mars and the Rolling Stones caused terror there. Usually, the NFL finals watch well over 100 million television viewers, it is now also very popular in Germany.
Last year, political controversy arose. The reason was the dispute over the quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who had refused to stand up against black police force in protesting the national anthem and had been harshly approached by US President Donald Trump, among other things. Out of solidarity with Kaepernick, some musicians had rejected a super-bowl performance - including Rihanna and Pink. The fact that the rock group Maroon 5 occurred was ultimately criticized by many.
An actor and Youtube adds to Egypt's ruler: For the time being, Mohamed Ali prefers to stay abroad.
The two men who influence the flow of blood on the streets of Egypt have both spent the past week abroad. One of them was once again at Cairo Airport on Friday. President Abdelfattah al-Sisi returned from the UN General Assembly. In 2013, the ex-general, who suspended Muslim brother Mohammed Mursi, the first freely elected head of state of the country, had spent a pleasant time in New York: U.S. President Donald Trump had praised Sisi’s action against political Islam and did not lose any silver on the human rights violations on the Nile – in a week when Egypt’s security forces arrested hundreds of people because they had dared to protest against the president. He had “no reason to worry,” said Sisi at the airport in the microphones of state television. “Egyptians do not allow themselves to go astray”.
Leading into error - according to the president of the other man, who is currently deciding what is happening on the streets. Mohamed Ali remained naturally abroad, where he evades the access of the security forces who would immediately arrest him if he tried to enter Egyptian soil. Weeks ago, the 45-year-old as an actor was only known to a minority of the Egyptians. Today, he is the tone-setting voice that dominates the political discourse in the cafés, living rooms and tearooms of the country: With his YouTube channel "Mohamed's Secrets" Ali calls his countrymen to rise against Sissi.
While the people are hungry, the president is enjoying luxury and building magnificent new palaces, it is said. The leadership of the army on which Sisi bases his rule presupposes corruption and enrichment. Because he worked as a construction contractor for 15 years with exactly these men's businesses, he seems to know exactly what he is talking about - at least that is the impression of many Egyptians, as the almost explosive click figures show.
After last week's arrest of thousands of civilians, prominent figures of civil society, human rights lawyers and opposition politicians, had been arrested since Sisi's arrest for power, Ali called for a "million march" for this Friday. It was unlikely that there would be so many people on the streets. But there were isolated minor protests, for example in Giseh near Cairo and in the place of China near Luxor. Videos in social media showed protests, whose participants accused Al-Sisi of corruption and demanded his resignation. In these protests, the police also used tear gas and rubber bullets. These videos were initially not independently verified. From security circles it was said that the police ended the protests.
From the city of Mansura in the Nile Delta, where demonstrators broke down banners last week with the portrait of the president, massive police presence was reported on Friday. Security forces built checkpoints in the city and on the downhill streets. In Cairo several subway stations in the city centre were closed for "maintenance work", most of the streets around the Tarir Square, the heart of the revolution of 2011, were blocked. And on the Rabaaa Square, where in 2013 supporters of the overthrown Muslim brother Mursi were sheltered until the army took them under fire and killed up to 800 people, another measure was to prevent discontention: Sisi's future party wanted to set aside a major proclamation for the president.
Mohamed Ali made these arrangements for a change in his tactics: "Our goal does not have to be the Tahrir Square," said Ali in Barcelona in his video camera. "Don't let us collide with police officers." But as a retreater, this is not to be understood: "All Egypt is the Tahrir Square".
If the provider promises too much performance
If the Internet connection seems to be much slower than the one applied for by the provider, there are several possibilities for testing.
If you conclude an Internet contract, you do not need to trust the supplier's speed data blindly. Customers can verify for themselves how much of it is actually achieved.
Finally, the transfer rates promised in advance are a contractual component and should therefore also be achieved, explains the Bayern Consumer Centre.
If the connection seems to be much slower than advertised by the provider, there are various testing possibilities. Thus, the measurement tools of the Federal Network Agency (BNetzA) measure the actual data transmission rates and compare them with the agreed rate in the contract.
"However, the tests of suppliers are carried out according to supplier-specific specifications and are therefore not uniformly and objectively calculated," says the Bayern Consumer Centre on its side.
If the connection is much slower than announced, customers can set a reasonable period of usually 14 days for the supplier to produce the promised service. This is best done in writing by registered mail.
If this does not happen even after multiple requests, customers can cancel and may also claim damages. However, if there is no success, only the lawsuit will help.
First senior Republican for investigation
As the first senior Republican, the Governor of Vermont has voted for an impeachment investigation against U.S. President Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important, yes, and where it leads from here, the facts are determined by the facts that are found," said Phil Scott at a press conference on Thursday. He wants to know more about the whistleblower affair before any action - an impeachment procedure can lead to the President's resignation - is taken.
Scott said he was not surprised by revelations that Trump had repeatedly asked Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj to investigate interventions by the democratic presidential candidate and former Vice-President Joe Biden in Ukraine, because Trump watched Biden "for years."
Republicans have so far held back with criticism of Trump because of the Whistleblower affair; few have expressed dissatisfaction with it. Scott’s comments are a first sign of this in Trump’s party. Scott, a moderate Republican, has already repeatedly opposed Trump’s policy, for example against the relaxation of environmental regulations and the tightening of immigration regulations.
Spider-Man remains in the MCU: Additional Marvel film planned
It was a shock for all Spider-Man fans: at the end of August, it was announced that Sony and Marvel would go separate ways in the future. Tom Holland’s Spider-Man would no longer be part of the "Avengers" universe. It was completely unclear how to continue with the films around Tom Holland.
Now the surprise: Spider-Man receives another final third film within the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) according to "Spider-Man: Homecoming" and "Spider-Man: Far From Home". This is what several US media report in agreement. The film is now scheduled to be launched in the USA from July 16, 2021.
In the magazine "Screenrant", Marvel-Boos Kevin Feige is quoted as saying: "I am pleased that Spider's path is continued in the MCU. I and everyone at the Marvel Studios are delighted that we can continue to work on it ... He is the only superhero with the ability to play in different universes, as Sony continues to work on his Spider-Verse. You never know what the future will bring."
But how does it get to the sudden good news? Apparently, Sony Marvel has made an offer. According to industry magazines, Disney, including Marvel, would participate with 30 percent in the revenue of future Spider-Man films. However, the news is not confirmed.
This is how Duke Meghan and Prince Harry appear in the "Suits" finale.
After nine seasons, the series "Suits" in the United States has now reached the big final. In the last episode, there have been many happy endings and as many Cameo appearances. And also the royal couple Prince Harry (35) and his Meghan (38), who participated in the series for many years, were given a charming tribute. Attention, the following sections contain spoilers to the series final.
One thing in advance: Herzog Meghan did not return for a last farewell as Rachel Zane, at least not for new scenes. Instead, some of the reflections showed again the most memorable scenes with today’s duchess. For example, the moments of the failed and the successful wedding with Mike or how she greeted him after his prison sentence.
But her real husband, Prince Harry, was also mentioned incidentally in the "Suits" finale, of course in a wedding scene. When Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman, 49) steps straight towards the altar to marry his fiancée Sheila (Rachael Harris, 51), Harvey Specter (Gabriel Macht, 47) makes a multifaceted remark about his suit. Whether he has actually thrown himself over a robe, the suspect Harvey wants to know about the bridegroom, only to note: "Louis, you are not the prince of England."
Aegean: Baby and four other children drown in boat accident
A baby and four other children drowned when a refugee boat was in the Aegean. In total, seven people died in the accident, as the Greek Coast Guard reported on Friday. Nationalities are still unclear.
The boat sank near the Greek island of Inousse, which lies between the island of Chios and the Turkish mainland. Four children, three women and five men could be saved.
Hundreds of migrants from Turkey are currently transferring to the Greek islands in the east of the Aegean. Last year, according to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNHCR), 174 people were killed on this route. Federal Minister of the Interior Horst Seehofer has now announced that he would like to visit both countries.
Together with his French colleague and the relevant EU Commissioner, he wanted to "inform Turkey about the situation of refugees", said Seehofer on Friday. Then he wanted to learn more about the "administrative problems of the Greeks" in Athens in order to help in dealing with them.
On Friday, a spokesperson of the European Commission confirmed the planned trip of Seehofer with Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos and France's Minister of Interior Christophe Castaner.
In Greece, an unusual number of migrants from Turkey still arrive. On Tuesday alone, 654 people transferred to the Greek islands, it was said by the Greek Ministry of Civil Protection on Wednesday.
Is the Turkey deal still working?
The increase in the number of refugees and migrants who illegally cross Turkey to the Greek islands in 2016 caused doubts about the functioning of the EU-Turkey Agreement. This foresees that the EU can send back all refugees and migrants who illegally cross Turkey to the Greek islands. In return, the EU wanted to take in an Syrian refugee from Turkey for every displaced Syrian.
However, the processing of asylum applications is difficult on the Greek side. According to the Ministry of Civil Protection, Lesbos, Chios, Samos, Leros and Kos have almost 29,400 people. The worst situation is on Lesbos: 5200 migrants are currently accommodated in a camp with capacity for 650 people.
Never since the entry into force of the EU-Turkey Refugee Pact in March 2016 have there been so many people," the Staatsrundfunk reported.
Climate change: Heat leads to more heart attacks
According to doctors, climate change will put the health system to the test in the future. Climate change is "very safe" one of the biggest challenges for the health system for the next 20 to 50 years," said Andreas Zeiher, President of the German Society for Cardiology. Especially the cardiovascular system made high temperatures and high temperature rises within a short period of time and led to more heart attacks. People with cardiovascular diseases, elderly people and diabetics are affected.
Green politician has to be responsible for embarrassing photo posters.
The head of the Canadian Greens, Elizabeth May, in the campaign - was the cup manipulated for this reason?
The Canadian Green Chief holds a multi-way cup in his hand on a photo. But now came out: The cup was manipulated.
Ottawa/Canada - It has remained unobserved for quite a long time - and finally it was noticed. Elizabeth May, the head of the Canadian Greens, never held in hand the reusable coffee cup with metal straw. On the party’s website she was on a photo to be seen with this cup, in conversation with citizens. However, the photo had already been published and also distributed to the media - and there was still a snowy (pop) cup, as the Canadian National Post reported.
Green Chief has to be responsible for photo shoots.
The National Post then accused May of manipulation and that the Fake News Party is producing news in order to appear more credible on the topic of "environmental protection", and this in the middle of an electoral campaign to the House of Commons, in which Trudeau is increasingly difficult because of a bribery scandal.
The photo went viral in the social media and started the discussion about Fake News. A user shares a comparison of the photos and writes: "The Greens manipulate a photo of their presidents to hide their disposable cup."
May showed himself shocked and claimed on her blog that she knew nothing about this action. To underline this, she immediately posted the original: she, in conversation with citizens, put a cup in her hand. However, she put it right, be made of bamboo. She always had it with him. A spokesperson of the party said that it was just about putting the party logo in the picture, and not hiding something. From the photo there is only one excerpt on the website.
May writes, it hurts her for the employee who did this. "I don't want to call him stupid, but there was nothing to hide," she says to the Guardian and at the same time asked some of her dedicated team: "If they want to edit a picture again, couldn't they do something with my face, so I look younger?"
The German Greens have also fallen for their use of disposable plastic or for flights in Shitstorms - but their pictures were not photoshopped. So the head of the Bavarian Greens, Katharina Schulze, ate ice cream with plastic spoons, as merkur.de* reported.
Influencer wants free upgrade: Lifelong flight ban at Cathay
It is said that Jaqueline Ng had been given an upgrade by mail from Cathay Pacific. But when she asked to check in, she was not allowed on board - and she should never be allowed to fly with Cathay again.
Spontaneous get an upgrade for the Business Class - many passengers dream of it. Sometimes they are lucky, and the check-in staff offer a free change from the Economy Class.
This case, however, shows how not to do it: A self-explained influencer has actively asked the airline Cathay Pacific for a free upgrade. On Instagram, Jaqueline Ng will follow more than 65,000 users. On May 30, she flew back from Taiwan to New York and on June 7th.
On the way back, the staff refused to upgrade Jaqueline, although she had presented an email in which her Cathay Pacific allegedly offered an upgrade. Writing wants to receive the influencer from an airline’s marketing staff. The airline, on the other hand, accuses Jaqueline of having faked the mail.
On the return flight, Jaqueline tried again to get an upgrade for the long-haul flight. This time, the woman was supposed to have shown the same mail, but with a different reference number. The employees at JFK airport were sceptical: they were sticking to the headquarters. And in fact, the employee from whom the mail was supposed to come was supposed to have disputed the mail contact with Jaqueline. This also confirmed the mail system in which the news did not show up.
The airline staff at the airport cancelled Jaquelines ticket and imposed a lifelong flight ban with Cathay Pacific. For $1,400 (about $1,280) she had to buy a new flight ticket to Taiwan.
In her case, the influencer turned to Elliot Advocacy, a company representing consumer interests, because Cathay had refunded her the price for her original ticket, but Jaqueline also demanded the cost of the new ticket.
But as long as Jaqueline does not submit the e-mail metadata, the case remains clear: for Cathay, the Influencer has committed fraud, it remains locked for future flights. The terms and conditions of the airline also state that they do not have to pay for the new flight. Jaqueline does not want to be satisfied with this – and now activates a lawyer.
Oil prices, according to the report on the ceasefire in Yemen,
Oil prices fell by more than one dollar in the shortest time on Friday afternoon. Last time, a barrel (159 liters) of the North Sea Brent 61.83 US dollar - about 1.4 percent less than the previous day. The price for a barrel of the American West Texas Intermediate (WTI) fell by 1.3 percent to 55.77 dollars.
The trigger for the slide was a report from the Wall Street Journal on a ceasefire in Yemen. Saudi Arabia is said to have agreed to a ceasefire in four areas.
In mid-September, a drone attack on the oil installations in Saudi Arabia had brought to a halt five percent of the world’s oil production. The Huthi rebels allied with Iran in the civil war country Yemen had denounced the attacks. Saudi Arabia, like the U.S. government, is responsible for Iran. A ceasefire would dampen the political tension in the region.
Should an agreement actually come about, one could focus on growth and demand concerns, said Ole Hansen, Head of the Department of Raw Materials Strategy at the Saxo Bank of Bloomberg News Agency.
The oil prices thus continue its downward movement over the past few days. A week ago, a barrel of WTI oil had still cost up to almost 59 dollars, Brent almost 65 dollars.
Most recently, Bloomberg, referring to Insider, reported that the repair work on oil plants in Saudi Arabia progressed faster than expected after the attack in mid-September. Thus, the production volume again reached a volume of eight million barrels per day and moved back towards the original quantity.
Recently, there were several press releases calling on Insider to report on rapid progress made by the state oil company Saudi Aramco in the repair work. However, raw materials experts pointed out that Saudi Aramco is currently trying to avoid a stock exchange plan and negative headlines.
At the same time, some relaxation was indicated in the conflict between Iran and Western countries: the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" is more than two months after Iran's arrest and the recent release on the way to leaving the port. The crew now prepared the departure while the ship was still ahead of anchor, Rederikef Erik Hånell informed the Swedish radio in a text message on Friday morning.
However, the United States announced that it would transfer missiles and soldiers to Saudi Arabia to the Iranian archenemy. Fear of an escalation between the Islamic Republic and countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom had temporarily increased oil prices significantly in recent weeks.
Accusations against Trump are exacerbating
In the affair of possible abuse of power by U.S. President Donald Trump, cover-up allegations against the White House have become loud. Several leading government officials would have tried hard to prevent access to the wording of the conversation after a disputed telephone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj at the end of July. That explained an anonymous informant. The spokesperson of the House of Representatives, the Democratic Nancy Pelosi, explicitly accused the White House of "disguising". Trump spoke of a "witch hunt".
North Korea considers the third summit of Trump and Kim to be questionable
North Korea has expressed doubts that it will soon come to a third summit of powerholders Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump in the nuclear dispute. The meaning and prospects of such a meeting are questionable because of the lack of progress in implementing agreements of the first summit in Singapore, said top diplomat Kim Kye-gwan on Friday, according to the KCNA agency.
The US had so far done nothing to implement the summit's decisions in the previous year, said the adviser of the North Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He also criticised intensified US sanctions and the joint military manoeuvres of the United States and South Korea. However, he hoped for a "wise" and "mighty" decision of Trump so that it would come back to an approximation.
Trump had said on Monday that he wanted to know what a third summit with Kim was supposed to bring before he agreed to do so. Negotiations on disarmament of the North Korean nuclear and missile program have been on the rise since the failed second summit of Trump and Kim in Hanoi in February. In June, both met in the de-military zone between the two Korean states. They agreed to revive the discussions, but so far without great success.
Prince Harry: Arms manufacturers are to help with mine clearance
In Angola, the British Prince Harry symbolically lit and destroyed a bomb mine. Near a camp of the British Halo Trust at the place of Dirico, he built the ignition circle. At a safe distance, the explosive body exploded. In view of the goal of getting Angola out of the mine by 2025, he later called in front of a running TV camera: "I call all the countries whose names are on these weapons, but who have not helped to get away from it."
Pound under pressure - interest rate reduction expected
British pound under pressure
In view of a rapid fall in interest rates, the pound is losing in value compared to the euro.
Frankfurt's speculations about the Bank of England's (BoE's) fall in interest rates add to the sterling pound. On Friday, the British currency was reduced by up to 0.4 percent to 1.2269 dollars.
The sales were triggered by statements made by the banker Michael Saunders. This led to a reduction in interest rates, even if a chaotic Brexit could be averted, as the uncertainty would affect the British economy at a foreseeable time. This statement was surprising, as Saunders considered himself an advocate of a restrictive monetary policy, said Analyst Ricardo Evangelista of Brokerhaus ActivTrades.
Last week, the Bank of England had already pointed out the burden on the economy of Brexit hack without directly signaling an interest rate reduction. Prime Minister Boris Johnson would like to lead his country from the EU, if necessary, without a divorce agreement on 31 October.
More: With his provocations, the British Prime Minister has taken a high risk. But it could pay off for him, says Handelsblatt editor Kerstin Leitel.
Doping: Other Russian manipulations demonstrated
Materials from the Moscow analysis laboratory are being manipulated - this confirms David Howman, former director of the World Anti-Tideoping Agency (Wada) and today's head of integrity of the world athletics association.
New details about the Doping scandal in Russia are emerging at the start of the athletics World Cup - and they are destroying the low credibility of what Russian sports had won back at the beginning of the year and even at the beginning of the year. In January 2019, the Moscow Doping Laboratory finally delivered the required samples from 2012 to 2015 to the World Antidipping Agency (Wada). Now it turned out that they were forged.
In December 2014, the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (Rusada) had been exposed to systematic fraud in Russian sport for three years. During this time, Russian athletes were not completely banned from the world stage. After an individual examination at the 2016 Summer Games in Rio, the International Olympic Committee had received around 270 athletes from the country under neutral flag. In February 2018, 168 Russian athletes were at the start. They were also allowed to participate in the World Cups in the various sports, and in summer, the football World Cup with the host took place.
Missing positive findings
The following September, the Wada picked up the Rusada banner again, but called for access to the lab and the said samples. The data should provide information on the extent of the cover-up of doping cases at the State Doping. They should help punish athletes afterwards. Three months later they were finally delivered.
However, the chairman of the independent integrity commission (AIU) of the athletics association (IAAF) has now confirmed that the doping data from the Moscow analysis laboratory has been manipulated. "Yes. We received the data nine months ago. We should check whether the task force has received the correct data," said David Howman in the interview of the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung" of Friday. "We have noted numerous discrepancies between the data that the Wada received from a whistleblower and those that they received from the Russians in January."
The World Cup is not affected
This confirms the attitude of the IAAF: The Athletics Association holds hold as the only organization at the banner of Russia. At the World Cup in Doha, 30 Russian athletes start under neutral flag. They had to prove that they are training outside the Russian system and are under test.
At the beginning of this week, the Wada manipulations had already taken place in the area and called on Russia to respond to the accusations within three weeks. Russia is now threatening the new block of Rusada and, in the worst case, the exclusion of the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo.
