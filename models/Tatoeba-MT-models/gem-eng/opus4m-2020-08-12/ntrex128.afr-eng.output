Members of the Welsh Assembly worried they're going to look like fools.
There is a lot of art among some members of the meeting about the proposal to change their title from AMs to MWPs (for Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This was caused by plans to change the name of the meeting to the Welsh Parliament.
Members from all over the political spectrum are afraid that it might provoke a mockery.
One member of the Workers' Party says his group is concerned because "it rhymes with Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means dumb and pwp means feces.
A member of the Plaid Cymru party said the group as a whole was "not happy" and suggested alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party says his group is "receptive" about the name change, but has noticed that it is a short speech leap from MWP to Muppet, the British equivalent of stupid or foolish.
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced as the Yorkshire-English pronunciation of the letter you.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the name changes, said: "The final decision on any descriptions of what members of the Assembly are called will, of course, be a matter for the members themselves."
The Act on the Government of Wales 2017 gave the Welsh meeting the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of public consultation on the proposals that received broad support to call the meeting a Welsh Parliament.
As far as the AM's title was concerned, the Welsh Parliament elected Members of WMPs, but the MWP option received most approval in a public consultation.
AM'e seems to be proposing alternatives, but the struggle for consensus can be a headache for the chairman, Elin Jones, who has to present a bill on the changes within weeks.
The reform legislation will also include other changes to the working methods of the meeting, including rules on disqualification of AMs and the design of the committee system.
AM'e will get the last say in the question of what they should be called when they debate the legislation.
Macedonians vote in referendum on change of country’s name
Voters will vote on Sunday whether to change their country's name to the "Republic of Northern Macedonia".
The referendum was arranged in an attempt to resolve a decade-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which itself has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has been demanding for some time that the name of its neighbour in the north represents a claim in its field and has repeatedly objected to its applications for membership in the EU and NATO.
The president of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the popular vote on the change of name, said that he would ignore the mood.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change of name is simply the price to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
The bells of Saint Martin's become silent because churches in Harlem are struggling
"Historyfully speaking, the old people I talked to were there a bar and a church at every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"Not one of the two is there today."
He says that the disappearance of bars is understandable.
"People socialize these days in other ways," he said.
"Crowds are no longer neighborhoods' family rooms where people regularly go."
As far as churches are concerned, he is concerned that the money from asset sales will not last as long as leaders expect, "and sooner or later they are back exactly where they started."
Churches, he adds, can be replaced by apartment buildings filled with condominiums of the type that will not help the neighborhood’s remaining refuges.
"The vast majority of people who buy units in these buildings will be white," he says, "and so the day these churches completely shut down will bring even closer, for most of the people who move into these condominiums will probably not become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis - Metropolitan Community in 1870, Saint Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist assembly moved away in the 1930s.
A black congregation that worshiped nearby took over the building’s title.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation led by Eerw. John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers in 125th Street, a main street for shopping in Harlem, who did not want to hire or promote black people.
A fire in 1939 badly damaged the building, but while Father Johnson's members were making plans to rebuild it, they ordered the carillon.
Eerw. David Johnson, father Johnson's son and successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the carillon "the poor people's bells."
The expert who played the carillon in July called it something else: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument."
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noticed that it was the first carlion in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who 18 years ago moved to the larger carlion at the Riverside Church.
Mr. Merriweather says that Saint Martin's has not replaced him.
What has been playing at St. Martin's for the past few months is a complex story of architects and contractors, some brought in by the laymen of the church, others by the Episcopal Diocese.
The church council, the church's governing body, which consists of lay leaders - wrote in July to the diocese with concern that the diocese "will try to pass on the cost" to the church council, even though the church council was not involved in the appointment of the architects and contractors who sent the diocese.
Some parishioners complain of a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark injures 13-year-olds on a lobster dive in California
A shark attacked a 13-year-old boy on Saturday and injured when he dived for lobster on the first day of the lobster season in California, said officers.
The attack took place shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was diving with friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy yelling for help and then rowing with a group to help him pull out of the water.
Hammel said he first thought it was just the excitement of a first lobster catch, but then he realized 'that he called, 'I'm bitten!
I'm bitten!'
His whole collarbone was torn open," saw Hammel when he reached the boy.
"I called out that everyone should come out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!' added Hammel.
The boy was flown to the Rady Children’s Hospital in San Diego, where his condition is described as critical.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
Lifesaver Captain Larry Giles said at a media briefing that a shark was spotted in the area a few weeks ago, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous species of shark.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries at the top of his upper body.
Officials have closed beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security reasons.
Giles notes that there are over 135 shark species in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's planning to expand to UK beauty market
Sainsbury's says Boots, SuperDrug and Debenhams fight with department store-type beauty corridors staffed by specialist assistants.
As part of a major expansion in the UK's £2.8 billion beauty market, which continues to grow as sales of fashion and household goods fall back, the larger beauty corridors in 11 shops across the country will be tested and if it is successful next year will be taken to more shops.
The investment in beauty takes place as supermarkets search for ways to fill shelves once used for TVs, microwaves and household goods.
Sainsbury's says it will double the size of its available beauty products to 3,000 products, which will include for the first time trade names such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also find more space with brand-specific areas similar to those seen in stores like Boots.
The supermarket also launches its Boutique makeup series again so that the majority of products are vegan-friendly - something that more younger buyers are demanding.
In addition, the perfume retailer, The Fragrance Shop will test concessions in two Sainsbury's shops, the first of which opened in Croydon in South London and a second one that will open later this year in Selly Oak in Birmingham.
Internet shopping and a shift to smaller amounts of food purchased daily at local convenience stores mean supermarkets need to do more to persuade people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, chief executive officer of Sainsbury's, said that the stores are going to look more like department stores when the supermarket chain tries to fight back with more services and non-food products against the outlets Aldi and Lidl.
Sainsbury's put Argos points of sale in hundreds of shops and also announced a number of Habitat points since it two years ago both bought these chains, which according to their grocery sales strengthened and made the purchases more profitable.
The supermarket's previous attempt to renew its beauty and pharmacy departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000's, but the relationship was terminated after an argument about how the profits from the pharmacies within his shops should be distributed.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's three years ago sold his 281-store pharmacy business for £125m to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain.
It says that Lloyds will play a role in the plan by offering an extensive range of luxurious skin care products, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's Trade Director, said, "We have transformed the appearance and feeling of our beauty walks to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be at hand to offer advice.
Our range of trade names are designed to meet every need and the appealing environment and convenient locations mean that we are now an extensive beauty destination that challenges the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones 'enraged' after Holly Willoughby withdraws £11 million agreement
Dragons Den-star Peter Jones ran away 'enraged' after TV operator Holly Willoughby withdrew her from a £11 million deal with his lifestyle brand business to focus on her contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for their home clothes and accessories trade name, True.
The couple's business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop trade name.
The This Morning Provider, 37, announced on Instagram that she was withdrawing.
Holly Willoughby left Dragon's Den-star Peter Jones furious by withdrawing at the last moment from their lucrative lifestyle trade business - to focus on her own huge contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say that Jones was "enraged" when TV's golden girl announced on Tuesday at a tense meeting in the headquarters of his business in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new opportunities - worth up to £1.5 million - meant that she could no longer spend enough time on their home clothes and accessories trading name, True.
The business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop trade name and would have doubled according to the inaugural Willoughby's estimated £11 million fortune.
While Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truey, Jones climbed a jet and traded Britain for one of his holiday homes.
A source says, "Truly was Holly's greatest priority far away.
It would be her long - term future that would carry her through the next few decades.
Her decision to withdraw her absolutely stunned all those involved.
No one could believe Tuesday what was happening, it was so close to the introduction.
There's a warehouse full of goods at Marlow headquarters that stands ready to be sold."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the This Morning provider, one of Britain's stars that brings in the most money, can drive the firm millions out of the bag as a result of the huge investment in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothes and household clothes, and the possibility that its introduction may encounter even more delays.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin has been close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby set up Truey with Capp in 2016 and joined Jones, 52, as chairman in March.
The couples have a vacation together and Jones owns a 40 percent share in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will become a trademark ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as a provider of ITV's I'm a Celebrity.
A source near Jones said last night, "We won't comment on his business."
Hard words 'and then we fall in love'
He laughed at criticism he was going to get from the news media because he made a remark that some would consider "unpresidential" and because he was so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in his kamma "newsreader voice".
"I gave up nothing."
He mentioned that Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump described their first meeting in June in Singapore as a major step towards the nuclear disarmament of North Korea.
But negotiations on nuclear disarmament burned down.
North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, said on Saturday, more than three months after the June summit in Singapore, to leaders at the UN General Assembly that the North does not see a "correspondent response" from the U.S. on North Korea's early disarmament activities.
Instead, he noted, the U.S. continues with sanctions aimed at maintaining the pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic turn in his convention talk.
"We're making excellent progress with North Korea," he said.
"We were about to start a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have this wonderful relationship."
He says that his efforts to improve relationships with Kim produced positive results — ending rocket tests, helping to free hostages, and causing the rest of American soldiers to be brought home.
And he defended his unusual approach to descriptions of relationships with Kim.
"It's so easy to be presidential, but instead of 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded arena, we'd have almost 200 people standing right there," said Trump as he pointed to the crowd right in front of him.
Tidal wave and earthquake in Indonesia devastated island, dead hundreds
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were said not to be needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population has been uprooted, no national disaster has been announced, a prerequisite for catalizing international aid.
"In many cases they were unfortunately very clear that they were not asking for international help, which makes it a little difficult," said I. Sumbung.
Although Save the Children is setting up a team to travel to Palu, it is not certain that foreign personnel can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, said that Indonesian officials are assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies will be allowed to contribute to the assistance effort.
Given the constant earthquake that Indonesia endures, the country remains sadly poorly prepared for the anger of nature.
While tsunamis were built in Aceh, it is not a common sight on other coastlines.
The apparent lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu had probably contributed to the loss of life, even though it was a warning of strength.
Traveling between Indonesia’s many islands is at its best challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo made the improvement of Indonesia's captivating infrastructure a core point of his election campaign and spent cumbersome money on roads and railways.
But Mr. Joko’s administration is being bullied by funding shortages as he faces reelection next year.
Mr. Joko also faces the pressure of sloping sectarian tension in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority accepted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands displaced like Christian and Muslim gangs with machetes, arrows and bows, and other primitive weapons fought on the streets.
Watch: Liverpool’s Daniel Sturridge kicks good equalizer against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge rescued Liverpool Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London from a Premierliga loss against Chelsea with a goal in the 89th minute.
Xherdan Shaqiri reported to Sturridge when he was about 30 years away from the Chelsea target and his team was back 1-0.
He typed the ball to the left before kicking far to the goalpost.
The effort sailed high above the frame as it soared to the top right corner of the net.
Finally, the ball over a jumping Kepa arrizabalag fell and fell into the net.
"It was just trying to get into that position, to get on the ball, and players like Shaq always play forward as far as possible, so I just tried to create for myself as much time as possible," said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante come and once typed and didn't think too much about it and just kicked."
Chelsea was 1-0 by mid-term before the Belgian star Eden Hazard entered a target in the 25th minute.
The Blues' goalmaker played back to Mateo Kovacic in that playroom before he moved near the middle field and entered the Liverpool half.
Kovacic quickly received and reported in the middle field.
With a beautiful head forward, he then led Hazard into the frame.
Hazard passed the defense and ended with a left-foot kick past Liverpool's Alisson Becker in the farthest net.
Liverpool fights Napoli on Wednesday at 3 p.m. in the group stage of the Champions League at Stadium San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea arrives in London on Thursday at 3 p.m. in the UEFA Europa League before Videoton.
Death to 832 after Indonesian tsunami
The number of deaths in Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami climbed to 832, said the country's disaster agency on Sunday early.
It was reported that many people were trapped among the garbage of buildings that caused the earthquake, which struck at a magnitude of 7.5 on Friday, and caused waves of up to 20 feet, the agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said to a news conference.
The city of Palu, with its more than 380,000 people, was littered with the ruins of collapsed buildings.
Police arrest man, 32, suspected of murder after women have been stabbed
A murder investigation was initiated after a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old was found at 7:55 a.m. in Grayson Mews in John Street with knife stitches, and a 32-year-old man was arrested under suspicion of murder.
The police urged people in the area who heard or saw anything to come forward.
Detective Brian O'Hagan said, 'The investigation is at an early stage but I appeal to anyone who was around John Street in Birkenhead who saw or heard anything suspicious, to contact us.
I also appeal to anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have caught anything on Dashcam film material, to contact us as they may have information that could be indispensable to our investigation.'
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkenhead and that she was found within a property.
This afternoon friends who believed they knew the woman came to the scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
Investigations continue, as the police said they were in the process of informing the victim’s loved ones.
A taxi driver who lived in Grayson Mews had just tried to return to his apartment but was told by the police that no one in or out of the building was allowed.
He was speechless when he discovered what had happened.
Residents are now said to take hours before they are reintroduced.
It was heard that a police officer told one man that the whole area was now being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared in tears on the scene.
She repeatedly said ‘it’s so horrible’.
At 2 p.m. there were two police cars inside the cordon with another wagon just outside.
A number of officers are left within the cordon to monitor the block apartments.
Anyone with information is asked to call @MerPolCC DM, 101 or anonymous Crime Stoppers at 0800 555 111 with log 247 of September 30.
Parliament's statute of Cromwell becomes the newest commemoration with 'rewrite of history'-dispute
His banishment will be poetic justice for his Talibanlike destruction of so many of England’s cultural and religious art objects carried out by his fanatic Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Association described Mr. Crick's proposal as "stupidity" and "an attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Association, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of statute that the form of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster would become a target.
The image storming of the English civil wars was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the deeds of his forefather Thomas in the last century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent depiction of Cromwell is evidence of 19th-century opinion and part of the history of a figure that many believe is still memorable.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, as defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case of course the monarchy.
Whether this is an entirely accurate representation is the subject of continued historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the middle 17th century gave shape to the later development of our nation, and that Cromwell is an individually recognizable figure representing one side of that separation.
His success as Protector is also worthy of celebration and commemoration."
Murder Pork Tears Chinese Boer
According to local media reports, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in southwestern China.
The man, who was only identified by his, "Yuan", was found dead with a torn-off artery covered with blood found near a cage at the market in Liupanshui in Guizhou Province, reported the South China Morning Post Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares on May 30, 2005, to inject pigs with vaccines at a pig farm in Xining of Qinghai Province, China.
According to reports, on Wednesday he traveled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan Province to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead and found a door to a neighboring pighouse open.
He said there was a large male pig in the cage with blood on his mouth.
According to the report, a forensic investigation confirmed that the 550-pound pig had bitten the farmer to death.
"My cousin's legs were bled and torn," said the cousin, who on the side of, "Wu," quoted the Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed how Yuan entered the market on Thursday at 4.40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man does not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening New that the pig was locked to prevent it from attacking anyone else, while the police gathered evidence on the scene.
Yuan’s family and the market authorities are said to negotiate compensation for his death.
Although strange, cases of attacking pigs have been reported before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts and left the man with critical injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 650-pound pig pinned a Welsh farmer against his tractor until his wife deterred the animal.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBS News that pigs are not usually aggressive but that the taste of blood can act as "faster".
"They're not playful.
They're picks, they're very curious... they're not interested in hurting you.
You just have to show them the right amount of respect," he said.
Traveling from Hurricane Rosa is going to bring widespread heavy rain to southwest U.S.
As foretold, Hurricane Rosa weakens as it moves over the cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring flood rains across northern Mexico and the southwest U.S. over the coming days.
Rosa had winds of 85 m.p.h. on Sunday from 5 a.m. east, a Category 1 hurricane, and was placed 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move northward on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a trough over the Pacific begins to form and move eastwards to the west coast of the US. As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula as a tropical storm, it will begin to drive heavy tropical humidity northwards the southwest US.
On Monday, Rosa will bring rain from up to 10 inches in parts of Mexico.
Then, in response to the approaching trough, tropical humidity will bring widespread heavy rainfall to the southwest over the coming days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous flash floods, wastewater, and possibly landslides in the desert.
Heavy tropical humidity will cause place-place rainfall rates of up to 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
As many as 2 to 4 inches of rain are expected in parts of the southwest, especially over most parts of Arizona.
Rapid floods are possible with rapidly deteriorating conditions because of the widespread nature of tropical rain.
It would be most unwise to venture into the desert on foot at the risk of tropical rainfall.
Heavy rain can cause deep chasms to touch wild rivers and bring thunderstorms to violent local winds and dust clouds.
The approaching trough will bring some local heavy rain to parts of the coastline of Southern California.
Rainfall totals of more than half an inch are possible, which can cause small waste streams and smooth lanes.
It will be the region’s first rainfall of the wet season.
Some scattered tropical rain showers will begin approaching Arizona late Sunday and early Monday before the rain increases its spread on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread on Tuesday to the Four Corners and will last until Wednesday.
October can see intense temperature fluctuations throughout the U.S. as the North Pole cools, but the tropics remain very hot.
This sometimes leads to dramatic temperature changes over short distances.
A good example of dramatic temperature differences across the central U.S. is on Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, lingering summer heat will try to rise and expand again.
It is expected that large parts of the central and eastern US will start hot October, with widespread 80s from the Southern Low Plain to parts of the northeast.
The city of New York can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above the average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a higher probability of above-average temperatures for the eastern US for the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watch Brett Kavanaugh hearing
More than 20 million people watched Thursday on six television networks the stirring testimony of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and Christians Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of a sexual assault allegedly taking place in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political dead end continued, with broadcasters interrupting regular programs for Friday's on-the-flip turn: an agreement reached by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation.
Ford told the Senate Judicial Committee that she was 100 percent sure Kavanaugh was getting her drunk and was trying to take her clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in a passionate testimony, said he was 100 percent certain that this had not happened.
It is likely that over 20.4 million people watched it on Friday, Nielsen reported.
The company counted average viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC.
Numbers were not immediately available to other networks that showed it, including PBS, C-SPAN and the Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen sometimes finds it difficult to measure people who look in offices.
To put it in perspective, it's an audience the size of one for a decisive football match or the Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose poll hosts strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, said Nielsen, with an average of 5.69 million viewers in the day-long trial.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, said Nielsen.
Interest was still high after the trial.
Flake was the central figure in Friday’s drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that he was going to vote in favour of Kavanaugh, he was caught on Friday morning at CNN and CBS where protesters shouted at him when he tried to take an elevator to a Judicial Committee.
He stood down with his eyes down for a few minutes while CNN was alive, imagining how he was being maligned.
"I'm standing right here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he'll tell the country the truth?
It was said to him, "You have power while so many women are powerless."
Flake said that his office had issued a statement and had gone in front of the elevator door, saying that he would have more to say at the committee hearing.
The cable and broadcasting networks covered later living hours when the Judicial Committee would vote to promote Kavanaugh's appointment to the full Senate for a vote.
But Flake said that he would only do it with the understanding that the FBI would look at the accusations against the candidate for the next week, like the Democratic minority has requested.
Flake was partly convinced by conversations with his friend, Demokraat Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators afterwards, Flake made his decision.
Flake’s choice was powerful because it was obvious that Republicans would not have the voices to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump set up an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British EM May accused critics of ‘political game’ about Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "political gambling" with Britain's future and subverting national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May will be presenting for the Concert Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain on September 29, 2018.
In another interview with her on the front page of the newspaper, her former minister of foreign affairs Boris Johnson continued his attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit and said that a proposal that Britain and the EU should collect each other's tariffs was "quite ridiculous."
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson in LSU player's death
The police arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and arrested on a second-degree murder charge, said the Baton Rouge Police Department.
Officials issued a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police said that Sims had lost his glasses during the quarrel.
The police found the spectacles on the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on it, reports CBS-enhanced WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, the police said he admitted that he had shot Wayde.
His bail was set at $350,000, reported the lawyer.
On Friday, East Baton Rouge Parish's judicial obituary issued a preliminary report saying that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head at the neck.
The department praises the Louisiana State Police's fugitive task force, the state police's crime lab, Southern University police, and territorial civilians for their help with the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanks regional law for his "zeal and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The six-foot predictor grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played for LSU basketball.
His average past season was 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "slagged" and "in shock" about Wayde's death.
"This is what you worry about all the time," said Wayde.
Volcano Spits as On Mexico City
As spitting out of the Popocatepeti volcano, the southern neighborhoods of Mexico's capital reached.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity had been picked up in the crater and registered 183 gas and ash releases in 24 hours.
The center monitored multiple swings and tremors.
Images on social media showed how thin low - gas car windshields in neighborhoods of Mexico City like Xochimilco were covered.
Geophysicists have noticed an increase in activity at the volcano, which has jerked 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital since an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.1 central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalonian separatists before commemoration of independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police, and thousands joined counter-protests to commemorate the first commemoration of Catalonia’s polarizing voice for restitution.
A group of masked pro-separatists who were held back by riot police, they struck with eggs and threw powder paint that caused dark dust clouds in streets that usually teem with tourists.
A riot also broke out later in the day and the police had to use their clubs to keep the fighting in check.
Over several hours, pro-independence groups sang in one tone "No Forget, No Forgiveness" in confrontation with the Unionists' cry of "Long Life Spain".
Fourteen people received treatment for minor injuries incurred in the processions, reported the local press.
The tension continues to run high in the independent region a year after the referendum of 1 October by Madrid was considered illegal but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
Voters voted overwhelmingly to become independent, but the participation was low, with those against renunciation who boycotted the voice for the most part.
According to the Catalan authorities, last year almost 1,000 people were injured after police attempted violent clashes to prevent voting at the polling stations across the region.
Pro-independence groups camped Friday night to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration continued but was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist demonstration with his wife, said he was no longer hopeful for the prospect of Catalonia gaining independence.
"Last year we went through one of the best moments.
I saw my parents crying for joy because they could vote but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite a vital but close-minded victory in regional elections last December, Catalan pro-dependence parties struggled this year to maintain momentum, with many of their best known leaders either in self-imposed exile or in detention for their role in organizing the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the demonstration in support of the police on his phone, says the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
"It gets more and more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalonian leaders in interrogation detention since last year, announced that he would be in European Parliament elections next year.
"To stand as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to counter the decline in democratic values and the oppression we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Husbands arrested after driving against home
Three men, 33, 34 and 39 years old, were arrested after a car repeatedly hit a house in Londonderry.
The incident unfolded Thursday at about 19:30 BST in Ballynagardsingel.
Detective Bob Blemmings said that damage had been done to the gates and the building itself.
A crossbow may also have been shot at the car at some point.
Menga goal gives Livingston 1-0 victory over Rangers
Dolly Menga’s First Purpose for Livingston Ensures Victory
Advanced Livigston amazed Rangers to transfer Steven Gerrard to only his second defeat in 18 matches as manager of the Ibrox Club.
Dolly Menga’s purpose was evidence of the difference when Gary Holt’s team moved with Hibernian to second.
Gerrard's team stayed this season in the Premiership without a win and came next week to face the forerunners Heart, who are ahead of them eight points.
Rangers are only host to Rapid Vienna in the Europaliga on Thursday.
In the meantime, Livingston is expanding their unconquered run in the division to six games, with principal coach Holt who has still not suffered defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston spills chances against bot visitors
Holt's team must have gone ahead long before they had recorded a purpose, with their round-breastedness which Rangers had brought all sorts of problems upon their necks.
SR broke through, but drooled in front of the goal gate, then AL could only play wide after he got closer and met CH's head hold across the goaltip.
The hosts were content to have Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could get the visitors with instants of death.
And thus came the decisive goal.
Rangers gave up a freehead and Livingston created an opportunity, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson who together gave Menga the chance to kick and from the middle of the frame a purpose to record.
By then, Rangers had dominated but could not penetrate the home defense, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was largely unconcerned.
That pattern was continued in the second half even though Alfredo Morelos forced a blow from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was denied by the feet of Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow typed wide to avoid any more open play of Livingston.
Crosses repeatedly reached and stopped Livingston’s frame, while two demands for punishment — after Halkett’s challenge of replacement Glenn Middleton and one for handball — were rejected.
Livingston’s ‘phenomenal’ – analysis
BBC Scotland’s Alasdair Lamont at the Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal game and results for Livingston.
Up to the last man was excellent; they still exceed expectations on this upward course.
Their game style and crew have remained almost unchanged since their return to first place, but much honor comes to Holt for the way he has strengthened the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Hackett was huge with his magnificent defense arrangement while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their toes all the time.
Rangers, however, lacked inspiration.
Just as they did at times under Gerrard, they were unable to maintain those standards.
Their final ball was missing and only once could they penetrate the home team, which is somewhat of a wake-up call for Rangers, which they found in middle division.
Erdogan gets mixed reception in Cologne
There were Saturday (September 29) smiles and blue sky when leaders from Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It's the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which was to restore relations between NATO allies.
They have had an outburst on issues that include human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city houses the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police quoted security reasons to prevent the 25,000-strong crowd from meeting before the mosque, but many supporters then arrived to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan demonstrators – many of their Kurds – have also thickened their voices, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
The fighting demonstrations reflect the division of a visitor who is greeted by some German Turks as a hero and who is carved out by others as autocrat.
Deptford Road Accident: Biker dies in collision with motor
A cyclist died in a collision in London involving a car.
The collision occurred about 10:15 BST near the junction of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford in southeast of the city.
The driver of the car stopped and paramedics were present, but the man died on the scene.
The collision came months after another cyclist died in a hit-and-step in Children's Street, about a mile from where Saturday's accident occurred.
The Metropolitan Police said that officials were working on identifying the man and informing his close relatives.
Roadblocks and bus bypasses were replaced, and motorists were advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six guards injured in riot
Six guards were injured in a riot at a high-security man's prison, the prison office said.
Riot broke out about 09:30 BST on Sunday and is still going on at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire.
Specialist "Tornado guards" were called in to handle the riot, which includes eight prisoners and is limited to one wing.
The guards were treated on the scene for minor facial injuries.
A prison spokesman said: "Specially trained prison staff have been deployed to pay attention to an ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six personnel were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and make it clear that those responsible will be referred to the police and can stay longer behind bars."
HMP Long Martin houses over 500 prisoners, including some of the country’s most dangerous offenders.
In June, it was reported that the chief of the prison was hospitalized after being attacked by a prisoner.
And last October, riot officials were called in to pay attention to serious disorder in which billiard - balled personnel were attacked.
Hurricane Rosa Threat Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City With Kit Floods (Drought Areas Draw Valley Advantage)
It's unusual for a tropical low pressure hit Arizona but that's exactly what can happen early next week if Hurricane Rosa's remaining energy moves across the southwestern desert and carries instant flood risks.
The National Resistance has already issued rapid - flood alerts for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California, and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will take a direct route over Phoenix on Tuesday, and by Monday it will be late with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noticed in a twite that only "ten tropical cyclones have retained tropical storm or depression status since 1950 within 200 miles of Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the AZ border."
The National Hurricane Center's models predict 2 to 4 inches of rainfall, with isolated quantities of up to 6 inches in the Mogollon border of Arizona.
Other parts of the U.S. southwest, including the central Rockies and the Great Come, are likely to get 1 to 2 inches, with isolated totals of possibly up to 4 inches.
For those outside the immediate flood risk, Rosa's rain is likely to be a blessing since the region is plagued by drought.
Although floods are a very serious issue, some of this rainfall is likely to be beneficial since the southwest is currently experiencing drought.
According to the U.S. Dryness Monitor, just over 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought, the second highest category," weather.com reported.
First, Hurricane Rosa’s path leads to the approach of land across the Baja California Peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, still at hurricane strength Sunday morning, with maximum winds of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and moves north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm encounters cooler waters in the Pacific, so her power is diminishing.
Thus, it is expected that she will reach the country on Monday in the afternoon or evening against tropical storm power in Mexico.
Rainfall over parts of Mexico can be heavy and pose a significant flood risk.
"Rain valtal totals of 3 to 6 inches are expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with up to 10 inches possible," weather.com reported.
Rosa will then move as a tropical storm north of Mexico before it reaches the Arizona border as a tropical depression on Tuesday in the early morning hours and will then move through Arizona and into southern Utah by late Tuesday evening.
"The greatest danger expected of Rosa is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwest Sonora and the U.S. southwest," said the National Hurricane Center.
This rain is expected to cause life - threatening floods and debris in the deserts and landslides in the mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenage boys a 20-year-old man was arrested under suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old with stab wounds was found in Somerset.
The injured teenage son was found on Saturday at about 04:00 BST in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton.
He was taken to the hospital where he was still in a "stable" condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, said Avon and Somerset Police.
Officers appealed to anyone who might have any cell phone footage of what happened to come out.
Trump says Kavanaugh that 'has suffered from the malice, the anger' of the Democratic Party
"A voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to reject the merciless and shocking tactics of the Democratic Party," said Trump at a convention in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh had "suffered from the malice, the anger" of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh witnessed Thursday before the Congress and strongly and emotionally denied a claim by Christine Blasey Ford that he had sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also witnessed about her claim during the trial.
The President said Saturday the Americans saw that day "the brilliant and quality and courage" of Kavanaugh.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to confirm one of the most capable legal spirits of our time, a jurisprudence with a pure record of public service," he told the crowd of West Virginia supporters.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's nomination as he spoke about the importance of Republican attendance at the mid-term elections.
"Five weeks away from one of the most important choices of our lifetime.
I'm not standing, but I'm actually standing," he said.
That's why I fight for these candidates everywhere."
Trump argued that the Democrat is on a mission to "resist and hinder."
The first important procedural vote on the Senate floor on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected not to take place later than Friday, said a senior GOP leadership assistant to CNN.
Hundreds of deaths from Indonesian quake, tsunami, with still rising figures
At least 384 people were dead and many washed away when huge waves broke on beaches when a great earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered on the beach on Friday in the city of Palu for a festival on the beach when surfers from up to six meters (18 feet) broke high at sunset on the beach, washed away many after their death and destroyed everything that was in the way.
The tsunami followed after a 7.5-degree earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still engaged in their activities on the beach and did not immediately run and they became victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's disaster relief agency BNP during an information session in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come on its own, it dragged cars, logs, houses together, it hit everything on the ground," Nugroho said and added that the tsunami had moved over the open sea at speeds of 800 km/h (497 m/h) before it hit the coast.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Air photos released by the disaster agency show many buildings and shops that were destroyed, bridges that were twisted and collapsed, and a mosque surrounded by water.
Aftershocks still shook the coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes are felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia’s Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) stated in a statement that the energy released by Friday’s giant quake was about 200 times the power of the atom bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geography of the city, sitting at the tip of a long, narrow bay, could have made the size of the tsunami worse, they said.
Nugroho described the damage as "significant" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers, and hotels collapsed.
Bodies of some victims were found trapped under the debris of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the accidents and damage could be greater along the coastline 300 km (190 km) north of Palu, an area called Donggala that is closer to the earthquake.
Communication "has been completely blocked with no information" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living there, said the Red Cross in a statement, and added that their staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected area.
"It's already a disaster, but it can get much worse," they said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for not telling that a tsunami hit Palu, although officials said that the waves had come at the time the warning was issued.
In amateur footage shared on social media, it can be heard a man on the top floor of a building shouting desperate warnings about the coming tsunami to the people at the bottom of the street.
Within minutes a wall of water meets the beach and sleigh buildings and cars with it.
Reuters could not immediately declare the image material authentic.
The quake and tsunami caused great power interruptions that cut off communication around Palu and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army began to send cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but evacuations still needed food and other basic necessities.
The city’s airport was reopened only for assistance efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was to visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
Indonesia-tsunami mortality rates rise above 800.
It is very bad.
Although World Vision's personnel from Donggala had arrived safely in Palu City, where workers were hiding in deck shelters set up in their office courtyard, they passed by scenes of devastation, said Mr. Dosheba.
They told me that they had seen many houses that had been destroyed," he said.
It is very bad.
Even as assistance groups begin with the terrible task of launching the disaster relief task, some people have complained that foreign assistance workers are being prevented from traveling to Palu with much experience.
According to Indonesian guidelines, funds, supplies, and staff from overseas can only come into operation after the area of the disaster has been declared a national disaster zone.
This has not yet happened.
"It's still a disaster at provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"As soon as the government says, "All right, it's a national disaster," we can open it up for international assistance, but it doesn't yet have a status."
With the arrival of the second evening on Palu to Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, friends and relatives of those still missing are hopeful that their loved ones will be the miracles that will bring relief to the sad storyline of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was taken out of a sewer pipe.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman for two days under rubble was stuck with her mother's corpse beside her.
Gendon Subandono, the trainer of the Indonesian national paratrooper, trained two of the missing paratroopers for the Asian Games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Still among those trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
"As a senior in the parachute field I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon tells how, in the hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel on social media circulated under paratrooper society, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the Palu participants who participated in the beach festival.
However, his messages were answered only with one gray mark, instead of two blue marks.
"I think that means the messages are not delivered," he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 while refueling OTM by Newport on the Life
Thieves stole Friday morning $26,750 from a Brink's worker who had refilled an OTM at Newport on the Life, according to a Newport Police Station news release.
The car driver was emptying an OTM in an entertainment complex and getting ready to deliver more money, detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press release.
While he was busy, another man "came running from behind the Brink's employee" and stole the bag money that had to be delivered.
According to the release, witnesses saw several suspects fleeing from the scene, but the police did not specify the number involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identities should contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West is going to change his name – to Ye
With the announcement of the change on Twitter Saturday, he wrote: "The being formerly known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for some time and has used the nickname as the title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to introduce his new ally Yandhi.
He replaced Ariana Grande on the program that canceled for "emotional reasons," said the program's manufacturer.
Besides the fact that it is an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has said in the past that the word has religious meaning for him.
"I believe 'time' is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," said West earlier this year when he discussed his album title with radio operator Big Boy.
"So I am you, I am us, it is us.
It went from Kanye, which means the only one, to only Ye – just the reflection of our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are."
He's one of a number of famous rappers who changed their names.
Sean Combs has been known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, or Diddy, but this year announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
A former West collaborator, Jay-Z, has also finished with or without a socket and capital letters.
Mexico’s AMLO promises not to use military force against civilians
Mexican newly elected President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised in the run-up to the country's 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students never to use military force against civilians.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza "never ever to use the military to control the Mexican people."
Soldiers shot on a peaceful demonstration in the plaza on October 2, 1968, where as many as 300 people died at a time when left-wing student movements established throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised to support young Mexicans by granting monthly grants to those studying and opening up more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and a lack of training opportunities moved youth to gangs.
U.S.A. needs to double AI funding
With China becoming more active in artificial intelligence, the US must double the amount it spends on research in this field, investor and AI practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after several parts of the U.S. government have made AI announcements, even though the U.S. is short of a complete formal AI strategy.
In the meantime, China announced its plan last year: they aim to be the No. 1 in AI innovation by 2030.
"Double the AI research budget will be a good start, given that all the other countries are so far behind the U.S. and we are looking for the next breakthrough in AI," said Lee.
The doubling of funding could double the chances that the next major AI performance would be achieved in the U.S., Lee said this week in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the HUB of Innovation Ventures, which invested in one of the most prominent AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that beat the highest-ranking American Othello player and later became a management officer at Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
Lee recognized previous technology competitions of the U.S. government, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's robotics challenge and asked when the next will be, to help identify the next visionary.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to win government seats, said Lee.
"It's not China that takes the academic leaders away; it's the corporates," said Lee.
In recent years, Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have appointed influential individuals from other universities to work at AI.
Lee says that immigration policy changes can also help to help the U.S. AI efforts.
"I think green cards should be offered automatically to PhDs in AI," he said.
China’s State Council issued its Next Generation Development Plan for Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
China’s National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people at academic institutions similar to the way the National Science Foundation and other government agencies distribute money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, said Lee.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a joint center for artificial intelligence aimed at involving partners from the industry and the academic world, and the White House announced the formation of a Committee of Appeals on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in AI research.
In the meantime, U.S. legislation aimed at creating a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has been under fire for months.
Macedonians must vote in election or change country’s name
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday about whether their names should be changed to "Republic of Northern Macedonia", action that would resolve a decade-old dispute with Greece that blocked its membership bottles for the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, insists that its northern neighbor's name represents a demand in the field and has refused their admission to NATO and the EU.
The two governments entered into an agreement in June, based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argued that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has cast doubt on whether the rise will meet the minimum 50 percent required for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum ballot letter read: "Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with acceptance of the agreement with Greece."
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, have argued that it is a price that can be paid to pursue admission for Macedonia, one of the countries that has emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia, to bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because it means safer lives for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although this is not legally binding, enough parliamentarians have said that they will accept the outcome of the vote to decide.
The name change will require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state election commission said that by 1 p.m., there were no reports of inconveniences.
But the rise was then only 16 percent, compared with 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 percent of the registered voters voted.
"I have come to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, an electorate in the capital Skopje.
Macedonia’s EM, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko cast their votes for the referendum in Macedonia on the change of the country’s name that will pave the way for the country to join NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
Before the Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small raise and drew chairs in front of tents set up by those going to the referendum boycott.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads up, not through the back door," said Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia to become part of the Euro-Asia integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership will bring much needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe the great majority will be in favour of it, for more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," said Zaev after he cast his vote.
He said a "yes" result would be "confirmation of our future."
A survey published by the Macedonian Policy Research Institute last Monday said that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum – less than the required amount.
Another survey, conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV, found that 57 percent of respondents were planning to vote Sunday.
Of them, 70 percent said that they would vote yes.
For the referendum to succeed, attendance must be 50 percent plus one voice.
A setback in the referendum will be the first serious setback for the policy of a pro-Western government since the government took over last May.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero navigates through Brighton Defense for Purpose
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling removed the Brighton defense in Manchester City's 2-0 win at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England on Saturday.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy during his 65th - minute goal.
The Argentine goalmaker received an indication at the beginning of the series at the midfield.
He chased between three Brighton defenders before he hit the open field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green shirts.
He pushed past one defenseman before he passed by several others on the edge of the Brighton Goal Lodge.
He then pushed a mark to the left, where he found Sterling.
The English predictor used his first contact in the cage to send the ball back to Aguero, who used his right foot to beat Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a kick to the right of the net.
"Aguero has trouble with his feet," said City Manager Pep Guardiola to journalists.
"We talked about him playing 55, 60 minutes.
That is what happened.
We are happy that he has recorded a purpose at that moment."
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League struggle.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
At that game, Aguero received the ball deep in the Brighton area.
He sent a beautiful ball along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane had some contacts before he led Sterling to the farthest point.
The Sky Blues predictor kicked the ball in the net just before he was over the backline.
City takel Hoffenheim in Kampioenliga Tuesday at 12:55 AM by Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play spoiler against Rockies
With the Nationals out of the playoffs, there's not much reason to force another start.
But the ever-competing Scerzer wants to start the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if there are still playoff implications for the Rockies, which have a one-off lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies got at least a promoter seat with a 5-2 win over the Nationals Friday night, but still wants to tie their first division title.
"Although we play for nothing, we can at least play the game knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team will probably play at the highest level of any point I will face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to participate in it?"
The Nationals still have to announce their starting player for Sunday, but is reportedly favorable to have Scherzer thrown into such a situation.
Scherzer, who will have his 34th start, had a throw-practice session on Thursday and will play on his normal rest-Sunday.
The Washington right-handed is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 turns in 220 2/3 turns this season.
Trump holds conventions in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation surrounding his Supreme Court election Brett Kavanaugh as he spoke about the importance of Republican attendance at the mid - term elections.
"Everything we've done is at stake in November.
Five weeks away from one of the most important elections in our lifetime.
It's one of the big, big – I'm not standing, but I'm actually standing and that's why I'm fighting for these candidates everywhere," he said.
Trump continued, "One sees this awful, terrible radical group of Democrats, one sees it happening now.
And they are now determined to take the power back by any means possible, one sees the meanness, the genius.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to walk over to gain power and control, that's what they want, power and strength, we're not going to give it to them."
Democrats, he said, are on a mission to "resist and hinder."
"And one sees it over the past four days," he said, and called the Democratic 'bad and mean and cunning and false'.
He referred in the name to Senate’s judicial committee’s high - ranking Diane Feinstein, who received hard calls from the audience.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, no, I'm waiting for one – it was really poor body language – the weakest body language I've ever seen."
Working party is no longer a broad church.
It is intolerant to those who say what they think
When Momentum's activists in my local party voted to put me under censorship, it wasn't exactly a surprise.
After all, I'm the last person in a string of Arbeiderparty LP's who was told that we're not welcome – all because we said what we think.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received similar treatments because she stood up fearlessly against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censorship criticized me for different from Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically enough similar issues that differed with previous leaders.
The notice for the Nottingham East Workers' Party meeting on Friday said that "we would like the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For most of my eight years as the local Labour Party LP, that was exactly what Friday morning's AR meetings were.
Unfortunately, it is not today the tone of many meetings and the promise of "more friendly, more gracious" politics has long since been forgotten, if it has ever begun.
It became increasingly evident that different views are not tolerated within the Workers ’ Party and that each opinion is judged on the basis of whether it is acceptable to the party’s leadership.
It began soon after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues with whom I thought I had previously shared similar political views began to expect me to make a U-turn and take positions that I would never otherwise agree with – whether on national security or on the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public – and it doesn't really matter what I say – there is a tyrade of abusive speech on social media that asks me not to be reelected, disapproval of politics from the core, and to tell me that I should not be in the Workers' Party.
And it is not just my experience.
Actually, I am happier than my colleagues because the comments directed at me tend to be political.
I have a great deal of respect for professionalism and determination for those colleagues who each day face a barrage of sexist or racist insults, but never shy away.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how the levels of insult normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Workers' Party should cultivate a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that broad church, and with every "motion of distrust" or change of selection rules, the party becomes narrower.
For the past two years, I have had a lot of advice that encourages me to stay under the radar, not to be so outspoken, and that I will then be "silent."
But I did not enter politics to do so.
Since I joined the Workers' Party 32 years ago, encouraged by the neglect of the Thatcher government, which literally dropped my state high school, I have tried to fight for better public services for those who need it most – whether as a local councilman or government minister.
I never hid my politics, including the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been at all confused about my political positions and areas where I differ from the current leadership.
To those who advocated the motion on Friday, I can only say that with the country heading towards a Brexit that is going to harm all households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader the Workers' Party.
But the one message I actually have is not to Nottingham Momentum, it's to my constituents, whether they're members of the Workers' Party or not: I'm proud to serve you and I promise that no amount of threats from not being re-elected or political advantage will hold me back from doing what I believe is in the best interest of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unconquered Ayr bo
Two late threes may have pulled the final result slightly wrong, but there's no doubt that Ayr deserved to win in this wonderfully entertaining Tennent's Premiership match of the day.
They are now at the top of the score, the only unconquered team of ten.
In the end, it was their excellent defense, as well as their better premises, that carried the home team, and coach Peter Murchie had every right to be satisfied.
"We have been tested so far in our contests and we are still unconquered, so I must be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "Honor to Ayr, they have taken their chances better than we have."
Grant Anderson's three in the 14th minute, intended by Frazier Climo, made Ayr front, but a yellow card for Scotland player Rory Hughes, who was made available for the contest by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to count the numbers and Jason Baggot signed an unintended three.
Climo enlarged Ayr's lead with a penalty head, just before he, just before rest, intended a solo three to make it 17-5 for Ayr.
But Melrose began the second half well, and Patrick Anderson’s three, intended by Baggot, reduced the backlog to five points.
There was a long pause for a serious injury at Ruaridh Knott which was carried off on a portable, and from the reboot Ayr enlarged the lead with a Stafford McDowall-three, intended by Clima.
Ayr's acting captain Blair Macpherson then got a yellow card and again Melrose took advantage of the extra player with an unintended three by Bruce Colvine, at the end of much pressure game.
The home team made a return and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card because he had taken Climo dead without the ball, and from the penalty line, MacPherson pushed the ball to death after the upcoming Ayr meal.
Climo intended it, and he too almost did from the reboot, after Kyle had obtained David Armstrong's goal and sent flank Gregor Henry away for the home team's fifth three.
Still Game-star seems to be embarking on a new career in restaurant business
It seems that the Still Game star will move to the hospitality industry after it has been discovered that he has been appointed as the director of a company of licensed restaurants.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC program, which he writes and plays with old comedy artist Greg Hemphil.
The duo announced that the next ninth season would be the last of the program, and Krun seems to be getting ready for life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Astridmorn Limited.
The actor didn't want to comment, although a source suggested at the Scottish Sun that Krunna wanted to get involved in Glasgow's "flourishing restaurant business."
'The sea is ours': country-bound Bolivia hopes court will reopen away to Pacific
Sailors patrol a masonry-covered fleet district in La Paz.
Public buildings fly a blue flag.
Fleet bases from Titicaca More to the Amazon are emblazoned with the slogan: "The sea is at right ours.
It's a duty to get it back."
Throughout the bordering Bolivia, the memory of the coastline that they lost to Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century is still fresh - nesting the need to sail the Pacific again.
That hope is probably the highest it was in decades, while Bolivia is waiting for a verdict by the international court on October 1st, after 5 years of talks.
"Bolivia has the momentum, the spirit of unity and peace, and obviously expects the outcome with a positive attitude." said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will look at the IGH verdict on large screens across the country, hoping that the Tribunal in The Hague will find in favour of Bolivia's claim that – after decades of sporadic negotiations – Chile is obliged to negotiate to give Bolivia a sovereign passage to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president – who next year faces a controversial struggle for re-election – also has many that depend on Monday's verdict.
"We are close to returning to the Pacific," he promised in late August.
However, some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court would decide in Bolivia’s favor — and that few would change if it did.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no power to assign Chilean territory, and has suggested that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the IRH's verdict comes only six months after the final remarks shows that the matter was "not complicated," says Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And rather than helping Bolivia’s case, it may have slowed down in the past four years.
"The issue of access to the sea was hijacked by the present Bolivian administration," said Zárate.
Morales ’ aggressive rhetoric tapped any remaining Chilean kindness, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will be resuming talks at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to have a close discussion.
The two countries last exchanged ambassadors in 1962.
Former president Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision - making was extremely quick.
Monday will bring Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "end 139 years of differences with reciprocal benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of Latin America's most popular presidents – used the maritime issue as a political crutch.
Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific," he added.
"The verdict is an opportunity to see what we need to overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't come unless they can trust the U.S.
North Korea's Foreign Affairs Minister, Ri Yong Ho, said his country would never disarm their nuclear weapons first if they couldn't trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He appealed to the United States to keep the promises made at a Singapore conference between the leaders of the competing countries.
His comments follow to U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo apparently on the brink of resuming nuclear diplomacy, which has reached a dead end, more than three months after Singapore with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it's a "dream image" that continued sanctions and U.S. caps to a statement that ended the Korean War will also bring the North to its knees.
Washington is careful to agree to the declaration without Pyongyang taking significant steps to disarm.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second hearing.
But there is widespread skepticism about whether Pyongyang is serious about relinquishing an arsenal that the country considers the only way to guarantee their safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump meeting.
Paris fashion shows reveal the latest series of major main covers on the way to the shops near you
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or completely turn the sun away, you do not have to search any further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne introduced a series of cowardly oversized headcovers at their SS19 collection on the running board that enchanted the style at Paris Fashionweek.
Extremely impractical hats permeated Instagram this summer, and these designers paraded their mind - boggling creations on the running board.
The gleaner by Valentino was an oversized beige hat with a feathery wide edge that swallowed the models' heads.
Other oversized accessories included water oranges decorated with jewelry, a magic hat and even a pineapple – but it is not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also introduced a series of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had finished lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creation looked like a scuba gear, with a snorkel and diving glasses included, while another looked like a melted ice-cream.
And if you continue the great fashion attitude, it is your happy day.
Stylers predict that the huge hats may be on the way to the shops near you.
The oversized hat follows briefly on the heels of 'La Bomba', the straw hat with a two foot wide edge seen on everyone's heads, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the highly impractical hat spread over social, sent another great creation over the walker board – a straw-strand bag that was almost the size of the swimwear model it wore.
The burnt orange raffia bag, finished with raffia frescoes and finished a white leather handle at the top, stood out at Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Modeweek.
Famous style Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: 'I expect to see big hats and beach bags in stores for the next summer – since the designer made such a big impact that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for oversized accessories.'
John Edward: Language Skills Essential to World Citizens
Scotland's independent schools have a zipping performance of academic excellence, and it continued in 2018 with another set of excellent exam results, which was only reinforced by individual and collective successes in sports, art, music and other community businesses.
With over 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best level of service to their students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen career, and their position as world citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a custom school curriculum, we see that world languages continue as a popular and desirable selection of courses in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to someone in a language he understands, it goes to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it goes to his heart."
It's a powerful reminder that we can't rely only on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From this year’s recent exam results, we can see that languages are at the top of the league tables with the highest success rates in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages achieved a higher degree A.
The data, collected from SCIS' 74 membership schools, showed that 72 percent of students received a higher degree A in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who studied German, 69 of those who studied French, and 63 of those who studied Spanish also received an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that children and young adults will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages now have the same prestige as the STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent schools and elsewhere.
A survey by the UK Professionals and Skills Commission found in 2014 that of the reasons that employees provide why they struggle to fill posts, 17 percent are attributed to a lack of language skills.
Thus, language skills are becoming increasingly important in preparing young people for their future careers.
With more likely jobs requiring languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Whatever career a person chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future with such a lifelong skill.
To be able to communicate directly with people from other countries, a multilingual person will automatically put over the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to conduct a conversation and French was the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage, 15 percent.
That is why it is now so important to invest in today’s children’s language teaching.
Knowing several languages, especially those of developing economies, will equip children with a better chance of getting meaningful work.
In Scotland each school will differ in the languages they teach.
A number of schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while other languages will teach that are considered essential for the UK when looking ahead to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be a number of languages to choose from in independent schools, with teaching staff who are specialists in this field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare and equip children with the skills needed to achieve success, no matter what the future holds.
It cannot be denied at this stage, in a global business environment, that languages are still extremely important for the country's future, and therefore they must be reflected in education.
Truly, modern languages should really be considered "international communication skills."
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity, and excellence to Scotland’s young people.
Il fout bien le faire.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will make a Sunday debut for San Diego Lakers
The guard is almost over for supporters to see LeBron James make his first start for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will be playing the Denver Nuggets in San Diego in Sunday's preseason opening match.
But just how many minutes he will play is still to be determined.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell has known that James is likely to play a limited amount of time.
After an exercise earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six matches in the preseason program.
"I don't need preseason matches at this stage in my career to get ready," he said.
Trump's West Virginia convention time, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is starting a wave of elections tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's Trump's first of five scheduled gatherings in the next week, including stops in friendly places including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the affirmation voice currently being held back for his choice to fill the vacancy in the Supreme Court, Trump plans to build support for the upcoming interelection because the Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when voting in November.
What time is Trump's gathering in West Virginia tonight and how do you look online at it?
Trump's meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, was scheduled for 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday 29 September 2018.
You can look below at Trump's contraction in West Virginia via live current.
Trump will probably pay attention to this week's hearings for the appointed Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, who became tense about accusations of sexual misconduct with an expected confirmation voice that was withheld for up to a week while the FBI investigates.
But the main point of this excess is to help the Republicans who face difficult elections in November.
President Trump's campaign thus said that these five gatherings were aimed at "visiting volunteers and supporters while Republicans tried to protect and enlarge the majority they had in the Senate and House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Control of Congress is so critical of its agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible when we reach the busy campaign season," a spokesman for the Trump campaign, who refused to call his name, told Reuters.
Tonight's gathering, arranged for the Westbanco arena in Wheeling, allows supporters to move from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and can be covered by the media in Pittsburgh," according to the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump will visit West Virginia, the state he won with more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the West Virginia Republican candidate for the Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who is at the back according to the voting patterns.
"It's not for Morrisey a good sign that the president should come to give him a boost at the polling booth," said Simon Hader, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Rider Cup 2018: The U.S. team shows that they have the courage to fight to keep the hope alive as they enter Sunday’s single game
After three one - sided sessions, the four - game teams of Saturday afternoon may have been just what this Ryder cup needed.
The swinging swing of momentum is a totally invented sport concept but one in which players wholeheartedly believe, and certainly in competitions like this.
Where, then, would they say that the momentum is now?
"They went ahead with six points and now it's four, so we carry it as a bit of momentum, I reckon," said Jordan Spieth when he ran away at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe has the advantage, four points before and twelve more being played.
The Americans, however, as Spieth says, feel that they have such a little wind in their sails and that there are many to encourage them, not least the class of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day long and each recorded three points in four.
Spieth was deadly from the top to the cleaners, leading by his example.
That scoring of celebration cries became louder as his round progressed and he sank a critical sethold to win the game four completely equal as he and Thomas were after two laps with two behind.
She setthou who won the contest for them at 15 was greeted with a similar shout, the sort that one tells one that he believes the American team has another chance.
"You really should just take everything out and worry about your own contest," said Spieth.
That is all that those players have left.
18 wells to stamp them.
The only players who have scored more than Spieth and Thomas in the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the unquestionable story of the Rider Cup.
Europe’s unpaired but charming couple got four out of four and can do nothing wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only few who didn't like track numbers on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided having one talk about track numbers on Saturday morning as well as during the back nine Friday mornings.
That run, and the way their energy seems to flow to and from this exuberant crowd, confirms that they are the players to be knocked on Sunday, and there will be no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari who can sound a potential European victory when the sun falls over Le Golf National.
Choose both at the same time or at different wells.
However, it is still too early to speak of European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made short runs with Sergio Garcia, the morning’s four - ball hero, when he played with Alex Noren.
One likes track numbers and two doubles on the front nine let the Spaniard and the Swede end up in a hole from which they could not even almost come.
On Sunday, however, there is no one to help you out of your hole.
The four-balls and four-game teams are so exciting to watch from close by because of the interaction between the pairs, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and the way a strategy can turn into an instant.
Europe has always played better as a team so far and has taken a significant lead on the last day, but this four-game session has also shown that the US team has the courage for the struggle that some, especially at home, have had doubts about.
Europe is 10-6 ahead during the last day of the Rider Cup
Europe will have a healthy advantage on the last day of the Rider Cup after they have come out of Saturday's four-ball and four-game games with a 10-6 lead.
The inspired duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the attack with two victories over a struggling Tiger Woods to take their count so far at Le Golf National to four points.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who tried to keep the trophies they lost two years ago at Hazeltine, dominated an American team that performed unevenly in the morning's four-balls, so they won the 3-1 series.
The U.S. had more resistance in the four - game field and won two games but did not shrink the backlog.
Jim Furijk’s team needed eight points from Sunday’s 12 single - game games to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European newcomer who won four points in a row while he and Molinari, who are called "Moliwood" after a sensational weekend, are just the second pair in the history of the Rider Cup who scored four points after their first four matches.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in the four-balls, they played excellently together to defeat a father Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambreau with an even more convincing 5/4.
Woods, who dragged himself through two games on Saturday, sometimes showed flashes of brilliance but he now lost 19 of his 29 games in four-balls and four-games and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who rested during the morning's four-balls, came back to play with Henrik Stenson in the four games to a 2-1 defeat for Dustin Johnson and Brooks Kupka - who is first and third in the world rankings.
However, Europe did not always get its way on a pleasant day with a little wind southwest of Paris.
Jordan Spieth who three times won a big tournament and Justin Thomas put the mark for the Americans on Saturday with two points.
They recorded a difficult 2 and 1 victory over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Paulter in the four-balls and later returned to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy with 3 and 4 in the four-games after losing the first two pits.
Just twice in the history of the Ryder Cup had a team recovered from a delay of four points when they entered the single game, though Furijk's team just had to play straight to keep the trophy because they're already holding it.
After being second best for two days, however, it does not seem that they will succeed in a counterattack on Sunday.
North Korea says they will 'certainly not' unilaterally disarm without confidence
North Korea’s Minister of Foreign Affairs told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions would exacerbate their mistrust of the United States and that the country would certainly not unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons without such qualities.
Ri Yong Ho told the world body's annual General Assembly that in the past year North Korea has taken "significant benevolence measures", such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, breaking down the nuclear testing ground and promising not to increase nuclear weapons and technology.
"We see, however, no corresponding response from the U.S.," he said.
"Without any confidence in the U.S. there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances we will certainly not unilaterally disarm ourselves first."
While Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "phased" approach to the removal of nuclear weapons by which North Korea would be rewarded if it took gradual steps, his words seemed significant in that it did not unilaterally reject the removal of nuclear weapons unconditionally as Pjongang did in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong-Oen and Donald Trump at the very first summit between a president of the U.S. and a North Korean leader on 12 June in Singapore when Kim undertook to work for the "destruction of nuclear weapons in the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea wants a formal end to the Korean War from 1950-53, but the United States said that Pjongang must first give up his nuclear weapons.
Washington also resisted requests to relax strict international sanctions against North Korea.
"The U.S. insists on the "destruction of nuclear weapons first" and exerts more pressure by tightening the level of sanctions to achieve their goal in a coercive way, and even objecting to the 'declaration of the end of the war," said Ri.
"The perception that sanctions can force us on our knees is a dream of the people who are ignorant of us.
But the problem is that the continuing sanctions make our mistrust worse."
Ri didn't say anything about plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader had brought to the attention of the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the Minister drew attention to three meetings during the past five months between Kim and the South Korean leader Moon Jae-in and added: "If the party were in this matter of nuclear destruction in South Korea and not in the US, the destruction of nuclear weapons in the Korean peninsula would not have reached such a dead end."
The tone of Ri's speech was still dramatically different from last year's, when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable that North Korea's rockets would be directed to the U.S. Landmass after "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim a "Fire Arrowman" on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who threatened to "completely destroy North Korea," commended Kim for his courage because he had taken steps to disarm, but he said that much work still needs to be done and that sanctions should remain there until North Korea destroys nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he didn't have a time frame for this, and said, "It doesn't matter if it takes two years, three years or five months."
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pjonyang for the steps they have taken.
But, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Thursday told the UN Security Council that: "Application of sanctions by the Security Council must continue zealously and without letup until we realize the complete, final, confirmed destruction of nuclear weapons."
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously intensified sanctions against North Korea in an effort to fund Pjongång's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met Ri on the outskirts of the UN General Assembly and afterward said he would visit Pjongang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo had already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip there did not go well.
He left Pjongång in July and said that progress had been made, but North Korea accused him of making "bandish demands" just hours later.
North Korea promised in a meeting with Moon to demolish a missile site and also take a core complex if the United States "consistent measures".
He said that Kim told him that the "consistent measures" he wanted to see were security guarantees that Trump had promised in Singapore as well as steps towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students are taking a course on enough rest.
A new course at Harvard University this year allows all his pre-graduate students to get more sleep in an effort to counteract the growing macho culture of studying by coffee-driven 'all-day sessions'.
An academic found that students at the world's top university are often ignorant when it comes to the basic principles of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleeping medicine at the Harvard Medical School and a specialist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believed was the first of his kind in the U.S.A.
He was inspired to start the course after he had given a talk about the effect of sleep deprivation on learning.
'At the end of it, one girl approached me and said, 'Why do they tell me this first, in my senior year?'
She said that no one had yet told her how important sleep is--which surprised me,' he said to The Telegraph.
The course, first offered that year, explains to students the basic principles of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, as well as how it improves their general well - being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at the Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said that the university decided to introduce the course after it was found that students were seriously deprived of sleep during the week.
The hour course involves some interactive tasks.
In one section there is a picture of a dormitory, where students on coffee cups, curtains, exercise shoes and books need to click to be told about the effect of coffee and light and how athletic performance is affected by sleep deprivation and the importance of a sleep time routine.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase risks of heart attacks, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the campus, with interactive icons, then encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
'We know it won't change students' behavior immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know--just as you have the right to know the health impact of choosing to smoke cigarettes,' added Prof. Czeisler.
The culture of pride in 'learning' still exists, he said, and added that modern technology and ever-increasing pressure on students meant that sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
To make sure you get enough sleep of good quality, a student's 'secret weapon' should be to avoid stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said--even to avoid gaining weight, because sleep deprivation puts the brain in a starvation mode, which makes you feel hungry all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to design the course after he took one of his classes last year, during his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to pursue a campus-wide course.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar study program before joining the institution where people compete with each other.
Prof Czeisler recommended that students consider setting an alarm for when they go to sleep, as well as when to wake up, and to be aware of the harmful effect of 'blue light' emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which may disturb your circadian rhythm and may cause you to struggle to touch the sheep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Purpose of Menga conquers Gerrard’s men
Rangers had another sarcasm of day-to-day pain when Dolly Menga's goalhead Steven Gerrard's incoherent team brought down 1-0.
The Ibrox team wanted to win their first as visitors since February's 4-1 win at St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team gave Gerrard only his second defeat in 18 games as manager so that his team was eight points behind Hearts, which ran loose in the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga struck seven minutes before rest, and it did not seem that a Rangers team would appear to play without much inspiration.
As Rangers now fall to the sixth position, Livingston climbs to the third and is just behind Hibernian on target.
And there could be further trouble for Rangers after border judge Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound after an object was apparently thrown away from the side.
Gerrand made eight changes to the team that stormed past Ayr after the final battle of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, used the same Livi-11 which last week took a point from Hearts and he would have been in his nostrils with the way his well-trained team had smothered their opponents at every turn.
Rangers may have dominated ball possession, but Livingston did more when they had the ball.
Actually, they should have scored after just two minutes when Menga’s first deposit was passed by Scott Pittman on Allan McGregor’s goal, but the middlefield player took his big chance.
A deep friar by Keaghan Jacobs then found Captain Craig Halkett but his defense partner Alan Lithgow could only kick mischief at the rear pole.
Rangers took control, but there seemed to be more hope than belief in their game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos felt that he must have been given a sentence at the quarter point when he and Steven Lawless collided, but the referee Steven Thomson dismissed the Colombian's requests.
Rangers managed to get only two shots to the target during the first half, but the former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was hardly bothered by Lassana Coulibaly's head and a tame target of Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi’s opener at the 34th minute may have been against the direction of play, no one can deny that they deserved it, even if it is only for their hard work.
Rangers once again did not handle a deep passage of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who stayed cool and sent it to Menga for a simple rounding.
Gerrard acted at the break when he traded Coulibaly for Ryan Kent and the exchange had an almost immediate impact when the wing sent to Morelos but pushed the impressive Kelly from his line to the block.
But Livingston continued to force the visitors to play exactly the kind of game they enjoyed, with Lithgow and Halkett palming long ball after long ball.
Holt’s team could have increased their lead in the final stages, but McGregor stood up well to stop Jacobs before Lithgow could come in wide from the corner.
Rangers' replacement Glenn Middleton had another late demand for a penalty head when he got confused with Jacobs, but Thomson looked away again.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our "Sunday Morning" calendar: September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, and WE REALLY FURTHER ... the day on which the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device called the Geiger counter.
Since then, the Geigerteller has been a pillar of science, and it has also become a pillar of pop culture, as in the 1950 movie "Bells of Coronado," in which those two unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans played:
Man: "What on earth is this?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put on these headsets, you can even hear the effects of the atoms emitted by the radioactivity in the minerals.
Evans, "Oh, my God, it's about to crack!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to 'see' predator cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to 'see' and kill predator cells
Antibody learns immune system to identify predator cells as part of treatment
Method involves removing immune cells from a patient, changing them in a laboratory.
They can then 'see' a protein that is common to many cancers and then inject it again.
A test substance shows promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
One woman who was treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to identify predatory cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for over 18 months.
The method involves withdrawing immune cells from a patient, changing them in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein found in many cancers called HER2 and then reinjecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said, "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "is driving the growth of several types of cancers," including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer, Prof. Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach to removing immune cells from patients and teaching them how to attack cancer cells worked to beat some kind of leukemia.
Kanye West began a pro-Trump mockery after his action on SNL, while he wore a MAGA hat.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was cast out in the studio during a Saturday night live after an extended act in which he praised the U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would be elected in 2020.
After singing his third song of the evening, called Ghost Town, during which he wore a Make America Greatpet, he sailed against the Democrats and repeated his support of Trump.
"I talk so often to a white man and they say, "How can you like Trump, he's a racist?"
Well, if I were concerned about racism, I would have moved out of America long ago," he said.
SNL began the show with a sketch of Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate's judicial committee on charges of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Even though it was not broadcast, the imagery of West’s bark was loaded on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is unclear whether Rock tried to mock West by putting it.
West also complained to the audience that what he carried on his head made it difficult for him behind the platform.
"They bullied me behind the stage.
They said, 'Don't go out with that hat on.'
They bullied me!
And then they say I'm in a low place," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West went before, "Do you want to see the low place?" and said that he would put on his "superman robe, because it means that you can't tell me what to do.
Try love."
His comment provoked at least twice a cheer-up from the audience and members of the SNL-roll division seemed embarrassed, Variety reported, with one person there who said to the publication, "The whole studio has become dead quiet."
West was brought in as a late substitute for singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, the rhyme chatterer Mac Miller had died a few days earlier.
West was very surprised by the performance of song I Love it, dressed like a perrier bottle.
West was supported by the head of the conservation group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who fought: "Thank you to one of the bravest spirits: THANK YOU TO BE AGAINST THE CITY."
But chatting program hostess Karen Hunter had known that West was simply "who he is and that's absolutely wonderful."
"But I chose NOT to reward someone (by buying his music or clothing or supporting his "art") who I believe accepts an ideology and preaches that endangers my community.
He is free.
We too," she added.
Before the show, the rhyme chatter announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and said that he was now "the creature known earlier as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and P Diddy.
Co-space chatter, Snoop Dogg, had the name Snoop Lion and, of course, late music legend Prince changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist previously known as Prince.

The charge will be reviewed by the public prosecutor.
Game of Thrones-star Kit Harington criticizes toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his sword - swinging role as Jon Snow in HBO’s violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
However, the actor, 31, criticized the stereotype of the macho hero and said that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel that they have to be tough to be respected.
Kit talked to The Sunday Times Culture and said he believed 'something went wrong' and asked how to tackle the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo-era.
Kit, who recently married his co-star from Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he felt 'reasonably strong' about working on this issue.
'I personally feel quite strong about it at the moment--where have we gone wrong with masculinity?' he said.
'What did our men learn as they grew up with regard to the problem we now see?'
Kit believes that television may well be responsible for the growth of toxic masculinity because of its extremely male characters.
He continued, "What is inborn and what is taught?
What is taught on TV and in the streets that makes young boys feel that they should have this certain aspect of being a man?
I think it's really one of the big questions in our time--how do we change it?
Because something was obviously going wrong with our young men.'
in the interview he also admitted that he would not participate in any of the Game of Thrones' sequels and sequels when the series next summer came to an end, for he said he was 'ready with battlefields and horses'.
From November, Kit will play in a new version of Sam Shephard's True West, which is the story of a filmmaker and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he thought that the best thing that came out of Game of Thrones was to meet his wife Rose.
'I met my wife on this program, so it gave me my future family, and my life from here on,' he said.
Rose played Ygrite, the love of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on the site of Leslie’s family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China announced a 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people in the country are affected, health officials.
Some 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases were transmitted by sex, representing a change of the past.
Traditionally, HIV spreads rapidly through some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who have contracted HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
Year after year, the number of people living in China with HIV and AIDS has increased by 100,000.
HIV transmission through sex is a critical issue in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalised in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still very common.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of the diseases come from insufficient sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, China’s government has promised universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to address the issue.
Maxine Waters denies that a staff member leaked GOP senators' data, condemns 'hazardous lies' and 'conspiracy theories'
U.S. Republican Maxine Waters ran out on Saturday against claims that a member of her staff placed the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on the legislators' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrats claimed that the charges were driven by "ultraright" experts and Web sites.
"Lies, lies, and still horrible lies," said Waters in a statement on Twitter.
The leaked information reportedly included the home addresses and phone numbers for U.S. Sens. Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared on Thursday online, placed by an unknown person on the Capitol Hill during the Senate Panel hearing on the allegations of sexual misconduct against the nominee for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred sometime after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the sites is related to Waters' office and has disclosed the information of a member of Waters' staff, Hill reported.
"This unfounded claim is totally false and an absolute lie," continued the Waters.
"The member of my staff--whose identity, personal information and security were compromised by this deceptive and false claim--was by no means responsible for leaking this information.
This unfounded claim is totally untrue and an absolute lie."
Waters' statement soon triggered online criticism, including from former White House press representative Ari Fleischer.
"This denial testifies to anger," wrote Fleischer.
"It suggests that she did not have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When a person is accused of something he has not done, he should not be angry.
He should not be challenging.
He should not question the motives of the prosecutor.
He must be calm and calm."
Fleischer apparently compared Waters ’ reaction to the Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of seemingly being too angry during Thursday’s trial.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who tried to highlight Waters in the middle selection from the pillows, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Great as it is true," he muttered.
In her statement, Waters said that her office "informed the appropriate authorities and law enforcement entities of these fraudulent claims.
"We will make sure that the nurses are exposed," she continued, "and that they will be legally accountable for everything they do that is destructive and dangerous to every member of my staff."
Johnny English Strikes Again review - flea Rowan Atkinson spying
It's now traditional to look for Brexit in any new movie with a British feature and it seems to apply to this resurgence of Johnny English action comedy ranches - which started with Johnny English back in 2003 and struggled further with Johnny English Reborn in 2011.
Will tongue-in-the-little self-athires be on the subject of how obvious power we are the nation's new experiential event?
In any case, the rude Johnny English with his bulwarks and rubber face had his license to rescind everything for the second time--and his name is a clearer indication than anything else that he is a great comical creation for non-English speaking movie audiences.
Of course, he is the ridiculous secret agent who, despite his bizarre pretension to sophisticated elegance, contributed a bit of Clouseau, a piece of Mr. Bean and a good shot from that guy who contributed a single note to the Charios of Fire theme song at the opening ceremony of the London Olympics in 2012.
He is also originally based on the traveler and international man of puzzles, who leaves chaos behind him, who Atkinson once played in the now forgotten Barclaycard advertisements.
There are one or two nice moments in this latest version of YOU.
I liked Johnny English who came running to a helicopter while he was dressed in a medieval armored suit and cut the screw blades short against his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is shown but the humor feels rather faint and strangely superfluous, especially when the "serious" movie brands such as 007 and Mission Impossible use comedy with self-confidence as an ingredient.
The humor seems to be aimed at children rather than adults, and to me Johnny English’s adversities are not as original and focused as Atkinson’s silent movie jokes in the persona of Bean.
The eternal thematic assumption now is that Great Britain is in serious trouble.
A cybercracker infiltrated Britain's super-secret network of spies and revealed the identity of all Britain's agents in the field, to the dismay of the agent on duty - a regrettable little role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last straw for a prime minister who is a puffed-up and besieged character, who is already experiencing a total collapse of political unpopularity: Emma Thomspson is doing her utmost with this quasi-teresa May character but there is little in the text to work with.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that since every active spy is at risk, she should call someone out of retirement.
And that means the struggling Johnny English himself, now employed as a teacher at some fancy institution, but that from the record gives lessons about how to be a secret agent, there are some nice jokes here when English offers a School of Rock-type spy school.
English is recalled to Whitehall for an emergency mission and is reunited with his former long-suffering companion Bough, again interpreted by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, married to a submarine commander, an allamapstieks role in which too little is expected of Vicki Pepperdine.
Thus the Batman and Robin are completely out of service in Her Majesty's secret service and arrive at Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatal Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls under the dangerous spell of the charismatic technology billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain’s computer problems: the mysterious Jason Volta, interpreted by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their journey of ridiculous escapades: disguised as waiters they set fire to a French restaurant, causing chaos when they smuggle themselves on board Volta's luxury seal hunt; and English unleashes pure anarchy when he tries to use a virtual reality headpiece to become familiar with the inside of Volta's house.
For that last scene nothing is spared, but as cute and exuberant as it may be, the whole affair is quite a lot like children's TV.
Fairly mediocre.
And like the other Johnny English movies, I couldn't stop myself from thinking: can't the British give Rowan Atkinson a role that really gets his talent right?
Work denies that it's a plan for the British to work a four-day week but be paid for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party must consider a drastic plan that will cause British to work a four-day week--but be paid for five days.
The party claims that company base savings caused by the artificial intelligence (CI) revolution should be transferred to workers by giving up their extra day.
It'll make workers enjoy a three-day weekend--but they'll still take the same payment home.
Sources say that it would be 'pass' to the party's economic agenda and plans to set the country in favor of the workers.
To change to a four-day week was signed by the Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior employee party source told The Sunday Times: 'A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
'It won't happen overnight, but a four-day work week is an ambition that fits into the party's approach to rebalancing the economy in favour of the worker as well as into the party's overall industrial strategy.
The Workers' Party will not be the first to endorse such an idea, with the Green Party promising a four-day work week during its 2017 general election campaign.
At present, however, the ambition is not supported by the entire Workers ’ Party.
A spokesperson of the Workers' Party said, 'A four-day work week is not party policy and is not considered by the party.'
Shadow Minister John McDonnell used last week's Labour Conference to elaborate on his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from 'faceless directors' and 'winners' to service companies.
The shadow minister's plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not get their entire investment back since an employee government can make 'deductions' on the basis of alleged wrongdoing.
He also confirmed plans to place workers on company directors and create inclusive ownership funds to give 10 percent of equity in private - sector businesses to employees, who can receive annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy tells "60 Minutes" whether the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh can change their mind
The FBI's investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed a final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court by at least a week and raised the question whether the Bureau's findings could convince any Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview that was broadcast on Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley for Republican sensibilities asked John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could deepen anything that could change their opinion.
Kennedy seemed more receptive than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said at the beginning of the trial, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it had happened, and that accusation came out, and said, 'Have you done this?'
He was determined, indeed, unambiguous."
Graham’s voice, however, appears to be unchangeable.
"I have formed my opinion on Brett Kavanaugh and it will take an accusation of dynamite," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know it: Brett has zealously denied it," continued Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone she calls couldn't confirm it.
It's 36 years old.
I don't see anything new changing."
What is the World Civil Festival, and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the World Civil Festival, an annual musical event that has a particularly impressive group of stars that act and have an equally impressive purpose; the end of poverty in the world.
The World Civil Festival is now in its seventh year, and during the festival tens of thousands of people will flock to Central Park’s Great Lawn to enjoy not only actions by Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes but also to raise awareness of the opportunity’s true goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Civil Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the World Poverty Project, an international interlocutory group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you are willing to pay for a GDP card), concertgoers had to perform a series of tasks, or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an e-mail to a world leader, making a phone call, or any other significant way to raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But just how successful was World citizen with 12 years of age who was left to accomplish his goal?
Is it the idea to reward people with a free concert, a good way to convince people to demand a call for action, or is it just another case of so-called "kliktivisime" -- people who feel that they make a real difference by signing an online petition or sending a twist?
Since 2011, World citizen says that it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" of its supporters, which support a multitude of different goals.
It says that these actions helped encourage world leaders to announce commitments and policies equal to over $37 billion that could potentially affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group mentioned 390 commitments and announcements resulting from its actions, of which at least $10 billion had already been paid out or collected.
The group estimates that the confirmed money has had a direct impact so far on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the most important commitments include the Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and implementers committed to "helping children reach their full potential", and promises to give $35 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 billion from world citizens.
"With the support of the government of the UK, donors, national governments and world citizens just like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition become a footnote in history," said the Power of Nutrition ambassador Tracey Ullman to the crowd in April 2018 during a concert in London.
The group also said that, after more than 5,000 actions to approach the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the common questions on his website that asks, "What makes you think that our extreme poverty can end?"
Worldburger replied, "It will be a long and hard way--sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-separation movements in front of us, we will succeed, because together we have more strength.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the artists who perform on this year's occasion in New York, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S.A. can use fleet for "blockades" to prevent Russian energy exports - minister of internal affairs
"If necessary," Washington could leave on his fleet to prevent Russian energy from entering the market, including in the Middle East, the U.S. Secretary of State for Internal Affairs Ryan Zinke revealed, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinc claimed Russia's involvement in Syria--especially where it works at the invitation of the legitimate government--is a pretext to investigate new energy markets.
"I believe the reason they're in the Middle East is because they want to act as brokers for energy just like in Eastern Europe, south of Europe," he said.
And, according to an officer, there are ways and means to deal with them.
"The United States has the ability, with our Navy, to ensure that the seaways are open, and if necessary, to block, to make sure their energy does not end up on the market," he said.
Zinc addressed the attenders of an opportunity offered by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a group without profit that considers themselves to be the "voice of the energy consumer" in the U.S.A.
He continued to compare Washington’s approaches to handling Russia and Iran and noted that this was practical.
"The economic option on Iran and Russia is, more or less, to finance and replace fuel," he said while referring to Russia as a "single talent" with an economy dependent on fossil fuel.
The verdicts come as Trump administration was on a mission to give a boost to Russia, by far the cheaper option for European consumers, to export their liquid natural gas to Europe.
For that reason, the Trump administration's officers, including America's president Donald Trump himself, tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, makes Berlin's "convicts".
Moscow repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2-pipeline, which will double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a pure economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's fiery opposition to the project is driven solely by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers," said Russian Minister of Energy, Alexander Novak, after a meeting with America's Secretary of Energy, Rick Perry, in Moscow in September.
The U.S. view elicited counterreaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading organization for industry, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has appealed to the US to stay away from EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), after a recent meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "consider it seriously" to stand as president in 2020, said the Senator of Massachusetts
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would "consider it seriously" to stand as president after the mid-term elections.
At a village meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider standing.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and correct our broken government and it includes a woman at the highest sport," she said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6th, I will seriously consider standing for President."
Warren gave her opinion on President Donald Trump during the town meeting and said "he's taking the country in the wrong direction.
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren was very vocal in her criticism of Trump and his nomination of Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court.
In a second Friday, Warren said, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote."
A survey released on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's own voters do not think she should be in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of "probably" Massachusetts voters said the senator didn't stand up, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe survey.
Thirty-two percent supported the idea that she should stand.
The survey showed more support for the idea that former Governor Deval Patrick must stand, with 38 percent who supported the idea that he should have been potentially supportive and 48 against it.
Other high-profile democratic names discussed to stand up in 2020 include former vice president Joe Biden and Vermont's senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision in January, reported the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin calls Track Palin's PTSD at Donald Trump Convention
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after he joined in September.
He was arrested on Monday night and charged with an incident of domestic violence.
"What my own son is going through, which he goes through since he came back, I sympathized with other families who sense the consequences of PTSD and the injury with which our soldiers return," she told an audience at a convention for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said of her son and other war veterans, "They come back a little differently, they come back hard, they come back and wonder if there is respect for what they and their fellow soldiers and Air Forces and every other member of the army gave to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence, assaulting a woman, interfering with a complaint of domestic violence, and possession of a gun while under influence, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Station.
18 state, D.C. supports challenge of new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the Columbia District support a legal challenge to a new US policy that refuses asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 states and the county have filed a friend-of-the-court legal order on Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker and challenge the policy, reported NBC News.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions case filed by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy in August was not made public.
She says her partner "and his violent gang members," mistreated her, but American officials refused her request for asylum on July 20th.
She was held in Texas.
The state attorneys who support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produces a large number of applicants for US asylum, as nations facing profound problems with gangs and domestic violence.
In 2014, the new US asylum policy reversed a decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals (Council of Immigrant Appeals) which allowed immigrants to apply for asylum without the necessary documents fleeing from domestic violence.
District Columbia's Attorney General Karl Racine said on Friday in a statement that the new policy "is ignoring decades of state, federal and international law."
"Federal laws require that all asylum applications be decided on the specific facts and circumstances of the claim, and such lawyerry violates that policy," said the friend-of-the-court order.
Lawyers further argued in the legal order that the policy that immigrants refuse access harms the US economy and says it is more likely that they will become entrepreneurs and "provide necessary labour."
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing from domestic and gang violence.
"Asia is available to those who leave their country of origin because of persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or membership of a specific social group or political opinion," said Sessions in his announcement of the policy on June 11.
Asylum was never meant to alleviate all problems — even all serious ones — that people around the world face every day.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu while death tolls double in race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation is increasingly sensitive.
"It feels very tense," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma as she comforted her feverish baby boy at a evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute bring an ambulance body.
Clean water is scarce."
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, seeking through drunken possessions, trying to save anything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5-volume quake, were overwhelmed.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who contracted a broken back and shoulder, rest outside Palu's military hospital where patients are treated outside because of constant strong aftershocks.
Tears filled his eyes as he told of the violent earthquake that shook the fifth-floor hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was pushed into the walls' ruins, I think," Haris told the Associated Press and added that he and his family were in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife cry for help, but then silence.
I don’t know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. ambassador accuses China of ‘ bullying’ with ‘propaganda advertising’
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement in an American daily that advocates the mutual benefits of U.S. China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
Last Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump referred to China Daily's paid inset in the Des Moines Register – the state of Iowa's newspaper with most sales – after accusing China of interfering in the U.S. congressional elections of November 6, a complaint that denies China.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the U.S. elections marked what U.S. officials told Reuters was a new phase in a growing Washington campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently trapped in an escalating trade war that has led them to make tariff rounds equal to each other's imports.
China’s retaliation rates early in the trade war were aimed at beating exporters in states like Iowa who supported Trump’s Republican Party, Chinese and US experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador for China and the former governor of Iowa for a long time, a great exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, wrote Branstad in an opinion paper in Sunday's Des Moines Register, "is now exacerbating bullying by publishing propaganda advertisements in our own free press."
"By spreading their propaganda, the Chinese government seizes America's cherished tradition of free speech and a free press by placing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register, Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, at the newspaper kiosk in the street here in Beijing, one will find very limited dissenting voices and not see any real reflection of the diverse opinions of the Chinese people about China's worrying economic trajectory, given that media is under the firm thumb of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers has staggered from the offer to publish his article", although he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans alienate women's voters before inter-election with Kavanaugh debacle, warns analysts
While many top Republicans stand at the Supreme Court-nominated Brett Kavanaugh defending him in the face of various allegations of sexual assault, analysts warned that they would see counter-reaction during the upcoming inter-elections, especially of women.
The emotions about this run tremendously high, and most Republicans are on record indicating that they already want to continue the mood.
Those things cannot be reversed," said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School to The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted whether Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s appeal for an FBI investigation on the sniper would be enough to appease severe voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday – they will not forget it tomorrow and not in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior advisor and national spokesman for the progressive group MoveOn Friday, according to Washington, D.C. newspaper.
Friday morning, protestors "November is on their way!" thundered as they argued in the Senate entrance portal while the Republicans who chose the Judicial Committee to continue Kavanaugh's appointment despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, reported Mic.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be very high," said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst, to the newscast.
"People say it was already high; it's true.
But it can be higher, especially among voice-female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18- to 29-year-olds, who don't often vote because they don't like the president."
Even before Ford's public testimony outlined the details of her charge of sexual assault against the Supreme Court-genominated, analysts said a counter-reaction could follow if Republicans continued to confirm.
"It has become a mess for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, early last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not about the committee's vote or the final vote and whether Kavanaugh is put on the court, it's also about the way the Republicans handled it and how they treated her," pointed Guy Cecil, director of Priority USA, a group that helps to elect Democrats, to the news channel.
But Americans seem slightly divided over who to believe after Ford and Kavanaugh’s testimonies, with slightly more that the latter takes sides.
A new survey of YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believe Ford's testimony, while 35 say they definitely or probably believe in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that they thought Kavanaugh was probably or definitely joked during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After Flake’s incitement, the FBI is currently investigating the accusations made by Ford, as well as at least one other complainant, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford testified last week under oath before the Senate's Judicial Committee that Kavanaugh had assaulted her at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court-nominated exposed his genitals to her while attending a party during their student years at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the global web plans to start a new Internet to tell Google and Facebook the battle
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the global web, launched a start-up business that tried to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The technology legend's latest project, Inrupt, is a company that builds on Berners-Lee's open source platform, Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people are allowed access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee mocked that the idea of Inrupt is "world domination."
"We must do it now," he said about the project.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data storage" or a POD.
It may contain contact lists, task lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It is as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all are available at the same time and on one browser.
What is unique about the personal online data storage is that it is entirely up to the user who can access that type of information.
The company calls it "personal empowerment by data."
The idea for Inrupt, according to the company’s HUB John Bruce, is for the company to bring resources, processes, and relevant skills to help make Solid available to all.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, developers on the personnel contracted to work on the project and a community of volunteer encoders.
From this week on, technology developers from all over the world can create their own decentralised applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee says he and his team don't talk to "Facebook and Google about introducing a complete change whether or not, where all their business models are completely reversed overnight.
"We don't ask their permission."
In a position on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission is to provide commercial energy as well as an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee converted the Internet when he founded the Global Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months Berners-Lee has had an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Even as he runs Inrupt, Berners-Lee will still be the founder and director of the Global Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm extremely optimistic about this next era of the Web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: WW1 Victoria Cross Spiritual Celebration
The only clergyman of the Church of England who won the Victoria Cross as a warrior during World War I was honored in his hometown 100 years later.
Lt.kol Reverend Bernard Vann won the award on September 29, 1918, in the attack at Bellenglish and Lehaucourt.
But four days later he was killed by a sniper and never knew that he had won the highest British military honor.
A memorial stone was revealed on Saturday by his two grandsons at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "brilliant symbolic" that the stone was revealed exactly 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning achievement.
According to the London Gazette, lt.kol. won on 29 September 1918 his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through very dense fog and under heavy fire from the field and machine guns."
He later rushed to the fire line and, with the "greatest bravery," led the line forward before he stormed a man-only field gun and knocked out three of the department.
Lt.kol Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's behavior is "something I know I can never confess, but something that is humiliating."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid a wreath at the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Orchestra.
Michael Vann said he "felt honoured to play a role in the parade" and added that "the courage of a true hero is demonstrated by the support that will be given by a lot of people."
MMA supporters stay up all night to watch Bellator 206, but get Peppa Pig
Imagine, you stay awake all night to watch the full - packed Bellator 206, just not to be able to watch the main event.
The program of San Jose contained 13 battles, including six on the main program that would be broadcast directly through the night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were on their way to tell each other the battle, viewers in the UK were stunned when the coverage changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were unimpressed after staying awake for the battle until early hours.
On Twitter, one supporter described the switch to the child cartoon as "someone or other sick joke."
"It is government regulations that the content was not suitable at 6 p.m. and therefore they had to switch to child programs," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator senior vice president of marketing and communication, when asked about the broadcast.
""Peppa the Pig," yes."
Bellator company president Scott Coker said they would work on their schedule to include UK viewers in the future.
"I think that when I think about retransmission, I think we can probably work something out," said Coker.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning on a Sunday there and we won't be able to sort it out until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we are working on it.
Believe me, when it switched over, there were many text messages sent back and forth and it wasn't all friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical mistake.
But it wasn't, it was a government issue.
I can promise that this will not happen next time.
We will limit it to five battles instead of six — as we normally do — and we have tried to offer more to our followers and just go over our time.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt 'minor' about sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up with a feeling of inferiority about his sexuality – but it gave him the motivation to be a success.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize before he went to high school that "not everyone is like me."
When he spoke on the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs offered by Lauren Laverne, he said he aired his feelings about gay rights to give others hope.
He also said that becoming a parent made him care less to win the Olympics.
The regular provider of the years-long program, Kirsty Young, took a few months off because of illness.
When he appeared as a rejection on Laverne's first program, Daley said he felt "less" than everyone else when he grew up, because "it wasn't socially acceptable to like boys and girls."
He said, "Until today, those feelings are less than, and feel different, the real things that gave me the strength and energy to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so that he wouldn't disappoint anyone when they would finally find out about his sexuality.
The double Olympic bronze medal winner has become a high-profile LGBT fighter and has used his appearance at this year's Australian League games to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He says he aired his feelings because he's so happy to be able to live openly without consequences and want to give others hope.
The three-time world champion said that to fall in love with a man – U.S. filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, "has caught him on his side."
Daley was married last year to the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than he is, but says the age difference was never a question.
"When you go through so much at such a young age" – he went to his first Olympic Games at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later – he said it was difficult to find someone of the same age who had experienced similar highs and lows.
The couple became parents in June of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley says his "whole perspective" changed.
"If you asked me last year, everything went on about 'I must win a gold medal,' he said.
"But you know, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son had the same name as his father Robert who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley says his father did not accept that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked was whether they had had tickets for London in 2012 — because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him 'you're not going to be here to be in the front row, Dad'," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and it was only after he had stopped breathing and was dead that I finally admitted that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley took part in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I just knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life – to dive in front of my home class at an Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired his first songwriter — Proud by Heather Small — who also resonated with him in the building up of the Olympic Games and still gave him chicken meat.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mikkelson did not push and withdraw from Saturday’s Rider’s Cup
American Phil Mikkelson will set up a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he will have to manage his form to prevent it from being an unfortunate milestone.
Mikkelson, who plays for a record 12th time in the biennial event, was withdrawn by Captain Jim Furijk for Saturday's four-ball games and fours.
Instead of being the focal point of the action, as he has often been to the United States, the five-time Major winner will divide his day between being a cheerleader and working on the top of his game in the hope of correcting the difference.
Even at the height of his career he was never the straightest driver, so the 48-year-old is not the ideal person for the narrow Le Golf National track where the long roughfield always punishes the erratic blows.
And as if the track on its own was not challenging enough, Mikkelson came on Sunday in his ninth match against the accurate British Ope champion Francesco Molinari, who had teamed up with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their matches this week.
If the Americans, who are four points behind, start the 12 single - game games well, Mikkelson’s game can be absolutely essential.
Frightened, he expressed confidence in his husband, not that he could say much differently.
"He fully understood his role which he had today, gave me a knock on my back and put his arm around me and said he would be right tomorrow," Fury said.
"He had a lot of confidence in himself.
He is in the Heroes Hall, and in the past and this week he has contributed so much to these teams.
I probably did not imagine that he would play two games.
I had more in store, but that’s how things worked out and that’s what we thought we should do.
He wants to be there, just like anyone else."
Mikkelson will surpass Nick Faldo’s record for the player who played most Rider Cup games on Sunday.
It can mark the end of a Rider Cup career that has never really matched the highlights of its individual achievements.
Mikkelson had 18 wins, 20 defeats, and seven halves, although Fürry said that his presence contributed to the team inestimable aspects.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he likes to shave the crazy, and he's a wonderful guy to have in the team room," he explained.
"I think the younger players also enjoyed shaving with him, which was fun to see.
He offers so much more than just games."
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows great advantage can quickly disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a considerable advance before the last day's single game in the Rider Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable experience.
The Deen made his debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where the team under the leadership of Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead, but only narrowly won with 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"One continues to remind oneself that we had a great advantage at Valderrama; we had a great advantage at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we had won close-up," said Bjorn, in the photograph, after looking at how the 2018 Class had won 5-3 and yesterday 10-6 ahead at Le Golf National.
So, history will show me and everyone on the team that it's not over.
You're going to full speed tomorrow.
Go out and do all the right things.
It is not over until you have the points on the board.
We have a purpose, and it's to try to win the trophy, and that's where the focus stays.
I keep saying, I focus on the 12 players on our team, but we're also well aware of who's on the other hand – the best players in the world."
Rejoicing at how his players sailed on the difficult golf course, Bjorn adds: "I'll never go ahead with this.
Tomorrow is a horse of a different colour.
Tomorrow it's the individual participation that comes next, and it's a horse of a different color.
It's wonderful to be out there with a partner when things go well, but when you're individually there, you're tested to your full capacity as a golfer.
This is the message you have to deliver to players, and it is the best thing you can do tomorrow.
Now you leave your mate behind, and he must also find the best of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his counterpart Jim Furijk would like his players to sail better individually than they did as playmates, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three points out of four.
Fright himself had been on both sides of those great last-day mercenaries, where he was part of the winning team at Brookline before he ended as a loser when Europe achieved the "miracle of Medinah".
"I remember every German word of it," he said in reply when he was asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999 had courageously talked his players into going to that last day.
"We had 12 important games tomorrow, but one would like to start well, as seen at Brookline, as seen at Medinah.
When that momentum begins in one direction, it puts much stress on those middle games.
We set our team according to it, and divided the men who felt us, you know, to bring us something magical tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned to try to lead the counterattack and compete in the main contest against Rory McIlroy, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans in the upper half of the classification.
"I've chosen this group of guys in this order, because I think it covers it to the end," said Bjorn about his single game options.
Germany’s New Warship Again Deferred
The German army's newest frigate would have been deployed in 2014 to replace the old warships from the Cold War-era, but it will not be there until at least next year, due to faulty systems and growing costs, reports local media.
The launch of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the main ship of the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg class frigates, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper, which quotes a military spokesman.
This vessel should have joined the Navy in 2014, but the troubling post-delivery issues plagued the fate of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg class vessels that the Navy ordered in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen class frigates.
It is understood that they will have a powerful cannon, a series of air-defence and anti-ship missiles as well as several secret technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods — it should be possible to develop the latest frigates for up to two years away from home ports.
But constant delays mean that the advanced warships — which will evidently enable Germany to project power overseas — will already become obsolete by the time they enter service, calls Die Zeit.
Last year the disastrous F125-freight made observations when the German Navy officially refused to hire the vessel and sent it back to Blohm & Voss-shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy sent a ship back to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but German media have mentioned that a number of essential "software and hardware defects" render the ship useless if it is developed in a campaign.
Software defects are particularly important since the Baden-Wuerttemberg class of vessels will be handled by a crew of about 120 sailors – only half of the manpower on older Bremen class frigates.
It has also come to light that the ship is drastically overweight, reducing the performance of the work and reducing the ability of the Navy to add future upgrades.
The 7,000 tons of "Rheinland-Pfalz" are thought to be twice as heavy as ships of similar classes used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the price label for the entire project – including the training of the crew – also became a matter of concern.
This apparently reached an incredible €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) – more than the initial €2.2 billion.
Problems that the new frigates have encountered are particularly important in view of recent warnings that the strength of Germany’s fleet is shrinking.
Earlier this year Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Defense Committee, acknowledged that the fleet's "ships that can be developed are running out."
The official said that the issue worsened over time, for old ships were out of service, but no replacement vessels were provided.
He lamented that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could join the Navy.
National Trust Listens to Bats ’ Secret Life
New research is being carried out on an estate in the Scottish Highlands that aims to reveal how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the behavior of the unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow the common and soprano bat as well as the brown long-eared and daubenton bats at Inverewe Gardene in Western Ross.
Special recorders will be placed on the property at important locations to track bat activities throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile recordings using hand indicators.
Expert clan channels of all recordings will check the frequency of the bat calls and determine which species do.
A habitat map and report will then be compiled to create a detailed landscape-scale view of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a conservation consultant for NTS hopes the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important for bats and how they are used by each of the species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management such as pasturage and how to best manage forest lands for bats and other associated species.
Bat populations in Scotland and throughout the UK have declined significantly during the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects sleep and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lightning can also pose risks, as well as fly paper and some chemical treatment of building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
Bats are not really blind.
But because of their nocturnal hunting, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echo orientation technique to point out bugs and obstacles on their flight route.
The NTS, responsible for caring for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens, and 76,000 acres [76,000 ha] of land throughout the country, is very serious about bats.
It has ten trained experts who regularly carry out surveys and bedside inspections and sometimes perform rescues.
The organization even established Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve at Threeave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
Estate manager David Thompson says the estate is the ideal site for them.
"Here at Threave we have a wonderful area for bats," he said.
"We have the old buildings, many veteran trees and all the good habitat.
But there is so much about bats that are still unknown, so the work we do here and on other properties helps us to understand better what they need to thrive."
He emphasizes the need to seek for bats before conservation in properties is done because it is possible that unknowing destruction of a single birthplace can mean 400 females and young children's death and annihilate an entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, disturb, or prevent them or destroy their sleeping places.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to jump in to help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we don't know how their populations are going."
Ronaldo completes rape claims while lawyers prepare to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo filed rape charges against him as "false news" and said that people wanted to "promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyers are ready to sue German newsmagazine Der Spiegel, who published the claims.
The Portuguese and Juventus actors were accused of having raped an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
He reportedly paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported Friday.
In a Instagram Live video in which he addressed his 142 million followers, hours after the claims were published, Ronaldo, 33, closed the reports as "false news."
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, false news," said the five-time Ballon d'Or winner to the camera.
"They want to promote themselves by using my name.
This is normal.
They want to be famous for saying my name, but it's part of the whole thing.
I'm a happy man and everything's right," added the player smilingly.
Ronaldo's attorney is getting ready to sue Der Spiegel about the claim, which they called, according to Reuters, "an inadmissible report of suspicion in the field of privacy."
Attorney Christian Schertz said that the player would demand compensation for "moral damages for any amount corresponding to the seriousness of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident was reported to have taken place in June 2009 at a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After they met at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly went to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anal, according to documents filed at Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and said he was "99 percent" a "good old" who was abandoned by the "one percent."
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had taken pictures of her injuries at the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was "afraid of retaliation" and worried about being "publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old says she wants to reverse the settlement now because she's still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged assault and moved this summer, in a $100 million agreement to the Italian giants, Juve.
Brexit: UK will lose 'everlasting repentance' if their car manufacturers
The UK will 'repent forever' if they lose their world leadership status in car production to Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it is "disquieting" that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement, it will have to stop temporary production at the Burnaston plant, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese vehicle manufacturer said that the impact of border delays in the case of a no-agreement Brexit could cost posts.
Last year, the Burnaston plant – which produces Toyota’s Auris and Avensis – produced almost 150,000 cars, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see production stopped in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director at Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, were afraid to leave the EU without an agreement and how cross-border trade would work.
For example, BMW said that they would close their mini-installation in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what car manufacturers say supply chain risks are in the case of a Brexit without an agreement.
Toyota’s production line runs on a “just in time” basis, with parts that arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars made on order.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there may be disruption at the border which the industry says can lead to delays and defects in parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day's supply at the Derbyshire plant, the company said, and therefore production will be discontinued.
Mr. Clark says Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU has been "calibrated to avoid those checks at the border."
"We need an agreement. We want the best deal that, as I say, will allow to enjoy not only the current success but for us to seize this opportunity," he said to BBC Radio 4's Today program.
"The indications of not only Toyota, but also other manufacturers, are that we absolutely need to continue what was an extremely successful set of supply chains."
Toyota could not tell how long production would stop but warned that in the long term, additional costs could reduce the plant’s competitivity and eventually cost posts.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years and is the Unite Union's social worker at the plant, says his members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, when these posts disappear, they never come back again.
A government spokesman said, "We have proposed a precise and acceptable plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump meeting with Rosenstein can be postponed again, says Withuis
Donald Trump's high-risk meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein can be "suspended by another week" while the fight on nominated for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh continues, said the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special legal adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates the Russian election interference, links between Trump helpers and Russia, and possible cross-breeding of the law by the president.
Whether Trump resigns the deputy attorney general or not, and thereby threatens Mueller's independence, Washington's gossip has been fueling for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of wearing a recorder to record conversations with Trump, as well as the possibility of removing the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
Last Monday, however, he went to the White House, amid reports that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would "choose not" to thank Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a collision with the Senate court's trial in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both witnessed.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation of allegations against Kavanaugh and the full Senate vote to be postponed further.
Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When she was asked about the Rosenstein meeting she said, "A date for it is not yet set, it may be this week, I can see that it is being postponed with another week with all the other things going on with the Supreme Court.
But we'll see and I always like to keep the press up to date."
Some journalists will disagree with that statement: Sanders has not held a White House press information session since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the scarcity of information sessions is not due to a reluctance for TV journalists who are "affective hunting," although she said, "I won't argue with the fact that they are effective."
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president holds more V&A sessions than any president before him," she said, adding without quoting evidence, "We've looked at the numbers."
Information sessions will still take place, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the president of the United States, then it is infinitely better than talking to me.
We try a lot and you've seen us do it a lot in the past few weeks and it's going to take the place of a press information session when you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press releases with visiting dignitaries.
Solo press releases are scarce.
In New York this week, the president may have demonstrated why, by making an unbound and sometimes bizarre appearance before journalists gathered there.
Secretary of Health writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland about Brexit fears
The Secretary of Health wrote to EU staff working in Scotland’s NHS to show the country’s gratitude and to express the wish that they would stay in Brexit.
Jeanne Freeman MSP sent a letter with less than six months before the UK withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to covering the costs of completed status applications for EU citizens working in the delegated public services.
In her letter, Freeman wrote to me: "During the summer negotiations between the UK and EU on withdrawal continued, on the way to expected decisions this fall.
But the UK government has also intensified their preparations for a possible no-agreement scenario.
I know it's a very disturbing time for all of you.
That is why I want to repeat how much I value each staff member’s contribution, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from all over the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the health service’s work and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home, and we very much want you to stay here.
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after head injury
Tennessee State Tigers' line player Christion Abercrombie had an emergency operation after he suffered a head injury in Saturday's 31-27 defeat against the Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessee team's Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State principal coach Rod Reed told journalists that the injury occurred shortly before rest.
"He came to the margin and sort of collapsed just there," said Reed.
Trainers and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen along the margin before he was placed on a portable and taken back for further evaluation.
An official of Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie was from the theater at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there is "no more details about the type/range of the injury" and Tennessee still tries to detect when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, an academic second year, was in his first season at Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
He killed five times on Saturday before leaving the game, which puts his total for the season at 18 deadlocks.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp tax when buying a property in the UK.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp tax when buying a property in the UK and the extra cash will be used to help the homeless, according to the new Tory plans
This move will neutralize the success of Corbyn’s attempt to attract young voters
The stamp tax will be levied on those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Thesoury expects to raise up to £120 million a year – to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp taxes when buying a property in the UK – with the extra cash that will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
The action will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's attempt to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing and target high earners.
The stamp - tax increase will be levied on individuals and firms who do not pay taxes in the UK, with the extra money that will help the government’s plans to combat homelessness.
The surcharge — which is beyond the current stamp tax, including the higher levels imposed two years ago on second homes and houses purchased for rent — can be as much as three percent.
The Thesourie expects this move to bring in up to £120 million a year.
An estimated 13 percent of newly built London properties are purchased by non-UK citizens who push the prices up and make it harder for first buyers to get a foot in the housing door.
Many wealthy areas of the country — especially in the capital — have become “spaved villages” as a result of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a stamp tax reduction to help more young people own their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping property prices high by picking up land, but not using it, and encouraged Mrs. May to give up quotas on affordable homes to repair Britain's "housing disaster".
Mr. Corbyn announced a striking series of planned housing improvements, including rent management and an end to "no-wrong outsourcings".
He also wants to give larger powers to build new homes.
Mrs. May said, "Last year I said I would devote my prime ministership to restoring the British dream – that life should be better for every new generation.
And that means restoring our broken home market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live here, work and build a life.
But it cannot be right that it is as easy for individuals who do not live in the UK as foreign - based companies to buy homes as it is for hardworking British residents.
For too many people, the dream of home ownership has become a far-off dream and the humiliation of homelessness has become too great a reality."
Jack Ross: 'My biggest ambition is to run Scotland'
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "greatest ambition" is to become the manager of Scotland at some point.
The Scotsman, 42, enjoys the challenge of reviving the North-East team, which is currently in third place in League One, three points below the tops.
This summer he moved to the Stadium of Light after taking St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play as a player for my country.
I got the second team, but that was all," said Ross to BBC Scotland's Sports Sound.
"But as a child, I often watched for Scotland with my father at Hampden and this is something that draws me back.
The event can come, however, only if I am successful in club management."
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic boss said he felt no anxiety to imitate such established names at such a large club, after he had previously turned down presentations by Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"At the moment, success will be measured for me by ''can I bring this club back to the Premier League?'
Because of the structure and facilities of this club, it definitely belongs in the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task to get it there, but I'll probably only consider myself successful if I can get the club out again."
Ross' career in management is still only three years, after a period of assistant boss at Dumbarton and a 15-month period on Hearts' training staff.
He then helped Alloa return from religion to the third league, converting St. Mirren from the edge of religion to winners of the Championship title in the following season.
And Ross says that he now feels more comfortable than he ever felt during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren, and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a true crossroads," he said when he remembered how he had taken over Alloa's ledges.
"I really believed the management was the right place for me, even more than playing.
That sounds bizarre, because I did well enough, made a reasonable existence out of it, and experienced reasonable highlights.
But the game can be difficult.
There's a lot of things you have to come through every week.
I still go through it in terms of the stress and pressure of the job, but driving just feels right.
I always wanted to drive and now I do it, it feels the most comfortable I have been in my own skin throughout my adult life."
On Sunday, September 30, you can listen to the complete interview on Radio Scotland between 12:00 and 13:00 BST
The perfect time for a pint is 5:30 p.m. on a Saturday, found recording
The summer heat wave improved Britain’s struggling bars ’ income but put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Drinking grounds and bar groups saw sales rise by 2.7% in July – but restaurant receipts down by 4.8 percent showed figures.
Peter Martin, of the CGA Business Consultant, who compiled the figures, says: "Continued sunshine and England's longer than expected participation in the World Cup meant that Julie followed a similar pattern as the previous month, June, when drinking spots were up by 2.8 percent, except that restaurants were hit even harder.
The 1.8 - percent drop in restaurant trade in June only worsened in July.
Drink-guided drinking grounds and bars did far better and rose more than restaurants had dropped.
Food - guided drinking areas also suffered in the sun, but not as badly as restaurant operators.
It seems that people just wanted to go out for a drink.
Sales increased by 6.6 percent for the month, with food down by three percent. ”
Paul Newman, of recreational and hospitality analysts RSM, said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
Weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the main factors in sales in the out-of-house market.
It comes as no surprise that restaurant groups continue to struggle, although a decrease in sales of 4.8 percent year-on-year will be particularly difficult above and beyond constant cost pressure.
The long hot summer could not have come at a worse time for food-conducted operators and only the time will show whether the more temperate temperatures we have experienced since August will bring needed relief."
Total growth in sales across drinking areas and restaurants, including new places that opened, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the slowdown in trade marks.
The Coffer Peach Tracker business sales monitor for the UK's drinking area, bar and restaurant sector collects and analyzes performance data from 47 business groups, with a combined turnover of more than £9 billion and is the established benchmark in the industry.
One in five children has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents
One in five children — some as young as 11 — has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers, revealing a survey
Recording 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in false Insta pages
The news heightened fears that sexual content would be placed
Twenty percent of students say they have a "main account" to show parents.
One in five children – some as young as 11 – creates social media accounts that keep them secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed rapid growth in false Insta accounts – a reference to the photo workshop Instagram.
The news heightened fears that sexual content would be placed.
Twenty percent of students said they had a clean "main account" to show parents, but also had private accounts.
One mother who came across her 13-year-old daughter's secret yard found a teenager who encouraged others to "rape."
The research, at Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of 11- to 18-year-olds have two profiles, with half of them acknowledging that they have private accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said, "It's disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can't find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be "vote for athletes" on the Scottish athletic council.
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Board of Scottish Athletics as a non-executive director at the governing body's general annual meeting.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated track-and-field runner and chairman Ian Beattie described the step as a wonderful opportunity for those who lead the sport to benefit from her extensive international experience during the past decade.
"Eilidh has great respect throughout the Scottish, UK and world athletic community and we are sure athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly from what she brings to the council," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I'm eager to act as a voice for athletes, and I hope I can really contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland."
The American, who has the 200 meters and 400 meters at the 1996 Atlanta Games under his four gold Olympic medals, is now a regular BBC expert, could not walk after having had a brief ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter, "Today a month ago I had a stroke.
I could not walk.
Doctors said that only time would tell if I would recover and to what extent.
It was exhausting work, but it fully recovered, again learned how to walk, and today it does skill exercises!
Thank you for the messages of encouragement!"
Breast-pump version that mothers compare to cows divide opinions online
A breast pump company divided opinions online with an advertisement that compared breast-feeding mothers to milking cows.
In celebration of the launch of what is called the "world's first silent portable breast pump," consumer technology company Elvie released a tongue-in-the-kind music video-inspired advertisement to show the freedom that the pump gives to mothers who milk out.
Four real moms dance in a barn full of straw and cows on the measure of a song that includes lyrics such as, "Yes, I milk myself, but you can't see a tail" and, "In case you haven't seen, these aren't uddies, these are my breasts."
The choir section reads, "Pump it out, pump it out, I feed the babies, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my ladies."
But the advertisement published on the firm's Facebook page has caused online controversy.
With 77,000 viewers and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reaction from viewers, with many saying it underplays the horrors of the dairy industry.
"Very poor decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Next we have to become pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but their babies are often stolen from them within days of giving birth," wrote one.
The Elvie breast pump fits discreetly in a feeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another person commented, "Surely traumatized for mother and baby.
But yes, why not use it to advertise a breast pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Someone else added, "The ad is so out of touch."
Others defended the ad, with one woman who admitted that the song was for her "screaming weird."
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
I would have had one if I were still breast - feeding.
To milk out made me feel like a cow.
The ad is a little crazy, but I accepted it for what it is.
It's a genius product," wrote one.
Another person said, "It's a nice advertisement for mothers who milk out (often in their workplaces or toilets) and feel like "cows."
It is not an advertisement that praises or judges the dairy industry.
At the end of the video the women showed that they had all danced with the discreet pump in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the understanding that many women who milk out say they feel like cows.
The Elvie pump, however, is silent, has no wires or tubes, and has just been discreetly in a feeding bra that gives women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even go out while they are milking out.
Ana Balarin, partner and UKD at Mother commented: "The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it has earned a great and provocative reputation.
By drawing a parallel between women milking out and dairy cows, we wanted to put the milking out process and all its challenges into the limelight, while in an entertaining way that people can find connection to demonstrate the wonderful sense of freedom that will bring the new pump.
It's not the first time the Elvie pump got the news.
During London Fashionweek, a mother of two appeared on the running board for designer Marta Jakubowski while she was using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of continuing migrant children has risen sharply, although monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, partly due to harsh rhetoric and policies set up by the Trump administration which make it more difficult to secure children.
Traditionally, most bailouts were also undocumented immigrants and feared that their own ability to stay in the country would be endangered by taking forward the claim of a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential bailouts and other adult members of their households should go their fingerprints if and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week Matthew Albence, a senior official at Immigration and Customs Maintenance before Congress, testified that the agency had arrested thousands of people who had applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested did not have previous criminal records.
"Almost 80 percent of the individuals who are either guarantors or household members of bail are illegal here in the country and a large number of them are criminal foreigners.
That is why we continue to persecute those individuals," said Mr. Albence.
In an effort to deal with the children more quickly, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a month after arrest, rather than after 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to shelter workers.
Many will appear via a videoconferencing call, rather than in person, to plead their case for legal status with an immigration judge.
Those considered unfit for relief will be deported quickly.
The longer the children remain in custody, the more likely it is that they will become anxious or depressed, leading to violent outbursts or escape attempts, according to security workers and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months.
Lawyers say those concerns are raised at a larger facility like Tornillo, where signs that a child is struggling are more easily overlooked because of the size.
They added that moving the children to the tent village without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally to say good - bye to friends could make the trauma that many are already struggling with.
Syria tells U.S., French, and Turkish ‘employees’ to withdraw immediately
When he addressed the UN General Assembly, Minister of Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moualem also appealed to Syrian refugees to come home, even though the country's war was in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as Deputy Prime Minister, said that the foreign forces are illegal on Syrian soil, on the pretext of fighting terrorism and will be "managed accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he said to the meeting.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terror" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, with millions more uprooted, is "almost over".
He said that Damascus will continue "to wage this holy struggle until we have cleansed all Syrian territories" of both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence."
The United States has trained and advised some 2,000 troops in Syria, who mostly train and advise Kurdish forces as well as Syrian Arabs against President Bashar al-Assad.
France with more than 1,000 troops on the ground in the war - torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said that the conditions were in order for them to return, and he blamed "some Western countries" for spreading "irrational fears that encourage refugees to stay away.
"We have appealed to the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They are politicizing something that simply has to be a humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union warned that there would be no reconstruction aid for Syria until there was a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats said that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major rebel fortress of Idlib created an opportunity to continue political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement has resisted a large-scale attack by Russian-supported Syrian forces on the province, where three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had "clear sperm times" and expressed the hope that military action would target jihadist, including warriors of the Al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front who would be "cut off".
UN Envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene soon the first meetings of a new committee composed of government and opposition members to establish a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem prescribed conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee and said the panel's work should be limited to the "review of the articles of the current constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to that logic, Mr. Trump will win the re-election in 2020, unless, as many liberals probably hope, a state of accusation and scandals end his presidency early.
In what without a doubt 'the most dramatic finale of a presidency will ever be!'
To this day, there are no signs of viewer fatigue.
Since 2014, peak viewing rates have more than doubled to 1.05 million at CCN and almost tripled to 1.6 million at MSNCBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million peak time viewers, at 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" is top cable viewing with as many as 3.5 million viewers on big news evenings.
"It is a fire to which people are attracted, for it is not something we understand," says Neal Baer, programme manager of the ABC drama "Designed Survivor" about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Congress building.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The manager told her that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? she asked.
"He said, "Because he made me laugh," said Scovell to me.
There is entertainment in the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the storylines coming from Washington can determine the future of Ru v. Wade, or immigrant families can reunite and the health of the world economy.
Disabling is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet it goes beyond being just an informed citizen when you're in the sixth hour of it to watch a panel of experts debate Bob Woodward's use of "deep background" from his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich leather fly jacket ("a piece of clothing thick from the hubris," said The Washington Post) and the implications of Stormy Daniels' shocking descriptions of Mr. Trump's, um, anatomy.
For example, I will never again look at Super Mario in the same way.
"Part of what he does what makes it feel like a reality program is that he feeds you something every night," says Brent Montgomery, chief of the wheelhouse entertainment industry and the creator of "Pawn Stars," about the Trump program's alternating roll distribution and daily twists in the plot (as to look for a fight with N.F.L., Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss one episode, or you'll stay behind.
When I reached Fleiss this week, it was 80 degrees outside his home on the northern coast of Kauai, but he was inside watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not tear himself away, not with Brett Kavanaugh on his way to appear before the Senate Court and the future of the Supreme Court hanging in the balances.
"I remember when we did all those crazy programs back then and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" said Mr. Fleiss to me.
"I thought it was kind of a joke, but it seems now they were right."

Outflow stream to the most exciting midterm election races in Home
It's not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th is seeing an inflow of money, thanks to a shift of congress districts that has now brought two officers into a race for the same seat.
The recently changed suburb Pittsburg district has democratic rep. Conor Lamb – who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring – measuring strength.
Lamb is standing against another officer, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the old Pennsylvania 12th district, who is heavily overlapping with the new 17th.
The cards were withdrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally defined in the Republicans ’ favor.
The race in the new 17th ended with a campaign finance contest between the financial legs of the major parties, the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a close win in a widely watched special election in March for Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
The seat was held for more than a decade by a Republican and President Donald Trump won the county by 20 points.
Political experts gave the Democrats a slight advantage.
U.S. thought of penalizing El Salvador, rather than supporting China, but then turning back
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until partners suspended the Trump Organization management team.
Officials of the State Department decided to recall the U.S. heads of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Panama on the "recent decisions to stop recognizing Taiwan," Heather Nauert, the department spokesman, said earlier this month in a statement.
But fines were only considered against El Salvador who received an estimated $140 million in US aid in 2017, including drug control, development and economic assistance.
The proposed fines, including reductions in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would be difficult for the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, only North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level congress and focused on security and economic progress to follow up on a similar convention last year that was considered a step forward in an effort to prevent migrants from going to the United States.
But by mid-September, top administrative officials made it clear that they wanted the Congress to continue effectively to put an end to any consideration of fines for El Salvador.
Deputy President Mike Pence is now destined to address the congress, now scheduled for middle October, as a sign of the seriousness of the convention for administration, the diplomats said.
And the three U.S. envoys returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic with no new bad news or rigours from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton did not want to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal discussion on the basis of anonymity.
Their statements were confirmed by an outside analyst who was close to the administration and also talked about the condition of anonymity.
Study History
The next thing that can happen can be the special discussion of Robert Mueller’s report on Mr. Trump’s possible crossbreeding of the dish, which is now well documented in the public record.
Mr. Mueller is also believed to focus his investigation on whether Mr. Trump’s campaign with Russia cooperated in the country’s attack on our elections.
If Congress were to change hands, Mr. Trump would have to face accountability in that body, just when he was preparing to go back before the voters, and perhaps eventually before a jury of his peers.
It's a lot of axes, and I don't want to imply that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable – nor that of his counterparts in Europe.
There are decisions to be made on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect how much the battle can be fought.
In 1938, German officials were ready to carry out a coup against Hitler, if the West only opposed him and supported the Czechoslovakian in Munich.
We failed and missed an opportunity to avoid the killings of the years that followed.
The course of history revolves around such turning points, and the relentless course of democracy is speeded up or delayed.
Americans are now facing several such turning points.
What will we do if Mr. Trump Deputy Attorney-General Rod Rosenstein, the man who dismisses the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation, resigns?
Rosenstein has been in hot water since this newspaper reported that last year he suggested taking the president in secret and speculating whether he was qualified for his office.
Mr. Rosenstein says The Times report is inaccurate.
"How will we react if the newly requested FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair – or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court in spite of credible charges of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the inter-election for a congress that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we watch those tests, there lies a long winter ahead for democracy.
But I believe we will not fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czecho-Slovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that lived at one time in my embassy house.
She survived, emigrated to America and, 60 years later, sent me to go light Sabbath candles on that table that the swastika wears.
With that as my origin, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Rangers' Graham Dorrans optimistic for Rapid Vienna battle
Rangers play Thursday hosts for Rapid Vienna knowing that victory over the Austrians, after the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will place them in a strong position to qualify for Group G of the Europe League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance from the season until the 2-2 equal outcome against Villarreal, but he said Rangers could use this outcome as a springboard for bigger things.
"That was a good point for us, for Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old.
"We went into the game with the conviction that we could get something and walked away with a point.
Perhaps we could have won it at the end, but an equal count is probably a righteous result.
They were probably better in the first half, and we got out in the second half and were the better team.
Thursday's another big European night.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it's going to be a hard game, because they've had a good outcome in their last game, but with the crowd on our side, I'm sure we can push through and get a positive outcome.
Last year was certainly difficult, with everything that happened to my injuries and the changes at the club, but there is now a good-feeling factor in the place.
The group is good, and the men really enjoy it; the training is good.
Hopefully we can push through now, sit behind us in the past season and succeed."
Women lose sleep over this retirement savings fear
Despite the fact that survey participants have a clear idea of how they want to be cared for, few people talk to their relatives about it.
About half of the individuals in the Nationwide study said they were talking to their husbands about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said that they had talked to their children about it.
"People want a relative to take care of them, but they don't take the steps to have the conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide's life insurance business.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your husband and the children: You cannot prepare your family for care if you do not express your wishes long in advance.
Work with your adviser and your family to discuss where and how to receive care, since those choices can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Bring in your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you come up with a way to pay for those expenses.
Your long-term funding decisions may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid cash-value life insurance policy to help cover these expenses or self-insurance with your own abilities – as long as you have the money.
Work out your legal documents: Cut legal battles off at the pace.
Get a health care proxy in place so that you assign a trusted individual to oversee your medical care and ensure that experts meet your wishes if you can't communicate.
Consider also authorized for your finances.
Choose someone you trust to make financial decisions for you and to ensure that your accounts are paid if you are incompetent.
Do not forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medication and allergies?
Just spell out those details in a written plan so you're ready.
"It's not just the financial issues that are involved, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
What Is the Medication?
Who Will Care for the Dog?
Make sure that plan is in place."
Man shot several times in Ilfracombe with windbuck
A man was shot several times with a windbuck when he walked home after an evening out.
The victim, in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
Officials described the shooting, which took place at about 2:30 BST, as an "opportunistic act."
The victim did not see his attacker.
His injuries were not life - threatening, and the police asked for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed because of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, and it is expected that the death toll will rise.
With communication out of action, relief officers could not get any information from Donggala Regency, an area north of Palu closer to the center of the 7.5-volume quake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were brought to safety after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi Province, located at the point of a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is a regency that stretches along more than 300 km (180 km) of coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
Regency, an administrative region under a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the pillars of the Central Sulawesi province's economy, especially the coastal area of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province but is mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala were hit several times during the past 100 years by tsunamis, according to Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A Tsunami also struck West Donggala in 1996 and caused nine deaths.
Indonesia sits on the seismic Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the great earthquakes and tsunamis of the past few years:
2004: A major quake along the western coast of Indonesian Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26 that led to a tsunami that struck 14 countries led to 226,000 deaths along the coast of the Indian Ocean, with more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong quakes struck the western coast of Sumatra late in March and early in April.
Hundreds died in the island of Nias, along the coast of Sumatra.
2006: a 6.8th magnitude hit the south of Java, Indonesia was the most populated island, resulting in a tsunami that struck the southern coast and caused almost 700 deaths.
2009: A 7.6-volume quake struck near the city of Padang, capital of West Sumatra Province.
Over 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-volume quake struck one of the Mentawai islands, near Sumatra, which led to a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of towns and led to about 300 deaths.
2016: A flat shaking struck the Pidie Jaya Regency in Aceh and led to destruction and panic when people were reminded of the destruction of the deadly quake and tsunami in 2004.
This time it didn't lead to a tsunami, but more than 100 are dead because of buildings that have collapsed,
2018: Large quakes hit Indonesia’s tourist island of Lombok, with more than 500 deaths, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings, and thousands of tourists were temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin’s eldest son arrested charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaskan governor and vice-presidental candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of domestic violence.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested under suspicion of domestic violence, interfered with a report of domestic violence, and resisted arrest, according to a report issued by Alaska State Police on Saturday.
According to the police report, he took a woman's phone from her when she called the police to report the alleged crimes.
Palin is in custody at Mat-Su interrogation facility and is held at a $500 uninsured deposit, reports KTUU.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he declared "innocent, decided" when asked what he was arguing, the network reported.
Palin faces three class A violations, which means he can be imprisoned for up to a year and fined $250,000.
He is also charged with a class B offense, punishable by a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time criminal charges have been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported the alleged attack.
The matter is currently before Alaska’s Veterinary Court.
In January 2016 he was charged with domestic violence, interference with the report of a crime of domestic violence, and possession of a gun while he was drunk, in connection with the incident.
His girl claimed to have boxed her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after she linked her son’s behavior to PTSD as a result of his military service in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake tsunami: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-volume earthquake led to a tsunami that destroyed thousands of houses.
Electricity and communications networks are out of action with mortality rates expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck just outside central Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos circulate on social media that shows the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the beach.
Federal prosecutors seek rare death sentences for suspects in NYC terror attack
Federal prosecutors in New York are looking for the death sentence for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terrorist attack that killed eight people – a rare punishment that has not yet been carried out in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, reportedly used a Home Depot hire truck to launch an attack on a bicycle path along the West Side motorway in Laer Manhattan to cut off pedestrians and a cyclist who was on his way in October.
In order to justify a death sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "consciously" killed the eight victims and "consciously" inflicted serious physical injuries, according to the notice of intent to ask for the death penalty, filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both of those charges carry possible capital punishment, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury beat Saipov with 22 charges, which included eight charges of murder for extortion, typically used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and a charge of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "deep planning and forethought", said prosecutors, and described the way Saipov carried it out as "disgusting, cruel and perverse".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, damage and loss to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleveland, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," stated the notice of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
A decade has passed since the Southern District of New York legally prosecuted a capital offense.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was sentenced to the murder of two drug dealers but was finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were put to death after being sentenced to a conspiracy to execute spying for the Soviet Union during the cold war two years earlier.
Both Rosenberges were tarred with the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, demonstrated no repentance in the days and months after the attack, according to court documents.
He told detectives that he felt good about what he had done, the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the charges.
He also asked to show the ISIS flag in his hospital room, the police said.
He pleaded innocently on the 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal pro Deo lawyers representing Saipov, said that they were "naturally disappointed" with the persecution's decision.
"We think that the decision to request the death penalty rather than to accept a debt recognition to life imprisonment with no possible release, only the trauma of these events will prolong for all those involved." said Patton.
Saipov’s defense team had previously asked persecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory LP says NIGEL FARAGE should be placed in charge of Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage made a vow today to mobilize "the people's army" during a protest at the Tory conference.
The former Ukip leader said politicians had to "feel the heat" from Eurosceptics – since one of Theresa May's own LPs he had to be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backboner Peter Bone told the March in Birmingham that by the time the UK "would be out" as Mr. Farage Brexit secretary.
But the challenge that Mrs. May faces to unite her deep-seated officers was fomented by pro-Roman Tories by joining a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep her Chequers compromise plan on track in the face of attacks by Brexitians, Remainers and the EU.
Colleagues insisted that she would press the door in her attempt to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the death march – and force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and 'chaos'.
Mr. Bone told the Loop Mean Loop meeting in Solihull that he wanted to throw out Chequers.
He suggested that Mr. Farage be made a nobleman and given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
‘If he had been in charge, we would have been out by now,’ he said.
The Wellingborough-LP added: 'I'll get up for Brexit, but we have to throw out Chequers.'
He outlined his opposition to the EU and said: "We have not fought world wars to be submissive.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.'
Mr. Bone suggested that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: ‘The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to be happy is completely untrue.’
Tory Brexitian Andrea Jenkyns was also on the march and told reporters: ‘ I’m just saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
‘Chequers is unpopular with the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular with our party and our activists who actually bombard the streets and make sure that we are chosen in the first place.
Please let Chequers go and start listening.'
In a direct message to Mrs. May, she added: ‘First ministers must keep their work when they keep their promises.’
Mr. Farb told me that convention politicians had to feel the "heat" if they were on the threshold of wanting to violate the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
'It's about a matter of trust between us -- the people -- and our political class,' he said.
‘They are trying to betray Brexit and we are here today to tell them ‘we won’t let you get away with it’.
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: ‘I want you to make our political class, who is about to betray Brexit, feel the heat.
‘We are mobilizing the army of this country that has given us victory in Brexit and will not rest until we are an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.’
Meanwhile, Remainers marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour convention in the city center.
A few activists waved Tories against Brexit banners after the introduction of the group this weekend.
Workersman Lord Adonis mocked the conservatives for the security issues they had endured with a party application such as the conference opened.
'These are the people who tell us that they can have the IT systems and all the technology for Canada plus plus in place, for the frictionless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,' he added.
‘ It’s a total trick.
There's no such thing as a good Brexit,' he added.
Warren plans to ‘look hard’ to stand for President
U.S. Sen Elizabeth Warren says she'll "look hard to stand for president" after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts democrat talked about her future at a city hall meeting in Western Massachusetts Saturday.
Warren, a regular criticism of President Donald Trump, stands for reelection in November against GOP State Rep Geoff Diehl who was co-chairman of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She has been in the middle of speculation that she might challenge Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon’s event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with founders using the city hall format since Trump was in power.
An associate asked her if she was planning to stand for president.
Warren replied that it was time for women to go to Washington to correct our broken government, and that includes a woman at the top."
Arrested in shooting death of LSU's Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, L.A., announced on Saturday that a suspect was arrested in the shooting of LSU basketball player Wayne Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11 a.m. ET news conference.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help identifying a man who was seen in the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near Southern University campus early Friday.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound in the head and was finally killed as a result," said police chief Murphy J. Paul to the media via 247 sports Saturday.
Wayde stepped in to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and confessed that he was on the scene, owned a weapon, and confessed that he had shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and arrested at East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A 6-foot-6 youth who grew up in Baton Rouge played Sims in 32 games with 10 leading seasons and he maintained an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebound balls per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton captivated world title after team orders gave him his win over Sebastian Vettel
It became clear the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified Saturday before Lewis Hamilton when Mercedes's team orders would play a major role in the races.
From Pálposisie, Bottas had a good start and almost won for Hamilton as he defended his position in the first two turns and invited Fattel to attack his teammate.
Fattel entered the wells first and left Hamilton at the back of the bundle in traffic, something that must have been decisive.
The Mercedes found a round later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton went forward to wheel-on-wheel action that the Ferrari driver reluctantly left risk-free the inner sight at the risk of stamina after a double-movement to defend on the third corner.
Max Verstappen began from the back of the jump - off schedule and was seventh toward the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then led for a large part of the races as he held on to his tires to finish quickly and to pass Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He may have entered the wells on the 44th round, but he could not speed up his pace in the remaining eight laps as Raikkonen took fourth place.
It was said that it was a difficult day, because Valtteri did fantastically all weekend and was a real gentleman.
The team did exceptional work to have a one-two," said Hamilton.
It was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein at a convention on Saturday about her insistence that she did not leak Christine Blasey Ford's letter in which she accused High Court-nominated Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
The president spoke at a convention in West Virginia and did not directly address the testimony that Ford had given before the Senate Committee. Instead, he commented that what had shown in the Senate was "congregation and rude and liars".
"The one thing that can happen and the lovely thing that has gone on in the Senate over the past few days, when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry and mean and liars," he said.
"When you look at statements and leaks and then they say, "Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you leak?
Remember her answer... you leaked the document--"Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't lick it."
Well, wait a minute.
Did we lick it...No, we didn't lick it," he added, in a performance of the senator.
Feinstein was sent the letter that set out the charges back in July against Kavanaugh by Ford, and it was leaked earlier in September--but Feinstein denied that the leak had come down from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations. I didn't leak her story," Feinstein told the committee, reported The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential as she asked."
But the president did not approve of her denial and commented during Saturday evening's convention: "I tell you what.
Maybe she doesn't, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen."
The president continued to defend the Supreme Court-nominated, accused by three women of sexual misconduct, and proposed that the democrats use the charges for their own purposes.
"They are determined to take back with any necessary means.
You see the meanness, the rudeness, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to drive around to get power and control," Mediaites reported the president.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer threw two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars reconciled for Friday’s Elite League’s loss against Belfast Giants by winning the competition 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants received an early two-goal lead by throwing from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the home team together before Dwyer restored the Giants ’ leadership.
Francois Bouchard brought Dundee together before two Lukas Lundvald Nielsen goals secured their victory.
It was the third Elite League victory of the season for Adam Keefe’s men who lost first matches and when Friday evening Dundee 2-1 won in Belfast.
It was the fourth convention of the season between the sides, with the Giants winning the previous three matches.
Dwyer's open ball came in the fourth minute at 3:35 from a Kendall McFaull help, with David Rutherford offering the help when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In what was a busy opening period, Sullivan brought the home team back into play at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt became the supplier of Cawnie's equalizer at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants took the lead until the first break in when he threw his second purpose of the evening at the end of the first half.
The home team regrouped, and Bouchard again won them a match with a power play goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran stood together to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time in the game late in the second half and made sure of the win with his team’s fifth point halfway through the final half.
The Giants who now lost four of their last five matches are at home to Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies to make sure hundreds of aircraft can escape an earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is considered a hero after he died when he made sure that a plane carrying hundreds of people took off safely.
More than 800 people are dead and more are missing after a great earthquake Friday hit the island of Sulawesi, and caused a tsunami.
There are still strong aftershocks in the area, and many are trapped in ruins in the city of Palu.
However, despite his colleagues fleeing for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his position in the control tower that swung heavily at the Mutiara SIS Al-Jufri airport in Palu.
He remained unmoved to make sure that the Batik Air flight 6321, which was on the runway at that time, was able to rise safely.
He then jumped from the traffic control tower when he saw it collapsing.
He later died in the hospital.
Spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, says that the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, reported Australia’s ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Sadly, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our hearts are broken to hear about this," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death toll may reach the thousands with the country’s disaster relief agency saying that access to the towns of Donggala, Sigi, and Boutong is restricted.
"It is believed that the death toll is still rising since many corpses are still under the downfalls while many cannot yet be reached," said agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves up to 20 feet [6 m] pulled Palu who would hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring in help and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance body is brought in.
Clean water is scarce.
The minimarkets are looted everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is chasing to help survivors, but we don't know what they're going to find there.
It's already a tragedy, but it can get a lot worse."
Indonesia’s President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country’s military service: "I ask all of you to work day and night to complete every task related to evacuation.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Earlier this year Indonesia was struck by earthquakes in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini says if one man is missing after a lagoon plane crash
The airline that managed a flight that crashed into a Pacific coastal lake in Micronesia says now that one man was missing after they said earlier that all 47 passengers and crew safely evacuated the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon they could not account for a male passenger.
The airline said that they were working with local authorities, hospitals, and detectives to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped save the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at the Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people were taken to a hospital.
The airline said that six passengers stayed in the hospital on Saturday, and that all of them were in a stable condition.
The cause of the collapse and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both said that the plane landed near the runway in the lagoon.
Some witnesses thought that the plane had missed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said that the plane had come in very low.
"It's a special good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and the others managed to walk through middle - deep water to the emergency exits on the sinking plane.
He said that the air hostess panicked and screamed and that he had suffered a small head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that ships working close to improving a wharf also helped to rescue people back and forth before the plane sank in about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Air Safety Network indicate that 111 people have been killed in the last two decades in crashes of PNG-registered airlines, but Air Niugini had been involved in one.
Analysts set aside timeline for the evening that woman was burned alive
The state closed its case on Saturday in the retrial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice Analyst Paul Rowlett witnessed for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used cell phone records to put together the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of his death.
Rowlett said that he had received location data from different cell phones that showed that Tellis was together Chambers the night of her death, which contradicted his previous claims, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When data showed that his cell phone was at Chambers during the period he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday that he was not in the city that day.
When prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said "jok, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency is that Tellis said he knew Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Cell phone records indicated that they knew each other only for a week.
Rowlett said that a while after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He assured her from his life," said Hale.
The defense was scheduled to begin his final pleadings on Sunday.
The judge said that he expected the trial to go to the jury later that day.
The High Width: What is conscious hip-hop?
A hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative view of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, of Bristol, claims that hip-hop has moved away from its origins of political messages and addressing social issues.
They want to go back to the foundations and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have seen a recent revival in the UK by artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
NY-Kindrouf sues couple because she is fired for "racist" text
A New York nanny sued a couple for discriminating dismissal after she received a misaddressed message from the mother who complained that she was "another black person."
The couple deny that they are racist and compare the case with "oppression."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, was upset when she learned that the new child care provider, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived for her first working day in 2016.
"NEWEEEEEE ANOTHER A BLACK PERSON," Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a message.
Instead of sending it to her husband, however, she sent it to me twice, Maurice.
After discovering her error, a "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman fired me Maurice and said that their outgoing African-American nanny was doing bad work and that instead she was expecting a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Me Maurice was paid for her one day's work and then sent home with a Uber.
Now Maurice sues the couple for damages over the dismissal and seeks his damages up to the amount of $350 a day for the six months, resident work for which she was initially appointed, although it was without a contract.
"I want to show them, look, you don't do so well," she told the Post on Friday and added, "I know it's discrimination."
Relating to the claims that they were racist, the couple said that it was the reasonable thing to end Maurice’s employment and fear that after insulting her, they would not be able to trust her.
"My wife sent her something she didn't mean to say.
She's not a racist.
We're not racist people," said Joel Pasco the Post.
"But would you put your children in the hands of someone with whom you were rude, even though it was by mistake?
Your newborn?
Come on."
Plasco compared the matter to "oppression" and said that his wife would have had a baby in two months' time and was in a "very difficult situation."
"Are you going after such a person?
It's not a very nice thing to do," the investment banker added.
As the legal case continued, the court of public opinion had been quick to put the couple on social media and cut them off for their behavior and logic.
A new letter reveals that Paddington publishers feared that a talking bear would not link readers.
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who read it for the first time before it was published.
It's very entertaining that we know of Paddington's great success."
She said that her father would have been fiery if his job had been rejected. He was a BBC cameraman before he was inspired to write the children's book about the little toy bear. She added that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication after his death was "bittersweet".
About Paddington, who she describes as a "very important member of our family," she added that her father was quietly proud of his ultimate success.
"He was quite a quiet man and he wasn't an apple-gathering man," she said.
"But because Paddington was real to him, it was almost as if one had a child who had achieved something: you are proud of them, even though it is not your job.
I think he considered Paddington's success sort of that way.
Even though it was his creation and imagination, he always gave the honor to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying, and I had to say hello over the phone.
When she landed, her daughter was rushed to Nice’s Louis Pasteur 2-hospital where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad regularly called to say that it was really bad, that they didn't expect her to make it," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got the call from Nad to say that she would die within the next two minutes and that I should have greeted her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much, heart lamb.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medication the doctors gave her to keep her heart at bay was slowly running out of her system.
She was a while before she died and the body was shutting down.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing that it was unfolding.
I couldn't bark or cry, because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to hold it together."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who by then was hurting for the loss of her daughter, accompanied by the other passengers on board the plane -- unaware of the trial she appreciated.
"No one knew," she said.
"I had lowered my head and the tears fell all the time.
It's hard to explain, but I got an overwhelming sympathy for Nad on the run.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Sad women post cards to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones because of suicide are working to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been posting cards for a while on a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Me Davis ’ son Tyler was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and killed himself at 18.
"I want no parent to feel like I do every day," she said.
Me Davis, 45, lives in Lydney and said her son was a promising boss with an infectious smile.
"Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said that his smile had clarified any room."
However, he gave up work before he died, because he was "in a very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, then 11 years old, found his brother after he took his own life.
Me Davis said, "I constantly worry that there will be a domino effect."
Me Davis designed the cards, "to let people know that there are people out there to whom you can go and whom you can talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't sit in silence--you need to talk."
Me Humphreys, who has been a friend of Me Davies for years, lost Mark, her 15-year-old husband, not long after his mother's death.
"He didn't say he felt sick or depressed or anything," she said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his attitude.
He reached the lowest point on Christmas Day -- when the children opened their gifts, he didn't make eye contact or anything with them."
She said his death was very traumatic to them, but that they had to work through it: "It jerks a hole through the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we must all go on and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh’s future was still undecided as the FBI began to investigate
"I thought if we could actually get something like what he had asked for--a timeless investigation that had no cover--we could perhaps bring some unity," said Mr. Flake Saturday and added that he feared that the committee was falling "separate" among entrenched partisan congregated.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is all due to timing.
The inter-elections are only weeks away, on November 6th - if, as is expected, the Republicans fare badly, then they will be severely weakened in their efforts to find the man they want to have chosen to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush calls senators to influence them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House and who met his wife Ashley and was Mr. Bush’s personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI delivers its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It's not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get up to at least 50 votes on the Senate floor that will allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to break an equal play and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
North Korea overruns numbers ‘decreasing’ under Kim
The number of North Korean invaders to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, said a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-zeug quoted data from the South's unification cabinet and said that there were 1,127 last year of the war - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that stricter border control between North Korea and China and higher rates demanded by human smugglers was key factors.
Pyongyang made no public comment.
The vast majority of survivors from the North are finally offered South Korea civil rights.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most flight through Shina, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the high-protection demilitarized zone (DMS) between the two Koreas.
Shina views the invaders as illegal immigrants rather than refugees, often repatriating them with violence.
Relations between the North and the South who are still technically at war with each other have improved dramatically in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks centered around the cease -fire negotiations on the removal of nuclear weapons.
It came to the historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore when they agreed in broad terms to work together for the nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But North Korean Foreign Affairs Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed US sanctions on Saturday for the lack of progress since then.
"Without any confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances, there is no way that we will unilaterally disarm ourselves first," said Mr. Ri in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh hysterical, says he is unfit to serve in the Supreme Court.
Home minority leader Nancy Pelosi called High Court-nominated Brett Kavanaugh hysterical and said he was temperamentally incapable of serving at the Supreme Court.
Pelosi commented on Saturday in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help thinking that if a woman had ever acted this way, they would say ' hysterical'," Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate-Justice Committee Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied emotional accusations that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when both of them were teenagers.
During his opening declaration, Kavanaugh was very emotional and at times almost screamed and choked as he discussed his family and his high school for years.
He also strongly rejected Democrats on the committee and called the claims against him a "stupid and coordinated character assassination," organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton had lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that she believed that Kavanaugh’s testimony proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court because it showed that he was prejudiced against Democratic.
"I think he makes himself incompetent with those statements and the way he went behind the Clintons and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi hesitated when she was asked if she would try to sue Kavanaugh if he was confirmed, and if Democrats won the majority in the House of Commons.
"I'll say that -- if he doesn't tell Congress or the FBI the truth, then he's not qualified to be in the Supreme Court, but to be in the court he's currently in," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the D.C. Association Appeal Court.
Pelosi added that as a democrat, she was concerned about potential Kavanaugh decisions against the Act on Affordable Care or Ruf v. Wade as he was considered a conservative right.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh skipped questions about whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
"It's not time for a hysterical, prejudiced person to go to court and expect us to say, 'It's not wonderful,'" said Pelosi.
And women must handle it.
It's a righteous diatribe, months and years' anger that boils over, and she can't get it out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do you?"
She went on, "I was very helped by a woman who was an executive somewhere, who also said that she cried when she got angry, but developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and started crying, she would tell the person she was talking to, "You might think I was sad because I was crying.
I'm angry."
And then she just went on.
And I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are permitted as a partial exit for bridle because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my sharpest memories of an early work in a male-dominated office was where I once found myself crying with nameless anger and being caught by an older woman's neck--a cold manager I was a little afraid of--who dragged me into a t reported room.
"Never let them see you cry," she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think that you are sad and will rejoice, because they have had an effect on you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic Congresswoman from Kolorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught up in an extra-marital relationship on a boat called Monkey Business and he had to leave the races, I was very frustrated, realized that there was no reason why she could not investigate the idea that she could run for president.
"I didn't think well about the decision," she laughed at me 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another.
Someone called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarves."
Because it was late in the campaign, she was behind with find collections and so she made a vow that she would not enter the races unless she had collected $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters who gave men $1,000 would give her only $250.
"Do they think I'll get off?" she wondered.
When she gave her speech and announced that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was overwhelmed by emotions--grateful for the people who supported her, frustrated with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and target voters rather than delegates, and angry at sexism--that she had stabbed.
You would have thought I had a nervous breakdown," recalls Schroeder about how the press had reacted to her.
"You would have thought that Kleenex was my corporate bail.
I remember thinking, what are they going to do on my gravestone?
"She cried?"
How the US-Shina trade war might be good for Beijing
The opening salvo of the trade war between the US and China had been deafening and, while the battle is far from over, a disagreement between the countries may in the long term be beneficial to Beijing, say experts.
Donald Trump, the U.S. President, fired the first warning earlier this year by loading important Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
This week the most interesting escalation rolled in with new rates that affect $200 trillion (£150 billion) of items and effectively burdened half the goods that come into the US from China.
Beijing retaliated every time in goods and recently clapped rates from five to ten percent to $60 billion in American goods.
China has promised to match the US shot-by-shot and the world's largest economy is not going to move soon.
Getting Washington to stand back means surrendering to requests, but meeting the US's requests publicly will be too much of an embarrassment to Xi Jinping, China's president.
Experts continue to say that if Beijing plays its cards right, pressure over US trade war over the long term can positively support China by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
The fact that a rapid political decision in either Washington or Beijing can create the conditions that an economic twelve air can begin in any one of the countries is actually much more dangerous than spectators had previously confessed," said Abigail Grace, a research assistant focusing on Asia in the middle of New American Security, a thinker.
Syria ‘ready’ for refugees to return, says Minister of Foreign Affairs
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and appeals for help to rebuild the country that has been devastated by a war for more than seven years.
The Foreign Affairs Minister Walid al-Moualem said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly that conditions in the country were improving.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to restore to normal the areas destroyed by terrorists.
All conditions are now present for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that have targeted their daily lives and their existence.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
A further six million people still living in the country need philanthropic assistance.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime would welcome help to rebuild the flatlands.
But he stressed that it would not accept conditional assistance or help from countries that sponsored the invasion.
Europe Seals Knight Cup Victory in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup and Team U.S. with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The US has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a Knight Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe got the crown back when the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn’s team scored the 14.5 points they needed to win the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mikkelson, who struggled for most of the tournament, had his T-hold blown into the water at par-3,16th hole and gave up his match to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari excelled in all his rounds and became one of the 1-of-4 players to ever go 5-0-0 since the tournament's current format began in 1979.
U.S. Jordan Spieth was blown out 5&4 by the lowest-ranking player on the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The player with the world's highest rank, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 and 1 to land Poulter from England who may have played in his final Ryder Cup.
A veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spaniard Sergio Garcia, has become the tournament's European winner of any time with 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It had been a rough year.
So grateful for Thomas, who chose me and believed in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to get the cup back.
It's about the team and I'm glad I could help," said an emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He hands the torch over to his compatriot John Ram who, on Sunday, defeated U.S. golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in a single game.
The incredible pride I feel, to conquer Tiger Woods, I grew up and looked at that old one," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 career Ryder Cup record.
A strange statistic by one of the biggest players of all time and he won 14 big titles second to just Jack Nicklaus.
Team U.S.A. struggled all weekend to find the clean field with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau who played high-caliber golf throughout the tournament.
US-Captain Jim Furijk spoke after a disappointing performance on behalf of his team: "I'm proud of these guys.
There was a time this morning when we were putting a little heat on Europe.
We deleted.
Watch out for Thomas.
He's a wonderful captain.
