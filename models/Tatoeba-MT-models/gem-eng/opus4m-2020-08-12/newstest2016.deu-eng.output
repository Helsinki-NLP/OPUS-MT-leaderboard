Obama receives Netanyahu
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not exactly friendly.
The two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and Tehran's destabilising measures in the Middle East.
However, the meeting should also focus on the conflict with the Palestinians and the two-state solution discussed.
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been tense for years.
Washington criticises the ongoing settlement of Israel and accuses Netanyahu of a lack of will in the peace process.
The deal on the Iranian nuclear program proposed by Obama has further aggravated the relationship between the two.
In March, at the invitation of the Republicans before the U.S. Congress, Netanyahu gave a controversial speech that was sometimes considered to be an affront to Obama.
The speech was not agreed with Obama, but a meeting had rejected it with reference to the forthcoming elections in Israel.
In an emergency call, Professor confesses to having shot his girlfriend.
In an emergency call, Professor Shannon Lamb told the police, with a somewhat shivering voice, that he had shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house.
Lamb was important to emphasize that his "sweet dog" was still alive and probably excited, and he said that the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone.
Inside the house the officials found the body of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note that was scribbled on a white block: "I am so sorry, I wanted to, I could make it go back, I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me." This was according to the authorities in the letter, and he was signed by Lamb.
There was no indication that Lamb, who taught in two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already traveled 300 miles to the school grounds where, according to the police, he shot and killed a popular professor of history, Ethan Schmidt, at the door to his office.
Delta State University Chief of Police Lynn Buford said that university staff heard shooting at 10:18.
He said that Lamb made the fatal emergency call sometime after that.
Until the end of the day there was another death: Lamb took his life when the police chained him.
One day after the university shooting, which forced students and teachers to hide behind closed doors, the authorities are still trying to get a picture of what motivated Lamb.
The details published by the investigators at both ends of the state, as well as what students and employees who knew him, helped to draw an image of a talented but perhaps difficult teacher.
Students said they were looking forward to his lessons.
The police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, said he had no history of violence or a criminal history.
Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book written by him in which he mentioned the "wonderful people" with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History, whose teaching body includes 17 members, and many students attended courses of both.
At the same time, there were some tendencies to problematic behaviors.
A student, Brandon Beavers, who praised the Lamb, said that he also seemed a little excited and nervous, "as if something were wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that Lamb told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014-15.
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University to leave for health reasons and said that he had any health problem.
This year he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in the university's employment policy meant that the doctorate, who had worked so hard for the Lamb, would not provide him with a guarantee of an automatic path to an assistant professorship.
University President William LaForge said he didn't know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr Lamb's idea."
These are questions that the Lamb can no longer answer.
After the escape from the campus, the police later found Lamb's trail when he returned to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb killed himself with a .38 caliber gun in the backyard of a house about a mile south of his parents' house on the outskirts of Greenville, Mississippi, said Washington County Coroner Methel Johnson.
His car was still in the driveway.
It wasn't immediately clear why lamb went to this house, but Johnson said that she believed that he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb began his work at the university in 2009, which has 3,500 students in a city with about 12,000 inhabitants and taught geography and pedagogy.
He received his doctorate in pedagogics in spring.
One of the longtime friends of Lambs called him intelligent, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met with friends.
She and her friends were in high school, and he was the cool older guy who tried to teach her the guitar game for a few years.
He was the women's swarm at the time.
All the girls melted away when he was there," said Hairston, now 40 and living in the Jackson suburb of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss were obviously together for some time.
In the emergency call, Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but there was no record of a marriage.
They had a dog called Lightning, who lived with them in the brick house, adjacent to a Bayou in Gautier.
The police said the dog was fine.
The ex-husband of Prentiss, Shawn O'Steen, said they had been divorced 15 years ago, but had remained friends and had a daughter who was now 19 years old.
"She was totally destroyed on the ground," said O'Steen about his daughter.
She and her mother were absolutely best friends.
O'Steen said he never met Lamb, but through his daughter Abigail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail both appeared on a summer market three years ago.
Later they played one gig or another together.
O'Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked online for various companies.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a poorly lit bar near Gautier, said that he saw Lamb and Prentisss Night on the night of September 5 for the last time after Lamb had finished his guitar and harmonica game in front of a few audiences.
There were no signs that something was wrong.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We were cleaning up and joking with each other.
I mean, they both had a good sense of humor.
Schmidt, the dead professor, led the first semester seminar program and specialized in American natives and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at school.
He was married and had three small children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his Brotherhood and Student Committee.
On Tuesday evening, about 900 people attended the Delta State Campus in Cleveland, including lecturers, staff, students and members of the community.
Schmidt's wife Liz and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the memorial service while the university choir sang "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace".
The lessons will be resumed on Wednesday.
"We are trying to move our students to return," said LaForge.
The crisis is over.
This is a day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press Authors Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report.
This story was corrected to reflect that the police now say that Lamb made the emergency call after he shot Schmidt, and that Lamm in his emergency call called Prentiss called his wife, but there is no indication that the two have ever married.
Toys R Us plans to employ fewer workers for Christmas
Toys R Us says that there will not be as many Christmas season employees as last year, but the toy and baby products dealer says that he will give the current employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours.
The company said that it was planned to recruit 40,000 people in stores and distribution centers all over the country. During Christmas 2014, 45,000 workers were hired.
Most jobs will be part-time jobs.
The company said that it will start job interviews this month and the number of employees will rise from October to December.
While the holidays themselves are still months away, the Christmas business is getting closer, and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to equip stores with employees who sell, ship and deliver products.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his "date" with Princess Diana
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was a great moment for Michael J. Fox.
It was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in the theater waiting for the Royals, and I notice that the seat next to me is empty, and it becomes gradually clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me," he said in a trailer for a upcoming documentary "Back in Time".
The film begins, and it makes sense to me that I am a simulated ganien and an arm length away from being with the Princess of Wales on a date.
"Back in Time", a documentary on "Back to the Future", presents interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as with director Robert Zemeckis and producer Steven Spielberg.
"Back for the Future" premiered 30 years ago.
"It's really for me," said Spielberg, "indisputably the biggest time travel movie ever shot."
"Back in Time" will be shown on VOD, DVD and in selected cinemas in October.
UN Chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon says that his response to Russia's reinforced military support for Syria is: "There is no military solution" to the almost five-year conflict, and more weapons will only exacerbate violence and misery for millions of people.
The UN Chief once again calls on all parties, including the United Nations Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he is planning to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA, Russia, China, Great Britain and France - on the margins of the Ministerial Meeting of the General Assembly this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He regretted that the divisions in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers "make this situation insoluble."
Ban called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in the handling of the crisis in Syria that they demonstrated in reaching a nuclear deal with Iran.
8 Surveys show that Donald Trump is to be taken seriously.
Some tried to brand him a flop.
Others have taken him as a joke.
And some are waiting for a collapse.
But no matter how some Republicans try to pull Donald Trump from the top ranks of surveys down, it has (still) not worked.
Ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Trump leading in the double-digit area, and some start to seriously ask themselves what it means for the chances of nominating the real estate mogul.
Of course, it is still too early in the election period.
Nobody claims that Trump is likely to win Republican nomination.
Experts stress that at this time in 2011, Rick Perry's leadership was given to the rising Herman Cain, none of whom won even one state in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election.
But outside groups like Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the conservative business group Club for Growth now recognize Trump's perseverance and start running their dollars to overthrow him.
Here are some current survey values that indicate that the real estate Mogul is not just a temporary phase:
Trump's popularity values have turned 180 degrees.
Shortly before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a survey by the Monmouth University showed that only two out of ten Republicans saw the real estate mogul positively.
By mid-July it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August it was 52 percent.
Now six out of ten Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump.
About three out of ten say they have a negative opinion.
And these numbers stay in early states.
A Quinnipiac vote in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of Republicans have a good opinion of Trump.
Two thirds of GOP voters would be happy with Trump as candidates.
In a CNN/ORC survey last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be either "enthused" or "satisfied" if Trump were nominated.
Only two out of 10 say they would be "enraged" if he were the candidate.
Only Ben Carson creates about the same enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they are "enthusiast" vs. 40 percent who say the same about Trump).
The next in the matter of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say that they would be "unsatisfied" or "enraged" if Jeb Bush, the favorite of the establishment, would be the candidate.
A majority of Republicans don't see Trump's temper as a problem.
While Donald Trump is widely criticized for his bombastic and insulting statements, 52 percent of Republican voters believe that the real estate Mogul has the right temperament for a president, says ABC News/Washington Post on Monday.
The same number applies in the first pre-election state of the nation, the state of Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think he has the personality for a commander-in-chief, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Nevertheless, 44 percent think that he does not have the personality to perform his duties effectively, and almost six out of 10 independents say that his temper does not fit into the White House, says ABC/Post.
Republican voters get used to the idea.
When they put on their scholarly hats, Republican voters think Trump is real.
When asked who won the GOP nomination most recently, after a survey by CNN/ORC from last week, four out of ten say Trump is the best bet.
This is a change since the time when four out of ten at the end of July put their money on Jeb Bush.
Complete disclosure: GOP voters did not have the clearest crystal sphere in the past.
At this point in the last cycle, four out of ten Republicans thought that Rick Perry would win the nomination compared to only 28% for the final candidate Mitt Romney.
Nevertheless, a large number of GOP voters consider Trump's campaign to be plausible.
Even if the Republicans gathered for another candidate, Trump still beats almost everyone.
Some experts point out that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to Trump's leadership, while anti-Trump support is diffusely distributed to more than a dozen other candidates.
But a survey of the Monmouth University in early September shows that in a hypothetical head-to-head race between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump reaps the majority support.
He has 13 points ahead of Carly Fiorina, before Marco Rubio 14 points, before Walker 15 points, before Jeb Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie 33 points.
It's a head-to-head race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who beats him?
Ben Carson would overtake the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypothetical head-to-head race.
A tight majority of Donald Trump fans say that they have formed their opinion.
A new survey by CBS/NYT on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of the voters who support Trump say that they have given their votes firmly.
Of course, much can happen to change that, and no one can really say never to change their mind.
46 percent said they left the door open to switch to other candidates.
Nevertheless, Trump's strongest competition at the moment is the other outsider, the neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say that they have formed their opinion are twice as common for Trump.
Six out of ten Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico "violent" in his campaign peace two months ago, immigration was a turning point in public discourse on 2016.
Some are concerned that the bombastic expression of Trump will keep decisive Hispano Americans away from the Republican Party and will damage the reorientation efforts.
But after the new ABC/Post survey of Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So as long as immigration remains in the spotlight, Donald Trump seems to be doing it too.
Frustration over the government climbs to new peaks.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson now account for about half of the support of Republican voters, mainly through their external status.
Six out of ten Republicans say in the new Monday survey of ABC/Post, they prefer a political outsider than someone with government experience.
And they're also angry at Washington.
A survey of Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago shows that three out of four Iowa Republicans are frustrated by the Republicans in Congress, with 54 percent "unsatisfied" and 21 percent "holiganized".
Munich, Sylt and Co.: The five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
Here in the Hobokenweg is the most expensive residential complex - with a view over the North Seawatt.
In the street, an average square meter of a roof house costs 73,300 euros.
"On Sylt, the offer of objects is naturally limited", says the study - therefore the high price.
A new study shows in which particular locations a square meter costs the most.
Of course, 18,70 euros per square metre for a student bid in Munich are not really little.
Unlike Germany's top places, however, one of the prizes is like Peanuts.
The real estate service provider Engel & Völkers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residences - with square meter prices in dizzying heights.
There are several tens of thousands of euros of nothing - per square meter, well noted.
But well, who can afford it...
By the way, Munich is exceptionally not the top.
Champions League: Bayern Dream Start thanks to Müller and Götze
Double goalkeepers in Piraeus: Bayern-Star Thomas Müller just has a run.
A lucky hit by Thomas Müller paved the way for a deserved 3:0 at Olympiako's Piraeus - then it went.
A sovereign start to the Champions League season.
The world champions Thomas Müller and Mario Götze gave the FC Bayern a dream start to the "Mission Milan" in the hex boiler of Piraeus.
The team of Trainer Pep Guardiola won their first match in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympiakos in hot atmosphere thanks to Müller's double pack (52./90.+2) and Götze's hit (89.) earned with 3:0 (0:0).
The 12th start-up success in the series is expected to be the first step towards the final on May 28, 2016 in Italy, where Guardiola finally wants to get the handle pot to Munich in the third race.
Müller received good help from Olympiakos-Torwart Roberto in his 28th hit in the Champions League for the Bayern Tour, which caused a shooting of the World Champion, thought to be a flank.
"We will not underestimate them," promised Bayern captain Philipp Lahm before the game in Karaiskakis Stadium before 31,688 hot-blooded fans - and the Munichers kept their word.
They showed a concentrated and committed vision without shining.
Piraeus had won his most recent six home games in the royal class, including against renowned clubs such as Manchester United, Atlético Madrid or Juventus Turin.
In 2011, Borussia Dortmund (1:3) also stumbled.
But the Bayern, in seven European Cup duels undefeated with Greek teams, did not want to be the next victim.
They courageously responded, but in their offensive efforts they often went to work indiscriminately.
The attacks were too often initiated by shift of the game on Douglas Costa, who rarely got through against the former Braunschweiger Omar Elabdellaoui.
Müller had more luck from the right than his flank from the right half in the upper left corner.
In the 67th minute the World Champion forgave the possible 2:0.
Robert Lewandowski had the best opportunities in half one.
First, when Olympiakos stormman Ideye Brown beat Poland's headball off the line (26).
Then by direct removal, the Gatekeeper Roberto paired with the knee (35.).
Although the Bayern used to raise her dominant game, Piraeus could put needlesticks.
However, Manuel Neuer was dependent on Gatekeeper.
For example, when he directed a shot of Ideye over the latte (56.).
Before Newer, Guardiola had a four-chain with David Alaba defend in the center next to Jerome Boateng, who did well.
Mario Götze, after muscular problems back in the cadre, sat outside first.
The World Cup hero only gave green light after the final training, said sports director Matthias Sammer at "Sky": "Who wants to make something else out of it, that's already evil."
During the first change, Guardiola decided against him when he brought Kingsley Coman for the beaten Lewandowski (59th).
Götze came late for Arturo Vidal (76) and made it clear 13 minutes later, per eleven meters Müller put another one on it.
Before the game it had come to Krawallen in the stadium.
After a small group of partially disguised Bayern fans in their audience block apparently provoked the supporters of hosts Piraeus with words and gestures, the security forces intervened and went with batons against the Munich supporters.
At least one Bayern fan was injured from the stadium.
Who smokes has a higher risk of losing teeth
Anyone who smokes not only harms the lung, but also the teeth - this suggests a Potsdam long-term study.
The good news: In case of renunciation, the risk decreases rapidly.
Smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early.
This is reflected in the long-term study of an international research team, including several employees of the German Institute for Nutritional Research (DIfE) in Potsdam.
Compared to non-smokers, smoking was at risk of losing their teeth prematurely in order to increase the 2.5- to 3.6-fold.
The scientists had observed more than 23,300 participants.
The main causes of tooth loss are caries and inflammation of the gums, the DifE emphasizes.
Smoking is a risk factor for this periodontitis, the authors stress.
The relationship between smoking and loss of teeth is therefore due to more frequent gum inflammation in smokers.
It is not clear to what extent smoking also increases the risk of caries.
However, people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk within a short time, writes the researchers in the "Journal of Dental Research".
However, it could take more than ten years for the risk to fall back to the level of non-smokers, explained first author Thomas Dietrich of the English University of Birmingham.
One had to convince people to become non-smokers, said study director Heiner Boeing of the DifE: "Smoking reduces the life span."
Not to smoke is good for lungs and vessels and, according to our knowledge, also leads to good dental health until old age.
In Germany, over 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 are affected by toothlessness, DifE reported.
Previous investigations have already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss.
The new long-term study underpins the findings.
Archaeologists encounter remnants from late antiquity at Cologne’s Rheinuper
Archaeological findings have been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne for several times.
Near the construction site for the new Rheinboulevard, archaeologists of the Roman Germanic Museum have excavated skeletons and remains of historical buildings, said Museum Manager Marcus Trier on Tuesday.
Since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine, historians have been looking for so-called ground monuments.
In all construction projects in the district of Cologne, the museum is always appointed as a specialist in the field of archaeological conservation.
In the third phase of the Rheinboulevard the archaeologists have now been found.
It has already been known from text documents that in the place in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century a church stood, explained Trier.
In addition to the remains of the fortress and the church tower, a cemetery with about 350 graves had been discovered, which probably belonged to the church.
Young woman covered by freight train
After a young woman's accident at the train station in Geilenkirchen-Lindern, the federal police ask the population for assistance.
On the early Wednesday morning at 1:40 a.m., the woman crossed the track from the station building at the end of the platform and was caught by a freight train coming from Mönchengladbach.
According to the Federal Police, by recording the train, she suffered the most serious injuries from it.
She was treated as an emergency doctor on site and was taken to a hospital by rescue personnel.
There is no knowledge of the reason for the nightly crossing of the young woman's tracks to the investigating officials.
The incident may have been observed by witnesses or residents have heard acoustic perceptions.
Residents or passers-by come from Linderner Bahn, Ziegelbäckerweg, Thomashofstraße and Leiffarther Straße (L364).
Information about the cause of the accident can be given under the free and 24-hour hotline of the federal police by telephone 0800/6888000 or any other police station.
EU Commission proposes new court in dispute over TTIP
In order to alleviate the dispute over the planned TTIP Transatlantic Free Trade Agreement, the EU Commission has proposed a major reform of the current arbitration system.
The disputed private conciliation bodies for disputes between corporations and states are therefore to be replaced by a more transparent system which, in its functioning, corresponds significantly to more traditional courts.
"We want to set up a system that the citizens trust," said EU Commissioner Cecilia Malmström in the performance.
Sweden intends to include the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the USA.
The German government announced support.
TTIP will create the largest free trade area in the world with 800 million people.
The plans for reforming the current arbitration procedures specifically provide for the EU Member States and the US to elect independent judges for a new investment court.
They are to come in equal parts from the EU, the USA and third countries.
A second instance is foreseen for the first time.
It would allow an objection to be raised against judgments.
So far, the parties to the proceedings have agreed on arbitrators, and there was no possibility of opposition to their judgments.
In the discussion over the past few months it had become clear that citizens did not trust the old ISDS system in terms of fairness and justice, said Malmström.
In the long term, it intends to work towards an International Investment Court, according to its own data.
There, for example, disputes between Chinese companies and EU countries could also be resolved.
The investor-state arbitration proceedings (ISDS) demanded by large companies are considered to be one of the main reasons for the major resistance in Europe to TTIP.
Traditional arbitration courts are criticised by opponents as a kind of parallel justice, by which companies claim damages to taxpayers, by legislating national laws or by enforcing a reduction in consumer and environmental standards.
In its first opinions, anti-TTIP organisations such as Campact identified the Commission's proposals as insufficient.
In particular, it was criticised that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada (Ceta).
On the other hand, the German Secretary of State for Economic Affairs Matthias Machnig (SPD) described the plans as great progress.
The Commission took into account key points raised by Federal Minister for Economic Affairs Sigmar Gabriel in the spring with other EU trade ministers.
The old system of private arbitrators is off the table.
The French government also welcomed the plans of Malmström.
The European Business Europe Association warned against restricting the opportunities for business to complain through too many new rules.
In particular, small and medium-sized enterprises could be disadvantaged by this, it said.
When discussions on the TTIP (Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership) Free Trade Agreement can be concluded, Wednesday remains unclear.
Negotiations have been in progress since mid-2013.
However, the issue of investor protection has not been discussed with the US so far.
Initially, a framework for the agreement should be in place by the end of this year.
This date is considered to be unsustainable.
Delicate Folk of Sufjan Stevens in Hamburg
Eleven years ago Sufjan Stevens is on stage at the Cologne Prime Club (today: Luxor).
Next to him is a flipchart on which the shy-looking folk singer recorded the picturesque U.S. state of Michigan with felt pen.
The entire audience, about 40 people, is almost caught up in Steven's lecture.
He tells on the basis of various places he records repeatedly on the map what his minute and delicately arranged songs tell about.
Where they came from and what it looks like in his home.
Since then Stevens has proved to be a wonderfully creative fool.
With the third album "Greetings from Michigan: The Great Lake State" released in 2003, smartly composed songs appear that are harmoniously close to the American folk of the late Sixties, but can drift into the great opulent at any time.
There is the rumor that "Michigan" would be the first part of a humiliated series: each of the 50 U.S. states should be sung in a row.
But already in 2004 and near the Rhine, "Seven Swans" has already appeared and breaks certain expectations positively.
Reduced Stevens' performance here.
Live enough guitar and banjo.
A year later, the musician living in New York returns to the series.
With "Illinois" ("Sufjan Stevens Invites You To: Come on Feel The Illinoise") in 2005, a comprehensively celebrated masterpiece appeared.
Overboard with ideas and stylistic finesse.
The album enters the American Billboard charts and is not missing in any year's best list of influential music media.
After extremely productive experiments Stevens then uses "The Age of Adz" (2010) very extensive electronic offsets.
This sixth neat studio album is still broad orchestrated, but worn by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effect and hall.
Long ago the smaller clubs emerged, the stage shows here become a colorful spectacle of neon headbands and large fluorescent stage decoration.
Sufjan Stevens is currently touring through Germany as part of a five-member band.
In the dark Hamburger Mehr!
He mainly presents the "Carrie & Lowell" which has been available since March.
Although almost 2,000 guests are now banished here in their chairs, Stevens, who has become more mature, returns to intimacy and to the folk.
Without a word to the audience, the group of excellent musicians plays through the wide-enriched album.
You can hear from the audience: The talk is "opulent" and you can throw away the "plate in essence".
First, Stevens gives a modest thank-you, plays a few older songs acoustically and finally bows down with a loud applause.
Jeremy Corbyn's debut at the Prime Minister's Question Time
Since his election, Mr Corbyn's debut is eagerly expected at the Prime Minister's Question Time
The new Labour Chairman Jeremy Corbyn is scheduled to make his debut at the Prime Minister's Question Time and make his first appearance with David Cameron.
Mr Corbyn will rise to ask the first of his six pre-set questions shortly after noon, with his performance being checked by the media probably and the Labour MEPs from nearby.
He called for "less theatre and more facts" at this weekly event.
He also said that he could skip some meetings to leave them to colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary examination for Mr. Corbyn's leadership, since she will come after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TUC Annual Meeting on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, on Tuesday during the National Anthem singing at a celebration of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain, the Labour President's decision to continue to criticise a number of Tory-MPs has provoked criticism and is the focus of several headline stories in the newspapers.
Mr. Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem has drawn attention to himself.
A spokesperson from Mr. Corbyn said he had "stand in a respectful silence" and he recognized the "Herence of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England".
But a member of Mr. Corbyn's shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told in the BBC Two Newsnight program that he had advised the Labour chairman to sing the national anthem, "independent" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Almost a dozen shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr. Corbyn's top team, calling for differences in economics, defence and foreign policy, while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party originally supported him as leader.
The BBC’s political correspondent Robin Brant says that political differences also "stitch" within Labour, according to Mr. Corbyn’s comments on the position on the European Union and the limitation of profits.
Mr. Corbyn said to the TUC conference that Labour is presenting changes to remove the whole idea of a total restriction.
Hours later, Mr. Smith, the shadow labour and pension ministers, said that the party was "very clear" that it was only against the government plans to reduce the limit from £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth Labour Chairman, who has been facing David Cameron since he was Tory-Chief in the last decade across the dispatch box in Parliament.
The Labour President, who has promised another policy approach, says that he has "crowd-sourced" ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and has been given more than 30,000 suggestions.
The Islington North MP has said that the Prime Minister's question hour is too confrontational, and that it will not be "stricken" and the dispute with reluctance and instead has committed itself to focusing on serious problems such as poverty, inequality and the challenges for young people.
Mr Corbyn has said that Angela Eagle, the shadow economic minister, will represent him if he does not participate - for example when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad.
He also brought up the idea that other colleagues would occasionally take the floor and that he would address John Bercow, the spokesman of the House of Commons, to discuss the problem.
When he became a leader in 2005, Mr. Cameron said that he wanted to get rid of politics in the style of a "Kasperle theater" often associated with the Prime Minister's Question Time. But a few years later, he admitted that he had failed in it.
Since it was first broadcast on television in 1990, the question hour with the Prime Minister was regarded as the most important barometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the House of Commons and his position among his fellow Members, although critics argued that it had become a cartoon and needed far-reaching reforms.
Shooting in Joburg: homeless young people trained as photographers
The city center of Johannesburg is a hard place when you are homeless.
But a group of former street children has found a way to learn a skill and thus earn a living.
"I was shot in Joburg" (I was shot in Joburg) is a non-profit studio that teaches homeless youths how to take pictures of their surroundings and gain a profit from them.
BBC News has met one of the first graduates of the project.

Pounds rise by accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
The pound rose sharply according to data showing an increase in the UK's wage growth. In parallel, the FTSE 100 was increased by the SABMiller bid target.
Between May and July, earnings without bonuses grew by 2.9% in the United Kingdom compared to the same period of the previous year.
Since 2009, this percentage has been the fastest and made estimates of the time of an increase in interest rates.
The pound rose by more than 1% compared to the dollar to $1,5505 and had climbed up to 0.84% compared to the euro to €1,3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed with an increase of 1.49% to 6.229.21.
SABMiller was the outstanding share on the market and made a 20% jump after the acquisition offer of Rivalen AB InBev had been received.
A transaction would combine the two largest breweries in the world and bring together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares were 0.9% higher after encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods Richemont.
Richemont's latest sales figures beat all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Burberry - again reported growth.
Shares of Glencore increased by 5% after the mining giant said he had taken $2.5 billion through a stock sale as part of his debt reduction strategy.
The shares of the packaging and paper group Mondi were the largest losers on the index, with a decrease of 4.3%, after Goldman Sachs had put his assessment of the company's rating on "sales".
JD Sports increased by 3.1% after the sportswear company had reported a pre-tax profit of 46.6 million for the six months.
The head of JD Sports says that higher wages jeopardize expansion.
The CEO of JD Sports Peter Cowgill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean "more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers".
But it is unlikely that this purchasing power will offset the higher labour costs of his company, he says.
The costs could meet the expansion plans of JD Sports, he added, and this could mean that there are fewer additional jobs.
Justin Bieber in the capital: on Bieber expedition in Berlin
Justin Bieber, Megastar.
Lappish 21 years old, a prisoner with upper-legged frieze.
The guy with the platinum blonde hair is 100 million euros heavy.
More than that.
Currently, Monsieur Bieber is in Berlin.
And the generation U17 is going through.
Like Viktoria Rudzinska.
The 15-year-old has never heard the name "Ritz Carlton".
Not bad.
Hundreds of fans accompanied Justin yesterday.
Including Ewa and Viktoria from Poland.
Since 7 o'clock in the morning, however, the Polin sits on the cold stone plates form Berlin's luxury hotel at Potsdamer Platz.
The Bieber-Bau: Here you live Idol, whose posters hang in Stettin, since Monday evening.
The suite where the Canadian singer lives costs as much as her mother Ewa earns for half a year a day.
If at all.
She says, "In fact, my Victoria would have to sit in the tenth grade in high school."
"I'll make her a dream."
School duty?
Who's fucking it?
The fans don't.
Not even Bieber himself.
He's been taking care of it anyway.
For the commercials during the commercial break of the Superbowl he spent three million, a two-year deal with an anti-pickle company washed many, many dollars into the beaver account.
And with every doll that looks like him and goes over the barn table, Bieber also collects.
When Justin Bieber drinks a coffee, you marvel at the window.
He's said he'd taken more than 100 million.
Some say the hype went too far.
Others stress that Bieber was finally in the United States and Great Britain with his new single "What do you mean?" in 1st place.
Bieber himself, whose fourth album will follow in November, does not interest the many zeros at first.
At least he does.
Pegida-Plakat brings Lebanese on potato-field toner idea
Potatoes or doughnuts?
It is both possible - in the cardboard paint that Oldenburger Imbisowner Hani Alhay has developed.
Inspired by the saying "cartaffe instead of donner" on a poster of the Pegida movement, Alhay put potatoes and meat together on a spear.
He was introduced to the idea by a poster on a pegida demonstration with the inscription "cartiffs instead of donners", which he had accidentally seen on television.
Since then, in his shop there is a grilled skewer, which is filled with meat and potatoes.
"This is multicultural for the stomach," says Alhay.
The idea has now been registered with the Patent Office in Munich.
According to the authority, it has recently been protected as a utility model.
Therefore, Alhay does not want to reveal how much meat and how many potatoes the spear contains.
Just so much: "It tastes even better together," he finds.
The culinary understanding of peoples is also well received by its customers.
Metcash launches Soil Resistance Campaign to Combat Aldi Invasion
Metcash is trying to protect the IGA from an Aldi march in South Australia and Western Australia.
Food wholesaler Metcash has launched a soil resistance campaign to defend the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a $700 million Aldi invasion.
While Aldi is preparing the opening of two distribution centres and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening their relations with local food suppliers and building the IGA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing via social media, as well as events like Adelaide show.
IGA dealers and suppliers jump on board, with brands such as ice manufacturer Simmo from Dunsborough, which distributes samples in IGA stores and sells shop owners the cheap tickets for the South Australian football league to loyal customers.
Metcash is expected to publish further details of its defence strategy on September 29th when the wholesaler of food, alcohol and equipment carries out his annual investor strategy day.
There is a lot at stake, as South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30 percent of Metcash's IGA stores and generate higher profit margins than Metcash's IGA network in the Eastern states.
Buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are notoriously provincial and IGA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in the Eastern countries.
However, analysts like Morgan Stanley believe that 12 months after the opening of its first markets, Aldi will take away about five percent of the food market in these two countries and will take away sales from all existing players, but mainly independent retailers.
According to a report published this week, analyst Tom Kierath of Morgan Stanley estimated that IGA retailers could lose $360 million of revenue per year and Metcash $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA next year and generate sales of $500 million and $600 million in each market.
The loss in food and groceries and in the amounts on Metcash's high fixed-cost basis could cost Metcash about $13 million before interest and taxes, said Mr. Kierath.
At the same time, Metcash loses market shares in the East, mainly in Aldi and Coles, although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that IGA buyers are the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley assumes that Metcash's sales in the food and food business will fall by 3.8 percent in 2016, by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, and will reduce the market share from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, the leading fund manager Hamish Douglass, founder of the Magellan Financial Group, told a business meal in Melbourne that Metcash would probably disappear within a decade. Metcash disappeared.
Metcash refused to respond publicly to Mr. Douglas's comments.
But it's assumed that a Metcash board member contacted Mr. Douglas last week.
Since 2010, IGA’s market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent, and revenue from Metcash’s food and food trade, which supplies about 1,200 IGA retailers, has fallen by 43 percent since 2012, reflecting the operational debt reduction at the same time as pressure on sales and margins.
However, the wholesaler resists and invests more than $150 million to match selling prices with Coles and Woolworths in hundreds of products each week and to improve IGA retailers in improving their stores through faster growing fresh food and providing a better choice of private label foods.
Metcash's main manager Ian Morrice says that the price adjustments and shop refurbishment programs will be added to Elan and hopes that the wholesaler will return to profit growth for the first time in 2017 in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis is supported by the President of the Australian Tennis Association Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves more praise than criticism of his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the "collateral damage" in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyrgios and, according to the president of the Australian tennis association Steve Healy, deserves more praise than criticism of his own behavior.
Kokkinakis, the younger of the talented duo, who is often referred to as "Special Ks", fell into the limelight at the Montreal Masters due to the infamous confrontation of Kyrgios with Stan Wawrinka.
In a fiery qualifying game in Cincinnati soon after, Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated twice by the referee, with Harrison shouting: "Wawrinka should have beaten Kyrgios, and I should have beaten the child."
While he was last seen smashing a tennis bat after a seizure destroyed a potential U.S. open victory by Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was steadfastly defended by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam Groth for second place in detail behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup Final against Great Britain.
"One thing I'm quite mature about is the fact that, in my opinion, Thanasi has been a little involved in the dispute," Healy said.
He broke a bat when he lost to the U.S. Open because of a cramp, but he's not the first player to break a fight of frustration with himself, and I know Thanasi well enough to know that he's not proud of it.
But, really, he has behaved extremely well in the US Open, even under the rather provocative circumstances with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves a lot of recognition.
He's got a great team around him, he's got a great family around him, and I think he's been treated a little too hard.
He is a very mature 19-year-old, he works very hard, and he fits into the team and so on, he's never had a problem with the other players, he's respected in the dressing area, he's trained hard, he's good in shape, he's a very stable and mature young guy, and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own merits.
Healy also supported the decision not to take Kyrgios into account in the important preliminary decision that begins on Friday, and he describes the "common decision" as the right one for all, but he assures the man from Canberra to return to the team as a long-term fixed component."
"First we wish that the team is fully focused on the competition and not on all the controversy around [Kyrgios]," Healy said.
And I think Nick has made the rise very quickly, which people like Federer and Murray have pointed out. He rises in the eyes of the public, and he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we try to support him, we try to make him understand the consequences of his action. Some time outside the spotlight, in which he can only think about it, I think it's appropriate, and it's best for the team and it's best for him.
Europe's refugee crisis: Hungary declares emergency, closes the border, detains refugees
Hungary declared the emergency and closed the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all those who tried to enter the country illegally. All with the aim of stopping the influx of migrants.
Chaos followed the border when hundreds of migrants gathered in no one's country and Serbian officials responded with outrage.
For an unknown time, the people who fled from violence were trapped in a strip of land on the road between the two checkpoints of the countries and built tents and settled there.
But frustrations increased.
When a police helicopter hovered over them, the migrants ransacked "Open the Border!" and shouted insults against the Hungarian response police.
Some rejected food and water from protest.
Serbia's Foreign Minister said it was "unacceptable" that migrants from Hungary would be sent back, while more and more from Macedonia and Greece would arrive.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution and not a collapseal damage.
Talks with Brussels and other countries will have to take place in the coming days," said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The turbulence at the Hungarian-Serbian border did not agree on a common immigration policy one day after the 28-Nation bloc in a disputed meeting in Brussels.
Ministers agreed, however, to share responsibility for 40,000 people seeking refuge in overcrowded Italy and Greece, and expressed their hope that, at last, next month or by the end of the year, an agreement would be reached that the EU countries would take up another 120,000 refugees, including some from Hungary.
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the continent's immigration crisis.
However, Hungary did not hope for an early action by Brussels or its neighbours.
The emergency situation in two southern regions, declared on Tuesday, gave authorities more powers to deal with the crisis, so that they could block roads and speed up asylum procedures.
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said in the meantime that his country was also planning to build a barbed wire fence along its border with Romania to stop the influx of migrants through the country - after it had completed a fence at the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prison inmates were used in the race to build the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, for many refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East, Hungary has become a significant congestion and an entry point into the European Union.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has insisted that most of the incoming economic refugees are seeking a better life, and not war refugees entitled to protection - a view that strongly contradicts other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws, which came into force in Hungary at midnight, make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4-meter (13-foot) fence that the government had built along the southern border with Serbia a crime. These laws also impose higher prison sentences for convicted traffickers.
"Due to the situation created by mass migration, the Hungarian government explains the emergency situation," said government spokesman Zoltan Kovac's reporters in the southern town of Szeged.
We say it very clearly: illegal border crossing is a crime.
Parliament still has to agree to the military's use, which is expected for next week, but Associated Press reporters have seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs on the border for days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, State Security Advisor for Orban, said that authorities caught 45 people trying to cross the border, 15 others had already invaded the country deeper.
They come over by damaging the fence, they are now in police custody and are accused of committing crimes under the new laws.
Authorities are in the process of repairing the fence quickly.
Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after a train wagon with barbed wire had arrived to close the borders.
Chaos surrounded the most important border crossing near Roszke, Hungary, when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and pressed a crowd to get in there.
Some 20 managed to get in, but thousands remained outside.
Another group of migrants blocked Serbia and Hungary's main motorway connection and said that they would refuse food and water until they were allowed to enter Hungary.
Election-2016: Hillary Clinton's lead ahead of Bernie Sanders in national poll halved
Former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double-digit lead in the democratic race for the nomination at national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders wins over her.
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of democratic voters in the preliminary elections (58 percent before), while Sanders is second in position, with 27 percent (up 17 percent).
Vice-President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he is running for the presidential office, is supported by 15 percent of the democratic voters in the pre-election.
More than five months before the start of the preliminary elections, most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is clear as to which candidates they will support.
But Clinton's supporters are more persistent in their election than those of the other candidates.
Since the CBS News survey, Clinton has lost in a number of demographic groups, while Sanders has made some profits.
Clinton holds a big lead in women and moderates, but these advances have decreased.
Their support for the men has fallen significantly, and Sanders is only back here with 5 points.
Clinton's advantage among democratic voters under 50 years of age has fled, and she and Sanders are now at the same level.
Clinton, however, still has a great advantage among the older voters.
Last month Clinton was ahead of Sanders with double-digit advantage among the liberals, but Sanders now has a 5-point advantage with this group.
About half of the democratic voters in the country say that they would be enthusiastically supporting Clinton if it were nominated by the party.
A quarter would support her with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support her because she is the candidate.
Six percent would not support them.
Perhaps not surprisingly, Clinton's current supporters are particularly enthusiastic about her.
The views are more mixed among those who do not currently support Clinton - only about a quarter would support it enthusiastically.
While 48 percent of democratic voters say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm, less republican voters say this about their top candidates Donald Trump (35 percent).
If Clinton's supporters are asked in an open question why they want her to be the candidate, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), followed by the view that it is time for a woman to become president (13 percent) and that she is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton's supporters also mention their connection with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
Consent to dealing with the problems and the ability to choose is also quoted.
Since the Vice-President casts a potential for the presidency into the balance, 57 percent of the democratic voters of the pre-elections want to see him in the race - although a third believe he should not.
If democratic voters of the pre-elections are asked who would be their second choice for the party, Biden is at the top.
Of Clinton's followers, more than half say that Biden would be her second choice far ahead of Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run for the nominee of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton's lead rises to Sanders, from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points without him in the race.
Fifty-five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances of winning the election, but this figure of 78 percent has fallen in the last month.
Biden is by far a second in this measurement, but the percentage that views him as the "most elective" has increased.
Nevertheless, when it comes to the question of what is more important for a candidate, democratic voters call questions about the eligibility.
Like last month, no single democratic candidate or potential candidate for these pre-election voters is considered unacceptable.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results in some important features for voters of their party pre-elections.
The majority consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden to be honest and trustworthy and with strong leadership qualities.
Biden is the best in the three candidates for honesty, while Clinton's strength is the leader.
Thirty percent of democratic voters don't believe that Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many say that about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent don't think so.
Democratic voters of the pre-elections generally see Clinton, Sanders and Biden ideologically in accordance with their views.
In all these measurements, about a quarter of the democratic voters have no opinion of Sanders.
Since questions about Hillary Clinton's use of a personal e-mail address and a server are still being asked during the term of office as Foreign Minister, most democratic voters of the pre-elections are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not affected their opinions overall.
But it's another story in the American public as a whole.
Half of the Americans are now dissatisfied with their statement, while only about one third are satisfied.
The public opinion on this was divided in March, shortly after the problem came to light.
Most Americans said that the e-mail controversy had no impact on Clinton's general opinions, although 36 percent said that her opinion had worsened.
It is mainly Republicans, more than six out of 10, who say that their views of Clinton have become worse.
Although Clinton is regarded by the voters of her party as honest and trustworthy, this remains a problem for them among registered voters as a whole: only 32 percent see them as honest and trustworthy, eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May.
62 percent of voters do not consider them to be an honest and trustworthy person.
At the same time, 55 percent of the electorate in the country view Trump as not honest and not trustworthy.
Clinton and Trump, however, receive good grades during guided tours.
Of the six candidates tested, Biden, Carson and Bush best cut off with honesty.
A majority view Sanders as more honest, but as with Carson, many have no opinion of him.
The error rate for the sample of 351 Democratic voters in the pre-elections is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson moves up close behind Donald Trump in a nationwide survey
Ben Carson is close behind Donald Trump in the latest CBS News/New York Times survey
The two candidates now account for half of the voters' support in the new survey, and others lose dramatically in support
Republican voters continue to support Trump in large numbers nationwide. The support is growing by 23% in the last CBS survey conducted before Fox News debate last month, by 27% in the Tuesday survey.
But Carson shot from 6% to 23% in the same period.
The survey also revealed that Carson is well received by demographic groups and surpasses Trump among Republican voters with higher education.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, has been cut off with Wisconsin's Governor Scott Walker, who has fallen most deeply, from 10% support last month to 2%.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio, are in third place with 6%.
The error margin in the sample of 376 persons from Republican voters in this latest survey is plus or minus 6% and was carried out in September.
The latest CNN/ORC survey, published last week, shows that Carson is rising in the polls - he is landing with 19% support from the Republicans, behind the Trump with 32% support.
The recent survey of ABC News/Washington Post also showed Trump clearly in front of Carson.
Looking at a carson rising in the past week, Trump found some side effects for the former neurosurgeon, even after Carson apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy," said Trump last Saturday during a campaign show in Iowa.
Pleasant bathing temperatures: The eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees hot.
Even if peak values are measured only remotely, a trip to the Mediterranean is already enough for swimmers to find warm water.
A bathroom in the North or Baltic Sea should be a little bit of fun at a maximum of 17 degrees.
Some no longer go to the sea: Maximum 18 degrees has the water in the North and Baltic Seas this week, the German Weather Service (DWD) announces.
Bathing temperatures, on the other hand, still offer the Mediterranean: in the east it even reaches up to 29 degrees.
In the Adriatic it is in the top 25 degrees, in France 23 degrees.
The Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees.
Five members of the Brotherhood burdened with the death of a baruch college rookie
Nearly two years after a student died during a scrupulous ritual of a student link in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, murders are filed against five people.
Members of the New York Baruch College Pi-Delta-Psi Brotherhood brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during an inaugural ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital, which contributed to his death, informed the police.
Officials said that he had been burdened with a 30-pound backpack full of sand and was repeatedly attacked while trying to reach a target via a frozen field.
Mr. Deng finally complained about headaches, then he fell unconscious.
The members of the Pi-Delta-Psi Brotherhood did not call 911 after Deng fainted and supposedly waited an hour before they brought him to a hospital, the police said.
However, they had time to change Deng's clothes, Google his symptoms and Andy Meng to contact the national president of the Brotherhood to get advice, said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference.
"At this point, members began to hide utensilien and put the well-being of the Brotherhood in principle about that of Michael Deng," said police chief Wagner.
He could not be revived, and he died the next morning from his injuries.
After an autopsy report, Deng was repeatedly added with blunt force injuries to the head, buttocks and thighs.
"Too many families have been destroyed by the harassment of the Brotherhood. At least one student has died every year from the harassment since 1970," said Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Deng's family, in a statement.
Brotherhoods and their members must be held accountable, and this step by authorities is very important.
A County Grand Jury of Monroe recommended a third degree murder charge for the first five members.
Thirty-two members of the Brotherhood, including Mr. Meng, are also charged with harassment and the formation of a criminal association.
"We not only want to make the persons involved responsible, but if there is an organisation that has sanctioned this - officially or unofficially - we will also take them to account," said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College has banned the brotherhood, and the national brotherhood has revoked its membership of the local group.
This will happen when the Fed increases interest rates
An increase in interest rates is coming, and the house is going to fall, yields for bonds are going to rise, and the economy is going to slide into recession.
We know that.
What we don't know is how long this will take and how long it will last.
In particular, the history of the economy offers little guidance on how to proceed.
A recession occurred within just 11 months of the first interest rate increase and lasted 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates is often, though not always, a factor in how the economy and financial investments react.
Therefore, representatives of the US Central Bank have stressed so strongly that investors should not focus on when they start increasing interest rates, but rather on the period required for normalisation.
In fact, several variables play a role.
In the end, however, market participants might find that the whole excitement may have been exaggerated due to an increase in interest rates.
"The first increase in Fed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the "cheap money" era," said Julian Jessop, Chief Economist at Capital Economics, in a communication to customers.
In contrast, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to normal levels, but still to low levels to lead to the seismic shock that many seem to fear.
However, this does not mean that there will be no impact.
Here is a historical trend-based look at how some areas of the economy could react:
As the market has seen last month, the anticipation of interest rate increases can make things volatile for a while.
As soon as the increase occurs, the influence is not so dramatic.
"There seems to be a tendency that income from assets will be smothered 12 to 24 months after the first increase, which may reflect the delay in monetary policy," said German bank analysts in a recent study on what happens after Fed increases in interest rates.
More precisely, in the past 35 years, the market has mostly been in the upward trend - about 14 percent - on its way to rising interest rates, rather flat in the 250 days after (average profit of 2.6 percent), then back to normal after 500 days, with an average return in the past six past cycles of 14.4 percent according to a current analysis that Bob Doll, head of asset management, published at Barron's.
Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the shares tend to occur later in the increase cycle and the return begins to decrease.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but increases in interest rates often promote them.
In the current case, the Fed is confronted with some conditions that were not there before and that could accelerate a recession.
It is particularly noteworthy that the gross domestic product will be close to its lowest point when the Fed increases in interest rates.
According to Deutsche Bank, only twice the nominal GDP of 118 interest increases since 1950 was less than 4.5 percent.
Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent, few expect this to continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter according to the Atlanta Fed.
Increases in interest rates at such a fragile economic scene could be risky and raise the question, "Whether it is different this time," Deutsche Bank said.
Market participants have been looking at an increase in interest rates throughout the year, and all eyes were focused on the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC could approve an increase in this session, the Futures trade only represents a 25 percent probability.
"In our study, all cycles of increase from 1950 to today have taken place in a super cycle with increasing GDP swings and put pre-recessional heights in the shade very quickly after the onset of recovery," says the report.
In contrast, this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase.
The current cycle is by far the longest that the Fed has been waiting for since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and so far this is 74 months.
The fixed income was also volatile, as the market anticipates an increase in interest rates, and the pattern is quite similar to that of the capital market.
The main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than on shares when they change their strategic price.
In the case of bonds, the returns appear to change direction as soon as the first increase/decrease takes place in the cycle.
At the end of the increase cycle, the bondholders immediately fall, said Deutsche Bank.
The strategists of Charles Schwab believe that the rise in interest rates will lead to yields moving closer between longer and shorter bonds and leading to a flattening of the curve.
High-interest bonds often yield better in such a climate, although "we are still careful to expect higher returns," said Kathy Jones, fixed-income analyst at Schwab, in an analysis.
Interestingly, Jones believes that the markets have already adapted to Fed strategy expectations.
"In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are some signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of stricter monetary policy," she wrote.
Short-term interest rates have increased, the yield curve is flatter, loan margins have expanded and volatility has increased - all the features of the market when the Fed tightens its strategy.
By and large, companies that do the greater part of their business in the US will benefit from rising interest rates and making local products more attractive.
Multinational high-debt companies will be worse off as a rising dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market and so does the financing of their debt.
"History shows that "quality" shares tend to react very positively three months after an initial interest rate increase," said Goldman Sachs analysts in a report to customers.
Companies with a strong balance sheet have on average exceeded 5 percentage points after each of the interest rate increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Companies with high capital yields and low volatility in their shares also exceeded their low-quality counterparts by an average of 4 (percent points) and 3 (percent points).
Debt will be a big problem.
Companies with a high proportion of flexible interest rates will lose the most, Goldman said.
Outside the pure stock markets, consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar.
Savers could see profits through higher revenues, even if experts disagree on how quickly this will take place.

Parliamentary colleague Damien Collins attacked The Voice and said that this was not very original.
BBC Radio 3 "turns" to Classic FM, claims a leading member of parliament and increases new pressure on the transmitter to prove that he is doing something that the private transmitters are not doing.
Conservative MEP Andrew Bingham also told the BBC boss that the public-law radio station was "stupid" and increasingly no longer distinguishable from its commercial competitors.
"Radio 3 seems - I don't like to use the word "dummy" - but it seems to turn into Classic FM," he said.
He also aimed at the BBC Music Awards, which started last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which started last year, seem to be The British only under a different name.
So, if you're trying to do something else -- these are two spontaneous examples where you're actually just imitating what's already on the market," said Mr. Bingham.
BBC Director General rejected the allegations and argued that BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and public education.
What I learn from Radio 3, I will not learn about classical music anywhere else.
And there is a commitment to live music and music that is truly unsurpassed.
"And the commitment of Radio 3, to find new music and to commission new works, I think it's really important too," he said.
At the beginning of this year, BBC Radio 3 controller Alan Davey argued that more work had to be done on engaging the audience than it did in the past, because the British are less informed about classical music.
Radio 3 was not, however, the only element of BBC production that, during the hearing in the Committee on the Selection of Culture, Media and Sport, was subjected to fire to kick the commercial rivals.
Tory Member Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the BBC's musical talent show bought by Dutch producer Talpa Media for estimated cost of £22 million.
Do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly significant?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show - with Paloma Faith and Boy George as judges - was "produced in special BBC-wise".
He added that he wanted the company to "find a hit from our own stable" when it started a series of entertainments next time.
However, he refused to exclude the order of further series of The Voice in the future or to spend money on other entertainment formats.
Internet sales increased the slowest in August and the Black Friday can be responsible for this
In the first three months of 2015 there was a seven percent increase in online sales.
Last month there was the lowest result since the beginning of the recording in 2000
Online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
Experts believe that the Black Friday slowed down spending in November
For over a decade, virtual shopping has boomed, and many of Britain's main shopping streets have turned into ghost cities.
However, experts say that there are now signs that online sales stagnate after new figures showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015.
Total expenditure for August showed the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of the records in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year.
Experts say there are signs that online sales stagnate after new figures showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
"If you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000, this has always developed over time," said Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG Sales Index to the Guardian.
He explained that online sales increased three years ago when buyers started to make purchases with their cell phones.
It meant that more people could shop online and that people could do so in different environments, e.g. at home on the sofa.
But now this is commuting, and we may experience that growth is decreasing.
The Black Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for the declining revenues.
Experts believe that buyers hold their purchases before this event, which takes place on the last Friday of November.
Last year, five times the average number of buyers gathered around their computers to make their snaps, and some dealer websites crashed.
Experts believe that Black Friday, where buyers fought for bargains, could stop buyers from making purchases.
A study by the British Retail Consortium found that out of £5 issues a little more than £1 was spent online.
For some products such as televisions and washing machines, more than one third of the purchases are now made via web shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of fashion chains in the inner cities.
Muslims bury those killed in Mecca in a crane accident - Bin Laden's family is sanctioned
The bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims at the first funerals in Mecca through the streets
Saudi Arabia is partly to blame for the collapse of the huge Saudi bin-laden group
The Ministry of Health said that a total of 394 people were injured after the crane crashed
Hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those who were killed when a crane crashed into Mecca's Great Mosque.
Mourning people, mostly dressed in white, filled the route to pay their respects when the first of the dead took their last trip to the Al-Moaissem-Friedhof.
The procession of mourning passed at the Holy Place, where only days before a crane fell through the mosque's ceiling and then on the prayers.
The corpses were released for the funeral when the Saudi king imposed a penalty on the construction company of the Bin Laden family because of the disaster that left 394 injured.
The bodies of 29 betters killed when a crane crashed through the Great Central Mosque of Mecca were carried through the streets.
Among the dead were Qasim Akram from Bolton, Greater Manchester, father of four children who were on his first pilgrimage when the crane crashed.
Mr. Akram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual Haddsch in the Great Mosque.
Saudi officials have already firmly pledged that the Haddach to Mecca will continue with thousands who will continue to come to the city.
Today, King Salman said that the Bin-Laden group should not have left the arm of the crane standing when it was not used.
An Arabic version of the Decree, published by the state Saudi Press Agency, said that the Bin-Laden Group was responsible for the collapse.
The news agency’s English-language service did not report this detail, but said that the management of the company’s travel abroad was prohibited.
At the beginning of this week, Salman promised to reveal what caused the fall of the crane that crashed into a courtyard of the Great Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered in front of the Haddach, which will take place later this month.
The Bin-Laden Group has not issued any statements on the collapse of the Krans, and their representatives were not available for an opinion.
The Royal Decree also denounced the group for non-current security measures and for not cooperating with meteorologists.
Thousands of cranes surround Mecca's large mosque as part of the massive construction project led by the Bin-Laden Group.
The Bin Laden family has been associated with the Saudi Arabia family for decades and is taking over larger construction projects.
The late leader of Al Qaida, Osama bin Laden, was an apostatized son who was exterminated by the family in the 1990s.
The collapse of the crane came in the midst of strong winds and rain, just a few days before the arrival of millions in the Kingdom for the pilgrimage that is required at least once in the life of any healthy Muslim.
Officials said that 158 people stay in the hospital.
Government representatives ordered that 1 million Rial (£174,000) be paid to the members of the killed and the same amount of permanent injuries.
Other injured persons receive half of this amount.
B&Q Boss says that the time for cheap Eastern European craftsmen is over
British are increasingly employing craftsmen, says Veronique Lauri
The number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe has increased
This leads to the opening of 200 other Screwfix shops aimed at craftsmen
At the same time, Kingfisher will close 60 B&Q sales outlets nationwide
By Rupert Steiner, City Chief Correspondent of the Daily Mail
It is claimed that the British lower their hammers and brushes in favour of the use of skilled East European craftsmen who carry out the work at home
If you can handle a hammer or brush to iron walls, you seem to be a minority today.
The British are increasingly employing craftsmen to do homework in their homes, according to the company's boss behind B&Q.
Véronique Lauriy, new Managing Director of Kingfisher, who owns the building market chain, said that a large increase in the number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe who offer services at low prices has now been overtaken.
Therefore, Kingfisher plans to open 200 other Screwfix shops, which are aimed at craftsmen and close 60 sales outlets of B&Q.
Mrs. Laury said she wanted to employ more women in B & Q shops, because eight out of ten purchase decisions in the store are made by women.
At the moment, the men are overwhelming.
She said that it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends that have more female single budgets, which carry out more renovations than in the past.
Mrs. Lauriy said, "It still works a majority of men in our branches.
We need to shift this further towards a balance.
In principle, half of our customers consist of women with 80 percent of the decisions about the purchase of articles by women.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process.
Mrs. Lauri, who is one of only five women at the head of a British FTSE100 index company, has also restructured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions.
Kingfisher is almost the only company that has occupied exactly 50 percent of the team with women, including its management and financial director.
Mrs. Lauriy said, "This was a conscious decision - diversity is an important topic here.
It was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board.
Kingfisher reported a decrease in half-yearly profits and sales after the group trained the cost of closing the stores.
Because of the trend, Kingfisher, who owns Screwfix and B&Q, will open 200 new branches.
Officials of Aich/Dob for infidelity in court
On Wednesday, two officials of the Austrian volleyball vice-master Aich/Dob were responsible for unfaithfulness and tax evasion at the Klagenfurt Regional Court.
The defendants didn't confess.
One of them had also been accused of abuse of office.
He was acquitted of this accusation in May.
The current process has been shut down.
According to Supreme State Attorney Robert Riffel, in the preliminary investigation, the defendants had crystallized that in the years 2006 to 2011, funds from association accounts that they were allowed to dispose of in their functions were used for private purposes.
The damage is estimated at around 400,000 euros.
The sports officials are also charged with financial crimes.
This fact was dismissed by the chairman of the Schöffensenat, judge Michaela Sanin.
It is to be negotiated at a later date.
As regards the rejection of the infidelity, the defense stated that the association had at no time created an asset disadvantage.
The sports officials had only calculated expenses and the sports club for which they had worked from 1982 to 2011 and in which they had invested a lot of time and money, out of the debt – the liabilities amounted to around 600,000 shillings in 2001 (around 44.000 euros).
"At that time we faced the situation: Are we going to continue the club or shut it down?" said one of the defendants, in the bread trade major auditors of the tax office.
With his colleague and co-complaints, he then decided to take over this task.
With all the risks.
"We have put our life insurance as security at the bank," he said at the time of the agreement.
The association has been agreed upon: you can manage the money freely, there can only be no debts.
Furthermore, in the event of financial success, the payment of the compensation for expenses had been decided retroactively by 1991.
Therefore, some of the expenses were paid out only years later, starting in 2003, when a plus had been on the account.
Therefore, even flat-rate and not detailed cancellations appeared, the former Obmann explained the proceedings.
The accounts and austerity books managed the two defendants together, said the second defendant.
The judge asked why the payments had not been disclosed to the association in detail.
The association had not been interested in the detail of the financial statement that only the freedom of debt was important, the answer said.
When in 2011 the one official investigation for abuse of office began, an amount of EUR 120,000 was transferred to the association account.
The defendants explained that this had been a reserve.
This security account ran on the name of the second defendant and was not known to the association, according to his statement.
"Why?" the judge wanted to know.
The questioner long knew no answer to this.
Finally, he said that he believed that this was the best thing for the club.
If something had happened to him, no one would have known anything about this money, the prosecutor put it in the room.
The defendant had been informed, the official justified himself.
This transfer was formulated as "damage recovery".
Why damages?, judge and prosecutor wanted to know.
On this basis, the first defendant stated that he did not agree to this wording because the association had never been harmed.
But what should I do if the lawyer says, "All of you are from the tailor."
"Am I a legal representative?" he asked.
In addition, the official said that he had never received a cent salary, he had only billed mileage money and diets.
On diets he charged the association 1,000 euros a month, but the actual effort was much higher, he added.
Accurate documents for the early years could not be provided by the defendants.
They explained that they had no longer been kept after an operating test in which everything had been judged to be correct.
Kilometer money had also been taken from the second defendant.
All the repairs had been made in cash, for which he had to go from his residence Völkermarkt to the bank to Bleiburg, he explained in his statement.
The main proceedings will continue on 23 September with the interview of witnesses.
Hewlett-Packard strikes another 30,000 jobs
In addition to the staff reduction that has been in progress for three years, the computer giant will reduce further jobs in the company's division.
The job strikes at the US computer giant Hewlett-Packard (HP) will not end.
As part of its restructuring, the US Technology Group plans to reduce its business customers from 25,000 to 30,000 jobs.
As a result, costs of 2.7 billion dollars (2.4 billion euros) are to be saved, the company announced on Tuesday.
The step will lead to a special cost of around $2.7 billion, which will be incurred from the fourth quarter.
The loss of 55,000 jobs, which has been going on for three years, is not yet completed.
HP still employed some 302,000 employees at the end of the 2013/14 financial year.
After the exchange, the Hewlett-Packard share dropped 2.3 percent.
The Group from Palo Alto, a Californian company that has grown up with printers, is currently splitting up: This is how the computer and printing business should be concentrated even this year in a new company - apart from the more forward-looking areas with computer servers and data storage for companies and other services.
Both business parts are to be listed on the stock exchange.
A again disappointing PC sales and a weaker demand from corporate customers for its services have recently increased the world's second largest PC manufacturer to Lenovo.
In the third business quarter to the end of July, sales of PCs and printers fell by 11.5 percent.
Sales fell by 8 percent to just under 25.4 billion dollars.
As a result, revenues fell in 15 out of 16 quarters.
HP responds with a split and massive job cuts to the change in the industry.
The 76-year-old company under the leadership of Meg Whitman has only responded late to the fact that customers are increasingly buying smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers and are doing more and more online business.
Whitman's restructuring plans provide for a total reduction of about 55,000 jobs.
Conflicts: majority supports the anti-IS training mission
A direct participation of German soldiers in combat activities in Iraq would, however, be largely repudiated: 54 per cent were opposed, 35 per cent were in favour.
That other states fly air strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria, 61 percent find positive.
24 percent are opposed to intervention in the conflict.
Cooperation with the Syrian ruler Bashar al-Assad rejects 51 percent of the respondents, with 20 percent in favour.
29 percent could not make up their minds.
Car: Second press day on the 66th IAA
The exhibition will focus on connected, self-driving cars as well as electric mobility until 27 September.
After two press days, Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 66th International Motor Show under the motto "Mobility Linkes" on Thursday.
The wide audience can visit the IAA from Saturday.
The organizers of the VDA Auto-Verband expect about 900 000 visitors as two years ago.
Röszke: Outbreak of violence at the Serbian-Hungarian border
The Hungarian police have deployed tear gas and water jets on the Serbian border against several hundred refugees.
Euronews correspondent Dániel Bozsik has witnessed the outbreak of violence at the border control point.
He reported by telephone:
A group of refugees broke the border.
Behind this, a police line had formed and behind the police was a water launcher ready.
40 to 50 refugees began to throw stones, sticks and plastic bottles at the officials.
The officials initially used continuous pepper spray.
After that, the police used tear gas.
A lot of tear gas was sprayed towards the refugees.
This disbanded the group.
The refugees have now withdrawn somewhat.
A pregnant and apparently injured woman was carried out of the zone.
Children who had inhaled the tear gas scream.
Other refugees sank together and suffered from respiratory distress.
The press spokespersons of the Serbian police also suffered injuries from the use of tear gas and pepper spray.
Time of decision on interest rates for the U.S. bank
The world is watching when the US bank meets on two days, on Wednesday and Thursday, to make the important decision whether or not interest has been raised for the first time for almost a decade.
A survey among 80 economists surveyed by Reuters found that a little more than half who was still last week thinking that the Fed would do this, now thinks that the Fed will last a little longer and will keep interest rates at the current level of 0 - 0.25 percent.
It's a historical event because it's been seven years since the Fed set interest rates on NULL.
"For the first time, we are approaching a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero range and start a process of normalising interest rates," said Angel Ubide, Managing Director at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy is at a relatively good performance level, trillions of dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a slight inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore the less rosy outlook on global conditions.
It has warned the markets to adjust to an increase, but the signs indicate that the chances against such a step are good.
The decision is due to be announced on Thursday at 8 p.m.
Death Protectors Leave Letters of Apology at Delta State University
After the shooting and killing of his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleagues later that day - Shannon Lamb wrote a note to say that he was "suffering" at the first murder and wanted to "he could make it unseemly," the authorities announced on Tuesday.
The police in Gautier, Mississippi, said that Lamb, professor of geography and social science education at Delta State University, called the emergency call number around 10:00 on Monday morning.
And he said he shot at someone and killed someone.
Lamb told the emergency call center staff that the police had to send policemen to his home.
He said, "I shot my wife last night" and he also mentioned that a "sweet dog" is in the house, but "no one will disturb," but probably will be excited.
The police asked the caller for his name, but he didn't give it.
Lamb gave no explanation for his shots.
When the police entered the scene, they found Amy Prentiss' body, 41, and a handwritten note from Lamb, 45, which said, "I'm so sorry, I wanted to, I could undo it.
I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me."
After writing the note, Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a professor of history, before finally taking his own life on Monday night when police surrounded him.
University President William LaForge said he didn't know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr Lamb's idea."
Despite reports on Monday, the Lamb allegedly believed that Prentiss also had a relationship with Schmidt, the authorities said on Tuesday, there was "no information, no evidence" for a "triangle relationship".
Prentiss was described by Shawn O'Steen, who said they were married for about seven years as a "good man".
The two were divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends.
O'Steen said he and Prentiss had a daughter who is 19, and she was "destroyed on the ground".
He said that Prentiss was her daughter "absolutely best friends".
Prentiss worked online from home, according to Linsday Knowles, identified by the Sun Herald as a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles said that Prentiss, who owned a dog named Lightning, had met with Lamb for about three years.
"She always wanted to help other people," said Knowles.
The police said that Lamb called relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them, "He's not going to jail."
When police picked him up on Highway 1 near Greenville later that night, Lamb drove his car to the side, fled on foot, ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot.
Lamb received a doctorate from Delta State University in the spring of 2015, as stated on the university's website.
Stars who have lost their lucky charms
The actor (left), in the picture with his son Redmond (right), had some stressful years.
In 2001, he fought against leukemia, and in 2009 he lost his longtime partner, Farrah Fawcett, for cancer.
The actor also allegedly has to fight drugs, and in 2008 he was sentenced to drug possession.
I'm sure all of this will require his tribute.
Eurowings: Lufthansa is rebuilding the Group
Lufthansa is planning a major corporate restructuring.
Half a billion euros a year, the Lufthansa Group wants to save with a better organization alone.
150 of the around 1000 managers worldwide will cost the company the job.
However, with the pilot union there are new negotiations.
Lufthansa is rebuilding its corporate structure and evaluating the low-cost Eurowings.
The objective of the realignment was a profit contribution of around EUR 500 million per year from cost and revenue synergies, the airline announced on Wednesday.
Among other things, Lufthansa will no longer have a board of directors for passenger business.
The Eurowings low-cost airline should be developed as independently as possible.
In future, Karl Ulrich Garnadt will be responsible for Eurowings on the board team headed by Carsten Spohr.
With the re-design, Spohr underlines the importance of Eurowings with which the Group intends to face Ryanair and Easyjet in the future.
So far, the organization of the 120 000 employees has been complex.
The airlines operated under the roof of the Passenger Airline Group, which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros.
New negotiations with the pilots
In the event of a tariff conflict with the Pilots' Association Cockpit (VC), the negotiations will be resumed after the judicial strike has been stopped on this Thursday.
That's what the union told me.
The subject of the talks should be the retirement scheme for pilots.
Cockpit wants to achieve sustainable results "in one year with a forecasted record result" as soon as possible.
The conflict between trade union and airline has led to various strikes in recent months.
In addition to the pilots' transitional supply, the "Wings" austerity concept is the background.
It foresees that Lufthansa will outsource routes to Eurowings’ most recent airline line in the fight against competitors.

Luke Shaw of Manchester United cannot play for months due to double fracture
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right leg at the Manchester Champions League defeat at PSV Eindhoven.
While this made the left defender cry and will exclude him from the game for at least six months, Louis van Gaal does not give up hope that Shaw will be able to play again this season.
The injury was caused by a reckless attack by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute after the 20-year-old Shaw broke into the PSV area.
He was treated on the field for nine minutes and needed oxygen before he was taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He has a double bone fracture and lies in the hospital."
He'll be moved tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operated in Manchester.
It's terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester United with 18 years of age, it's very hard and then it's fantastic, and then it happens.
In the dressing room he had an oxygen mask on.
He cried.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, then it takes six months, and he won't play in the group phase.
I hope he can play this season again.
Moreno seemed happy to have escaped a red card and the hanging of an 11 meter.
Nicola Rizzoli, the referee, did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal suspected that the Italian referee had erred.
You can judge for yourself when I say that an 11 meter and a red card were due.
It was a very bad attack with both legs.
A tweet on Shaw's account said: "I thank you all for your news. Words cannot describe how broken I am, my path to recovery begins now, I am coming back stronger."
Based on this: Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Shaw in defeat at PSV
With the European Championship in France, the defender of England has an additional incentive to recover by next June.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV coach, said, "It's a very bad injury."
If a player leaves the place with this kind of injury, all are very sad about it.
It is never our players' intention to hurt an opponent.
Moreno suffered a leg break when Mexico played against Van Gaal's Holland team at the 2014 World Cup.
"He is doing very hard because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent, and if you then hear that it is a very bad injury, that is not good," said Coco.
For me it was not possible to see the moment.
The only thing I could see was the ball that was going in a different direction, so it looked as if he had touched him [Moreno], but I could not see the attack on Luke.
In a conversation with SBS6, Moreno said, "I know how it feels, I know how hard such a thing can be.
I'm so sorry.
The PSV player Andrés Guardado was also taken to the hospital - after a foal game by Chris Smalling.
Surely David Cameron The Lorax knows better?
It is one thing that all parents will soon learn: If your child loves a book, it will not take long until you know it almost externally.
Unless you're David Cameron.
When he was asked by a provider of childcare systems to name his favorite children's book, the Prime Minister of The Lorax decided to write Dr. Seuss's environmental film, published in 1971.
It was a difficult choice, Cameron writes in a message on the website of the company SuperCamps, and continues: "Kiddy, moving, creative and with a powerful message, it is a book that I like to read to my children, because it always seems to give a picture or a message that we have missed so far."
Everything nice and good, except that the following paragraph, in which Cameron allegedly describes the story of the book, instead renders a content statement of the 2012 film version that added new characters and details to expand the rather short original text.
"Amid the walled town of Thneed-Ville, where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams by fulfilling her desire to see a real tree," one reads. One love interest was Dr. Seuss, whose real name was Theodor Seuss Geisel, who died in 1991 but was completely unknown.
As if this were not yet suspicious enough: The text presented by Cameron reads in part like the summary of the Lorax film, which is presented on the Internet Movie Database website and begins as follows: "In the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted, hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams."
Although he admits to being a pragmatic father, it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar with the story of the book. Here, an unnamed boy hears how the local environment is destroyed by the money-loving, tree-causing, thneeded- knitting Once-ler despite the protests of the name Lorax, a shocking, obscene being, "who speaks in the name of the trees".
Most likely, such a relatively low PR assignment was delegated to a helper who The Lorax did not read a child 20 times in a row.
A downing street spokesperson said that the text probably came from Cameron's constituency office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron's employees, but did not give any further immediate comments.
Adam Lyth was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England's team, but it's still hard.
Hitting Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but when you see the squad that England has chosen for the tour, there is no repetition of the 3-0 test series defeat on my map.
I wouldn't rule out an away victory.
Alastair Cook's site may be less experienced than the three years ago, but there are good spin players in the batting setup, and the community spirit is strong; they will not wear scars of 2012, only a youthful-positive attitude.
With the ball Moeen Ali develops as a spin-bowler and Adil Rashid, even if he is an unknown size at test level, is an option for the attack.
Message related to this: Adam Lyth separates from the England test framework and is replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to let Adam Lyth go is, of course, difficult for me as his head coach in Yorkshire to analyze.
In his seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions, and the simple but hard reality is that cricket players are focused on results.
There were no question marks at Joe Root, for example, and that led to the nomination, since - and I said this before - players are their own best pickers.
Long ago one would have extended the course of Lyth, but he had control over his own destiny.
If he hopefully beats out more races for Yorkshire, there's another chance.
The English coach Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude, even though he did not perform so well, and that does not surprise me; he is primarily a team man.
The question of how much time a test hitman gets to put his mark is difficult.
Lyth got seven chances - like Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got the chance to play home and out.
The only accusation that can be raised was that England first used Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean - when Lyth was in the highest form - but this lost opportunity is now in the past.
Alex Hales comes in, and he's a hit man I highly appreciate.
He is an X-factor cricket player, what we saw at Yorkshire early this season when he scored 236 against us on a Trent Bridge square, which hit us very hard.
He must have at least the same opportunities as those before him, but this, of course, depends on the team position in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of having Moeen beat next to Cook, which would produce an extra spin bowler and get four quicks, appeared, and I have nothing against it.
I don't see why a hit man can't hit there, and this left-handed man has already shown himself to be a devil of Cricket players.
Moeen may not have done his job for his County Worcestershire, but he's a number three for her, and there's no big difference.
My former teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 tests at the first drop before appearing as an opener in 2001.
He made three hundred runs right away and didn't look back.
Zafar Ansari comes into the cadre as a backup spinner, and in my limited dealings with him he impressed me very much as a young man.
People may look at his statistics - on average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it's a point, but there are no large number of backup spiders that raise their hands and the trainers have chosen youth.
He will learn a lot on this tour.
Apart from the team, England has made a few smart additions to the coaching staff.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, the Batsman from Sri Lanka, as an advisor to the test games could be a master coup.
He is one of the nicest guys in the game who will bring a wealth of experience, as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful commitment to the setup.
I have always felt that he was created for the international Cricket competition, as a player or as a coach, and like Mahela he has insights from which we can benefit.
Sometimes new voices in the dressing room can bring fresh wind, even if the news is in harmony with what was said before.
Colly's teammate at Durham, Ben Stokes, is not employed at the One-Dayers, Root was given a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with it for my part.
Some will not agree, but Coaches and team setters do not determine the schedule.
And you have to remember that as with the players their jobs depend on the results.
Such decisions are not made lightly.
The Brexit camp (Brexit = UK exit from the EU) could gain momentum if the economy went into a fluke by 2017
David Cameron's inexorable renegotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU will become more difficult every day, even without the choice of ingenious Jeremy "Is it yes or no?" Corbyn as the leader of the Labour or the TUC, who is fiercely disputing about Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their Corbyns and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomat friend recently said that some Member States, as deeply entangled in various crises as the EU is now and not always on their own account, are tired of Britain's own agenda with split concessions and disruptive treaty changes that they usually do not want.
In Brighton, TUC decided at its annual meeting that it did not like them if they threatened social protection.
We could call it Dave and George's Selfie-Agenda.
Prime Minister and Finance Ministers climb to summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take a picture of themselves in front of a famous local monument, with or without local sizes, then come home and say that they win allies for reforms.
It's always about me.
My European friend, who wants a UK looking outside inside the EU tent - "Don't let us alone with France," says Berlin - and lets us see that more and more short-sighted ministers and officials have come to the point where they don't care whether we stay or go.
Germany's cautious Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her, as has happened with the exaggerated long-standing like Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
France's François Hollande is looking at his re-election or his replacement in 2017.
He is also a fading force.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right government, Spain a left.
It is hard to imagine that they will break a leg to help the selfie British, whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland from leaving the UK - something they don't want either, because most of them have similar separatist tendencies.
Therefore, some such ministers may even deliberately plan unhelpful remarks, quite in the SNP style, while Britain's 2017 referendum campaign to speed up the Brexit process, my friend suspects.
"The renegotiation was a break" and "Great Britain has gained nothing of value from the renegotiation."
Europeans know how predatory the Fleet Street can be at its expense and which EU sceptics are the oligarchy of the press barone, as it was during the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn, which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2:1.
You can recall Boris Johnson, the Erz Euro-Opportunist, who made a name as an "EU-straight banana" Brussels correspondent in the early 1990s.
With all his madness, Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.
This included the Medley of tax-fearing villains, telephone-tapping foreigners and the pseudo non-residents, who own most of our major newspapers.
Actually Tony Blair thought about her similarly, but found that if you sit in a cage with a hot gorilla, you better distribute bananas to distract him instead of becoming his lunch and dinner.
In fact, Miliband was more Blairian than Blair himself when he opposed Cameron's referendum vortex, because Blair had set the principle of the EU's non-adopted constitution, which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, which opened a back door to him.
The press never forgave him either.
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn, who gave me a friendly slap on my back on Monday in Westminster - I told him that he no longer needs to waste time for me - seems in danger of repeating Neil Kinnock's boycott Murdoch's strategy of the 1980s, a mistake then and today.
It may take time, but he has to develop a coherent strategy to win the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position on Europe is - I would like to express it kindly - in development.
He says we should stay in a reformed EU.
Well, most people outside Ukip's traditional blue-color tendency and the wilder areas of Tory's small-englanderism can probably say yes.
It's what Hilary "A Benn, but no Bennite" Benn said on radio and television this week, when the Boy Scout fought in him, not admitting that Corbyn's appointment of provocative John McDonnell as a shadow chanceller was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 70s when his old father tried on television to be disloyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job.
Hilary's fight was even more attractive.
But fighting to stay "under all circumstances" - Benn's expression - wasn't what McDonnell said, nor what JC told his fellows and MPs after all reports at her clausus meeting on Monday evening.
Whatever the moving bottom-up image of Corbyn wants to convey - remember that he has even touched me - news discipline remains important in the age of television around the clock and above all in the strudel of social media, a breeding ground of paranoia and betrayal.
It is right not to give Cameron a free card for Europe that allows him to hold Labour's support in the referendum campaign for a self-evident nature, as McDonnell said.
I'm sure Simon Jenkins thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbyn's fundamental ambiguities about EU membership - in line with their narrow siege economy, their anti-capitalist past - are no longer just a matter of esoteric discussion among left dissidents, for whom the narcissism of the small difference is a central principle of dogmatic disputes.
As with his ambiguities about NATO - Tom Watson is firmly convinced that JC is not starting a campaign to quit - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to find in everything a sense for their superiors at home.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have suspicious voters - in order to make concessions to the British, if all of this can be pointless?
The United States is already quite disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a cost reduction of the Tory government in power, which I was reminded at the start on Monday of something called the British Influence Security Forum.
Experts criticise Public Health England report on e-cigarettes
According to researchers, claims by a state-funded agency that e-cigarettes are less harmful than smoking originated from a meeting of 12 people, partly with connections to the tobacco industry.
Experts who write in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet by criticising the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in their report on e-cigarettes.
PHE published the "basic report" last month and described it as a "comprehensive review of the evidence".
However, some researchers have questioned the resilience of the data and pointed to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
An editorial in the medical journal Lancet last month attacked the "extremely windy basis" on which PHE based its most important conclusion.
Two other researchers write in BMJ and asked if the claims "build on stone or sand".
Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "A fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on proof of effectiveness."
They said that the public expects that the claim of PHE that "the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than smoking" is based on a detailed review of the evidence and modelling.
In fact, this statement comes from a single meeting of 12 people who have been convened to develop a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) model to lead their opinions on the damage of various nicotine-containing products to a synthesis; the results of the meeting were summarised in a research report.
McKee and Capewell said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO was said to have received funding from British American Tobacco (BAT) for an independent study.
He also signed the references of BAT to public health in a sustainability report, they said.
One of the 12 participants in the meeting declared that they would receive funding from an e-cigarette manufacturer, but not the funding he was supposed to receive from the tobacco company Philip Morris International, according to reports.
The reasons for the selection of members of the board are not provided, but they include several well-known e-cigarette champions, some of whom also indicate an industry financing in the paper.
Some other participants at this meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The meeting also included the PHE tobacco management.
The research work of the group "significantly" admits that there is a lack of "hard evidence of the damage of most products in most criteria", wrote McKee and Capewell.
However, none of these links or restrictions are discussed in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said that the claims of PHE that "there is no evidence so far that e-cigarettes were premature as a way to smoke for children or non-smokers".
Prof Kevin Fenton, Director of Health and Welfare at PHE, said that BMJ's claims had already been responded to.
He said, "E-cigarettes are far less harmful than smoking."
Every second lifelong smoker dies of his addiction.
All evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes are low compared to this, but that we continue to have the long-term impact to study.
PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public about what evidence proves and what not, especially if there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people die every year from an illness related to smoking, and smoking costs the National Health System £2 billion a year.
By clearly presenting current evidence that e-cigarettes are not without risk, but represent only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking, we fulfil our national competence.
BBC should give up EastEnders, says former Head of Channel 4
The former chairman of Channel 4, Luke Johnson, said the BBC should stop sending programs like EastEnders and The Voice. He said that commercial rivals would "give their right arm" for hit shows like the Albert Square Soap.
Johnson said that the broadcast fee should only be used to make the kind of programs that are not sent by other UK channels.
He criticized the BBC for placing public-law programs, which are probably seen by a smaller audience, in hard controversial time windows against the most popular shows of their rivals and by broadcasters like BBC4.
After the BBC General Director, Tony Hall, said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said that he had tried to get in touch with the BBC for six years at Channel 4 without success.
"I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or broadcast, which would also clearly be shown by unsubsidized rivals," said Johnson to the Oberhaus Communications Committee as part of his study on the future of the BBC.
If you want to keep the broadcasting fee, which I do not think is a good idea in the medium or long term, you should at least put its production on programs that others do not make or commission.
They send The Voice in a first-class time window because they want to achieve the widest possible support for their future.
The idea that no one else would show this is a joke, it's ridiculous, it's of course nonsense.
Johnson said, "I don't see why a regressive tax programme is financed, which could be financed even without subsidies.
The Voice is such a program, EastEnders is another, admittedly both own productions.
Frankly, other channels would give their right arm for it.
I'm trying to see how this is supposed to be public-law television.
I don't think this would reduce the BBC at all.
Johnson, an entrepreneur for series who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said that the BBC was guilty of hunting for ratings "because of the ambitions of the people who work there, and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long-term support."
His comments on the most popular BBC shows reflect what the former head of Sky, Tony Ball, proposed in his 2003 MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh that the BBC shows should sell like EastEnders.
Johnson said that the rather public-law niche programs "should go to BBC4 where you can't quite measure the audience, but they fulfil their tasks, and they can argue if they go on their hypocritical missions to justify £4 billion broadcast fees, "Well, of course, we've created all these obscure programs that nobody's seen."
They put them in a window of time where no one ever wanted to see them.
At the broadcast fee, Johnson told the committee: "I urge you to find a more regressive system in terms of conditions for who can get the best value out of it.
Of course, you all think we all think that you get a big value for £150 a year here, but for people who are a lot of money for the £150, ask me if that's true, because they don't consume much of the BBC.
Former Sky and Channel 5 chief David Elstein, who also announced before the Committee on Tuesday, demanded that the BBC review their Reithian mission to "inform, form and entertain".
He said that little of the BBC production would now officially be classified as education - he said it was 1% of their TV production and 0.1% on the radio - and she should take an example of this change in "informing, educating and entertaining" at the public television stations in Australia and Canada.
On the question of partnerships, Elstein said that the BBC should do more in areas like the proms, of which he said that only a handful are shown on TV, and enter into alliances with the commercial channels to make everything available online.
'Sonogenetics' can control brain cells through sound waves
The video shows how the nematods change the direction in the moment they are irradiated with sound impulses.
Scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by sound waves.
The tiny nematods change the direction at the moment they are irradiated with sound impulses that have too high frequencies for human hearing to be heard.
The impulses work by switching on motoneuron cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that respond to ultrasound waves.
Further information on this topic: Researchers read and write brain activity with light
The researchers said that the worms showed the power of a new process called sonogenetics, in which ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain, heart and muscle cells outside the body.
Srechanth Chalasani, researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that one day the procedure could replace deep brain stimulation, an invasive procedure that gives electrical impulses into the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
Threadworms usually do not respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they did it when surrounded by a liquid with microscopic air bubbles.
The bubbles, he found out, amplified the ultrasound waves, which then penetrate the worms.
The enhanced ultrasonic waves affect structures called TRP-4 ion channels and are found in the membranes of some of the worm cells.
The sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells to which they are assigned, says a report Nature Communications.
In order to create ultrasonic-controlled nematodes, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of their motoneurons carry TRP-4 ion channels.
When he applies ultrasound to the modified creatures, the sound waves are amplified by the microblowers and transmitted to the worms, where they turn on the modified motoneurons.
The process has some similarities with Optogenetics, a groundbreaking tool that allows scientists to turn neurons on and off with impulses of light.
But Chalasani said that Sonogenetics could have some advantages over this technique.
Unlike light that has to be sent down to the desired place in the brain at an optical fiber, low-frequency ultrasonic waves can pass through tissues unobstructed and can be sent into the brain from the top of the skull.
"We believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make the intended human neurons temporarily susceptible to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments," said Chalasani.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.
Illegal torture devices - right at your doorstep!
The ads shame Britain's arms trade
Amnesty International Anti-Weapon Watch Messen-Video.
Horrible killer drones!
Feet joint crushing leg restraints!
Dispersion bomb!
And electric shock bars that cause painful pain, but leave no trace!
The cheerful voice and cartoon images leave no doubt that this display for the world's largest arms trade fair is a fighting parody produced by Amnesty International in order to bring the British government's willingness to undermine arms to repressive regimes over the Defence and Security Equipment International Jamboree at the ExCeL Centre in London's Docklands.

But a separate campaign also leads to many posters that can be seen at bus stops and in the subway trains and require a second look.
"Important announcement: Do you drive with the DLR from 15th to 18th September?" (Docklands Light Railway) is read in the typefaces of the London Underground and the trademarks of the DLR line, which turns into the image of a tank.
In September, a swarm of arms dealers will ride with the DLR... customers are asked to help stop the arms trade fair.
The 300 posters are by artists who have exhibited their work at the Museum of Cruel Designs in Banksys Dismaland.
A collector named Special Patrol Group helped distribute in London and used "Ad Space Hack Packs", a £6 pack of inbox keys, which claims that "access to about one third of bus stop advertising areas on the planet."
Transport for London does not find this posterist "vandalism" funny.
One of the parody ads produced by Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Crueol Designs and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists become more critical and try to bring political works to the audience outside galleries.
Many artists work with activists within protest movements, noting that they have to go outside to the real world so that their art has an impact on society.
Another of the anti-weapon trading posters greets the commuters in the subway.
The Amnesty video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and was created by the advertising agency VCCP, which works non-profit with the graphic artist and voiceover artist, who also works for free.
VCCP creative director Matt Lever was amazed at the silence that prevailed around advertising for the arms trade fair - through an empty space of the ExCeL calendar - and thought: "Let's give them the campaign they are trying to avoid."
They played with the invention of a more realistic business advertising, but "by bloating with bright colors and animation it remains more attached."
"They have done a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness of the sale of illegal torture devices at the fair," says Tom Davies of Amnesty.
What we need now is an intrusion by the British Government and the guarantee that torture devices will not be dealt with illegally at our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art around the arms trade fair comes from the area within ExCeL, where exhibitors scramble fantastic euphemistic products.

Eight Golden Rules for Living in Student Homes
Eleven years ago, as a self-forgotten 19-year-old, I moved to a student residence, still in the belief in Berets and moral relativism, but only now do I remember the tense smiles of those I have annoyed - and the numerous, long-term complaints about others.
Most of what I have learned can be distilled into eight simple rules.
The entry into student homes ranges from slightly nerve-enhancing to absolutely terrifying.
It's tempting to whisper: people tell you where you come from, whether and where you took Sabbath year, where you stand in relation to Corbyn, and why you "honestly don't love Marmite or hate, because seriously, guys, it's just a yeast extract HAHAHA, I'm in my room."
Breathe through.
And help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest.
It directs the conversation and helps you to find out the people you like in contrast to those you wouldn't talk to, even if your eyelashes were on fire and those fire extinguishers.
Let people.
The rooms of people often turn into beverage receptions, film night venues and municipal meeting points, but they are also the places where people dress up and adjust their underwear.
Regarding this: Don't think about starting a relationship at the university
Introverts receive a rough treatment at the university.
Your room should be a refuge, but many student homes form a space-to-space-bomb culture that is friendly and social and can lead to lifelong friendship.
This can be hell for someone who's trying to recover.
Nothing in culture allows you to say, "I like you, and I want our friendship to go on, but you have to go away so I can get back the energy I've used to interact with you."
Try to feel when a fellow member is exhausted from happiness - and send him a text message instead of knocking.
Speaking of knocking: do it.
A guy in my student homes had the idea that an unclosed door was an invitation.
He saw some things.
Friendship close by baking.
Since you start the university at the height of the back mania, knocking at the doors of people to imagine with a plate full of brownies is less strange than welcoming the 1950s "Welcome to the neighborhood, I baked you something. So, and now please smile when I ask you a few personal questions."
Offering home-made delicacies is a good way to make friendships.
Your roommates feel obliged to talk and will eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise.
Of course, this depends on whether you are a decent baker.
Bad mixed lumps of flour, sugar and fat cause people to fall asleep when you knock.
Stealing food is a common crime in student homes.
Of course, chewing chicken is a theft, but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea as well?
Check it with the milk owner.
The chances are good that they say to use themselves, even if they cook inside.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying, and you have my sympathy - but try to deal with it more balancedly than my roommate who added a detergent to her milk to punish thieves.
She's in prison now.
You should not make noise that keeps people from sleep or work.
It's not just about being a decent person, it's about being among the people who sit in the glass house in the truest sense of the proverb.
A girl on my hallway asked her neighbors if it would matter to put Drum & Bass a little bit quieter, because it was three o'clock in the morning, and she had an exam in the morning.
They responded with even louder music.
When they finally stopped at 5:00 p.m., they kindly let their neighbors sleep for two hours before they had their own music plastered, closed their door, and went to their three-hour test.
Would it not be romantic if your future mate were to enter the same student home by chance?
On the other hand, would it not be profoundly embarrassing if you considered a roommate for your future wife, approached her, separated her again, and then saw her every day, and perhaps experienced how she would pass all of her common friends to herself?
Of course, the heart goes its own way - but if a hot roommate is definitely not your future spouse, at least try to talk a little reason into your abdomen.
In the exciting moment when you notice that someone has left his keys in his unclosed room, the border between a wolf and bullying is finer than it seems.
A good strike is funny, but it only takes moments until it becomes a boomerang.
Hide a valuable and fun lesson about safety - but never waste anyone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Close your door, and place your keys in a glass of water, which you then place in the freezer - but thank your assets on the ceiling no more than twice.
Houses for refugees, single parents, low-wage earners
The real estate company Markus Gildner builds row houses for people who don't have much money in the central Franconian corner valley.
So, for example, for refugees - but also as a signal: "Not only do refugees need housing, but so do the only raising mother and the lowly earner."
"I show how you can still build cheaply and well today," says the 44-year-old in the interview
Thousands of refugees will push into the housing market.
Entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes to know how quickly to create a more affordable living space: he builds row houses for refugees in a project.
Mr. Gildner, many refugees will be pushing into the housing market.
What solution do you offer?
Markus Gildner: Massive accommodation in containers or gyms has no sustainability.
Because people stay here to a large extent.
In view of the flow of refugees, we will also need sufficient housing in the next few decades.
A completely banal, three-storey terraced house is the solution.
Gildner: A row house needs the least space.
It facilitates integration.
This is different when you put people in housing blocks.
Each of the six houses that are built in the pilot project consists of three housing units for four asylum seekers each.
Each unit has two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a living room.
It may be that many refugees will say it's peace again, I go back.
Then the houses can easily be rebuilt according to the respective needs.
How high are the costs?
Gildner: The price for 160 square meters of living space per house is 184 000 euros, without land.
That's manageable.
The construction took six months.
That's appropriate.
Have the building regulations complicated their plans?
Gildner: I have successfully completed my project.
Especially complicated it always makes the threatening Damocles sword special construction and the parking regulation.
Horrible.
It is still assumed that those who create three apartments in a row house need at least three pitches.
Only in the cities lacks space for this.
And refugees and asylum seekers don't have cars.
How did the residents react to their terraced house project?
Gildner: There were some who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers.
That definitely isn't true.
But don't you intensify the competition for affordable apartments?
Gildner: True is true: We have had a building boom in Germany in the last five years, but luxury apartments have been built that can hardly afford one more.
My project has the message, even the normal people need housing.
Not only refugees, but also the single mother or the lowly earner.
I'll show you how you can still build cheaply and well today.
That's what this is about.
Markus Gildner (44) studied microsystem technology in Regensburg and initially dealt with environmental analyses.
iOS 9: How to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is released
The new operating system can be requested by going to the Settings app, tap "General" and then select "Software Update".
When it is ready, the phone gives you the option to download and then install.
Some have encountered problems after installation, as they receive an error message stating that the "software update failed".
To avoid the problem, users are advised to either wait until the storm goes back or try to update over iTunes.
The phone itself guides you through the rest of the process.
This may mean deleting apps to create space - but Apple has made it more unlikely by slimming down the update. Likewise, it will be easier to do this when using a special tool, deleting apps and then reinstalling them as soon as the process is completed.
It is worth ensuring that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is located near a charger so that the battery is charged.
If the charge is too low, Apple does not allow the update to continue, as the phone may turn off half way and this could lead to a breakdown of the update.

You should also make sure that before downloading you have looked through our checklist of all things to prevent things from going wrong and protecting yourself if they do. iOS 9 brings new features, including a much smarter personal assistant and huge new productivity features for the iPad, as well as changes that accelerate and repair the operating system.
Rosberg's Only Curriculum: Full Attack
Nico Rosberg only knows one more motto: "Full Attack" in the fight for the World Cup title in Formula 1 against his leading Mercedes teammate Lewis Hamilton.
The WM-Tweite emphasized before the start into the decisive seven overseas races, "that I have nothing left to lose".
53 points separate the Vice World Champion before the night race in Singapore on this Sunday from the title defender and double champion Hamilton.
The British won seven of the previous twelve season races and also launches the floodlight Grand Prix in the city state as a favourite.
In 2009 and last year, the 30-year-old British won the race.
Whether the current smog in the city state will have an impact on Singapore's Grand Prix is still unclear.
For days a thunder bell has been hanging over the city, triggered by fires on the neighboring island of Sumatra.
Bad Kissinger Chess Club has a prominent member
Founded three months ago, the chess club "Schachfreunde Bad Kissingen" has added another member to its ranks, increasing its membership to 19 players.
The new member is the entrepreneur Paul Gauselmann, a passionate chess and tennis player who stayed for the spa more than 40 times in Bad Kissingen.
Gauselmann is a carrier of the first-class Federal Cross of Merit and an honorary citizen of the cities of Espelkamp and Lübecke.
The chess club in Bad Kissingen supported Gauselmann with a donation, which was received by President Alfred Klein.
This makes it possible to include chess players who cannot make the membership contribution.
Youth work and talent searching should also be promoted.
Gauselmann wishes that membership in the chess club and also friendly contact with the tennis club "Rot-White" be seen as an expression of his connection with the spa town.
Quartiersbüro is looking for direct contact
Saludis and the Old Centre Antonistift have gathered under the coat of the social foundation and opened a new point of contact at Graf Stauffenberg Square.
In addition to consultations, you can also participate in courses there.
The social foundation pulls it down from the mountain to the city center.
More specifically, to the Graf Stauffenberg Square.
A new quarter office was recently opened there.
Here, right next to the shopping market, seniors and advice seekers will now receive information on issues such as care insurance or health insurance services.
For years we have been seeing with our outpatient care that often caring relatives are left alone.
There are infinitely many questions.
"Even more often, many cash benefits are not used because the complexity of insurance is barely understood," explained the new hostess Jutta Weigand, who is also responsible for the Antonistift and the Civil Hospital as well as for the outpatient service "Amadeus".
In addition to the consultations, the new district office also offers prevention, health courses and wellness.
The Saludis was taken into the boat for this purpose.
Therefore, additional offers such as fall prevention, memory training or physiotherapy can be used.
The offers from the Senior Centre and the Saludis complement each other in an ideal way.
Saludis stands for prevention, prevention and rehabilitation.
"The Senior Care Center", said Heike Riedel, Managing Director of Saludis.
The reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre is that both managing directors are particularly aware of demographic change.
Because this makes a good decentralised infrastructure in the individual districts of Bamberg essential in the future.
In addition, Mayor Wolfgang Metzner (SPD) stressed that the district office also devoted itself to the association at the age: "There are numerous events and offers on the program and these invite to a regular social gathering."
This makes the social foundation a major contribution to the ability of seniors to live as independently and as well as possible in their familiar environment.
The office is open Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 14 p.m., Tuesday and Thursday from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m.
Eintracht Bamberg v. Würzburger Kickers on 6 October
Now it is official: After the date for the game FC Eintracht Bamberg against the third-party player Würzburger Kickers had not yet been set for renovation work at the Fuchsparkstadion, the 6th October was now set as a date.
The meeting of the FC Eintracht Bamberg in the eighth final of the Bavarian Football Totopokal against the third-ligist FC Würzburger Kicker was now finalized.
Played at the Bamberger Fuchsparkstadion on Tuesday, 6 October at 19:00.
"We are glad that we now know when the game will be over the stage, now we have planning security," says FCE team manager Karlheinz Hümmer, who also points to the now launched card pre-sale.
It's special for our team to play against a third-party player.
We therefore hope for many spectators, and this is not without reason, because floodlights have a special appeal.
In the round of the last 16 teams, FC Eintracht Bamberg won the district league 1st FC Oberhaid (3:1) and at home against the regional league 1st FC Schweinfurt 05 (3:2).
The winner of the competition receives 5000 euros and qualifies for the first round of the DFB Club Cup 2016/2017.
Title Defender is third-level runner SpVgg Unterhaching.
Viennese architect Karl Mang died at the age of 92
Karl Mang, one of the doyens of Vienna's architecture, is dead.
He died on September 5 at the age of 92, as the artist's house announced on Tuesday.
With Mang the Künstlerhaus loses an honorary member and at the same time "one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna", as it was called in the broadcast.
Born in Vienna in 1922, Mang studied architecture at the Technical University in Vienna with Friedrich Lehmann during and after World War II.
Since 1952 he has worked as a freelance architect, but has also worked as a teacher, writer and head of institute.
From 1972 to 1983 he was President of the Austrian Institute of Design.
In the 1980s, he was commissioned to the Austrian Museum of Theatre with the establishment of the Treasury in the Wiener Hofburg and the conversion of the Palais Lobkowitz.
Park penalty: Tim Wiese hires policewoman with money
Tim Wiese, ex-footballer, has never been noticed in Bremen.
Soccer was once, Tim Wiese, ex-national gatekeeper in Germany and involved in Bremen and Hoffenheim, Wrestler.
According to his own statement, he has added 30 kilograms of muscle mass over the past two years.
Intellectually, however, he has not added.
Wiese just cut his hair in the city centre of Bremen when he saw how outside a parking guard issued a penalty for his white Chevrolet Camaro.
Wiese then stormed out of business, insulted the official and threw the due fine at her feet, as the "picture" newspaper reports.
At the city of Bremen one confirms the accusations, but is not yet clear about the consequences for the unusual incident.
"The matter is still under review," says the city of Bremen.
Only after that will it be decided whether or not meadow is displayed.
Panamanian authorities destroy 4500 marijuana plants
The fertile soil and the rainforest-like climate of the Isla del Rey are ideal for the well-being of marijuana plants.
For three days the Panamanian authorities have been tearing out the 4,500 plants and burning them.
Men fighting on 17-year-old Afghans
Witnesses are looking for the police for an incident in Bad Soden-Salmünster: On Friday evening, around 23.45 p.m., three young men were walking from Bad Soden towards Salmünster.
One of the group, a 17-year-old Afghan, was reported to have followed his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called on them to wait for him.
At that time, the group was at the level of the bft power station.
On the grounds of the gas station, three people also stopped.
One of these men now yelled at the young people and slapped them in the face with his fist.
The victim suffered a nose fracture and bleeding heavily from the nose.
When his two friends rushed along and spoke consolingly to the striker, he left his victim at first.
The injured young man was now brought home by his friends.
The perpetrator pursued the group with a car up to their apartment and drove there demonstratively several times.
When you no longer saw the vehicle, the injured person went to the building to smoke a cigarette.
There he was again attacked by the butcher and another male person.
With the help of a baton, the victim’s face and thighs were beaten.
The injured person had to be taken to a hospital for medical care.
So far, there is only a vague description of the perpetrators.
One of the men was about eight feet tall.
The second bat should have been about 1,65 meters tall and was dressed with a jeans and a brown-white shirt.
The police are asking witnesses and informants to report under the telephone number 06181/100-123.
Dr. Frank Müller takes over Praxis Felstehausen and invests 310000 euros
Silvia Müller-Gongoll and Frank Müller (from the left) take over the practice of Karl-Heinrich and Ursel Felstehausen.
It is also a delight for Samtgemeindeburchmeister Bernd Bormann, business promoter Uta Seim-Schwartz and Asendorf's mayor Heinz Kabbert.
In many places in the country doctors are missing - Asendorf is lucky: Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice Felstehausen on 1 October.
While Ursel Felstehausen retires, her husband Karl-Heinrich is still on his side in the next few months with half a job.
After a conversion phase Müller reopens the practice on 12 October, until then he invests EUR 310000 in the premises on St.-Marcellusstraße 6.
It was sympathy at first sight when the Felstehausens met Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller-Gongoll, who is currently completing her specialist training at the Verden hospital and wants to join the practice next year.
"We always had in mind that the Müllers would fit well into this practice," says Dr. Ursel Felstehausen and laughs.
"When it was time, I just called her."
The Muller couple liked the idea of running their own practice in Asendorf in the future.
"The proximity and constant contact with patients are very attractive for us," says 39-year-old Müller.
"We want to get to know and accompany the families over the years".
As an advantage, he sees himself soon to be his own boss.
And so one agreed, the Müllers bought the house with the practice.
However, they will continue to live in Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
There the two-time family-father Frank Müller grew up, his medical studies in Hanover followed stations in several medical practices as well as in the hospitals in Sulingen, Nienburg and Rotenburg.
He is currently working as a general practitioner in Sulingen, and in 2009 he was appointed chief emergency doctor in the district of Diepholz and is volunteered in the DRK readiness of Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
The practice will be prepared for the new boss from 19 September onwards.
While the surgeon Dr. Karl-Heinrich Felstehausen works as a general practitioner, his wife Ursel (internalist) specializes in gastroenterology.
The Müllers, both interns, want to settle down as house doctors.
"Endoscopy therefore comes out," says 38-year-old Silvia Müller-Gongell.
After the conversion, the rooms will look more modern.
We will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long-term and stress ECGs and need a more voice room.
In addition, the EDV will be completely renewed.
The Müllers receive a grant of a total of EUR 50000 as part of a funding programme from the Landkreis (25000 euros) as well as from the Samtgemeinde (12500 euros) and the municipality (12500 euros).
"This shows how proud and happy we are that the practice is continued," emphasizes Samtgemeindeburchmeister Bernd Bormann.
According to Silvia Müller-Gongoll, about 2000 patients enter the practice of Felstehausen every quarter, with an average practice of about 500 in northern Germany.
There is another general medical practice in Asendorf.
A positive side effect of taking over the practice by Frank Müller: According to Ursel Felstehausen, the pharmacy remains in Asendorf.
If no successor had been found, she would have gone too.
By the way, anyone who visits Müller's speaking time continues to look mainly at familiar faces: takes over the seven medical professionals and the cleaning power of the Felstehausens.
With their farewell an era ends in Asendorf, after all the doctors have practiced there for 30 years.
"In the beginning we only had two rooms," Ursel Felstehausen remembers smiling.
After a long period of time, she feels a little pain.
"But we continue to live in Hohenmoor and will certainly see many patients often," says the internist.
Your husband adds laughingly: "We have a 6000-square-meter base."
"I've always pressed myself before gardening, now it could be different."
In addition, the couple has two grandchildren and likes to travel.
Croatia: "We let the refugees through"
"The border controls will now also be lifted at our southern border," said Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner.
The checks at the Hungarian border remain in parallel.
It remains clear that anyone who wishes to apply for asylum can do so "of course".
The supply and security of people are at the forefront.
But it is also clear that "it needs clear signals," said the Minister.
People need to know that we do not accept borderless migration flows, even across the Austrian-Slovenian border.
It needs a controlled approach.
Croatia considering "Corridor" - Slovenia denied
The Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia also wanted to send refugees to Austria and Germany and, in some cases, also set up corridors for refugees.
This was not the case with the Minister of the Interior, Vesna Györkös Znidar in Laibach.
The idea of corridors is "absolutely unacceptable" and Slovenia will instead intensify border surveillance - especially for Hungary.
The border with Croatia, on the other hand, was already heavily controlled as the external border of the Schengen area.
However, as the Minister stressed, Slovenian does not want to block its borders for refugees.
"Every EU member must fulfil his obligations, otherwise the system will not work," said Györkös Znidar.
As the Croatian government announced, the first refugees had already tried to pass the Tovarnik/Sid border crossing in eastern Croatia during the night hours on Tuesday to avoid registration.
The Croatian police were able to pick her up in the nearby cornfields.
According to local media, police vehicles with new refugees have been constantly arriving in Croatian Tovarnik.
It is mainly about Syrians and Afghans, including numerous women and children.
Rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use.
In the coming days his country will count with about 4000 refugees, said Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic.
In addition, buses from Presevo on the Macedonian-Serbian border, which had previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border, would be diverted to Croatia, reporting Croatian and Serbian media in agreement on Wednesday.
The Belgrade government, however, argues that it is to direct people to take certain routes: "We cannot, nor do we want to do so," it said.
According to the media reports, in the early days a first bus with about 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of Sid, and further buses were expected during the day.
About Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany
The inmates had been on their way through Serbia all night from the Macedonian border, some 500 kilometres away.
"We have heard that Hungary has closed, so the police have told us to go here," said one of the refugees.
They wanted to travel through Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany.
This could actually lead to an already predicted shift of the previous Balkan route Turkey-Greece-Serbia-Hungary to a slightly further west.
Croatia: "Comprehensive possibilities for border control"
Croatia's Minister of the Interior Ostojic had previously stressed that his country had prepared plans for possible exceptional situations in the event of a strong influx of refugees.
He did not mention details, but pointed out that as a non-Schengen member, Croatia had "comprehensive possibilities for border control".
Strict controls are being carried out to qualify for membership in the Schengen area.
Slovenia has been one of these since 2007, and the EU partners have been giving a good witness to the country since then as regards the standard of border controls.
On the Serbian side, there are still about 300 refugees behind the Hungarian border fence.
According to Belgrade media reports, they had spent the past night at the Horgo border crossing leading to Röszke.
According to the Hungarian authorities, the two border crossings of Horgos and Backi Breg remain completely closed.
Whether the remaining refugees want to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear.
Serbian Interior Minister Nebojsa Stefanovic tried to calm down on Wednesday morning at a local eyelight in Horgos: he considered the debates on alternative routes of refugees, after the Hungarian border is now closed, to be premature.
It would not be a very high number of refugees at the moment.
It is not yet possible to say whether they would continue their journey over Hungary, Croatia or another country.
Help Rate Migrants - Dangerous - Alternative Routes
However, private Hungarian refugees have already begun to distribute maps to refugees on which alternative routes through Croatia have been marked.
However, the crossing of the border between Serbia and Croatia is not harmless: in parts of the border area there are also 20 years after the end of the Croatia war still uncleared minefields.
On Wednesday afternoon, the Croatian police announced that a team of miners had been sent to the border region.
Stock Exchange Hackers: Ukrainians pay 30 million dollars
Supranonok is said to have belonged to a ring of cybercriminals, which has been accused of having repeatedly gained insight into unpublished financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire, Marketwired and PR Newswire since 2010.
The information collected should have made insider business on the financial markets.
In this way, according to the investigators, more than 100 million dollars were totaled.
"Today's comparison shows that even those outside our national borders are eventually caught," says the SEC Communication.
The proceedings against 32 other accused persons in the case continued.
Most of the defendants come from Ukraine and Georgia.
The perpetrators are said to have acted both in the United States and from Eastern Europe.
Ecumenical Hospice Help Mannheim has existed for 20 years
Around the Mannheimer Paradeplatz there is a large operation.
People take care of their concerns, partly quick steps, partly cozy strolling.
They control the two stations of the Mannheimer Autosalon at the parade square.
Keeping city railways.
Pulsating, grand life with beautiful autumn sunshine and in the middle of each four large panels with the title "Before I Want to Die"....
The ecumenical hospice aid made this action aware of its 20-year existence and faces mixed reactions.
"It's about life, so we went with the action in the middle of the city and among the people," says Josefine Lammer.
The head of the Ecumenical Hospice Aid is available to passers-by for questions and conversations as well as the volunteer staff.
While some passers-by spontaneously grasp the chalk and add to the sentence of "knowing my life", "reading", "driving with the camper through the USA", "stop the war" or "not suffering for long", others stay short, read, say sentences like "as far as I'm not yet" and then go on.
Time and again small discussions develop on the margins about the action itself, about life, about dealing with death.
Peter Hübinger is also on site.
"Only if I realize that the end will come for me at some point in the world can I live responsibly," says the director of the Diaconic Work Mannheim, who is together with the Caritas Association to support the Ecumenical Hospice Aid.
Therefore, this public action for the 20-year-old is good.
The fact that not everyone would like to be publicly informed on the boards, however, is understandable, and finally it is a very personal matter.
The subject of death and death is still subject to taboo, according to the experience of Josefine Lammer, although the hospice movement in recent years has contributed much to the people's opening up.
An assessment that Angelika Godefroid shares.
The death and mourning companion is one of the volunteers of the first hour.
Faced with the topic through personal experience, she read a lot of literature and decided to get involved in the death aid.
When the Ecumenical Hospice sought volunteers by phone, she immediately reported and was present at the founding in 1995.
Godefroid belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - who are accompanied by the affected and relatives in private households, hospitals, nursing homes and in the Hospice of Saint Vincent.
They are all carefully trained.
Angelika Godefroid can do well with her task and the experiences and experiences she has gained.
"I see life from another wait, consider it precious and appreciate the moment," she says.
The offer of the outpatient ecumenical hospice service is free of charge and independent of the denomination.
The financial support of health insurance funds and donations from relatives and associations allows training as well as training and supervision of the death and mourning companions.
Training is offered every two years for new employees.
The tables described on Saturday are now displayed in the house of the Evangelical Church (M1, 1a) and in the house of the Catholic Church (F2, 6).
Further personal wishes can also be noted on postcards.
FedEx results mixed, financial prospects for 2016 decreased
FedEx reports disappointing results for the last quarter, and the delivery giant reduced its profit outlook to a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its ground transport service.
The company also said that she is planning to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday.
At this time last year, FedEx announced that the company would like to recruit 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season.
The share fell more than 2.5 percent in premarket trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said to earn a profit between $10.40 and $10.90 in the financial year ending next May, 20 cents less than in the previous forecast.
Analysts expected $10.84 according to a survey of FactSet.
The lower outlook comes despite the rise in prices, which on average amounts to 4.9% and will take effect on 4 January and despite higher increases for soil transport of heavy and large packages, which will be collected from November onwards.
The company said that it still expected that earnings would increase compared to the previous year due to cost reductions, higher revenues and growth in online sales.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company "provides solid revenues when considering the weaker than expected economic conditions, especially in manufacturing and global trade".
The plans for holiday employment were announced one day later than the Rival UPS, which plans to recruit 90,000 to 95,000 additional workers, about the same number as last year.
In the quarter, which ended on August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, 6 percent more than in the previous year.
Earnings per share amounted to $2.42 per share, just behind the $2.44 per share that twelve analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research predicted.
Sales rose by 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
Six of Zack's analysts surveyed expected $12.23 billion.
In recent years, FedEx has seen a decline in international priority shipping that has stagnated sales in its Express unit.
But the boom in online shopping has increased the results at FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, land transport sales rose by 29 percent, but the operating result was basically flat due to higher costs for larger parcels and self-insurance.
The Express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices, while the result decreased due to higher labour costs in the freight business.
In the premarket trade, about an hour before the opening, the FedEx shares sank by $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $10.15.
On Tuesday they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent under a record high on June 11.
At its most expected meeting in the year, Federal Reserve Strategegen spends two days this week sitting around a 27-foot Honduras-Mahagoni table to decide if it is time to raise the key interest rate for the first time in almost a decade.
Threatened by them at the end of the decorated, two-storey meeting room is a mural of the United States.
The card is a reminder that Fed President Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues are to put the nation's economic interests ahead of everything else.
The Central Bank has a twofold order from Congress: maximizing US employment and keeping prices stable here.
But since the great recession, the Fed leaders have acknowledged that there is an unwritten third mandate: financial stability.
And this third mandate could be the X-factor in a decision that is too narrow to predict it. It is announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to take off the unprecedented incentive by the near-zero short-term interest rate since the end of 2008.
Although most of the economic data show that it is growing solidly, the recent turbulence in global financial markets could make the already cautious Fed representatives afraid to increase this volatility by increasing interest rates on federal bonds - and even by a quarter of a percentage point.
"Of course, the labour market and inflation will be the most important thing they observe," said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at the brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think if they were looking for a pretext not to increase the interest rate, the increased uncertainty around the global market is enough justification to continue to wait," she said.
There is no consensus on what the Fed is going to do, which in itself insures the financial market.
About half of the economists surveyed recently by Bloomberg predicted an increase in interest rates this week.
However, financial markets expect the Fed to wait, with a key indicator showing only a 30% chance of an increase.
This indicates a decline in the stock market if the Fed increases the rate, unless the strategists mitigate the blow by promising that another increase is far away.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial averaged 228.89 points or 1.4% to 16.599.85.
The action was triggered by expectations that Fed policy will maintain the sentence this week, said John Lonski, Chief Economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
It would be a surprise if the Fed were to raise the rates at that time," he said.
If she does, "in her statement she has to go very far to calm the financial markets so that they don't panic."
Other experts argued that an increase in interest rates would calm the financial markets because it would eliminate the uncertainty about when the Fed would act.
Just a month ago, the Fed seemed on a good path to increase the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US.
Yellen had said in spring and early summer that this year, despite the complaints from liberals that more economic progress would be needed, she expected an increase in the rate.
Although job creation slowed down in August, the improvement in the labour market was solid this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest for more than seven years and close to the level considered by the Fed to be full employment.
Increases in wages have shown signs of recovery.
And although inflation was constantly below the annual target of 2% of the central bank, the Fed representatives said that the main reason is the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy "can handle higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension on the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But the financial markets around the world collapsed at the end of last month after China had devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial average fell by more than 16% below its peak in May, when investors feared that slowing down the Chinese economy would dampen global growth.
The market has recovered somewhat this month, with the Dow now almost 10% below the May high.
For Fed representatives, market turbulence affects the complex calculation of when to increase interest rates.
"If the events on the financial markets and the news of the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the last few weeks, they would have taken the lead in this session," said Stephen D. Oliner, Senior Research Fellow at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former US-Note Bank employee.
Now he predicts that they will wait at least one month to get better control of the effects.
"There's a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the US economy will be, and there's almost no reliable data to describe the developments in China," said Oliner.
The health of the world economy is not one of the main concerns of the Fed, so it should not be technically involved in its decision-making.
But in the end, the Fed has become the monetary authority of the world.
The influence of the Central Bank has been enormous in recent years.
The mere indication by then director Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could "encumber" its monetary expansion caused confusion around the globe.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, Fed representatives can be expected to monitor not only developments elsewhere but also consult with other central banks and experts in order to gain a better understanding of the global economy.
Her decision-making is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of the global asset management strategy of Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, VA., noted this month that "the Fed has a history of over-reactions on financial market movements that are apparently not linked to the economic fundamentals."
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, who is committed to raising interest rates, cited decisions in 1998/1999 as an example.
A financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to lower its key interest rate by 0.75 percentage points in three meetings "despite the limited recognizable impact on growth in the US", said Lacker.
A year later, the Fed representatives reversed these reductions.
The Fed should put financial stability issues first only during a severe crisis such as the 2008 market collapse, said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England's interest-rate fixing committee.
The recent turbulences do not come near this level, he said.
"She certainly does not want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of an increase in interest rates because the markets are exhilarating," said Posen, President of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until that is changed, I do not believe that it should advance time.
Do you need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown
The market/stock was opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
LAX-C is often referred to as Thai Costco and is a Thai wholesale market that also sells to the general public.
Yeah, he's in Chinatown and not in Thai Town.
The market/camp is a central point of contact and offers a confusing number of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian snacks, and dishes, furniture, religious jewelry and Christmas decorations.
There is even a car department if you need engine oil.
The store is huge, and it takes over an hour to stroll through the corridors.
If the whole shop makes you hungry, there is a meal in the LAX-C BBQ Express for you.
The kitchen (good and cheap) in this shop is located near the cashier and has various take-away options.
What there is here: Do you need something - anything - Thai?
LAX-C probably has it.
Products are cheap and a number of them are sold in large quantities.
Fresh products include Asian specialties and regional Thai herbs, fruits and much more.
The meat counter is extensive, as is the fish counter - the staff behind the counter will clean and fillet the fish and even fry on request for you.
A good part of the store belongs to the massive freezing department. Here you will find frozen curry leaves, bitter melon and galgant, whole ducks, fish, bovine blood and bile, pig-natural intestine, fish balls, regional sausage, commercially prepared food and more.
Who buys here: restaurant owners and chefs, also individual families and individuals.
The wide corridors are suitable for shopping carts and forklifts.
You can find here: fresh Monthong Durian next to the checkout.
Where it is: The store is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles on the outskirts of Chinatown and downtown - a few blocks away from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own parking area, along with other shops and restaurants.
Even if the shop is well visited, it is not difficult to find a parking lot.
Hoyerswerda: Small life support for refugees
More and more refugees arrive in Germany these days.
To offer you a warm welcome does not go without the commitment of countless volunteer helpers.
There are also a number of people in Hoyerswerda who support unselfish asylum seekers in the city.
They include Petra and Klaus Heine.
Petra Heine is a teacher with body and soul.
She still loves to teach with her 74 lentils.
Every Thursday she does it in the asylum-seeker's home on Dillinger Street.
There she helps refugees from Syria, Kurdistan, Kosovo and Pakistan learn the German language.
Of course, this is quite different from teaching at a proper school.
Brazil's Pediatric Society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breastfeeding
The Brazilian pediatric organization SPRS is trying to shockingly inform women about the importance of good nutrition during breast-feeding. It does this with the presentation of pictures of babies sucking on breasts painted with depictions of unhealthy foods.
Breast milk consists of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system.
Due to the additional energy requirements, pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calories by about 500 calories a day.
However, new research indicates that higher calorie intake is not the only dietary adjustment that mothers should make.
A recent study conducted by Robert Waterland, professor at the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from developing tumors.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet of the child can adversely affect the immune system.
Exceptions for the new Bernrieder Sporthalle
The municipal councillor Bernried approved the construction application for the 2.3 million euros expensive sports hall.
And he made an exception.
The roof may become flatter for the solar system.
The plans for the long-awaited gymnastics building at the Bernried sports grounds are progressing step by step: In the recent municipal council meeting, the construction application was unanimously cancelled without much discussion.
The board had previously decided, among other things, an application for a construction "exception" or "exemption" from the valid building plan.
The "exception" was about the permission for a special form of roof construction.
Thus, a "saddle roof with non-middle first and roof handle" is to be built.
The planning background is the planned use of the roof area for solar systems: "This means that we get a wonderfully large south roof together," said Mayor Josef Steigenberger at the meeting.
In turn, the "liberation" was about the roof inclination, which is supposed to be less than ten degrees for energy reasons - unlike the construction plan.
This significantly reduces the volume of the hall.
A "exemption" was therefore necessary because the plan of construction does not allow for "exceptions" in relation to the roof inclination - with the Bernried municipal council generally acting more restrictively in the case of requests for exemption.
Turnhallenbau is not a recurring project, however: "We do not create a precedent for this," says Steigenberger.
The Turnhallenbau am Sportzentrum is a joint project between the municipality and the SV Bernried.
Some 2.3 million euros have been included at costs.
Grants are expected from school and wide-ranging sport promotion.
In the next stage of the procedure, the building application for the 18 x 36 meter hall is now submitted for examination to the Landratsamt.
Klinik Peißenberg moves to Schongau
The Peißenberg hospital is to be closed earlier than planned - namely 2016.
At the same time, Dr. Wilhelm Fischer (66) will be new Director of Medical at the Schongau Hospital.
The station and the majority of employees move from Peissenberg with them to Schongau.
This provides for the surprising plans of the Hospital GmbH of the County Council, confirmed by Countess Andrea Jochner-Weiß.
However, a decision on this is taken by the Supervisory Board, and the meeting next Wednesday, 23 September.
If the plans were to be implemented, all of the nearly 50 employees at the hospital in Peissenberg would be employed.
The vast majority were to move with fishermen and the remaining internal station to Schongau.
The rooms were present.
According to Jochner-Weiß, employees who cannot go to Schongau are to be offered a job in Weilheim.
The employees were informed of the plans.
The change triggered the termination of Dr. Andreas Eder, who has only been a doctor director of the Schongauer Klinik since the beginning of the year and is now switching to a private practice in the immediate vicinity of the hospital.
According to Jochner-Weiß, the name "fisher" came into play, who declared himself ready to take over the lead from 1 October and change with his team to Schongau.
For the house in Schongau, this means in any case an "upgradation" and a broadening of the offer in the field of "inner medicine", says Jochner-Weiß.
Fischer is a specialist in pacemakers and defibrillators.
Schongau (180 beds) specializes in gastroenterological diseases at the inner station.
In transition for the next two years, when the Board of Supervisors agrees to lead both houses, fishermen with their team are to be finally closed in Peissenberg after almost 140 years until next year the former hospital of scarcity, which still has 35 beds.
So far, the county had planned this for 2018 when the ongoing renovation at the Weilheim Hospital is completed.
Landratin Jochner-Weiß, who is also chairman of the Supervisory Board, encountered rumors that the house, which is owned by the Federal Shortage, will be used as accommodation for asylum-seekers in the future.
As with the property, Jochner-Knowledge could not say, there are several considerations.
There is currently a short-term care of the Caritas and a daily psychiatry.
"What better could not happen to us, such an opportunity does not come back," says Fischer about the Quasi move to the Lech, which had been recorded "positive and very understanding" by the employees.
A real perspective for the house where fishermen have been working as chief doctors for over 30 years has not existed.
He had been asked by Schongauer colleagues to take over the position of the Medical Director.
The Peißenberg Hospital (one hundred beds) has been under constant threat of closure over the past decades, departments have been closed, such as surgery and maternity care.
The handballs of the Rhein-Neckar lions are required at the Bergische HC this evening (20.15).
The table leader of the Bundesliga is the clear favourite in Wuppertal, but there is no reason for superiority.
Last season, the Badeners took a painful defeat at the BHC and have something to do with it.
Hunting dune with two injured at Pratau
Two tractor drivers were severely injured by shooting during their corn harvest on Tuesday afternoon.
During the aberration on a cornfield near Pratau (Kreis Wittenberg), several hunters were in use, as the police reported.
After a shooting, a 63-year-old and a 22-year-old man suffered serious injuries and were taken to hospitals.
At first, how exactly the accident could have occurred was unclear.
The criminal police are investigating.
Missing 16-year-olds from Rhineland-Palatinate victims of violent crimes
A suspect has led the police to the body of the 16-year-olds from Rhineland-Palatinate who have been missing since Saturday.
In the interrogation, the 20-year-old admitted to having killed the young people and thrown their bodies into a canal in Rockenhausen.
A 16-year-old from Rhineland-Palatinate who has been missing since Saturday has fallen victim to a violent crime.
The body of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rockenhausen near Kaiserslautern, as the prosecutor and police reported on Wednesday.
A 20-year-old who is also arrested on Tuesday evening is considered to be a suspect and the investigators have led to the location of the body.
The 16-year-old had been reported missing on Sunday morning, after she had not returned home as agreed on the eve of a visit to Rockenhausen after a fall festival.
In the search for the young woman, the investigators initially encountered personal objects of the victim.
In the case of interviews in the circle of friends and acquaintances of the missing persons, there was a suspicion of a crime against the 20-year-old.
The suspected perpetrator then led the police to a canal in Rockenhausen, where the body was found.
The arrested person admitted to the authorities in the police interrogation, killed the 16-year-old and put the body in the canal.
The 20-year-old was to be presented to the prison judge on Wednesday, the investigators put him to death.
Further investigations are to be made into the details of the situation.
Refugees need accommodation: Study warns against apartment gaps
The situation on the German housing market is tense.
More and more refugees are also looking for a affordable stay.
The pressure on the housing market is growing.
Social housing is facing a challenge.
The distribution struggles on the German housing market have long since begun.
With the incoming refugees and jobseekers from the EU, more and more people are pushing for a market that is already overburdened in many large cities.
They compete with low-income citizens for the last affordable apartments.
In order to meet the demand for affordable apartments, 400,000 new units would need to be built each year by 2020.
This is the result of a study commissioned by the Association of Social Housing.
For comparison: This year, 260,000 units will be completed in Germany.
This lacks 140,000 apartments.
Refugees are no longer obliged after the first three months of their stay to live as asylum seekers in an initial accommodation.
Many then come to the housing market and line up in the long snakes in front of the rental apartments.
According to the Federal Statistical Office, however, less than half of all asylum seekers lived for rent last year.
However, the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the rising numbers of refugees.
The study is also a major failure in the housing policy of recent years.
Germany is pushing a housing deficit, which is growing year by year.
Currently, some 770,000 housing units were missing in the urban areas, laments Matthias Günther, author of the study.
Many workers therefore lived in large cities in need of WG rooms.
Young adults stayed involuntarily longer in the "Hotel Mama" because of the whistle on the apartment market.
In the big cities, the number of square meters per head has fallen for the first time in recent years.
To solve the problem, the alliance "Social Housing" proposes a restart.
New incentives should stimulate social housing.
For example, the basic income tax could be waived and the land tax on assisted dwellings would be suspended for a limited period.
In addition, according to the Alliance, attractive tax depreciation options are necessary.
The funding programme for refugee accommodation by the Staatsbank KfW is already well received by cities and municipalities.
A good week after the start, more than half of the approximately 300 million euros available had already been called up on Monday evening with 184 million euros.
Now the project could even be increased.
Refugees have free access: Croatia and Slovenia set up a corridor
To Hungary there is virtually no way through, as more and more refugees are choosing the way over Croatia.
Zagreb announces to grant the passage through Slovenia to the north without hindrance.
However, the route is dangerous.
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbouring country of Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees.
"I have spoken with the Slovenian Minister of the Interior, and if necessary we will organise a corridor," said Croatian Minister of the Interior Ranko Ostojic.
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area.
The EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country.
After the Serbian-Hungarian border was cut off, hundreds of refugees broke into Croatia to get from there to Western Europe.
500 people crossed the border at Tovarnik, reports the Croatian TV station RTL.
Hungary had blocked its border for refugees the day before.
Moreover, new laws that came into force on the same day make regular asylum procedures virtually unnecessary in Hungary.
Croatia wants to let the refugees happen.
Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic said: "You can travel through, and we are preparing for this opportunity."
These people are there, there are women, children and men who want to live and achieve something.
However, it was people who did not want to live in Croatia.
In the morning, the Croatian police picked up the first refugees at Serbia's border with the EU-neighbourhood country Croatia.
Most of them were reported to have come from Syria, Iran and Afghanistan.
They came both by bus and taxi to the Serbian border town of Sid.
Immediately after their arrival, they would have tried to cross the green border to Croatia on foot.
At the Croatian-Serbian border, the refugees do not encounter border fences.
The border line poses other dangers for this: there are still sharp mines from the Yugoslav Civil War in the 1990s.
Mine clearancers should now quickly create a safe passage.
However, hardly more refugees come to Hungary after the border is closed.
On Tuesday, the police counted 366 people.
It had been 9380 shortly before the closing of the gate on Monday.
The new Hungarian laws constitute a crime of overcoming and damaging the frontier fence.
35 criminal proceedings were initiated in the southern Hungarian border town of Szeged.
The sentenced persons are threatened with imprisonment for up to five years and the deportation from the country.
According to the immigration authority, a total of 94 asylum applications were received on Tuesday in the newly established "transitzons" at the border, almost all of which - 93 - are at the most important crossing of Röszke.
Among the applicants are 13 families with young children and two older people.
On Wednesday morning, 40 refugees were still there.
In practice, however, no one has any prospect of getting asylum in Hungary.
According to Hungary, Serbia is a "safe third country".
The rejected asylum seekers are to be deported there.
Before the "transit zone" in Röszke, only a few hundred refugees gathered.
In Röszke, workers started to clean up.
They collected the garbage that tens of thousands of people had left on the road in recent weeks.
Sperrgitter was dismantled and one of the reception camps in the border area was rebuilt.
No one wanted to comment on the objective of this conversion.
After the close of the border between Serbia and Hungary, Austria only reaches a few refugees.
The country has also strengthened its border controls.
However, around 20,000 migrants remained in the country according to government records.
In Salzburg, about 1400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany.
The train traffic from there to Germany was stopped on the morning at the direction of the German authorities.
In Freilassing, smaller groups of refugees regularly arrived on foot.
Mayor drove "beached" across the border
"After the bridge festival on Sunday we were busy cleaning up when suddenly ten people with suitcases stood at the entrance of the tent," said Wernstein's mayor Alois Stadler.
Tourists, they wanted to take the train to Passau.
On Sunday, however, Germany stopped rail traffic with Austria surprisingly because of the flow of refugees," Stadler, who immediately offered his help and drove the stranded along with two other helpers and their cars across the border to the nearby Passau, said.
Previously, we tasted the unexpected guests first, with jause and drinks.
We just said we'd take her by car to Passau.
"That was for us, of course," said Stadler in the OÖN discussion.
They were very grateful.
A man did not allow himself to hand over a generous donation - 100 euros for the fire department.
"We were very pleased about this," says Stadler.
The stranded train passengers had moved from an ICE to Passau on Sunday evening in Wels to try to cross the border after the short-term announcement that the rail traffic to Germany was stopped.
However, the regional train was stopped before the border in Wernstein am Inn.
In Wernstein the cross-border is generally high in course.
The bridge festival was sociable with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday, on the previous days a two-bridge run sporty - organized by the Union Wernstein and Bavaria from Neukirchen.
The fact that Viktor Orbán now sends us thousands of more cigars is a logical result of a hypocritical policy:
Instead of helping Röszke immediately to establish structures to ensure humanity in the camp, our Federal Chancellor has officially and publicly moved the attitude of the Hungarian government into the dark circle of National Socialism.
The suffering of this policy is not only those Austrians who are now facing chaotic conditions in the border regions.
The refugees will also have to find that the "promised country", which they have invited and welcomed, is nothing but another refugee camp.
It will be a great challenge, given the continuing flows of refugees and the approaching winter, to create humane conditions for those seeking protection.
And it will be even greater - to maintain peace, security and stability in Austria.
Konrad in search of 35,000 winter-proof quarters
Konrad has all his hands to do with refugee accommodation.
Christian Konrad is accustomed to his word having weight.
The government has used the former powerful Raiffeisen banker to set up quarters for the thousands of refugees.
The chaos in the first shooting centre Traiskirchen has already caught up with Konrad.
"We no longer have homeless people in Traiskirchen," he reported about his first success.
The accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who had come to Austria on Monday was also without large vortex, said Konrad and praised the organizational "master performance".
The Ministry of the Interior, on the other hand, spoke of a "crisisful situation".
In total, Konrad expects a demand of 85,000 quarters this year.
In order to meet the number, 35,000 additional accommodations have to be found in the next weeks - 20,000 are to provide the countries, 15,000 of the federal government.
Should there be more refugees, we can make it.
"But it's not a barrel without soil," said Konrad.
He has already had talks with the heads of state.
These would have assured him to create quarters for the coming refugees as well.
"In Upper Austria it's going well," said Ferry Maier.
The former VP mandate supports Konrad.
Tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schönborn to clarify how the church will help.
The asylum coordinator also places great expectations in the ORF "Help Like Us" action.
Privates can offer simple accommodation on the platform.
In addition, you hope for hotels that are empty in winter.
Konrad and Maier criticized the standards for accommodation as "very high" yesterday.
In times of need, it could not be that quarterers have to comply with a certain amount of towel holders or size of upper lights.
For a limited period of time, "emergency standards" should apply.
In contrast to the Ministry of the Interior, he is more successful at accommodation, Konrad explains with his experience.
I am an older man, to whom the falsehood is not immediately said in the face.
Convinctiveness was his most important weapon.
Konrad and Maier do not cause the Republic any costs, as they themselves explained.
They want to increase their number of employees to three to four.
Your own search for quarters has not yet been successful.
Konrad wanted to set up a container at Stephansplatz as an office.
But there are obviously problems with the authorization.
Linz calls for a better division
For the time being, no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as Tips-Arena and Design Center to accommodate refugees is planned by the city of Linz.
This is not necessary at the moment, as it is currently possible to accommodate those affected without these measures, says Mayor Klaus Luger (SP).
In the event of an emergency, however, further sites should be checked for their suitability.
Criticism is exercised by the head of the city in the division of refugees within the federal state.
Other districts, too, have to make their contribution here.
Seehofer: "Borders are not locked"
In a longer telephone call with the Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU), Head of State Josef Pühringer (VP) agreed on the further action in the refugee question on Monday.
Seehofer assured me that the German borders will not be blocked.
The continuation of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany was still possible.
However, there is now the appropriate border controls.
There will be no more special moves with refugees to Germany for the time being.
However, the applicants would be brought to Germany on a regular basis.
From the other EU Member States, Pühringer once again called for greater solidarity in the refugee issue.
For Pühringer, the fact that Austria is also introducing controls at its borders is "a logical consequence" of the Germans' actions.
The next Runtastic is a question of time
The general renovation of the "New Shipyard" in the Linz industrial line is officially completed.
On four of the six floors of the office and production building, the listed IT group S&T has moved in and the rest (2700 square meters) is to be rented to young, innovative companies from the technology sector.
"In IT, the smart minds are our raw material - and we have to try to make them work for us," says S&T Chief Hannes Niederhauser.
He could imagine investing in startup companies of the New Shipyard and later also acquiring some.
From the beginning, S&T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - of which Niederhauser promises: "The next Runtastic is just a matter of time".
1.7 million euros were invested by S&T in the location, 3.3 million euros from the Techcenter, one-third of the city of Linz, the country of Upper Austria and the Federal Republic of Germany (FFG).
The building is leased by Linz AG to S&T and Techcenter for 60 years.
30 percent of the 2700 square meters of remaining space in the building are already rented, for another 40 percent there are requests.
Lia Peroni owner opened second store in the arcade
Furla handbags are at the center of the new shop.
Jutta Breit actually wanted to lay down a dog.
The 49-year-old owner of Lia Peroni in the Taubenmarkt-Arkade had to postpone this project briefly: finally, she has grown in the form of another business premises.
In the Furla shop opposite the store where they sell, among other things, bags, suitcases, shoes and clothing from different manufacturers, everything is now centered around women's handbags of the brand Furla, wallets are starting from 75 euros.
Larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros.
The new shop has been in operation since yesterday.
Previously, several weeks have been changed.
"But I've been thinking for a long time about opening another store," says Breit.
The decision was decisive, among other things, that the Furla producers, who are at home in Bologna, were also inspired by the idea of their own location, where only their handbags are sold.
"We are the only ones in the Linz area who sell this brand," says the mother of two daughters who have Italian roots.
Her fashion interest got broad from her mother into the cradle.
I do most well when something develops and I can show new trends at fair prices.
Why some women, when looking at a beautiful handbag, are in a trance, can't answer the expert woman with the last certainty.
Maybe it's because a nice bag enhances every outfit.
The Brulljesmacher from Kallstadt
The Palatinate ancestors of Donald Trump came from a place whose inhabitants are called the landlords.
This property also combines some with the billionaire who wants to become the US President.
Donald Trump (69) is always good for intruders.
Whether he is hostile to foreigners, about journalists or reveals gaps in knowledge in international crisis policy - the candidate for the US Presidency is strongly inciting the election campaign.
And cut well.
This is also recorded in the Palatinate Kallstadt, where the grandparents of the real estate billionaire come from.
The New Yorker with the hairdresser is a term many in the wine village on the Weinstraße.
Some people in the 1200-resident-town are more than ten corners related to him.
His grandfather came from Kallstadt in the Palatinate: Donald Trump, here in campaign mode.
Simone Wendel made a film about Trump.
And what do the villagers think about his goal of becoming the most powerful man in the world?
"I think they find this kind of exciting, but they are not so deeply impressed in their Kallstadt style," says Simone Wendel.
The native Kallstädterin has filmed an amusing documentary about the place and its famous sprösslings, which includes the Ketchup family Heinz in addition to Trump.
Trump, who is not known for modesty, also speaks in "Kings of Kallstadt" (2014) - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he lived in Kallstadt.
He did not bring it there to the king of hearts.
While there is respect for the performance of the family, but also tending to believe that Trump is "a bit of a big mouth," says Wendel.
By chance, the nickname that Kallstadt has in the vicinity is "Die Brulljesmacher" - to Hochdeutsche: the editors, she says.
Trump comes from the village of the warden.
Trump's success story began in 1885 when his later grandfather emigrated and opened a place for gold diggers in the United States.
The foundation of the real estate group was the first land purchase in New York.
But the life of grandparents was not free from tragedy: their desire to return to their homeland in the long term failed in the Bavarian state, to which the Palatinate belonged at that time.
He did not take Trump because he had once left without permission, the director of the Institute of Palatinate History and Folklore, Roland Paul, had declared the film to start.
Trump was the grandson of an "illegal immigrant".
This contrasts with the sometimes striking statements of the descendant.
He had repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the USA and demanded the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants.
"Like the polterate, this is not as sympathetic," says Hans-Joachim Bender, a distant relative of Trump ("The Grandma was a born Trump, the grandfather was born Heinz").
The retired winemaker sees the American rather distant, "he's always so uplifting".
Does he think Trump's coming?
"I can't imagine that," says the 72-year-old.
"He never took care of Kallstadt."
The pensioner Veronika Schramm mentions, like some Kallstadters, that a descendant of the Heinz family spent something on a visit for the Church’s noodles, which generally arrived well.
"I can't imagine that from Donald," says the 68-year-old.
She would find it better if he did not win the election, for "he has such radical views, I don't know if that's good".
If those who had spoken at the time of his grandfather in the United States had been like him, "he would never have arrived there."
"There are more interesting topics than him," says Winzerdaughter Sarah Bühler.
And as president?
"It's not my president," she says.
And: "The grapes will also mature without President Trump".
Wendel's film, for which Trump has been interviewed for a long time, has seen 12,000 moviegoers, and also in the United States the interest aroused.
The upper Bavarian municipality of Ramsau near Berchtesgaden is Germany's first "mountain village".
From the hands of the Vice-President of the Deutsche Alpenverein, Ludwig Wucherpfennig, the 1800-resident village in the National Park Berchtesgaden received the award for soft tourism on Wednesday.
There are already 20 "mountain villages" in Austria.
In the neighbouring country, the Alpenverein is responsible for awarding the award.
A "mountain village" may not have more than 2500 inhabitants.
At least one fifth of its area shall be designated as a protected area.
Seven's Sunrise dominates the reviews, despite Nine's attempts to take over the loss of leadership at the Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson rush to Canberra to report after the loss of the leadership of the liberals, but it did not make any major shifts in the reviews for today.
Nine's breakfast show was broadcast by the federal capital when Malcolm Turnbull made Tony Abbott's fall.
The Rival Sunrise, with the moderators David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was part of a one-week series of international television programs in London, including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This disadvantage of the distance seemed to play no role for Australian TV viewers, as Sunrise averaged 397,000 viewers among the five capitals, compared to Today 339,000.
Today achieved a slight increase compared to the ratings for Monday (317.000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but its number remained behind the last Thursday (343.000).
Today has closed the gap to Sunrise in recent months.
In August, today reached an average of 318,000 compared to 330,000 of Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the distance was between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far in September Sunrise has an average of 349,000 spectators of 314,000 at Today.
This is the most interesting thing that happens every morning.
The winds of change affect these morning people more than Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for the review!

The great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former serial star of Packed to the Raffers Erik Thomson.
The new drama about a recently widowed father who decides to settle with his two children on the coast of New Zealand reached a very impressive number of 1,219 million spectators.
Critics had wondered if Thomson could wear a hit show solo without the Ratters Star Rebecca Gibney.
Last night's result answered this with a clear "yes".
Seven's X-factor remained strong with 1.136 million spectators and slightly beat The Block (838.000) and TBL families (726.000).
Seven had mixed results on evening two of The Chase Australia.
The first half hour (17.00 to 5.30 p.m.) of the new quiz show, moderated by Andrew O'Keefe, averaged 446,000 spectators.
The second half hour (17:30 to 18:00) jumped to 623,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Eddie McGuire's hot seat (613,000).
On Monday evening, the first half hour of The Chase Australia reached 520,000 spectators and in the second half hour satisfied 70,000.
Hot-Seat averaged 620,000.
The decline in the quotas of the second evening of The Chase Australia will make Nine confident that hot-seat will finally prevail at 5:30 p.m.
The Chase Australia is a substitute for a million dollar minute that failed to overwhelm McGuire's show.

The last three agree: Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose?
Secret revealed? ...
Lana Jeavons-fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have unknowingly revealed who won the Bachelor.
The woman, who finally landed at Sam Wood in The Bachelor, was covered in the greatest secrecy.
And none of the three remaining girls will surely not reveal whether she is the one who received the last rose.
But when we checked in with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons-fellows the day before being out of three two, you may have accidentally given a clue who will be the winner.
Sam Wood keeps his lips sealed until the finale on Thursday
All three women have left out in a lyrical way about why Wood is the perfect man, mentioning his sense of humor, ambition, family values and positive attitude as reasons why they want to be his partner.
However, if the question is asked, "If you don't, who should get Wood's last rose?", their answers could become the degenerate who won the bachelor's heart.
Jeavons-fellows and Markoski both quickly called Mackay the best partner for Wood except themselves.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship from day one.
"From the moment I went into the house and noticed (Sarahs) and Sam's energies, I felt that they were quite compatible, and I thought this throughout the show," said Jeavons-fellows.
"Sarah is standing on the ground with both feet, it is so much fun to be with her," added Markoski.
I saw them together, and they have the right chemistry.
They feel comfortable and comfortable with each other.
Sarah Mackay thinks she and Sam Wood would be a good couple.
From her point of view, Mackay said that last week's visit made her realize that Wood could be "the One".
"As soon as I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this is obviously not just a game - I am now unreservedly tuned to him," she said.
And when she was asked who to choose Wood, if not her, she was mysterious.
"I don't know if I can say that," she said.
I love the remaining girls alike - there's a decision between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor will be broadcast on ten on Wednesday, 19:30.

Jarryd Hayne had several options to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after his move to the United States - and there were many other teams who sent inquiries after his impressive open day at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula and it looks like a smart decision.
Some trainers would have banned Hayne from the bank for the rest of the game when he lost an organ as much as the Aussie-Rugby-Liga-Convertit did on his first point return on Tuesday at the 20-3 victory against Minnesota.
But Tomsula trusted his husband and gave Hayne the next opportunity to return a point and also to the current game after an injury from Reggie Bush.
Tomsula continued to show his true face in the changing room after the game.
Instead of grinding his rookies in front of the rest of the team through the mill, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly strengthened Hayne in his post-game press conference.
The 49er sports reporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by Special Team Coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget his lost catch and take care of the next game.
Jarryd Hayne patzt at a point restored in the first quarter of the Minnesota Vikings
It was certainly not the start that Hayne and his massive Australian follow-up to his NFL debut had hoped.
Hayne left the field after the fumble cursing and later told Australian radio Duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 that he could not imagine a worse start in his NFL career,
"That was a thing that happens now, you just take care of the next game, and that's it," said Hayne.
Hayne compared the Schnitzer with his original debut back in 2007, when a pass in his own in-goal area led to a Try for Queensland.
Overall, it was a great experience for the 27-year-old.
Hayne poses for a photo with fans and holds an Australian flag after the game and posted it on his Instagram.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights
Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Russia's richest man, was arrested on a Siberian roller coaster.
After openly challenging President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was sentenced, his oil company Yukos confiscated, and his democratic efforts stopped.
Free voters demand that 1000 new teachers be recruited in Bavaria because of the high numbers of refugees.
Party and political leader Hubert Aiwanger warned at the beginning of the autumn FW clause in Großwallstadt about a serious crisis at Bavaria's schools, if there are not new teachers for the many new students: "We need at least 1000 additional teachers to save schools from collapse," said Aiwanger.
"Otherwise, we're going to get rejections in the Bavarian education system."
The Landtagsfreakte der Freie Electoren meets until Friday in the Lower Franconian municipality.
Actually, very different main topics were planned.
But the record number of refugees now dominates the Free Voter Meeting.
"Of course, the issue of asylum will overwhelm the Klausur," said Aiwanger.
Aiwanger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria, as they did during the Yugoslavia wars in the 1990s.
"That's not how it goes, we have to get to the causes," said the Free Election Chief.
Rejected asylum seekers want to postpone the free voters as soon as possible.
That is why Aiwanger also demanded more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum complaints: "We also need at least 50 new asylum judges," said Aiwanger.
The FW Chief criticized that several federal states were not consistent: "We need uniform standards from the federal states nationwide."
"Bavarians stagger, others don't."
"We need to be more able to act."
However, national policy should not fall under the table in Großwallstadt.
A year-long permanent burner remains on the agenda: education policy.
For the new school year, Minister of Culture Ludwig Spaenle (CSU) started the pilot experiment "Medium-Level Plus" at 47 high schools, where an extension of the upper secondary level is tested from three to four years - in the result it takes nine years to graduate.
But Aiwanger doesn't go far enough.
"The topic of G9 needs to be accelerated," said the FW Chief.
We demand freedom of choice for all the gymnasiums that want it.
Free ride at the G9 wherever it is desired.
Harder Wall Street Helps Dax Jump
After a long distance, the German stock market has closed down directionless and nervous trade with profits.

The shares of the two largest German energy groups recovered somewhat, but ultimately lost 3.31 percent (RWE) and 6.15 percent (Eon).
Infineon shares increased by a further 3.22% at the Dax peak.
According to a dealer, a positive report of the US investor magazine "Barron's" from the weekend was successful.
According to this, investors were currently paying too little attention to the German chip builder.

4 people killed after policemen shot rubber bullets at demonstrators in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after the police shot rubber bullets in a crowd demonstrating against the proposed new constitution, an official said on Wednesday.
Violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the district of Rupandehi, about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, Chief District Officer, said that more than 1,000 demonstrators had gathered outside a police station, with some of you throwing stones and fire bombs.
Mr. Dhakal said the police had used tear gas and then shot into the air before she resorted to rubber bullets.
20 policemen and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why the rubber bullets used, of which it is known that they can kill, but which are traditionally used as a less deadly alternative, apparently produced such a high death rate.
The dispute was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal's southern levels, where members of the ethnic group of Madhesi say that new provinces formed under the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence.
There were also protests in western Nepal by the ethnic group of the Tharus who want their own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have been in violent conflict since the 10th century.
August killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which has been centrally governed for centuries.
Work on a new constitution has been underway since 2008, but the legislators accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
The legislators voted on certain clauses in the draft Constitution in Kathmandu this week, and officials said that the new Constitution could enter into force on Sunday.
Construction site planned in the city
The property at the Emder Jugendzentrum Alte Post is to be rebuilt.
The city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000-square-meter surfaces.
A mix of trade, commerce and housing is planned - but there are no specific offers yet.
Emden - The city of Emden wants to market a plot of around 4000 square meters in a direct neighborhood to the youth centre Alte Post.
Preparations are currently under way.
It is planned to use the site for a mixture of trade, commerce and housing.
They are waiting for appropriate offers, it is said from the city.
Which investor is in question is not yet clear.
In this respect, no contracts had been concluded.
The town of Emden had bought a part of the property located on Ringstraße / Ecke Große Straße a few months ago and had the building on it demolished.
Project Hieve: Details are on the table
The plans for the holiday home settlement at the Kleine Meer near Emden take shape.
The investor presented plans for the project to the public for the first time.
A number of trailers are still worried - they fear the sale of their leisure refugium
For months behind closed doors had been negotiated, resented, debated and drawn.
Now the plans for a new holiday home settlement on the Small Sea near Emden are on the table.
The interested party, the medium-sized Emder company "System-Bau", presented its plans to the public for the first time on Monday evening in the city development committee of the Emder Council.
Originally, this item had appeared on the non-public part of the agenda.
Under the pressure of the project critics and the FDP Group, who accused the investor and the administration of secret cremation, Ralf Behrends went from the system building management to the offensive: "We don't have an answer to all the questions yet," he told the council members and more than 50 visitors.
But it is good to be able to meet all rumors now.
The approximately ten to twelve million euro project has been under discussion for months.
Violent reactions among seabuds owners who had arrived at the meeting brought out the pictures and new details about the desired hotel construction.
Roberto Schulz, seabud owner and board member at the interest representation of the owners, Pro Hieve, complains: "This will be a giant globe that dominates all other buildings".
He also fears, like many other project critics, that traffic would increase sharply due to the planned size of the plant: "There must be whole busloads in order for this to be reckoned," says Schulz.
However, what is happening exactly on the well-sized area of the former restaurant is still open.
There's no operator yet.
"First we must have a coherent concept," said Ralf Behrends.
Because this was still missing, the construction plans are also still variable.
Twin offspring at Gorillas in the Frankfurt Zoo
The Frankfurt Zoo is pleased about young people at its Gorillas.
The 26-year-old Dian brought twins to the world yesterday.
Twin births are rare in Gorillas.
The last one in a German zoo was almost 50 years ago and was also in Frankfurt in 1967, it is said by the zoo.
The gender of the newborn Gorilla twins is not yet established, as Mother Dian holds them close to the body.
First, the "picture" had reported.
NHC predicts 60 percent chance for cyclone south of the Cape Verde Islands
On Tuesday, the US National Hurricane Center predicted a wide pressure system of about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southern Cape Verde Islands, which has a 60 percent chance of developing into a tropical whirlwind over the next 48 hours.
Another clearly defined low pressure system, for example in the middle between the Cape Verde Islands and the Small Antilles, also has a 60 percent potential to form a tropical whirlwind in the next two days, added the weather experts stationed in Miami.
Google launches doubling donation campaign to raise $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL. O) announced a double-donor campaign to spend $11 million on humanitarian organizations to help thousands of refugees who have overrun the European nations, fleeing from war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google has an unusual personal approach to announcing the donation call on its blog.
Instead of having a manager make the announcement, Rita Masoud, a Google employee who fled Kabul with her family when she was seven years old, wrote about her personal experiences.
"Our journey included many dark train and bus journeys, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and fear," she wrote.
I was lucky.
But since the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe, many people like my family are desperately looking for help.
The donations go to four non-profit organisations that provide assistance for refugees and migrants: Doctors without Borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said that the first globally collected donations up to a value of 5.5 million on google.com/refugee relief are doubled to $11 million.
Europe has been confronted with its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War, largely caused by the four-year civil war in Syria, which has driven out more than 4 million people this year.
Many also fled the war - torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

For slightly overweight diabetics, weight loss surgery can be helpful.
The benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes may take at least five years after a new study.
It is still too early to say whether slightly overweight people with diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those who receive non-surgical treatments.
"The mortality data need a long time to show something," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert on weight loss surgery who wrote an editorial on the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Weight loss surgery or obesity surgery, use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the body's ability to absorb food.
Over the years, obesity surgery to treat type 2 diabetes has been shown to be effective, but most studies have been conducted in people who are ill obese with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a certain degree of weight in terms of size, is considered to be normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight and people with a BMI of more than 30 are considered obese.
Here you can calculate your BMI: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers from Taiwan's Min-Sheng General Hospital used data they have collected in a study since 2007, comparing two types of obesity surgery - stomach bypass and gastric tube formation - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight.
The mean BMI among those undergoing this operation decreased from 31 to 24.5 to the end of the fifth year in this study.
Meanwhile, the BMI remained approximately the same for those who received non-surgical diabetes treatments at 29.
Among those who underwent surgery, 36% of the patients had total and 28% had diabetes.
In the medically-treated group, the total resolution of diabetes was only one percent and in part only about two percent.
In addition, the results in the control of blood pressure, triglycerides and "bad" LDL cholesterol "were generally better in the 'surgical' group", the authors found out.
The researchers also monitored the patient blood levels of haemoglobin A1c, which reflects the blood glucose levels over time.
Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent, the researchers say.
After surgery, the average haemoglobin A1c level decreased from approximately 9 percent to about 6 percent.
However, in the medical treatment group it remained stable at about 8 percent.
But this better "glycemic control" - as reflected in the improved haemoglobin A1c level - did not reduce mortality in five years, according to leading researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared average results in the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, the bypass surgery group lost more weight compared to the gastricectomy group (18.7 vs. 14.2 kg), achieved greater reductions in BMI (7.4 vs. 5.1) and haemoglobin A1c (3.1% vs. 2.1 %) and experienced more complete overcoming of diabetes (46.9% vs. 16.7%).
While the new study shows no survival benefit of surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life, says Blackstone of the University of Arizona, College of Medicine Phoenix.
In the Swedish study it was about 29 percent less likely to die over 15 years in obese people who underwent obesity surgery compared to a group that tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study showed no benefit for survival in surgery patients, Blackstone said it was reassuring for people with a BMI below 35 who are interested in the procedure.
"This is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BMI group", she said, without increasing the risk of death or kidney disease.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as the patient with his BMI is between 27 and 30.
"I think we wait too long to get people to take this seriously," she said.
I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have permanently linked their bodies to obesity and diabetes, a reversal is really difficult."
Love History Plays in Hunsrück
It is a topic that is currently increasingly paying attention in the field of Belletritics: A young woman, unpopular and inimitable at school, meets the swarm of her youth after years, and this one falls in love with her.
So also in the recent novel "Really we are not like that" by Luisa Binder.
Beyond the story of love, the novel should be of interest to Hunsrücker readers in particular, as it plays in Langweiler and the surrounding villages.
The chief professional author grew up in Bordweiler and is pleased that she was able to set a literary monument to her hometown.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT-News
Europe could not accommodate all refugees, said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan-Buddhist leader called for the end of violence in the refugees' homelands.
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten-day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, dedicated to ethics studies.
He demanded that under the circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents.
He also stressed that although the response of the Western European countries to the refugee crisis was admirable, the situation was not appropriate.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria's efforts to cope with the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
"To care for several thousand refugees is wonderful, but in the meantime you have to think about long-term solutions, how real peace and development, mainly through education, can be created for these Muslim countries," he stressed.
In the end, we need to think about how the killing will be reduced in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of violence.
"The application of violence has never solved these problems," he added.
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of violence and also commented on George Bush's actions after the September 11 terrorist attack and showed that the violent reaction of the United States led to a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 11 September, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush, and I told him that the way to solving this problem is in nonviolence.
"I know his motives were good, but he used violence, and this has caused unexpected consequences," said the Dalai Lama.
Four-fold increase in the intake of hand disinfectants by children in the last 4 years
According to the Georgia Poison Center, poison control centres in the United States report an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under the age of twelve who swallow highly alcoholic hand disinfectants.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Center, cases of hand disinfectants in children under 12 years of age reporting poison control centres increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
"Children come to these products more and more often, and unfortunately a percentage of them end up in the emergency room," said Lopez CNN.
He said that some children are deliberately drinking disinfectants while some are doing it to impress their friends or because of a test of courage in the social media.
Videos on YouTube show how young people drink disinfectants only because of a cheap experience.
Youths are said to have mixed disinfectants with alcoholic oral water in order to get a tougher drink.
Younger children can be attracted by attractive fragrances of disinfectants.
"A child doesn't think this is bad for it," said Lopez.
Many of the more attractive (hand disinfectants) are those that are perfumed.
There are disinfectants with strawberry, grape and orange fragrances that are very appealing to children.
Hand disinfectants contain between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
Especially in small children, few syringes can lead to alcohol poisoning.
"It is highly concentrated alcohol," said Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the poison distress centre at the University of Kansas Hospital, sender Fox 4 in Kansas City.
So, you wouldn't leave a sip of whisky around, but people leave these hand disinfectants in the reach of children, and when children come to it, then it's a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaidah Russell, a six-year-old girl who had recently taken four syringes from strawberry scented hand disinfectants at school, was taken to an emergency room.
Her blood alcohol concentration was 179 times higher than the threshold legally considered drunk by an adult, said Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency doctor who treated her at the Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah laughed at her words and was unable to go when she arrived in the emergency room.
Doctors watched them overnight in a separate children's hospital for signs of brain trauma, as the girl had fallen through the alcohol and hit her head, Ritchey said.
"That was very scary," said Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah's mother, CNN.
It could have been fatal for my child.
Lopez has recommended parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic products or disinfectants and store hand disinfectants outside the child’s reach.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants were associated with deaths.
In 2013, two women died in Ontario after swallowing hand disinfectants containing a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
Employees of health authorities suspect that the product contained methanol, a lethal solution, instead of ethyl alcohol, which was listed as an active substance.
In January, three fourth-class students in New York City planned to poison their "common" teacher by interpreting antibacterial products around the classroom," reports a police report.
The teacher is highly allergic to hand disinfectants and exiled them from her room.
The police considered the plan to be a "funny" and referred disciplinary action to the school authority.
Villingen-Schwenningen: Three vehicles damaged
A 33-year-old driver has been slightly injured in a hitchhiking accident on the cross-rail between Nordring and Herdenen.
A 60-year-old lorry driver drove on the cross-rails towards roundabout industrial area and noticed too late that two vehicles had stopped at roundabouts.
As a result, he bumped into the back of an Audi with his truck and pushed this vehicle onto a Ford Fiesta.
In the case of vehicles involved in the accident, the police reported damage of around EUR 10 000.
The Audi of the 33-year-old was no longer ready to drive and had to be towed.
Rumors: No Disharmonies at Celtic
Griffiths plays the talk of disharmonie down at Celtic Glasgow, Deila admits that the hopes are in a bad place, but that he will turn that over again.
Hearts will fight SFA for the charge of Neilson and Warburton will be careful in January-Neuve commitments that could destroy the unit of the squadron
Dons increase leadership over Celtic to five points
ADAM Rooneys Elfmeter in the first half gave Aberdeen a tight victory over Hamilton in Pittodrie, so that the Dons create a five-point gap between themselves and Celtic.
Griffiths plays down talk about disharmony
There are rumors of disharmony at Celtic Glasgow, which was spontaneously rejected by Griffiths. This insisted that he and his teammates are not under increased control as they are preparing for the confrontation with the Dutch table leader.
I don't think we feel under pressure, I think the players are looking forward to it.
The lack of title competition in Scottish football bored Dutch - de Boer
The former Rangers midfielder and former Dutch national player Ronald de Boer has said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic, as there is no title rivalry with the Rangers.
De Boer, currently an ambassador for Ajax, said: "In Holland they no longer show highlights of Celtic games and why?"
It's because the Rangers aren't here.
People here are not just talking about the Rangers' return.
You're talking about the Old Firm.
They talk about both teams, and that's what interests them.
There's a lot of excitement in the old firm games, and it's not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games.
I'll turn things around, Deila swears.
RONNY Deila has accepted that Celtic must fight, but the Norwegian boss swore to turn things around.
After the defeat against Malmö and the subsequent withdrawal from the Champions League, the defeat against ten men from Aberdeen followed, which now stand clear at the top of the table with five points of head start.
But Deila said, "Celtic had bad times before, and we'll come back."
Now we want to get out of there as soon as possible.
I know it's very frustrating and a lot of people are very, very angry or sad about what's happening.
We feel that way - but we have to move on.
We really need, really, the support of Celtic because that makes players better.
To stand together now is so important.
Warburton carefully at January transfers
Despite his comments just a few weeks ago, which indicated that he was targeting some January transfers, Rangers-Boss Mark Warburton is cautious in signing new entries and insists that he does not want to disrupt the unity of the Ibrox framework.
The former director of Brentford said, "The January Transfer window is very different from the summer window."
The players who come in summer have this preseason time to integrate what you have seen with our own group this season.
The team is really good.
Sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need.
Celtic target person Michu with withdrawal notice
Swansea stormer Michu, with Celtic during the transfer period in conversation, has indicated that he could withdraw when his contract with the Swans expires.
The 29-year-old has been plagued with a annoying ankle for two years and has not managed to leave Wales this summer.
Hearts set to SFA battle for Neilson's comments
The Hearts led 2:1, when Paterson was sent from the field and then lost 3:2, but the Red Card of the Defender was later revoked - the third Red Card of Collum, which was revoked in eight months.
Neilson sticks to what he said and insists: "I have not questioned integrity, I have not commented on performance."
Griffiths vows to avoid Tynecastle
The incorrigible Hibee was corrected after he admitted to singing a song with offensive lyrics about ex-hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident occurred in a pub in the Roseburn area of Edinburgh in front of a Edinburgh Derby in Tynecastle in March 2014.
"It was a Derby, and it was the heat of the moment," said the stormer, adding, "It's safe to say that I'm not going back to Tynecastle if it doesn't play for Celtic Glasgow."
Tannadice Supervisory Board has confidence in Dundee-United-Management
Simon Donnelly insists that the Executive Board of Dundee United still has confidence in the management team to spin things - but admits that the downturn must end on the field.
I think Stephen Thompson has confidence in us.
We're going to get the boys back on track," said Donnelly.
McInnes is happy to "favorably win against Hamilton".
Derek McInnes admits that his team from Aberdeen had to struggle desperately against Hamilton Accies to see a seventh consecutive league victory that brought them a lead of five points ahead of Celtic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Rooney's 11 meter in the first half.
McInnes said, "There is no team that has won everything, in troupes or leagues that have not won the games of this kind."
Unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged as it rises in the United Kingdom as a whole.
Unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged between May and July at 164,000, while the number of people without work in the United Kingdom as a whole increased by 10,000 to 1.82 million over the same period.
Scotland's unemployment rate of 5.9 percent was above that of the UK of 5.5 percent, as the figures of the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed.
In the meantime, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 over the three months, with the number of employees now reaching 2,612,000.
During the quarter, the employment rate for Scotland fell to 74.0 percent - above the UK average of 73.5 percent.
The State Secretary for Scotland David Mundell commented on the latest figures and said: "The government's long-term plan laid the foundation for a stronger economy."
It is almost exactly a year ago that Scotland has made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months we have seen further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a fall in unemployment.
Drunken people interfered with the process
Since the security personnel could not satisfy the situation, the employees called the police.
Only with the use of pepper spray could the officials take the troubleshooters into custody.
A breath alcohol test resulted in a 16-year-old of 0.89 per mille.
The adult was picked up by his mother.
A 28-year-old had 2.15 promille and initially remained in custody.
Why I Will Witness an Execution in Oklahoma
A little later today, except for a late legal intervention, I will see a man put to death.
If it happens, and I hope it doesn't happen, I'll sit in an audience gallery in the death chamber in the Oklahoma State Penitentiary when Richard Glossip is executed by the poison syringe.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death.
The invitation took place for the first time in January about his best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day approached, I began to fear.
So, why would I do that?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty.
It would offer a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists are allowed to see executions in the US, and since there are often more applications available than places, a macabre lottery takes place to decide who is elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media spots from 12 to 5.
Whoever is selected will observe it without emotion.
I can't.
I will sit next to Richard Glossip's closest friend, with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with telephone calls and a two and a half hours visit.
I like this guy.
We often laugh a lot when we talk.
The prison authorities say I can't be a witness and a journalist, so I won't be allowed to take a notebook and a pen to record what I see.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of abandoning my impartiality.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the story of the prisoner how he wants it, and you get access.
I complain to her.
She admitted that she could have written it better, but she still thinks it's wrong what I'm doing.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't do it even if he did.
I told him he could remove me from his list of witnesses at any time.
But he wants an international reporter to be present to write there.
When he dies, he thinks that the public relations work of the movement will help against the death penalty.
Kim Bellware, a reporter at the Huffington Post, will be sitting next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, please listen to the series of podcasts I made.
I don't want to go back to all the details.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would make him a beneficiary of action.
But I think there's a strong probability that he's not guilty of murder.
I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence.
I think his execution is wrong.
And from this perspective, I'll see him die.
I can't claim to be really objective.
There will be other reporters you can contact for this.
What you're going to get from me is what it means to see a man die an unnecessary death.
Man after wet police chase persuaded him to get out of the Canning River
The Canning Vale policeman stayed dry when he persuaded the man from the Canning River.
An attempt by a man from Perth to hang the police was unsuccessful when he was in the shallow and swampy waters, only a few meters away from a police officer who tried to "trace him gently to return to the shore."
Canning Vale's police were called on Tuesday to a break-in of house in Beckenham.
When they discovered the suspect, he tried to escape them towards the Canning River.
But he didn't get too far.
"He stood in the water and said 'I'm not coming out, come and get me," said Senior Sergeant Shandel Castledine.
Constable Lachlan Perhavec was not too enthusiastic about wetting his uniform, so he applied a more reliable tactic - "A good policeman is negotiating".
"Sometimes people do funny things to try to escape," said Senior Sergeant Castledine.
Championship football player Ben Cousins offers an unforgettable example.
In 2006 Cousins drove his car to the ditch to avoid an alcohol check and then tried to swim over the Swan River.
His efforts were unsuccessful, but inspired locals to plan a Ben Cousin Biathlon humorously.
Peter Moody claims that stewards tried to spy on him and threaten to stop racing
Peter Moody claims that stewards of Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his stables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately.
He aimed at the stewards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria and claimed that they were conducting a personal campaign against him with the late scratching of Lady Tatai for a race day treatment, the last straw on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he had always tried to do what was best for racing and he had found himself under difficult conditions when it was about the positive cobalt cup test at Lidaris that he could not explain.
He had held back 18 months because of the spying accusations and did not want it to be "exhaust like too high hanging grapes."
"I had no intention of saying anything about it, and I've been sitting on it for a long time, but sometimes you're so frustrated that everything comes out suddenly," said Moody.
You know it went on.
Sometimes you react, and you have to live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I'll go home tonight and sleep well.
I want to go around raised head, and I want my owners to think that I'm trying my best for them.
If they start thinking I'm not doing this, then I shouldn't be a coach anymore.
I have to think about what I'm doing with my license.
Previously Moody had raised the bomb in an interview with racing.com that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable.
"Eighten months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - whom I will call when asked - and offered him a job in my offices to provide information about what I do within my stables," said Moody on Racing.com.
You obviously think I'm a fraud.
If that is the case, they should certainly touch their noses because they have failed in trying to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former chairman of the RVL, David Moodie, president of the RVL and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of the RVL, was aware of this at the time and are still aware of it today.
Is that supposed to make me think it's gonna be personal?
Has the RVL behaved cowardly and perhaps makes people outside of trainers responsible for what is going on in the industry?
Am I bad for the industry?
Am I that bad for the industry?
Maybe people out there think it's me.
Maybe they have to take my license and run away from me, and I have no doubt that what I'm saying now makes them think about it.
But I have now arrived at the point where I don't care, and that makes me sad.
That makes me really sad.
I'm gonna put pressure on them and push them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can go.
The frustration levels of the coach have built up with the long-lasting cobalt investigation at Lidari, and the late scratching led him to say that he could "throw his license over the table."
Moody, best known by his preparation of unbeaten master Black Caviar, called the race day treatment rule "stupid" after a pack of mud or clay had been applied to the horse legs, which violated the rules.
"It is against the rules of racing.
I have to take full responsibility for this," he said.
"One of my employees has incorrectly applied mud to the leg.
It could have been like that last night.
It could have been like that all day yesterday.
But it also had that way on the race day.
Moody could be confronted with a three-month disqualification for treatment with the pack on the race day. An investigation of this matter was opened.
It's a joke.
People who make these rules know nothing about the horse.
"We all realize that we need rules, but here we have gone too far," said Moody.
Arrested after a driver's flight
The police arrested a man after a collision with a cyclist and then a driver's flight in Cobram.
The cyclist was handed in with the helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after he was hit by a car on the Murray Valley motorway on Saturday morning.
The police said the driver continued without stopping to help the injured driver.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia stood up to the police in Shepparton.
It is likely to be accused of driver's flight and of failure to provide assistance and other traffic offences.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram stays in the hospital. He is in a stable condition.
Melbourne Storm Trainer Craig Bellamy Strikes Back Against Rivals for Claims of Ringfight
Melbourne Storm Trainer Craig Bellamy has called criticism of the strike of his players "Agenda-Setting" by two Premier League favorites of the NRL.
Sydney Rooster's coach Trent Robinson said that the referees allowed the storm players to "ring" with his team during the high storm victory in the qualifying finale in Sydney on Friday evening.
Brisbane Bronco's coach Wayne Bennett made a hardly hidden comment about the Storm team after his team had won the final victory against North Queensland cowboys on Saturday night. He named the game a "pattern example" of the Rugby League and said that the two from Queensland were not "too good" in the ring.
Bellamy defended the Tacklimg of his team and said that they were only focused on their "contact" with the tackle.
Bellamy added that the criticism of two leading trainers at his team confidently agrees with him, as it meant that they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team.
"It keeps showing up - I didn't hear Trent Robinson talking about ringfights when they beat us 24:2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we have not changed our defensive system or techniques throughout the year, but in the last six weeks we have made contact with Tackles a real focus, and this has brought us the trend shift.
Trent has been there for three years now, and he obviously has a great team to train. So he is probably not used to losing it, so it was a bit of a shock to him.
It's funny how this happens again and again at this time of year.
Bellamy attacked Bennett's idea of "stressing football" and reminded his mentor that Bennett's St. George Illawarra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with "tiring" football.
Wayne speaks of exciting football.
He compared his game on Saturday night with ours on Friday evening and how exciting her game was," Bellamy said.
I remember that in 2010 St. George was criticized as a boring team, and Wayne said he'd take care of a shitload of it.
But now he has a team that can play and that we consider exciting, especially his young players at their speed.
That's the ball game you want to play when you have this kind of player.
He made this statement in 2010, now he wants all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can play like these.
I am building more trust because they say these things because they are a little worried about having to play against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think of us when it came to the Big Games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the game Storm vs. Roosters scored a higher result than the game Broncos vs. Cowboys.
The game of the Broncos was probably a good game, I haven't seen it yet, but what was the result? 16 : 12 ?
Our game was 20:18, there were two more attempts in our game, but is this an exciting game?
Or are breaks made and no points exciting?
For me, it's the game plans.
When they mention us, it means that we will meet them in a phase.
The Storm team is free this weekend because they have won the right to receive either North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks the next Saturday evening in the pre-final in AAMI Park. Ticket sales start from next Tuesday morning.
Serbia with $200,000 deposit after drug charge
A man who may be at risk of a life sentence for his attempt to get possession of 40 kilograms of cocaine smuggled to Queensland was released for a deposit of $200,000.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Solay, which came from South America via Vanuatu and docked in Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was observed meeting his fellow defendants in the marina during the morning and later at Café Coomera Roadhouse, where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo.
Despite a potentially life-long penalty for trying to own a commercial amount of cocaine, the lawyer of Maksimovic argued that there was no evidence that he tried to own the entire amount and that the cafe could have been for a harmless reason.
The judge at the Supreme Court, Peter Flanagan, was concerned about the danger of escape at Maksimovic.
He has clear relations with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he told the court on Wednesday.
In the criminal case, he lied to the police about his place of residence.
Maksimovic's mother and stepfather had offered a security deposit of $200,000 to reach his release.
"After reading the oath statements of the two persons, it is clear that the imposition of a security of $200,000 is a real financial burden," said Judge Flanagan.
But that alone will not be enough to stop him from appearing, he warned.
Maksimovic was released against bail, under the conditions that he surrenders his Australian and Serbian passports, reports to the police daily and stays at an exit lock from 18:00-06:00.
Accident on A5 at Karlsruhe: Driver's house breaks apart
On Tuesday evening, a truck driver was seriously injured in a driving accident with three trucks on highway 5 near Karlsruhe.
Two of the three trucks involved had braked in front of a permanent construction site towards Basel.
The third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to divert left at the last moment, as the police reported.
The driver's house of the cause of the accident completely broke apart.
The driver was seriously injured in a hospital.
The A5 between Bruchsal and Karlsruhe-Nord was completely locked over six hours to 2 hours.
There was a damage of 122,000 euros.
Stevan Hogg used phone of girls to attract pedophiles to send pictures
A pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to request pictures of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone when it fell asleep, logged into an online messaging service, from which he received a series of rude pictures of children sent to him by another user.
The girl later woke up and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of sleeping Hogg.
She saw it through, found the confusing messages and immediately alerted her mother.
The police took care of this and saw the five pictures, then analyzed computers that were found under the address and discovered "relevant" web searches that used the terms to search for indecent pictures of children.
Hogg then claimed to the officials that he had done it because it would lead to "paedophiles on the Internet" and he then "forgave to be a policeman to scare them".
Prosecutor Eilidh Robertson told Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it was an addiction - that he was addictive to frighten people.
He admitted that the searches on the computer were carried out by him, but said that it had happened because he wanted to claim to be a policeman to frighten pedophiles.
He was asked for his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and who he asked to send even more photos.
He said he did it to lure her.
He said he was sick in the head when he drank, and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder.
Ms. Robertson added: "When the girl found the news on the phone, she called her mother and was shaking and crying.
She then also saw the indecent pictures on the phone and confronted the accused with them.
The girl was interviewed and said that the accused used computer and playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than he did.
Hogg, 23, Ward Road, Dundee, declared himself guilty in the sense of the indictment to have taken illegitimate pictures of children on 14 June last year, to have violated the obligations on 25 January of this year and not to have appeared before the court for a hearing on 24 March of this year.
Defense lawyer Gregor Sim asked that Hogg not appear in the register of sexual offenders, as one could argue that "no significant sexual element" could be found in his offense.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the verdict until October to receive background reports on social work.
In this case, Hogg was granted a security deposit but was held in custody for hearings on other pending cases.
He was added to the list of sexual offenders before the date of the judgment.
Locks deviate from small border crossings to Germany
More and more refugees are being picked up outside the large control points at the German-Austrian border.
Many locks left people more and more at smaller border crossings because of fear of discovery and arrest
On the Austrian side out, said a spokesman for the Federal Police.
Since Tuesday, more than 1000 refugees have been picked up in the districts of Passau and Rottal-Inn.
They had reached the German side on foot over bridges and dams.
There they are received by federal police officers and forwarded for registration.
At the Munich Hauptbahnhof, a significant number of refugees arrived again on Wednesday, according to federal police reports compared to the beginning of the week.
By 8:00 p.m. alone, some 700 people had arrived in the state capital, said a speaker in the morning.
After the reintroduction of controls at the German-Austrian border, refugees reached the city on Tuesday 1759.
Stuttgart: Exiter of tropical storm "Henry" in the southwest expected
Meteorologists warn against sturmøen in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon.
Due to a deep pressure area across Western Europe, hot sea air flows into the country, the German Weather Service (DWD) in Stuttgart announced.
The strong depth was the outlet of the tropical storm "Henry", which had been pulled over the Atlantic by the Bermuda Islands in the past few days.
Violent storms and thunderstorms are expected especially in Baden.
According to DWD, the Black Forest, the Swabian Alb and the Lake Constance are also expected to have waves ranging from 60 to 90 kilometres per hour.
On Friday the sun can be seen again.
The mass does it: Every two years the car builders at the IAA show their newties.
In 2015, there is especially movement in the compact cars, which currently sell particularly well.
Cars from the compact class are currently particularly in demand: According to the Federal Motor Vehicles Agency (KBA), about 28.1 percent of new registrations were made available to this segment in August alone.
This is also reflected on the IAA (Audience Day 17-27 September).
This year, many new compact models will be presented, above all, between all the futuristic concept vehicles and new top-class and luxury cars.
One of the biggest premieres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra, which will be standing with the dealers in the fall.
"The Astra is an extremely important model for us," said Opel-Chief Karl-Thomas Neumann at the fair.
It belongs to the core of the brand.
In order for the volume model to sell well, the new Astra should not be much more expensive for it.
Opel offers a start below the biggest competitor of VW Golf, which starts at 17 650 euros.
The current Astra costs from 16 990 euros.
The Astra is available with a new 1.4-liter engine with 74 kW/100 hp.
In addition, the Hessen offers additional diesel and gasoline engines from 70 kW/95 hp to 147 kW//200 hp, including three-cylinder gasoline for the first time.
Unlike the main competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus, the Opel Astra is initially only five-door.
As a second variant, the combination will follow in spring, which can also be seen on the IAA.
And what is going to happen next to the Astra on the IAA to new compact cars?
Renault Mégane: Renault sends the fourth generation of his Astra competitor Mégane to the race.
At the fair, the Mégane can only be seen as a five-doorer in a conventional and emphasized sporty GT version.
He will be traded at the beginning of next year, then also as a combination.
Infiniti: The Infiniti Q30 is completely new in the segment.
The Nissan branch wants to find its position in the growing segment with the new model.
The compact Infiniti with its curved lines fully fits into the design line of the brand.
The base model will get a petrol engine with a power output of at least 90 kW/122 hp.
However, there is also a diesel with 80 kW/109 hp or 125 kW/170 hp.
Suzuki Baleno: New in the segment is also the Suzuki Baleno, which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt.
The model is offered with petrol engines, including a newly developed 1.0-litre turbomotor and an output of 82 kW/111 hp.
The maximum torque is 170 Newton meters (Nm) according to the manufacturer's specifications.
The start of Baleno sales in Europe is in spring 2016.
DS 4: Not entirely new, but completely renewed is the compact class model DS 4, which can be seen on the IAA.
Outside, the designers of the noble Citroën branch put on hand at the front: Here the cooler grill was redrawn and the modified headlights were equipped with LED technology.
In the interior, the infotainment system was modernised, the number of buttons reduced by a touchscreen, and Apple's CarPlay was integrated for the first time.
In addition, a number of revisions and new variants like the refreshed Mercedes A-Class or the Peugeot 308 GTI join the IAA in the compact class.
JVA Berlin-Tegel: Five square meters of cell are unworthy of human beings
The Federal Constitutional Court gave the right to an ex-convict of the Tegel Judicial Tribunal, which had been housed in too small a cell for months.
Because of the violation of human dignity, prisoners are in principle entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in too small cells.
This was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday.
According to the judges, those affected can even hope for money if they were locked up in the too narrow rooms for a few days (Az.: 1 BvR 1127/14).
This made an ex-prisoner with his constitutional complaint successful in Karlsruhe: He was accommodated in a single cell with about five square meters of floor space at the Berlin-Tegel Judiciary Centre between June and November 2009; the toilet was not separated by space.
After that, the man, who, according to his lawyer, was now on the loose again, had been transferred to a larger cell.
His legal action for the unworthy conditions of imprisonment against the country of Berlin failed.
However, the constitutional judges raised the judgment of the Berlin Chamber Court and rejected the case for a re-examination there.
You see the human dignity of the man hurt.
The Board of Appeal now decides on the amount of compensation
Even if, for legal reasons, only a few days of detention for compensation were essential from the period in question, there was a claim for compensation, it said.
Otherwise, "a weakening of the legal protection of the personality would be feared".
The Chamber Court now has to clarify the amount of the compensation.
In the past, constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners.
In April, they only awarded damages to a prisoner because he was imprisoned naked in a cell.
According to a 2011 decision, the multiple occupation of a cell without a separate toilet is unworthy of human beings.
Karlsruhe also confirmed on Wednesday the Berlin Constitutional Court, which had certified a prisoner in a parallel case in November 2009 an unworthy accommodation.
The plaintiff was accommodated daily for three months between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Karlsruhe case.
The Berlin prisons had also come into the headlines in recent weeks because of the lack of personnel.
Prisoners are therefore kept locked up for 23 hours, aggressiveness increases, even beatings are said to have already come because of the tense situation.
According to information from the Legal Press Office, 21 jobs in Tegel are not occupied for the lack of young people, 19 are to be dropped in 2016.
Angela Merkel and refugee policy: "We can do this"
Immigration of refugees is a huge challenge - the Federal Chancellor is determined to accept it.
What matters to Germany?
Some 800 000 asylum seekers will come to Germany this year, according to forecasts by the Federal Ministry of the Interior, and according to Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel (SPD), Germany is even able to accommodate one million refugees.
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) has demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge: "I say over and over again, we can do this, and we can do it".
What is due on Germany provides the following overview.
According to different forecasts, between 350000 (estimated by the Federal Ministry of Construction) and 400000 (estimated by the Pestel Institute) dwellings are used each year - i.e. for the next five years.
This is almost twice as much as previously built (250000 apartments).
The lack of housing, however, is dramatic, especially in the case of affordable rental properties: 60000 to 80000 social housing units fall out of the rental price binding every year, and refugees will also apply for these particularly favourable apartments.
Federal Building Minister Barbara Hendricks (SPD) therefore wants to double the funding, from currently EUR 518 million to EUR 1 billion.
This is far too little from the point of view of the Pestel Institute: 80 000 social housing units would have to be created each year and the federal government would have to invest 6.4 billion per year.
Scientists and the Federal Minister for Construction agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investment in housing.
According to the Institute for Labour Market and Vocational Research, it is estimated that 55 percent of refugees in Germany can work in the long term.
However, refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked for their qualifications to help them get started, says Claudia Walter, project manager for integration and education at the Bertelsmann Foundation.
For the integration of refugees, however, it is crucial whether they find work in Germany.
Work is the key to social contacts, for appreciation in the host society, but also for the self-esteem of immigrants, says Migrant researcher Dietrich Thränhardt.
In Germany, according to Thränhardt, there has been a political turn: the ban on the work of refugees for the recognition of work.
While formerly there was a ban on work for asylum seekers of up to five years, it was reduced to three months in November 2014, as well as the obligation to reside, limiting asylum seekers to a place of residence.
The majority of people in society, also because of the lack of skilled workers, have maintained the view that refugees should be able to access the labour market more quickly.
A major obstacle to access to the labour market is the lack of German knowledge.
So far, there is not enough supply of general and vocational language courses.
Studies also show that workplaces are most often provided through personal contacts.
The construction of networks is therefore considered by Thränhardt to be the King's Way to Work Integration.
The Berlin School Administration has found that only a few refugee parents are giving their children to the kitas, an estimated ten to 15 percent: "It is important for the displaced parents to keep the family together," says Ilja Koschembar, spokesman for youth and family at the Berlin Senate Administration.
In order to convince the family of the advantages of the kita, the administration distributes handsets in different languages.
If the need for educators increased greatly by the large number of refugees, the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacity, for example by allowing more specialised schools.
In the countries, students without German knowledge in welcome classes are prepared for teaching.
However, they are not always taught by fully trained teachers, but, as in Berlin, also by teachers who have only one qualification in German as a second language.
There is no shortage of them, says Beate Stoffers of the Berlin School Administration.
The Deutsche Studentenwerk estimates that about 20 percent of refugees want to study in Germany.
In principle, no federal state prohibits asylum seekers or tolerated the study - the only exception has been Berlin so far, but interior senator Frank Henkel (CDU) has now given up his position.
Eligible refugees could be facilitated access to the university.
For refugees with a residence permit or tolerance no longer receive benefits under the Asylum Seeker Benefits Act when they start a study.
The latter, in principle, do not get a fag, as they do not fall within the circle of those who have the right to babble.
To date, displaced refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years in order to be Bafög-authorised, from 1 January 2016 this span will be reduced to 15 months.
However, this funding gap must also be closed, Steffen Krach, Berlin's State Secretary for Science, and the Deutsche Studentenwerk.
The students should get bafög right away.
Islam will play a more important role in the future, as many refugees are Muslims, and for many, religion is an important part of their identity.
The state should gradually grant Islam the same rights as they have the churches, and develop the existing state-church law into a new state-religion relationship.
It would also be important to establish an Islamic welfare association that takes care of the new arrivals professionally.
The rights also include obligations.
For example, the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contacts and be willing to cooperate with the state in many areas and provide it with certain means of control.
This includes the willingness to take concerted action against religious fundamentalism.
The chairman of the Central Council of Muslims, Aiman Mazyek, expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be brought into Germany.
Those who wanted to endure such conflicts in Germany "have immediately their right to stay here, in Germany, lost," he said in the Bavarian Radio.
He proposed that the basic law be translated into Arabic.
In the future, integration will be much more than it is today.
This will also mean that the majority society will have to change and that the reduction of discrimination and racism will be more urgent.
Germany, as a result of European decisions, has had an anti-discrimination office and a general equality law for a few decades.
But it learns very slowly, as the NSU murder series showed, in which police and authorities systematically ignored the racist motive.
Equal opportunities for all: What migrants' organisations and the interest groups of non-white Germans have been demanding for a long time and what international agreements such as the anti-racism convention commit Germany must become reality in the next few years if the country is to remain peaceful and use its opportunities for its new citizens - for the good of all.
In general, Germany is able to provide medical care for the expected refugees so far, says Dr. Frank Ulrich Montgomery.
"As far as man-power and capacity are concerned, we can do that," he said to the day mirror.
However, additional money had to flow into the system.
In order to avoid bottlenecks, Montgomery demands to hand out health cards to all arrivals at the same time as registration.
Services provided could later be billed with the federal states.
And in the long run, it would be highly questionable to feed so many people with the limited performance catalogue provided for by the Asylum Applyer Performance Act.
Otherwise, the doctors make especially the language barriers to create.
So far, the Berlin health scientist Thea Borde has proved that migrants are being better informed about their diseases than other patients.
Not only in clinics, but also in medical practice, interpreters' costs should be taken over.
Many refugees would be helped, but also with more general medical contact points in the emergency ambulances.
And with a different diagnostic look.
For example, there are clearly more untreated disabilities among refugee children, and young people are concerned with HIV education.
German doctors, however, would be clear from their training, says Montgomery.
"Parasitic infestation or tuberculosis are not so difficult to recognize". And as far as the medical shortage is concerned, the refugees may even see relief.
The Syrians have a highly developed education system, some refugees are even doctors.
In order to be able to practise, however, they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly carry out further examinations.
At least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are psychologically ill: most suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder or depression, according to estimates by the Federal Psychotherapist Chamber (BPtK).
Dietrich Munz, President of the BPtK, explains that refugees are particularly vulnerable.
A recent study by TU Munich shows that every fifth Syrian refugee child arrives traumatized in Germany.
Those who have a post-traumatic stress disorder suffer from, among other things, so-called flashbacks with respiratory distress, dizziness, heart rate and death fears.
Other symptoms include sleep and concentration disorders, severe frightfulness and emotional deafness.
In order to prevent the symptoms from becoming chronic, early treatment was necessary, Munz explained.
To date, however, only four percent of mentally ill refugees have received psychotherapy.
While mentally ill asylum seekers in the social services may apply for psychotherapy, the processing usually takes several months.
In addition, in the social services most professionals or doctors who are not trained for mental illness would decide whether therapy is necessary or not.
This often leads to misassessments, says Munz.
Manege invites you to dream
With the new production "Leidence", the Circus Probst resorts to the traditions of circus art.
The goal is to draw every age group into the trap of fascinating acrobatics, animal dresses and unique entertainment.
Now the Circus Probst invites into the manege on the brick what to dream.
"Our passion is the circus."
"I can't imagine living without my circus family," says Stephanie Probst, animal teacher and junior headmaster.
"Leidence" - under this motto is the current management stage.
The circus has been in the hands of the Probst family for more than 33 years.
So the gift of enthusiasm lies in the blood of the family.
"It is important for us to get people away from their everyday waste and take them to a completely different world for two hours," says the 27-year-old junior manager.
"Manageng cocktail with world-city flair", Director Reinhard Probst calls his concept.
50 cities on the almost 3,000 km long tour can now experience this flair.
The circus program convinces with talented artists from all over the world.
Excellent at the international circus festival in Monte Carlo, the Russian Stoliarov Clown Family puts the audience in jeopardy and charm.
The Castillo Brothers also understand their craftsmanship.
With the heroes of the silent films it wants to record the Cuban duo loosely.
Easiness and mobility - with these words they identify themselves.
Her humorous art on the mast is supposed to conquer women's hearts in the storm.
Apart from numerous salmon salts, the acrobatics of the Circus Probst also fascinates with fingertips and joints.
Balancing with the unicycle on a ball?
No problem for He Yuan.
Snake people fascinate and frighten at the same time.
Wang Lin from China is familiar with the oldest form of acrobatics like little others and fascinated with their mobility.
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect.
"The animals belong to our family," emphasizes Stephanie's mother, Brigitte Probst.
Mistakes in the attitude of circuses are only too often the subject of various animal welfare organisations.
Stephanie Probst also says: "If our animals are not well, we are not well."
Around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each stroke unit.
The "four-legged artists", as they are affectionately called, are read from the eyes whenever possible.
We want to work with the animals and have fun with them.
If the animal doesn't feel well, it doesn't want to be in the manege either.
So the top commandment: take good care of the animals.
Especially on her Zebroid Jumbo, a mixture of a ShetlandPony stallion and a zebra stute, the family is proud of Probst.
The two animals lived together in a alley for eight years and nothing happened.
"But then, suddenly, our little jumbo was there," says Brigitte Probst.
Although the Zebroid is not yet ready for the manege, it is the unique mascot of the Circus Probst.
So every visitor should have something to do with it.
"One thing is certain," says Stephanie Probst: "Whether five or 1,200 spectators, we always do our best and are with all our heart."
The Circus Probst invites you to his performances daily from 17 to 20 September at 5 p.m. and 8 p.m.
The program starts on Sunday at 11am and 4pm.
Thursday is family day, prices are reduced for the performance at 5 p.m.
In addition, the animal show is open daily from 10 am to 6 pm.
Zimbabwe Robert Mugabe gives the wrong speech in Parliament
Mr. Mugabe, Africa's oldest leader, fell down the stairs from a podium at the beginning of the year.
He remained unharmed, but the video of the case spread rapidly through the social media.
The opening of Parliament was also hampered by allegations by opposition MPs that they had received anonymous death threats and were warned against accompanying Mr Mugabe's speech with bohus.
Last month they bent him out and interrupted him during his speech on the situation of the nation in Parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The spokesperson of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) Innocent Gonese said that seven opposition politicians received SMS messages on their phones that they warned against interrupting Mr. Mugabe's speech.
"The message comes from a number that is not displayed, but it has the title 'Death'," he said journalists after Mugabe's speech.
It warns the Members concerned that immunity ends in Parliament, and once they leave Parliament, their parliamentary immunity ceases to be effective.
The chief spokesman said that the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai was "anxious" about the dangers to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard will reduce up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is expected to reduce 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in the context of restructuring and savings efforts in the company's services.
HP will later this year split up into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast growing business hardware and its services business.
The expected job losses result in a burden of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter, said HP in a statement.
"These restructuring measures will enable a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard enterprise," said Meg Whitman, HP President and Chief Executive, who will lead the unit after separation.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP is today, and we have a broad and in-depth portfolio of businesses that support companies in their transition to a new business style," said Whitman.
As an independent company, we are better placed than ever before to meet the changing needs of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than $50 billion of annual revenue and "will focus on providing unachieved, integrated technology solutions for companies so far", says a statement by the company.
It divides a company that was founded in the 1930s by the graduates of Stanford University Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to produce electrical installations and whose Palo Alto Garage was called "the birthplace of Silicon Valley".
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to cope with turning away from traditional PCs to mobile devices.
The measure of HP, the world's second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. tech companies, is the latest in this area, which is based on the belief that closely focused companies deliver better performance.
FC Arsenal Captain Mikel Arteta says that teammates must stand before the match against Dynamo Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wilshere
Wenger pointed out to Wilshere that it was not until September and, if his rehabilitation is planned, there is no reason why he cannot play again before Christmas.
This optimistic scenario already means that Wilshere will surely miss at least the next four games for England and, given his history, his participation in the European Championship next summer is certainly still uncertain.
The big shame in this current problem is that Wilshere had completed the last season after a separate knee injury and then found back to his old swing during the previous season.
"This kind of injury does not threaten the career," said Wenger.
It's a bone that didn't heal well.
That's not a big deal.
This was just an accident.
It was not associated with his ankles or with the injuries he had before.
This may be true from a purely medical point of view, but as Wenger also acknowledged, there is the associated danger of further injuries, always when a player tries to return in the middle of the season.
It also develops an unpleasant pattern.
The investigation of Premier Injuries Ltd has recorded 23 different diseases of Wilshere since its debut six years ago.
He also played in only 65 of Arsenals 157 leagues in the last five seasons.
The broader picture for Arsenal is that in six out of eight seasons since 2007/08 they have been one of the two Premier League Clubs that have recorded most of the injury days.
Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle, but Arsenal believes that an improvement in the injury rate will continue during the last season.
"Sometimes when you come back from an injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time when you need to strengthen your body and gain combat power," said Wenger.
Jack's young enough to get over this.
I hope his body stabilizes, I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the kind he deserves.
Arsenal starts his Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Dinamo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tottenham Hotspur on next Wednesday, and Wenger sets a rotation within the team.
Héctor Bellellín and Aaron Ramsey did not travel to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta should start.
Wenger can also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to keep the balance and give the players who need to take a little break," said Wenger.
Although Arsenal are clear favorites to move on through Group F, the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the playgrounds with the biggest intimidation effect in Europe.
Dynamo is also unbeatable after 41 games after the "invincible" campaign was launched in the last season.
The stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening, measuring 3.2 on the judge scale.
This year it was the 10th in Zagreb.
Wenger believes that Arsenal has drawn the teaching from the past season with the Champions League capitulation against Monaco and remains driven by the distant hope of leading the club to its first European Cup Triumph with its management.
"This drive is immense," said Wenger.
It's never worked at Arsenal.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand, I am in business long enough to be realistic.
We're ambitious, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: the comedy show that gives us serious lessons about men's friendships
The lack of similar representations in shows is obvious, especially in terms of how the need for men to open up has now become even more desperate than ever before, as suicide rates among young men prove at a 15-year-old high.
In 2013, it was the leading cause of death among men aged 20 to 45 in the UK, and it remains three times more common among men than among women.
In an effort to address the problem, the Campaign Against Living Misably (CALM) announced 2015 as the Year of the Man, with the aim of questioning the culture that prevents men from seeking help if they need it.
Friendship is the heart of the struggle to overcome this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 high-school students with depressive symptoms found that if the sufferer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with a "healthy mood" his chances of recovery doubled.
For those who are not depressed, a circle of spiritually healthy friends halves the risks of mental problems.
But of course you have to have friends first so that a friendship can work.
In the age of social media communication, with its focus on style about substance, the immediacy of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong, vibrant and successful, even if in reality isolation dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values; money, image, social status, all at the expense of intrinsic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship, which affects our mental health much more deeply.
And as a video game inventor and billionaire recently explained, money really can't buy luck.
The beautiful thing about Friends was that this focus was put on the head.
Each character was defined not by his work but by his personality, which shined through the interaction as a friend.
The humor of Joey and Chandler's frequent hugs, moments of football watching in cozy armchairs and the longing of Ross for Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can definitely relate to it, even if they often refrain from fully exploring their feelings.
As a telephone soul employee explained to me: ... "My listening role for people who feel depressed and are suicidal has really shown me clearly how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference."
The men who contact us often feel unable to talk to friends.
The old saying "I can handle it" has an enormous effect, such as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness when you talk about problems openly."
Friends is one of the shows that makes sense to me when I try to offer longer-term management mechanisms.
It clearly presents the small moments of men's friendships.
So much my objective outsider status over the phone may also help people in moments of despair, the long-term support comes from a personal network of family and friends.
And so, if you are visiting Comedy Central FriendsFest this weekend with the setting completely new for the celebration of the day, why not take your friends to a drink at Central Perk.
Or, better yet, if you see someone sitting around in Starbucks alone, give him a smile and say hello.
You never know what difference your friendship could make.
Friends are sent to Comedy Central from beginning to end - the entire 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
Di Maria meets to help PSG crush Malmö
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after his match against Malmö.
Di Maria meets at his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PSG pass Malmö.
Here are the game report and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani held a course when Paris Saint-Germain started his Champions League season with a very comfortable 2–0 victory against Malmö in the Prince Park Stadium on Tuesday.
Di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champion League debut as a PSG player who set off the French champion, but after that they missed a number of opportunities before finally raising their lead when Cavani scored a headball goal in the 61st minute.
With Real Madrid and Schachtjor Donetsk also in Group A, Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish champion, as it not only strives to qualify for the K.O. rounds, but to improve on the way to the quarter finals in each of the last three campaigns.
But while they got the points, it was not a class game by Laurent Blancs team with Zlatan Ibrahimovics missed chances in front of the goal. He was later replaced in the game against his hometown team and against the club with which he started his illustrious career already in 1999.
"It is not easy to win at home or away in the Champions League. Therefore, it is a good start to win 2:0, to cause our opponents problems and to look back relaxed, even if there are certain things that we still need to perfect during the season," said Blanc.
"This is a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, although I regret that we have not reached one or two more goals."
After his injury, Ibrahimovic returned to the Paris team in one of three changes, which was able to hold a 2:2 in his own place against Bordeaux in the First League on the weekend, but he was kicked out by Di Maria in the fourth minute.
The Argentinean wing tower was called the man who can take PSG to the next level in Europe when he was taken over last month by Manchester United, and he indicated why, when he entered Marco Verrattis Pass behind the Malmö Defense Forces, he ended up past Johan Wiland nicely in the long corner of the network.
However, if someone believed that PSG would win a big victory, he was disappointed.
Malmö, who hit Celtic in a play-off to reach this level, joined Anpiff with nine national players on the field and was a heavy opponent with a five-man defense and two deep in the middle field.
But apart from a shot by Nikola Djurdjic, who passed far by Kevin Trapps' posts in the 34th minute, they offered little to attack.
Instead, PSG itself sometimes gave up, with some mispasses and bad conclusions, not least by Ibrahimovic, who, in no less than five attempts alone in the first half of his life, and then was given up after Cavani had used him after the restart.
Nevertheless, he demonstrated much more skill when he brought his co-players into play, and it was a pass of Ibrahimovic that Di Maria turned into a shooting, which Wiland pointed past the post in the 52nd minute ...
The second gate finally fell shortly after the hour mark thanks to Cavani. The Uruguayan reached its sixth season gate after Ibrahimovic caught a left flank of Maxwell.
This ended all thought that Malmö could come back to the game, and only an excellent intervention by Wiland from the shortest distance to stop David Luis could keep the end result low before replacement player Ezequiel Lavezzi was recognized a goal at the end.
The coach of Malmö, Age Hareide, later admitted that PSG played a class over his team, and the Norwegian said: "Our last Champions League game was in December last year.
Since then we have only played in the Swedish league, which does not have the same level.
The skill games are not enough."
Take off before Paris!
It was a great game of them!
Glencore collects $2.5 billion through stock sales
The Swiss mining giant Glencore, affected by falling commodity prices, collected $2.5 billion on Wednesday through a stock sale as part of its huge debt-removal plan.
The London-registered company Glencore said in a statement that it has sold new shares worth about £1.6 billion to pay off its own debts.
The company, which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year, is struggling with falling raw material prices, as China’s economic downturn is pushing demand and having a devastating impact on markets.
The issue of subscription rights brought Glencore's share price in early Wednesday morning trading a rapid increase at the top of the London Stock Exchange.
The share jumped by 2.77 percent to 131.60 Pence on the FTSE 100 index, which opened 0.69 percent higher.
Glencore announced the $2.5 billion stock sale last week as part of the broader plans to cancel around a third of its $30 billion debt.
The company sold the new equity at 125 Pence per share, which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday.
There were 1.3 billion shares in the value of up to 9.99 percent of the group.
Concerns about long-term inhibited growth in China have cut iron ore prices by about half, coal, copper and other commodity prices have fallen by 20 to 40 percent.
Refugees arrive in Weimar
On Tuesday afternoon, 49 people reach the city administration in Weimar after a mostly long flight.
The refugees come from Syria, Albania, Afghanistan, Macedonia and Somalia.
The youngest breeder is a six-month-old girl from Syria.
The White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington
Chinese President Xi Jinping will make a state visit to the United States at the end of the month, confirmed the White House in a statement on Tuesday.
The visit, Xi's first official in Washington, takes place on 25 September and returns President Barack Obama's trip to Beijing last November, said the statement.
The U.S. President and First Lady Michelle Obama will also host Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan at a State-Diner this evening, after the two leaders have had bilateral talks.
"President Xi's visit will offer the opportunity to extend American-Chinese cooperation on a number of global, regional and bilateral issues of common interest, while also giving President Obama and President Xi the opportunity to address areas of disagreement constructively," the statement adds.
XI, whose visit was first announced in February, is expected to meet several U.S. technology leaders on his way to Washington before moving on to New York City to the UN General Assembly in September.
It is expected that Obama and Xi will address a number of contentious issues, including Washington's concerns about China's alleged cyber espionage and its growing self-confidence in the controversial waters of the South China Sea.

On the rainy highway then came the evil awakening.
At a company in Gotha County you can fulfill the dream and once hire and drive a V8 US sports car Ford Mustang Boss 302 with 440 hp.

Xavi: Pep Guardiola prevented 2008 change to FC Bayern
World and European champion Xavi has been playing for the al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015.
The FC Bayern was obviously just a few years ago the commitment of Spain's Superstar Xavi, who played for FC Barcelona at the time.
Eight times Spanish champion, three times cup winner, four times Champions League winner, two times club world champion, two times European champion, one time world champion - the title list of Xavi is stunning.
In the summer the 35-year-old left Barcelona FC after 24 years and moved to the al-Sadd Sport Club to Qatar.
But in an interview with Marca, Xavi now reveals that he was already standing before the European Championship in 2008 before leaving Barcelona.
"They told me Barça wanted to sell me."
"Madrid won everything, we didn't," he says.
And that was also recorded by FC Bayern.
Xavi: "There was an offer from Bavaria."
"Rummenigge wanted me."
To remember: In the summer of 2008, Jürgen Klinsmann took over FC Bayern.
Guardiola was the reason that Xavi did not change
However, the change did not occur.
And the decisive man for this works today for the German record champion: Pep Guardiola.
Xavi explains why: "Barça signed Guardiola and I played a great EM."
"Pep told me that I wouldn't change that he couldn't imagine the team without me."
"That's how he got me."
Who knows how Bayern's season 2008/2009 would have gone with Xavi.
Xavi stood for Barca in the quarter finals of the Champions League against the Bayern over the entire distance on the lawn, turned off the reds (4:0, 1:1) and finally celebrated the King-Class Triumph.
Matt Damon plays diversity down in filmmaking
Matt Damon confronted African filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion about diversity and said she was not needed behind the scenes.
During a Sunday night episode by HBO's Project Greenlight, experienced actor Brown interrupted when he stressed the need for alternative perspectives in relation to a black protagonist in the chosen script of the project.
"When we talk about diversity, you do it when you occupy the film and not when you occupy the show," Damon assured.
Brown reacted shockedly, with insulted disbelief and called out "Hoo! Wow. Okay", when the comments of the actor of The Martian strengthened.
Damon and Brown joined the producer colleagues Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the show finalists.
"I want to encourage people to think about how they treat the figure of Harmony - whoever will be the director," Brown said first.
The only black person, and she's a hooker beaten by her white pimp.
The producer of Dear White People advocated for the finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for the directing rights to the film; Damon replied that her director could "in the end give us something that we don't want."
After the discussion was broadcast, the social media exploded before disapproval of Damon's comments.
Twitter user Mr Pooni expressed his anger about the clip by writing "Matt Damon talks about the only black person in the room, so he can explain her diversity - that's SO WEISS that it hurts."
The tweet earned more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes since its release.
Damon's comments come at a time when exact racial representation in the media is at the top of the social debate.
After the teenager Michael Brown was killed by a white police officer in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement achieved national effects and urged legislators and authorities to impose discriminatory practices against coloured interference.
In February, singer Prince made an allusion to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Grammy Awards.
"Albums still matter" (albums still have their meaning) he said.
Like books and black lives, albums still have their meaning.
In recent times leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement have published a statement in response to the question of Fox News personality Elisabeth Hasselbeck, whether the group should be considered a hate group.
"The Black Lives Matter Network is a love group," the leaders said.
Recently, it was announced that Damon was on a list of entertainers, producers and media moguls who are invited to visit the Pope to discuss the presentation of the Catholic Church in the West.
Whether he has accepted the invitation or has already met the Pope is unclear.
'American Ninja Warrior' crowns first champion
Professional sports climber and operator Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior on Monday evening and took home the big price of $1 million.
The competition show, which just finished its 7th season, had never experienced a contestant who could complete all the stages of his obstacle course.
During the season, two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten, made it to the finals.
One of the last tasks was climbing on a 75-foot climbing rope in 30 seconds.
British finished the task within the time with which he was the first athlete to complete the strenuous phase 4 of American Ninja Warrior. However, Caldiero completed this challenge fully three seconds faster, making him the winner.
Caldiero spoke to E!News after the hard-won victory, still under the shock of winning the Great Price of $1 million.
"I mean, it's amazing to think about it, I've never earned more than $10,000 or had to live," Isaac E! said about his pile of money.
As suddenly as I can't even imagine how it is... the future is unknown.
The leading producer Kent Weed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the finale and why British, although he was the first to finish the race, won no prize money.
According to the rules, the money goes to the fastest person.
"If there's more than one finalist, it gets the one with the fastest time," said Weed.
How much money is a wonderful price and life changes, he gets the great congratulations.
I don't think he has any resentment about it.
He's just so happy to have done what he did.
He received a lot of awards from fans.
He's such a great guy and a family father.
He's a hero for his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, "If I should be beaten by someone, then I'm glad it's Isaac."
And I think Isaac would have felt the same way if they had switched the roles.
America Ninja Warrior has been extended for a eighth season, the shootings will begin in spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers sneaking past Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS-The second half of the season was not very funny for the Detroit Tigers.
They used to be one of the best teams in baseball, and today the Tigers are in the last place in the American League Central.
The Tigers are reduced to their role as spoilers, but on Tuesday this part played perfectly against the Minnesota Twins with 5-4 in the Target Field.
The Twins wasted a chance to rise within a game half of the Houston Astros for the second American League Wildcard place.
For Detroit, though only for one evening, it was a return of the three letter F word that was so difficult to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season.
"All wins are fun, no matter how it comes," said Tiger's manager Brad Ausmus.
Tiger-Pitcher Alfredo Simon maintained his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two innings, then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) hit 6 times in the 1/3 Innings and made three runs possible.
It was only his third successful start in his last nine games.
"I want to finish strongly this year," said Simon.
It's hard to throw every game in the bullpen, and that's why I want to get into the game completely focused.
The designed Tiger-Hitter Victor Martinez had three hits and was in two runs, his first RBIs since mid-August.
It was Martinez's first three-hit game since he had four hits against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He swung the bat well," said Ausmus.
He looked good at (beat training), looked significantly better in the bullpen, and he put it right into the game.
With three runs in reverse at the end of the seventh innings, the Twins had their best chance to get back into play.
Center Fielder Byron Buxton completed the inning with a double on the left line.
Right Fielder Aaron Hicks reached a colorful, and Simon brought his second Baseman Brian Dozier to the strikeout before being replaced by Left Hand Blaine Hardy.
Hardy survived the wall, the only man he was confronted with, in front of the designated rookie hit man Miguel Sano, who entrissed Drew Verhagen's right-hand man a two-run.
With a pair of runners and the final run at the second, Verhagen brought the third baseman Trevor Plouffe to a double play.
It was the 27th time in the Major League this season that Plouffe hit a double play
After Detroit added an insurance run at the end of the ninth innings, the wall created an RBI double against the closer of the Tigers Bruce Rondon and reached the score of 5-4.
However, the right-hand man ran out of Sano at three pitches for his fifth save.
Detroit benefited from a Phil Hughes who was not yet mobile in the start of the game.
The Tigers scored three runs in the first two innings against the right-handed veteran who had been removed from the list before the game after he had missed more than a month because of a back disorder.
"Of course not the beginning that I wanted," said Hughes, "but I felt better when I got started and felt that I would create some pretty good pitches there in the third inning."
After first receiving the Leadoff Batter, Hushes gave a single to Second Baseman Ian Kinsler.
A two-out walk for J.D. Martinez brought Victor Martinez to the game, which created a single "up the middle" on the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez made his 0-21 success series with the runners in the scoring position.
The third baseman Nick Castellanos followed with a single on the right, created another run, but Victor Martinez was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third, which ended the threat.
The Tigers added in the second, a one-out double by Catcher James McCann and a two-out single by Center-fielder Anthony Gose scored 3-0.
"That was a big blow," said Twins manager Paul Molitor.
He didn't hit very well, but he got the right place.
Hughes was in a pitch count, didn't score any points in the third inning before being replaced by the Reliever Rechtshanden A.J.Achter.
At Hughes there were three runs with six hits and a walk with four strikeouts.
NOTES: Tiger's RHP Anibal Sanchez retired due to an injury to the shoulder.
He is investigated by Dr. James Andrews, who operated on Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez, who has been on the list of injuries since mid-August due to shoulder damage, is scheduled to be activated for the launch on Wednesday.
With Sanchez out of the game, LHP Daniel Morris is removed from the injury list to start against the Twins.
Norris with 1-1 at four starts with the Tigers, since he was acquired in exchange with LHP David Price on July 30.
He has been missing since August 20 because of a breakdown in the right hip joint.
The Tigers and the Twins will finish their series of three games in the Target Field on Wednesday
Norris (2-2.4.43 ERA) will play against Minnesota's RHP Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73)
Hundreds of refugees are to be accommodated in Wiesbaden
A train with hundreds of refugees is on its way to Hessen.
His arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday.
The people who travelled there will then be accommodated in emergency accommodation in Wiesbaden, as the city of Wiesbaden announced on Tuesday evening.
She calculated with 450 to 750 arriving refugees.
Several sports halls in the Hessian capital had been prepared for this case in the past few days.
Up to 1000 refugees can stay there temporarily.
They should then be distributed to other municipalities.
In the last ten days alone, according to the government bureau responsible for initial admission, 7500 people had arrived in Hessen.
Frankfurt and Hanau have also set up emergency accommodation in sports halls due to the large number of refugees.
Ischinger: German military measures in Syria an option
The head of the Munich Security Conference, Wolfgang Ischinger, considers military action with German participation in Syria possible.
"I believe that the decisive reflection on military action options must not take place without Germany," he said.
He accused the European states of "collective vision".
Four years ago, it was a good thing that the cup of military participation in Germany had passed.
"Now the conflict is falling at our doorstep," he said in Germanyfunk.
The former German ambassador to Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid on the ground for refugees.
Austria controls at southern and eastern borders
After Germany Austria has also introduced controls at its southern and eastern borders.
Austrian Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner said on Tuesday evening at the Austrian TV station ORF that no one will be sent back to Hungary.
Germany also did not send refugees back to Austria.
"No, that's agreed," she said.
On the question of an agreement that Germany could accept a certain number of refugees from Austria per day, Mikl-Leitner said that there had already been discussions between the Director-General for Public Security and representatives of Germany.
She did not mention concrete figures and referred to talks on Wednesday in Berlin.
In the past few days, tens of thousands of refugees had come to Austria via the so-called Balkan route from Hungary.
Her goal is mostly Germany.
Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and her Austrian colleague Werner Faymann together with several other EU Heads of State and Government requested a special summit for next week.
Germany had begun temporary border controls on Sunday.
The EU countries have so far been unable to agree on a common approach in the crisis.
On Tuesday (22 September) the EU Ministers of the Interior will take a new start at a special meeting for the binding distribution of another 120 000 refugees.
In view of the strong refugee regime in Germany, the Federal Government intends to strengthen its support for the countries in the first uptake and distribution of people.
The union will manage this together with the countries, Merkel announced on the late Tuesday evening after almost four hours of discussions with the Prime Minister at the Chancellor's Office in Berlin.
Merkel underlined that those people who need protection would also get them.
But those who do not have a stay perspective could not stay in Germany either.
This view had been widely shared in the round.
The chancellor stressed that the state as a whole now had to cope with a "great effort".
Thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan route.
Hungary closed its 175-kilometre border with Serbia on the night of Tuesday.
A few hours later, the government announced in Budapest that it would also lock off the border with Romania with a fence.
This neighbouring country belongs to the EU, unlike Serbia.
Hungary wanted to prevent tows from seeking out routes across Romania, said Hungary's Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto about the planned new border fence.
The Romanian government immediately condemned the plan.
There were first arrests of people who had cut the fence.
According to eyewitness reports in Turkey, thousands of other migrants were on their way to the Greek border.
Space probe "Cassini" finds ocean on Saturnmond Enceladus
Under the ice cream of Saturn Moon Enceladus, a global ocean changes.
This includes researchers from observations of the "Cassini" space probe.
Thus, the moon tumbles slightly on its orbit around the ring planet.
Although this haze movement is only small, it is still too large for a consistently fixed celestial body, it is stated in a statement from Cornell University in Ithaca (New York, U.S.A.) on Tuesday.
The researchers present their analyses in the journal "Icarus".
For a long time it was known that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of Enceladus.
In 2006 "Cassini" had discovered ice volcanoes at the south pole of the Saturn Moon, which spew water vapor and ice particles and thus feed the so-called e-ring of Saturn.
At least on the south pole there had to be an underground sea, the astronomers closed at that time.
However, the expansion of the hidden ocean was not clear.
Rama missing 1860 Munich several weeks
The 1860 Munich has to renounce the offensive of Valdet Rama for about a month.
An investigation revealed an adductor injury in the 27-year-old, the association announced.
Rama had already complained about pain at the beginning of the week.
According to Münchner Löwen, the diagnosis means "presumably four weeks of forced rest".
"This is hard for us, Rama is a terrible loss."
"Of course, we need to think now," said sports director Necat Aygün of the "Picture" newspaper with a view to the possible commitment of a non-unionist professional.
However, as a training guest, the Sixties first presented a defensive man.
The 30-year-old Hrvoje Cale was last active in Belgium and was already under contract with VfL Wolfsburg.
The Croat currently has "the opportunity to prove his ability".
Torjäger Rubin Okotie can return to the team training next week after his concussion.
Already on Thursday, the Austrian national player is scheduled to join the running training.
Okotie had injured himself in the game at Fortuna Düsseldorf (0:3) during a violent impact on his head.
In contrast to his first fears, however, he remained without a severe blessing.
No diet-fruit - Mangos contain a lot of sugar
Mangos are exotic and juicy-sweet.
But whoever wants to pay attention to his slender line is often advised by them.
Mangos contains a relatively large amount of sugar - especially sucrose.
The exotic fruits are still healthy: they contain B vitamins as well as vitamins E and C. Mangos, however, contain a lot of vitamin A and its precursor beta carotene.
The person who eats the fruit thus supports vision, immune system and metabolic processes in the body.
When buying, Mangos should not be too soft or too firm and smell pleasant.
The shell color alone does not tell you how ripe the fruit is - so also green mangoes can taste very delicious.
You should store at room temperature and be consumed within a few days.
Then, of course, they taste pure or in sweet foods.
A mango, however, also gives hearty dishes a special touch.
It softens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as Chicoree and Radiccio.
And a mangochutney fits well with fish, poultry, lamb and game.
The U.S. Package Service UPS is hiring up to 95,000 helpers for the Christmas business in the United States.
The company had already started recruiting seasonal workers, UPS announced on Tuesday.
Especially drivers are being looked for.
Already last year, UPS had increased its staff for the holiday season by 95,000 extras.
In view of the booming online business, UPS and its competitor FedEx have been making arrangements since last year to be armed for the Christmas business.
In 2013, late deliveries had brought harsh criticism to package services.
First hairwind, then marked cold front
In the coming night, the valleys of the Alpine north side of the Föhn break through, as Meteozwiss announced on Tuesday.
On Wednesday and on the night of Thursday, the hairdryer blows partly with storm strength through the foyer valleys.
After the hairdryer on Thursday morning, a marked cold front crosses us, bringing strong rainfalls, windbows and a drop in temperature.
As MeteoNews writes in a Communication, Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive deep pressure area across the British islands in a strong south-west current.
On the Alpennord side breaks through the valleys in the night to the Wednesday of the hairdryer.
The hairdryer blows until Thursday morning in the foyer valleys with arches from 60 to 100 km/h, isolated and especially in the Urnerland partly also with over 100 km/h.
The hair dryer can penetrate to the adjacent central country, and on the mountains even hurricane bays of more than 120 km/h are possible.
While in the north on Wednesday stormy hair dryers provide summer temperatures from 23 to 27 degrees, moisture begins to stand on the alpine slope.
Here is rain that lasts until Thursday evening.
In total, the south of the Alps has to be expected over the next 48 hours with some more than 100 litres of rain per square metre, which has already fallen in the last few days.
On Thursday morning the hair dryer leaves the air, and then a cold front rolls over Switzerland with strong, partly whitish-permeated rain from west to east.
Together with the cold front, the wind refreshes strongly to stormy, and the temperatures drop significantly.
The following days present themselves in the north autumn with 15 to 20 degrees, while in the south it becomes sunny and warmer with up to 25 degrees.
Rome now has a Martin Luther place
Almost 500 years after the Reformation, there is now a Martin Luther Square in Rome.
In the presence of city president Ignazio Marino, a previously nameless place in the park on the Oppio hill was baptized on Wednesday on the name of the German reformer.
At the "Piazza Martin Lutero" he is now recognized as "German theologian of the Reformation".
The park is located in the middle of the old Rome right next to the Colosseum.
The denomination had been applied for by the working community of the Evangelical Churches in Rome.
Jens-Martin Kruse, pastor of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Rome, recalled on Wednesday that Protestants in the city of the Popes could often live as a minority only in secret.
With the place become symbolically visible that their tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome.
Martin Luther (1483-1546) stayed in Rome for several months as a young Augustine monk at the turn of the year 1510/11.
At the time, he felt the city was an agreed sinful Babylon.
His negative impressions, according to historians, should have strengthened him in his later fight against Rome.
Luther then, with his theses against the indulgence trade, had initiated the division of the Western Church.
Hammer artists invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the (golden) crown of thorns is one of the main works that Otmar Alt painted for his Bible.
Klaus Altepost wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts.
At the beginning was the word?
No, not at the Otmar-Alt-Bible, which has now appeared with magnificent images.
At the beginning was the image for Otmar Alt, who in 150 motifs formulated his very personal interpretations of Bible stories on paper and canvas.
His "language" with colorful colours and imaginative shapes has been preserved by the 75-year-old - but this is by no means equivalent to "funny" pictures.
On the contrary: adapted to the respective topics, this can seem quite gloomy.
About three years old Otmar has been working on his Bible project, for which he has made a subjective-artistic selection from the many topics of the book of all books.
Cycles have been created that devote themselves to such topics as crossroads, plagues, commandments, or father's.
As a result, he spontaneously fascinated several partners: This applies to the Luther publishing house with its theological orientation as well as to the Kettler publishing house with its focus on art books.
And there is especially the author Klaus Altepost, who has dealt with the respective Bible passages on the basis of painting.
He interpreted the Bible passages chosen by Otmar Alt and thus "translated" into today's contexts.
These texts are like verbal mirrors of Old's painting.
They are embedded between the original Bible quotation by Martin Luther and a sentence by the artist, who here formulates his very personal thoughts about the situation.
The jewelry cover has golden letters.
Thus the 75-year-old equally doubles a deep insight into his soul, his emotions.
This is a high level of intimacy.
Emotions were in the end a trigger for the Bible project: Otmar Alt, born in 1940 in Wernigerode and raised in Berlin, comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant Herrhuter order.
"There the education has already happened with the tube stick," remembers Otmar Alt.
"I have tried to work on this in order to perhaps tolerate myself again with the Lord's Father."
His second concern was to help art return to its place in a fast-paced time: "The perception of image worlds today is marked by advertising, and it is loud.
Symbolism is being suppressed there.
Artists have a different desire and pleasure to show things.
Images always have something mysterious and are not decorative.
"In this respect, I am a dinosaur."
Otmar Alt wants the viewers to "fall in", let them act on them, discover and feel the power they have: "The image seeks its counterpart".
Klaus Altepost confessed on Tuesday at the presentation of the Otmar-Alt-Bibel in the Otmar-Alt-Foundation to be "always" a lover of Otmar Alt's art: "I like how he understands life with his pictures".
Not only did old people take full note of the Bible but they chose the important, mysterious topics that he considered to be important.
"This was not a collaboration on eye level," Altepost says: "This is about the pictures, the text merely explains."
For Hans Möhler of Luther's publishing house, this work is an invitation to "deepen his life and find freedom".
Otmar Alt's images speak for Möhler both the (biblical) language of love and that of responsibility.
A part of the original - paper and canvas pictures - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition that will be opened on 15 November at the Otmar Alt Foundation.
Construction start for BMX train closes
Plans made, space found, company commissioned, earth hill modeled for a round course: a year later almost everything was done - but before the official opening of the BMX-Bahn was already finished.
Failures in politics and administration caused distortions, especially among the residents who did not want to tolerate the railway.
So hill shifted, new place sought - now with formal planning and application for construction permission.
The approval would be granted in October, the first municipal councillor Sabine Mosebach-Bock could now report to the Children's and Youth Committee.
"I hope that this year something visible is still happening," she said.
The work at the former indoor pool should then be started without "further commemorative break".
DFB strengthens commitment to refugees
The DFB extends its commitment to refugees until 2019, and the Bundesliga is a clear sign on the weekend.
Soccer reacts to the acute situation in Germany and assures politics its help in dealing with the problems ahead.
"I consider this to be the biggest challenge of our country since the reunification."
"In principle, no one can say that's none of my business, I have nothing to do with it."
"Everyone must be interested in getting this issue under control," said DFB Chief Wolfgang Niersbach.
At the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin, he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively.
"I will be at the chancellor's office next Wednesday and meet the Minister of State Ms. Özoğuz and the Chancellor."
"There the topic will certainly play a central role," he announced.
The football can and would help.
However, the decisive course must be political.
The German Football Federation has therefore extended its refugee initiative "1:0 for a welcome" by four years.
"About the Egidius Braun Foundation, we have ensured that this programme will continue until 2019," Niersbach said on the edge of the UEFA conference in St. Julian's/Malta.
Some federal leagues also support this program.
This weekend, the 36 professional clubs set a clear mark if they will wear the "We help - #refugeeswelcome" on the left jersey sleeve instead of the usual sponsor logo (hermes).
"We also want to make it clear that everyone should help, where and how they can," said Leverkusen's sports manager Rudi Völler of the "Picture" newspaper (Tuesday) and described the project as "of course".
"The refugee drama affects everyone, no one can look away."
"We football leaguers can, no, we need to use our radiance, influence and opportunities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so incredibly," said Hertha manager Michael Preetz.
Hoffenheim's managing director Peter Rettig spoke of a "prominent sign of the league".
The women's national team invites 100 refugees to Halle/Saale for the EM qualification game against Hungary this Friday.
Niersbach described the support of refugees as "a large community of German football".
That all 36 licensors in their places had started their own projects is great.
Just as great is that small and smallest clubs are active there.
The message "1:0 for a welcome" we have issued is live in football.
"This is of enormous importance," he said.
In this and next year, the association, together with the DFB election and the Federal Government, will each provide EUR 300 000 for the integration of refugees.
"The clubs have already called the whole sum for 2015," Niersbach reported.
Reports: SAP Chief Executive loses an eye in an accident
According to several reports, the CEO of Europe's largest software group, Bill McDermott, lost his left eye due to a fall in early July.
In the accident on the stairs in his brother's house in the USA, he fell on a glass of water after midnight, which he carried in his left hand, reports the "Economic Week" on Wednesday.
"He almost bled, was powerless, then dragged himself out on the street - he told us so last week," quotes the "WiWo" SAP co-founder Hasso Plattner.
But McDermott could do his job.
"At the beginning of October we meet before the Supervisory Board meeting in Walldorf," said Plattner.
The 54-year-old manager was present at the meeting and "fully capable of working".
McDermott announced in an interview with the "Süddeutsche Zeitung" (Süddeutsche Zeitung) that he would come back to Germany in October and lead the software group.
"I'm full for SAP, full of my job."
"Of course, I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman, Hasso Plattner," said McDermott of the "SZ".
McDermott usually commutes between Germany and the USA, but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Walldorf.
It was important for him to go to the public with such a personal story, the manager of the "SZ" said, "Everyone can do something like that."
"It's important to get back up when you're down."
McLaren Replacement Pilot Magnussen out of combat...
Magnussen tweeted an appropriate photo and explained that he had suffered the injury when he fell off the wheel.
He is therefore less likely to be a reserve driver for the two regular pilots Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button at the weekend in Singapore than a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan.
Football: BVB without Reus against Krasnodar: Weidenfeller in the gate
At Borussia Dortmund, all hopes for a comeback by Marco Reus in the first group game of the Europe League have finally shattered.
The national player will also be missing the table leader of the football league with the FK Krasnodar on Thursday (19.00 a.m./sky).
"Unfortunately, we cannot resort to him," said Thomas Tuchel on Wednesday.
Whether Reus will be back on Sunday in the Bundesliga top game against Leverkusen, the BVB coach left open: "We expect him to return to training on Friday".
In view of the high load of his professionals, Tuchel will not only change his tribal Elf on the giant position.
So he announced a change in the gatekeeper position.
That's why Roman Weidenfeller takes the place of keeper Roman Bürki.
"He trains at an absolute top level," the football teacher praised the world champion.
Whether pasture traps are used in all European League games in the future, however, Tuchel left open.
He will very likely also contest the second batch.
The research statement by co-player Reus that the final move for the BVB in the Europe League must be the goal, midfielder Julian Weigl believes it is understandable: " Marco is not so wrong with that."
"I think we have a good chance to take the title."
Robotic Cars: Government wants pioneering role for Germany
Germany should be, according to the will of the federal government, in the transformation of the car of technological pioneers.
On Wednesday, the Federal Cabinet adopted a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), which includes investments in the development of digital infrastructure.
Dobrindt spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the IAA car fair about a "new age of mobility".
Automated and networked driving will increase road safety and reduce congestion, said Dobrindt.
He also wants to discuss the issue with his colleagues from the G7 countries, who also meet with representatives of the industry at the IAA.
The strategy paper of the Ministry of Transport stresses, among other things, the importance of mobile broadband expansion and a rapid switch to digital radio.
In order to test new technology, a test track is currently being built on motorway 9 in Bavaria.
In order to ensure that the driver is "not exposed to any additional liability risks", the Federal Government intends to "check the legal framework and, where necessary, adapt to the new developments".
For example, Germany intends to make international efforts to increase the maximum speed allowed for self-driving cars from 10 to 130 kilometres per hour.
The Federal Government is also committed to an amendment to the Vienna Convention, which has so far only been a driver.
With automated driving, the car increasingly takes the lead, the driver becomes more and more a passenger.
The technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process the data in seconds.
According to a study submitted by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, highly automated driving on motorways will be technically possible by 2020.
Nevertheless, driverless vehicles on public roads are "to be expected far after 2020".
The authors of the study for 2025 estimate the value added in the area of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at the location Germany to be around 8.4 billion euros.
"The digital networking of the car can lead to more safety and efficiency in road traffic," said SPD transport politician Sören Bartol.
However, the question of liability in the event of accidents and the safety of the personal data of drivers must be clearly clarified.
However, the Germans still see self-driving cars sceptical - much more than French or American.
A survey by the Forsa Institute on Wednesday at the AA commissioned by Dekra's testing organisation leads to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that auto-driving cars will prevail in the next ten years, 32 percent only expect to do so in 20 years, 31 percent don't believe in it at all.
In France, 21 percent of respondents expect autonomous cars by 2025, 33 percent in the US.
In any case, the drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self-driving vehicle.
After a survey by the Bitkom Digital Association, only seven percent would agree to take control of all roads throughout the journey.
At least 15 percent could be imagined on the highway in flowing traffic, at a congestion of 45 percent.
Well every four would not leave control to the car under any circumstances.
Boll announces team and double start at table tennis-EM
According to the current state of play, the Düsseldorfer only wants to show up in detail in the title fights from 25 September to 4 October.
The final decision shall be taken by 22 September at the latest.
"This is a huge loss for our team."
"The boys found out in the morning."
"But we are strong enough to get the title even without Timo," said Federal Trainer Jörg Roßkopf during the EM course in Düsseldorf.
Boll was at that time on the flight to a long-term sponsoring date in China.
The 34-year-old German master is expected back on Friday.
"Without Timo, we are no longer such a clear favourite," said single European champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov.
The Hamelner, who leads the list of seats in Ekaterinburg, also reminded of the EM 2013 in Schwechat.
"At that time Timo also missed, and we have become European champions."
"That's what we should be oriented towards," said the World rankings Five.
The English football national player Luke Shaw of Manchester United has contracted a serious injury to the right leg.
In the Champions League game at PSV Eindhoven, the defender was hit in a strike by Héctor Moreno and replaced after long treatment.
The first diagnosis indicated a rail fracture in the 20-year-old co-player of Bastian Schweinsteiger.
Gaultier feels too old for an enfant terrible
It is a mixture of a huge fashion show and a wax-figure horror cabinet: The designer Jean Paul Gaultier (63) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich.
The Highlights: Shop windows dolls, which look awfully human thanks to video projections.
They carry the spectacular creations of the French designer, who, among other things, became the great star of the fashion scene with Madonna's stage outfits - and that he put men in skirts.
"I can't say today that I'm the enfant terrible of the Haute Couture because I have white hair."
"In the past it was bleached, now it's real," said Gaultier.
For the visitors of the exhibition "From The Sidewalk To The Catwalk" (From the Burgersteig to the Runpsteig), which can be seen from September 18 at the Kunsthalle der Hypo-Kulturstiftung, it is a good thing that the fashion creator has changed his initially negative attitude to a show about his person.
Actually, he was against it, because: "To me, an exhibition sounded a little bit after death," he said.
When you die, you come to the museum.
The impressive collection had already been made in the Canadian Montreal and Paris station.
"It's about so much more than just beautiful clothes," said the director of the Kunsthalle, Roger Diederen.
It is about tolerance, acceptance and the vision of an open society.
The exhibits give an insight into the hard-to-see work of the man who wrote fashion history without ever having completed an education.
Chronologically, the show is not built up, but it is an excellent choreographed overall work of art, for which much effort has been made: for example, a stylist has been engaged to refresh the dolls.
According to the curator Thierry-Maxime Loriot, 14 tons of material the makers have carted to Munich.
Just before the start of the Oktoberfest, there was a special treat: a leather trousers outfit with corset.
Heidi's measuring Madonna.
He has always been interested in strong women ("women are smarter than men") and in people who are a little different, said Gaultier.
Gaultier's old Teddy can also be seen in the exhibition.
He stands for the first, sluggish, fashionable style of the designer.
As a child (he was not a good student and bad in football) he put on his Teddy bras and clothes, said Gaultier.
To play with a doll would not have allowed his parents to play with him.
He later taught himself how to design fashion.
He stole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers, as Gaultier told in Munich.
Later I bought them, of course.
For his first fashion show he could not have paid the models.
They got nothing, but they were allowed to keep the clothes.
Jewelry instead of curtain - Plauener Spit as fashion niche
It used to be about the long embroidery machines in and around paws to make meters.
The embroidered fabrics and laces were produced in large quantities for customers who, for example, processed them into blankets and curtains.
This alone no longer works today, explains Andreas Reinhardt, Managing Director of the Plauen fashion centre.
Instead, fashion is again important.
In the early days of the Plauen peak, fashion played a larger role, was then displaced by the home textile industry - and is now rediscovered as niche.
Reinhardt mentions some examples: lace in jewelry, accessories such as bags and regional costumes.
Overall, the so-called vintage fashion, based on past styles, represents an increasing potential for order.
Those who do not serve niches in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market.
With us they already make up half of all orders.
Fashion tip Plauen is a member of the Plauener Spitt and Embroidery Industry Association together with nine other companies.
Only they are allowed to wear the protected label.
In the last 15 years, about 80 percent of sales have been broken.
There are almost no more private trades and wholesale trades.
Our products hardly reach the customer in this way.
Today, the mass goods were produced in the Asian space much cheaper and sold almost exclusively via chains.
Furthermore, exports are weakening, currently to Russia and the USA.
So enough reasons for new ways.
The industry association is also trying to point out by environmental awareness, as Cordula Bauer of the Stickperle in Falkenstein explains: "Since this year we have had a quality seal that shows that we produce organically and socially compatible."
Reinhardt adds: "This also refers to the materials used".
Diploma designer Ute Schmidt teaches at the Schneeberger Ausstelle of the Western Saxon University of Zwickau - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and specializes in embroidery and lace.
In order to counter the competition from the Asian region, you need to find high-quality and innovative products.
It takes time and courage.
There is a field of tension between the freshest ideas of designers and the companies that have to think economically above all," says Schmidt.
Therefore, an existing design is often only slightly varied in order to keep a customer base.
A few years ago, textile designer Kati Reuter revitalized the historic snowball tip.
The machine in some places embroiders small balls.
Plauener Goldschmiedemeister Bianca Hallebach-Krouße was inspired by this: "Before, I couldn't begin with a traditional plueneer tip".
Now she uses the snowball tip for her jewelry.
In an elaborate process, it marks the pattern in silver.
"Many people in the region identify themselves with the theme of Plauener Spit - young and old," says Reuter.
It also delivers to the USA, Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors have lived in Plauen and surroundings and who want a souvenir.
This is how I see my jewelry as a modern ambassador to the Plauen peak.
Disney plans new Mary Poppins film
Legends should not be touched, but Disney still dares a new film of his classic "Mary Poppins".
According to "Entertainment Weekly", however, it is not a re-filming, but a kind of continuation that is played 20 years after the first film with the magical nanny.
It is about the experience of the Nanny with the Banks family in times of the world economic crisis in England.
Those who play poppins more than 50 years after Julie Andrews are still unclear.
But the director is already clear: Rob Marshall, last with "Into the Woods" in the cinema.
Xi urges to open up the economy wider to the world
The economy needs to open up wider in order to promote growth, said President Xi Jinping on Tuesday of a group tasked with steering the reform.
"China should strive to attract foreign investment and know-how and improve business start-ups," he said in a speech at the 16th meeting of the Central Executive Group on the deepening of a comprehensive reform.
Promoting new start-ups and advancing reforms will bring about new momentum and vitality and provide a new place for economic growth, said Xi.
The management group has adopted a number of directives, including a negative list on market access regulation, relaxation of border control policies, promotion of state enterprises (SOE), private capital, and overhaul of the resident reporting system.
According to the statement, a negative list is created that identifies sectors and companies that are not eligible for investment.
The system is gradually tested and improved by testing programs.
The initiative is important because it attaches a greater role to the market in the allocation of resources, ensures a legal state business environment and makes the market more open, said the statement.
The government will also relax controls on the powers conferred on companies and ensure that companies decide how to conduct their business.
The statement also stated that China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
As part of an offer to open state-controlled sectors, further areas will be opened for private investment.
"The government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-funded companies and provide them with better services," said the statement.
In addition, it is made easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the "Green Card" by optimising the requirements and facilitating the application process.
The right of lawyers to guarantee the exercise of their duties and the use of professional judges and prosecutors was also discussed at a meeting.
The meeting also included Prime Minister Li Keqiang and important leaders such as Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, as reported in a statement published after the meeting.
EU wants to double mercury limit in predatory fish
The European Commission intends to double the limit values for mercury in large predatory fish and thus assume a significantly higher dose of neurotoxicity for consumers.
The consumer organisation Foodwatch, which has a corresponding EU working paper, strongly criticized the plans: "Risks and side effects of missing industrial and environmental policies are passed on to pregnant women and toddlers with full weight," said Matthias Wolfschmidt of Foodwatch.
According to Wolfschmidt, the limits of neurotoxicity for large fish at the end of the food chain, such as shark or swordfish, are to be raised by one to two milligrams of mercury per kilogram of fish for "economic reasons".
Large predatory fish, however, are already so heavily burdened with mercury that about 50 percent of the catches may not be sold on the basis of the limits still in force.
After doubling the limit values, only 14.5 percent would be unsold.
In return for this relaxation, according to Foodwatch, the EU wants to tighten the limits for other fish from 0.5 milligrams to 0.1 milligrams of mercury per kilogram.
But foodwatch called this a "trick" because smaller fried fish, such as carp, are usually so low that they already comply with the planned maximum levels.
The reduction in small fish is therefore "a perfect diversion manoeuvre that only helps the economy," Wolfschmidt explained.
Mercury is a heavy metal that is highly toxic to humans, which is greatly enriched over the food chain, especially in predatory fish.
The Federal Government therefore warns that "small quantities can cause damage to the nervous system, especially in the case of unborn babies".
However, the Federal Ministry of the Environment stated on its homepage that a "health threat to the general population" could not be expected.
Mercury gets into the environment mainly by burning coal.
According to a written information from the Federal Environment Ministry, the German coal power plants emit more than six tons of mercury per year to the Green Federal Assembly member Annalena Baerbock, two-thirds of the total quantity issued in Germany.
The concentration of mercury in fish, for example in Elbe, Rhein and Danube, was "permanently and comprehensively exceeded", the "mirror" quoted from the paper in March.
Last year, Europe-wide alerts to mercury in fish have already been among the most frequently reported health risks in the EU alert system RASFF.
