28-year-old chef found dead in San Francisco Mall
A 28-year-old cook who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stairwell of a local shopping centre.
The victim's brother said that he couldn't imagine anyone who would want to hurt him, "Finally, he was going up again."
The body found in the Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning was identified as the 28-year-old Frank Galicia from San Francisco, and reported to the San Francisco Judicial Department.
The San Francisco Police Department said that death was classified as murder and the investigations are ongoing.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told the ABS Sender KGO in San Francisco that six months ago Frank, who had worked as a chef in Boston, had spent his dream job as a cook at Sons & Daughter's restaurant in San Francisco.
A spokesman for Sons & Daughters said that they were "shocked and destroyed on the ground" about his death.
"We are a small team that works like a close family and we will miss him painfully," the speaker continued.
Our thoughts and our condolences are in this difficult time with Frank's family and friends.
Louis Galicia said that Frank lived in hostels first, but that, "the things finally went uphill for him."
"He found an apartment, he had a girlfriend," said Louis Garcia KGO.
Louis Galicia said he couldn't imagine anyone trying to hurt his younger brother.
He was a kind person with a great heart.
His way to connect with his family was always to cook us something, to prepare us dinner," said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to participate in any kind of conflict.
He was the brother who swam with the electricity.
"With everything that goes wrong in the world, he was this uncut diamond that shined bright every day," he said.
Anyone who has information about the case will be asked to call the SFPD's call number 415-575-4444.
Jennifer Aniston: I'm always stuck in drawers
Jennifer Aniston doesn't always have to be perfect or successful.
The Hollywood star has made this clear in an interview.
"I'm always stuck in drawers or get pasted from outside label, which usually have little to do with me and reality."
"I myself do not wish to always be perfect and successful."
"To be honest, these things are rather clever to me."
Jennifer Aniston (47) can only laugh that she is regarded as "Miss Perfect", as she explains in the current "Cosmopolitan".
The actress prefers to spend her time at home, form TV with easy stuff and Mexican food, says the magazine.
To the white glow, they raise the question of the child's desire: "We women don't have to be married or have children to be perfect," says the Hollywood star.
In her new film "Mother's Day - Love Is Not a Children's Game", Aniston can be seen as a single mother of two sons.
The film runs with us from August 25th.
Golfer Langer receives the sports pyramid
His experiences on the horse are manageable.
At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer, with some colleagues, sought a little variety with a ride on the beach.
For the 58-year-old it was a premiere.
CHIO: "Golden Sport Pyramid" for Bernhard Langer
After a few minutes the horses remembered their celebration evening, they chased home the food troughs in the fast gallop.
One kilometer at this pace, I was scared.
"It wasn't a good experience," says Langer.
And with that, the riding career ended again.
On Saturday, Germany's best golfer of all time - 101 tournament victories - was back in the vicinity of horses.
He was led with his family over the ALRV plant, not even for photo purposes on a horse.
Longer was the first time in Aachen and with it also at the CHIO.
The reason was quite convincing.
The German sports assistant presented the Golden Sport Pyramid to the man from Anhausen as part of a small gala.
Awards are not lacking in the sympathetic athlete.
Federal Medal of Merit, Silbernes Lorberblatt, Champions-Tour-Player of the year...
Even the British Queen has already nobled him.
Longer is the 18th winner of the sports pyramid.
In Aachen he met the first winner Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday.
"This award means a lot to me," says Langer, "because it will be awarded not only for sporting success, but also for social commitment."
For decades, Langer has been promoting young people.
And so he also passed on the price money of 25,000 euros.
With 15 other outstanding athletes, the two-time U.S. champion was admitted to the Hall of Fame of German Sports on Saturday.
Among the outstanding athletes are Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the Turner Eberhard Gienger, the fenders Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Push and Arnd Schmitt, the rower Peter-Michael Kolbe, Bob-Fahrer Meinhard Nehmer, the Judoka Frank Wieneke, the jumping rider Alwin Shockmöhle and posthumous handballer Erhard Wunderlich.
Many of these sports legends had come to Aachen on Saturday.
After the official part, the illustrious society moved to the jumping stadium, where the Lavazza Prize ran.
Bernhard Langer kept a distance from the big animals.
Clintons and Trump's economic policy compared: It's all about the money
Invest in infrastructure and prevent the trade agreement TTP - this is what both Clinton and Trump want.
However, the two US presidential candidates disagree on tax and energy policy and on a fundamental issue.
The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are based on a fundamental, rather philosophical difference.
The one about the role of the state.
Trump wants to keep that in doubt rather small and warns about how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations.
Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate it to death, he says.
He himself would be quite different, says Trump.
It will reduce regulation massively, and it is strongly in favour of a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private individuals and for businesses.
Clinton, on the other hand, says that the state has certain tasks to perform, that it has to open up disadvantaged opportunities and that it needs money to do so.
That is why taxes would be increased for the rich, she says.
Interestingly, both are very close to infrastructure.
Trump and Clinton say almost word-to-word.
The democratic candidate announces the biggest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.
State investment programmes in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the Republican State-Critical Tea Party wing.
Trump could thus have internal discussions.
The differences in energy and climate policy are more pronounced.
Trump wants to build coal-fired power stations and re-establish coal production in the USA.
Oil promotion should also be possible in previously protected areas, and he wants to terminate the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.
Clinton, on the other hand, explicitly wants to expand the renewable energies with its investment programme and demands: "A country will become the superpower of clean energies and create millions of jobs."
"It will be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be us."
But not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far apart.
TPP, the Trans-Pacific Trade Agreement, does not want to sign.
At the same time, however, they do not want to isolate the US from international trade - but simply protect American jobs better.
They're supposed to be better paid, for example, requires Clinton.
The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a hunger wage.
She wants to raise him to $15 an hour.
What Trump wants to do on this issue is not quite clear: once he says: The minimum wage must be raised, then he says he must not be changed.
However, the major debate in the coming months is likely to be more about the tax policy of the two camps.
Trump, on the one hand, wants to relieve the economy and the public to boost growth.
His critics argue that the budget deficit would be even greater.
On the other hand, Clinton, who at least wants to ask the rich to pay more taxes, says their critics: More taxes are not the solution either.
Escape: "Every fledgling woman has experiences of sexual violence"
Sexual violence belongs to women who flee alone, almost to their everyday lives.
When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized.
A house offers refuge.
Four women sit in a large kitchen.
Everyone has a baby with them, which is no more than a year old.
One of them put her little son in the arm.
He looks curiously into the room with big eyes.
His mother stares at the tabletop.
Until she realizes she's being watched.
She smiles briefly and kisses the little one.
The scene seems normal.
Until you talk to Katrin Bahr.
She is Head of Department of Condrobs, a social assistance provider in Bavaria, and deals with the topic of women on the run.
The four women in the kitchen are refugees.
They live in the north of Munich in one of the few decentralised accommodations for all refugees and their children in Bavaria.
In January, Condrobs opened the facility together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women's Aid.
Recently it was officially opened.
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.
There are no men - nor as visitors.
The exception is a guard at the door.
"It is not exaggerated to say that every woman who arrives here has had experiences with sexual violence on her escape," says Bahr.
"Men flee because of wars because they are politically persecuted because they are threatened with torture or death or because their families send them to Europe as a bearer of hope," she says.
In women, other reasons for escape prevail: "Many steal from it secretly because they see no other way out."
In their home country, they have experienced sexual violence, coercion, murder of honour, slavery or forced prostitution.
That's what keeps her going.
On the run, this goes on.
"For example, that towers demand sexual action for a bottle of water is not a rarity," says Bahr.
And the women are alone, they are not protected by their families.
Who believes that as soon as they arrive in Germany, this will end, tells Bahr.
Here, too, single women in refugee accommodation would often be regarded as inferior and, in the worst case, abused.
As a result, about 90 percent of the women living in the apartment in the north of Munich are traumatized, she estimates.
"Some of the children have certainly not been created voluntarily".
Many women are so used to saying nothing.
"Or they don't trust to talk openly about the experienced because the shame is too great."
Since they often do not know how to help, Bahr demands more accommodation for them.
In Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees.
The question of whether they knew about a similar project in their area of competence as in Munich is answered by some with no.
In the Upper Palatinate and Upper Franconia, for example, there is no such thing in government accommodation.
Even in Schwaben, refugees alone are not accommodated separately," says Karl-Heinz Meyer, government press spokesperson.
In Upper Bavaria, Lower and Middle Franconia there are on some common accommodation floors or private houses only for single women and their children.
The exception is Niederbayern, where there are two central accommodations exclusively for women.
The Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality in the European Parliament also calls for women to be accommodated separately from men.
In a study published for the Committee, it says: "It is very important that men and women are accommodated separately."
"If there is a lack of privacy, or if men and women are accommodated together, violence against women can be continued."
In particular, the washrooms should be separate and easily accessible to women.
How much the women feel about this need for protection can be read on the Andrang, which there is on the house in Munich.
"Since we talked about it, we have a long waiting list," says Bahr.
You could easily open a second house.
Strike assistant doctors: Demands for new work-fighting measures
Deputys of the Assistant Physicians have called on their trade union to approve new work-fighting measures in their disputes over a new contract.
The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has asked the entire Council to approve more work-related measures from the beginning of September.
The JDC said that it had failed ministers to address the concerns about the Treaty.
Assistant doctors and medical students voted in July on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BMA.
It was rejected by 58% of its members who voted in the elections.
In a letter to the members, which was published on Twitter on Thursday evening, the chairman of JDC Ellen McCourt said that the government had remained "persistently calm" to problems, which led to the rejection of the treaty.
She said: "In view of this, the JDC Executive Board has voted to reject the proposed new contract completely and to request official renegotiations to all your concerns."
In response to the silence of the government, the JDC Executive Board today made a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve an ongoing programme of escalating work-related measures, which begins at the beginning of September.
The dispute led to a six-time strike by assistant doctors this year, the first total failure in the history of the NHS.
The head of the BMA Assistant Doctor Dr. Johann Malawi resigned after the election to reject the agreed contractual terms recommended by the BMA.
He informed BMA members during the meetings, which were held before the vote by 54,000 assistant doctors and medical students, that the contract was to be beneficial and accepted.
After the vote, health minister Jeremy Hunt said that the contract for doctors would be imposed in England.
Russia and Turkey: An alliance of outsiders?
It was a gesture that ended a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to hand over and announce an official end to the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish opponent in the golden hall of the St. Petersburg Palace, I cannot resist the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most.
There was the handshake, yes.
But Putin's smile seemed small and he hardly radiated heat, even for his restraining conditions.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his "loving friend" Putin - according to a report a whole five times.
I couldn't count it anymore.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but will even improve.
The next day a newspaper described that Erdogan had behaved as if nothing bad had ever happened.
His enthusiasm seemed more to me to be the opposite.
But a climate of sustainable coolness from Putin showed that Russia's head of state had forgotten nothing.
Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduction words: the shooting of a Russian fighter aircraft at the Syrian border through Turkey.
Moscow's reaction at the time was furious.
Putin handed out and accused Ankara of falling in the back of Russia.
The offense was even greater, as it was committed by a supposed friend.
Rebuilding the Vetrauen will be difficult, if not impossible.
Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.
For months the state-controlled media carried out a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara.
Suddenly, it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything.
The most serious accusations of senior officials were that Erdogan's own family would have benefited from the illegal oil trade in Syria's areas controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He has disputed this vehemently.
But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.
Finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received the apology he wanted to hear from President Erdogan.
Russia was able to win some kind of victory.
For Ankara, the advantages of a ceasefire are clear.
Erdogan primarily needs all the friends he can get after he was almost fired from his office last month in a failed coup d'état.
Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.
But there are also economic motives.
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - in particular the ban on charter flights, which usually brings several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.
The number has fallen by almost 90%.
In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when the flights are resumed.
They count on a late-season storm on the Mediterranean Sea.
This week, state television forecast cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again.
A report in Vedemosti put it this way: "Tourists there long, tomatoes here long."
But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry on the West as it sees its reaction to the attempted takeover of power as a weak answer.
In addition, there is the continuing resentment about the speed of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is keen to take advantage of the cool mood and reduce Turkey's relationship with the West.
The Russian head of state in Ankara certainly won a bonus for calling for support for the elected state agencies after the attempted coup.
This is a matter of course for Moscow, which itself has a deep fear of regime change.
The summit in this brilliant palace on the sea enabled Russia and Turkey, as an analyst once described, to represent "the alliance of outsiders": two countries that are in breach of the West and feel ill-treated and now ally.
Nevertheless, despite public reconciliation, there are still major differences between the two.
The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently played the role of peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.
It could be significant that after almost three hours of first talks, both presidents said at the press conference that they had not even stripped the subject.
The President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences, while Putin decided to stress them.
There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.
But after months of open hostilities - and given the potential for a complete disaster when NATO member Turkey shot down the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two Heads of State at least talk to each other again.
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside Scotland no longer available
According to the CEO of the Bank, the RBS brand should only be reduced to a back office roll.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan informed BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank's global ambitions.
The bank has since distanced itself when it almost collapsed and had to be saved eight years ago.
At this time, brand strategists have used RBS to protect other end-user financial brands.
She supported international sports with millions of pounds of sponsorship, from Six Nations Rugby to Wimbledon winner Andy Murray.
But now she has decided to focus more national brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland, but will not be initialized.
In England and Wales, all RSB references, the decentralised headquarters and the stock exchange listing will be changed to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller brands for the retail business that will gain more importance - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a tour by customers and employees in Inverness-shire.
He told BBC Scotland: "The brand RSB will become our investor brand and the brand under which our employees will be employed, as we will now become more a bank of brands."
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became the global brand.
I am now saying that we are not pursuing global goals but local goals.
Each of these brands will stand for something completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with the customers under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will no longer continue its Six Nations sponsorship and that it will increase the visibility of the various brands in its sports sponsorship.
"It's time for us to develop into the bank of the brands, because how do we focus on the inside (we asked) to make this a better bank for customers?" said the CEO.
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and would have launched these brands.
But with our work, the focus on customer needs and not our own, I think you will see many changes.
We can relaunch these brands, so I think the time has come.
Frankie Dettori achieves its 3,000th prize at Newmarket on Prediction
Dettori sprays champagne after a double at Newmarket that brings him 3,000th prize
The Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th British win on Friday at Newmarket.
He set a milestone on his local race track with his second win of the night on Preference, which is trained by John Gosden.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach the milestone in the flat race.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddry and Willie Carson.
The three-time winner Dettori, who won before on Ghayyar, said, "It's something special."
I'm very emotional because my family is here too
I'm very happy that it happened at Newmarket because I landed here 30 years ago.
It's not a big meeting, it's not Royal Ascot - it's a banal Friday night with 20,000 people.
I'm relieved and very modest.
Dettori takes the cheer when he takes the victory on Prediction
Two jockeys have reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jockey Richard Johnson and the retired 20-time winner Sir Anthony McCoy, who achieved more than 4,300 wins in a record-breaking career.
Lester Piggott, the nine-time Derby winner had 4,493 career victories
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of modernity and it's no surprise that he has reached this milestone that only a few have reached before him.
He has style and is strong, but it is his tactical intellect that distinguishes him from the others in the weight control room.
He is a fantastic ambassador for racing, his enthusiasm and charisma has been inspiring fans for this sport for years.
I told Frankie at Epsom a few weeks ago that he had already won 6,000 if he wasn't just a weekend and big tournament jockey!
Frankie has been riding winners in GB for almost 30 years, which is great.
He has a living personality, which is good for a British race, but beyond that he is an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dismount
From Flying Finishes to Flying Dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the flagship of the British flat race for two decades.
It was nerve-enhancing.
A whole series of major tournament wins, including his famous "Glory Seven" in 1996 in Ascot, but he also survived an airplane crash and received a drug ban.
Three years ago he had trouble when he returned from his six-month banishment, but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to defy his doubters and return to his best form.
And he's not at the end for a long time - Dettori once said that he wants to continue in competitions until his 50th birthday.
Russian Putin fires Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly released his chief of staff Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov was part of Putin's closest circle of trust for many years.
The 63-year-old was appointed Special Representative for Environment and Transport.
In a Kremlin's opinion, Putin "ordered Ivanov's resignation from his duties as Chairman of the Russian Bureau without giving reasons".
Anton Vaino, who has been Ivanov's deputy since 2012, was appointed his successor.
Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in 1972 in the Estonian capital Tallinn, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Embassy in Tokyo.
On the Kremlin's website (in Russian) it is said that he was later Head of Protocol and Head of Staff of Government Staff.
Regarding his appointment, he said to Putin, "Thank you for your trust."
I think it is the most important task of the government to support your work as Head of State in terms of draft laws and controls to implement your instructions.
Putin informed the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his post and had recommended Vaino as his successor.
Convince the smiling faces?
This step has made Moscow mysterious.
Sergei Ivanov was for a long time one of the closest trusted Vladimir Putins and works as he does for the Soviet secret service, the KGB.
As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, who was broadcast on television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff resigned at his own request.
But despite the smile for the cameras, here are only a few convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
So is there a kind of power struggle going on here?
Nobody knows that at the moment.
But the official assertion - that a man who was once praised as a potential president wants to lead Russian environmental policy at once - was a great sceptic.
In his comments to Putin, quoted on the Kremlin website, Ivanov said "It is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 to entrust me with this very complicated post - one might say almost - difficult post for four years.
As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian Bureau for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took up the post in December 2011.
Previously, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, a former member of the KGB State Security Service.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was Chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov as one of the five people he trusted most.
Once it was assumed that Ivanov could become president of Russia after Putin's second term, as a third term of office of Putin would have violated the Constitution.
But this post was taken by another, close ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became Prime Minister before he became President again three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds Star Thomas Gibson fired after he beat producers
Gibson was involved in a physical dispute last month in the series set in Los Angeles.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce the series, announced their termination in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized publicly on Thursday before the announcement of his resignation.
On the set, there were artistic differences and disagreements.
I regret the incident," he said in a communication.
Details of how Gibson's character is released from the series following a team of FBI agents are expected to be released at a later date, according to the statement of ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
The 54-year-old, who previously played in the Sitcom Dharma & Greg, has been present since the first season of the series in 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds and have spent the last twelve years in my whole heart's blood," said Gibson in a message published on Friday.
I had hoped to be there by the end, but that will no longer be possible.
I would just like to thank the authors, producers, actors, our wonderful crew and above all the best fans you can only wish for a series.
The planned release of the twelfth season is scheduled for 28 September.
Puzzles about fish landing in the garden in Banff
A Banff resident called for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain thinks that the 75 fish could be sandals spewed out by a fountain.
Mr. Bain, who lives about 500 meters from the sea, published a video on Periscope of the Spectacle in the hope that someone might shed some light on the appearance of the two-inch long fish.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connected to Fife
The £1.35 billion project will be completed by May 2017
Engineers have connected the north deck of Queensferry Crossing to the viaduct - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.
It is the first of four locks of the "deck blowers", which are approaching completion around each of the three towers of the bridge.
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 ropes.
The £1.35 billion project will be completed by May 2017.
Minister of Economy Keith Brown made a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge.
He said, "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of Queensferry Crossing.
We are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic measure in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the lock between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity that requires extremely precise tolerances for the fit.
In total, almost 79% of the entire bridge decks are in their place and the last section of the deck today in Rosyth gets a concrete for the deck, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place.
Michael Martin, project manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said: "The first closure is a significant milestone in every bridge project.
With this fantastic project, the closure represents forward-looking construction and civil engineering.
After the installation of the last section of the road deck and its connection with the north tower deck under construction, we had to close the remaining gap on the north or the country side.
This was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters south.
This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.
Massive, because the Viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled up at a slope of about 3%.
Heikel, because the tolerances the team is working on were tiny - on each side they were only a few millimeters.
Fortunately, everything went very well.
Rescue in Moelfre Bay: Three men have "Happy to be alive"
Three men still have "luck to be alive" after being thrown by their fishing boat before Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station hit the alarm on Friday at 13:20 BST after a crew observed the event in Moelfre Bay.
The three men had difficulty swimming in safety while their boat moved on from its own strength.
"We saw how the boat turned around in its vicinity and imagined the worst," said the head of the rescue station of Moelfre Vince Jones.
"Unfortunately, the strong winds have already weighed the boat beyond its reach until we let it go to water," he added.
Two of the men were rescued by a local fishing boat, while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and found hanging on a buoy without a life jacket.
They all came aboard the coastal rescue boat and were taken back to the rescue station.
Mr. Jones said, "The three men who were thrown into the water have been unharmed and still alive.
Although the boat engine had an emergency stopline, it got rid of the person who was driving the boat when the boat was nodded.
Someone's been watching over these men today.
Severely injured - man sticks to his ex-girlfriend
A man attacked his ex-girlfriend in Hamburg-Harburg with a knife and severely injured.
As the police reported yesterday, the 50-year-old had got the key to the apartment to get his personal things.
Instead, the alcoholics cut his ex-girlfriend's clothes.
When this one came into the apartment, he stabbed her twice.
The 44-year-old was injured by the hand and the body.
The police were able to arrest the perpetrator.
While the 50-year-old destroyed his ex-girlfriend's clothes, he called his mother.
This alarmed his sister.
Together with her partner, the 45-year-old wanted to calm her brother.
But she couldn't move him to leave the apartment.
That's why she left the house with her partner.
They met the man's ex-husband on the street.
When the two women entered the apartment again, the 50-year-old pushed his sister aside and attacked his ex-girlfriend.
Who builds Braunschweig's cheap apartments?
The SPD and the Greens believe that investors will be much more committed in the future.
How do you respond to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1,300 cheap apartments in the next few years?
At the next Council meeting, the SPD proposes a "housing" approach.
But dispute is programmed.
First of all, the question is: who should actually build the cheap apartments?
So far, there has been no regulation.
SPD chairman Christoph Bratmann says: "We agree with the Greens: If you want to build on urban areas, 20 percent of all apartments will have to be designated as social housing in the future."
However, the cheap apartments can also be created in the stock.
The big issue in the town hall, however, is, says Bratmann: "How do you deal with investors who want to build on private areas?"
"We want investors to build at least 10 percent of their homes on such areas, but as much as possible as 20 percent of their homes as social homes."
A new urban housing funding programme, which will cost millions and still needs to be financed, will provide incentives.
The problem, says Bratmann: "There is currently no agreement between the political groups."
The CDU wants investors to make as few regulations as possible.
The left wants tougher conditions for investors.
Despite this, says Bratmann, the situation on the housing market is exacerbating.
If the action concept is implemented, it will provide additional tasks in the construction management.
More staff is needed.
It's not clear if we'll get the specialists.
However, the programme is not yet complete: for the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway.
How, though, does it equal the loss of another 1,300 cheap homes, the promotion of which will expire in the next few years?
By 2020 alone, it will be 500 apartments.
In order to prevent this, according to planning spokesperson Nicole Palm, now expiring ties should be purchased from the city.
In addition, consideration should be given to bringing apartments back to the price fixing.
That's possible in the West Town.
The problem could be solved at once.
Because in the West City, the end of the year expires.
Around 1800 apartments could be brought back to the price fixing for cheap apartments.
Only: The owners don't want the housing companies.
Because the number of social housing in the West Town is once again drastically increased, one is away from the goal of so-called mixing.
There should be no more concentration of social weaknesses in only a few districts.
The Greens expect that there will still be movement in the discussion.
Group chairman Holger Herlitschke says: "For a large majority, the CDU must join the boat."
Although they have concentrated on more construction sites for single-family houses.
What does not mean, however, that a compromise cannot be found.
Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that is worth it
It is fascinating to see how the world is changing.
The fact that teenagers and children don't go out to play anymore, but rather prefer to spend their leisure time staring at screens, has been lamented by many in the last decade.
At Pokemon Go, it's about getting people off the couch and getting more active.
The time on the screen was initially limited to TV, then to video games and finally to smartphones.
Therefore, it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive.
I refer, of course, to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters originally created for the video games in the 1990s (later a series of cartoons, playing cards and other spin-offs were created).
How many phenomena of pop culture decreased interest before the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July.
The market launch in other countries has been postponed by the massive demand that overburdened the servers.
Within a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
How does it work?
In short, the players with their smartphones go outside and search for Pokémons, which are tracked with a GPS and, once they have been found, can be "photographed" (via a screenshot on the phone) or "captured".
A generation who played the game when she was younger joined the madness and jumped for the search of the sofa.
In the U.S., the game led to a significant increase in the number of steps taken by the "average" person every day.
Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch that tracked 35,000 users, recently announced to the Washington Post that within two days of the market launch of the game, the number of tracked people who train 30 minutes each day jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company does not know who is playing Pokémon Go - it only sees the raw data to increase performance.
Many public health education campaigns that people want to "take 30 minutes," "come from the sofa" and "be active every day" came across deaf ears because many public messages are boring to health and come from people who look miserable.
Nevertheless, the importance of sport cannot be over-estimated.
Those who regularly exercise reduce their chances of suffering from cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to list here.
But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it makes people do something outdoors that they enjoy.
Thus, three pillars of health are covered - exercise, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.
Some people even close new friendships on the hunt.
As always, there are grumpy degenerators who always have to complain about something.
And yes, someone could walk against a door.
What's up?
There's been a breakthrough.
Even though smartphone apps like Fitbit were able to track our activity in the past, they gave us no reason to play sports as this game does.
The new will lose its appeal and use will cease over time.
However, due to Pokemon's success, there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with the real world's activeness, helping many people to be more active, fitter and healthier.

Simone Biles creates gold in the women's tournament
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is immune to all this.
Dynamic on the jump horse.
Don't worry about it on the bar.
Breathing on the ground.
Brilliant on the whole line.
And now, finally, Olympic champion.
On Thursday, the 19-year-old American gymnast climbed to the multi-combat title and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games.
Their overall result of 62,198 was clearly ahead of the silver medal winner and "Final Five" teammate Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medal winner Aliya Mustafina.
The Americans Simone Biles will play on the glide beam during the women's single more battle finals at the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday.
Biles is the fourth heterosexual American who wins a multi-fight title and a total of the fifth, as she strengthens her reputation as the best of her generation or even even even at all.
She broke out in tears when her final result was shown and her long journey ended at this moment.
This success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who have brought their sports to new heights:
For the last three years, Biles has dominated her sport, winning 15 world champion medals - including 10 gold medals - with such amazing exercises that include a mix of ambition and precision that the 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Redton said she is "the best tournament I have ever seen."
She expected a final test in Brazil, a competition that did not go so much between Bile and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a burden of oversized expectations.
Not with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, Texas, would be regarded as disappointment.
The Americans Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman embrace each other after winning gold and silver in the single multi-game finals of women at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday
Biles won the first medal on Tuesday, while serving as an exclamation mark at the farewell celebration of the retired team coordinator Martha Karolyi.
Although Biles insisted on never having planned the future during their long journey to the top, this is not really true.
Part of her ground exercises - which include her typical Tumbling Pass - is tuned to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic Arena in Rio.
It's not a coincidence.
This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a young child and discovered by Trainer Aimee Boorman's mother during a school trip to the gym, in which Boorman trained, became a force.
She has not lost any more competition since the summer of 2013, a series of victories that will last as long as Biles wishes.
Even though Mustafina led easily through two rotations, the image was tarnished.
Soaring beams and ground tournaments - in which Biles holds the world championship title - were lurking.
She picked up again with 15,433 on the suspended beam - and put one more on the ground with a 15,933 on it.
Raisman gently hugged her as she expected her end - a pure formality - and tears flowed upon Bile's shiny red, white and blue eyeliners, when the vision she once described in her collection book became a reality.
Raisman's performance was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for third place, but the bronze medal went to Mustafina in a tiebrake.
This time the 22-year-old team captain, called "Grandma" by the Americans, had a lead.
After her ground practice, she threw kiss hands at the audience, overwhelmed by a comeback that sometimes appeared doubtful.
As far as Biles is concerned, the rapidly spreading tweet of the 19-year-olds from the beginning of this week has a whole new meaning:
Police: 3 victims in serial murder shot while listening to music in the car
According to police reports published on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot, killed in one of the most deadly attacks in Phoenix's first serial murder since a decade, while talking in the car and listening to music.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Elli's daughter Maleah were shot on June 12, while the car was parked in a driveway, the authorities said.
The perpetrator fired eight shots from a hand firearm while standing on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle, is to be read in the report.
The police reported that the triple murder did not appear to have been the result of a robbery, since the attacker did not carry the handbags or the $2,900, which were owned by one of the adult victims.
The police spokesperson of Phoenix Sgt. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting led the investigators to take a closer look at whether it is linked to four previous attacks.
In total, seven people were killed in nine attacks and two more injured in hispanic residential areas within four months.
"It happens in a residential area in front of a house," said Howard of the KHPO, a CBS subsidiary, at the beginning of the month.
It is assumed that the suspect used several vehicles, including a brown niche from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to disclose the evidence which led them to conclude that the attacks were linked and committed by the same murderer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized for her injuries and later died.
Liner, 31, and Elli's daughter Maleah died on the scene.
One Witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
The authorities also published a police report on the shooting, which aimed at an empty pickup truck half an hour before the triple murder and is assumed to be the work of the serial killer.
Investigators found cartridge sleeves and secured a ball from the seat as well as bullet fragments from the engine compartment.
Mother of a 6-year-old with microcephaly: "It's getting better"
Like most 6-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But like the least of his peers, Edmund Mikrozephalie, the result of a genetic disorder about which his mother Elizabeth Picciuto knew nothing during her pregnancy.
When he first came home, my first thought was, I can't.
I can't do this.
I didn't get involved.
What's not right at all -- of course you've let yourself in on it," she said.
Her husband Vincent and her were told that Edmund may never be able to recognize her and that he may not even survive.
Some doctors even went so far as to suggest institutionalizing him.
"My first answer was 'I didn't know people were still doing'," said Picciuto.
Edmund can walk with a walking aid.
Edmund couldn't sit or scratch until his third year of life and he still can't talk.
But he's making progress slowly.
He can walk with support and cycle.
He also loves to play and sing with his two brothers.
Elizabeth shows the sign language that Edmund invented for "Please sing something in front of me."
"We teach him sign language," said Picciuto CBS News.
But it's not a typical sign language -- she says. Edmund invented some signs alone.
Microcephaly has a variety of causes: genetics such as Edmund and infections with viruses such as measles or the Zikavirus during pregnancy.
Symptoms and predictions can vary greatly.
It is still too early to say how it will affect the life of those infected with the Zikavirus.
Picciuto recalls the emotional price of an uncertain future.
I kept asking, what's going to happen?
What's going to happen?
And she still doesn't really know.
I haven't asked for the prognosis in a long time because I don't expect anyone to really tell me.
But Picciuto has a hopeful advice for mothers of infants with birth defects caused by the Zika virus.
It's getting better.
You know it'll be better for you.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy rainfalls, floods give rise to rescues in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rainfalls and large-scale floods in Louisiana forced the governor to call the emergency on Friday. It is expected to rain more over the whole Saturday.
Numerous rivers in southeastern Louisianas and the south of Mississippi flooded their banks and threatened with large flooding after extreme rainfall, reported the National Weather Service.
The Governor of Louisiana John Bel Edwards announced that state officials are in constant contact with the local authorities and are already on the move to assist the communities concerned.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Governor's Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, announced that requests for flood vehicles, boats and sandbags increased.
Steele said that the municipality of Tangipahoa alone had requested ten thousand sandbags.
A flood warning system is used for large parts in the south of Louisiana until Saturday.
The weather service indicated that there could be an additional 3 to 5 inches of rain in this area.
In the south of Alabama, a flood warning system was used on Friday, while it continued to rain in the Mobile area.
The river Comite near Baton Rouges and the river Amite near Denham Springs, both located in Louisiana, are likely to reach record levels after the weekend.
Metereologist Alek Krautmann says that both rivers could flood many houses in the suburbs near Baton Rouge.
He also said that a downstream flood in Ascension Parish is a danger, as these will flow slowly into Lake Maurepas via the trodden rivers.
The Tickfaw River, south of the Mississippi State Border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest level ever recorded on Friday at 09.00.
Rescue teams were still picking up people from the floodwaters in the districts of Amite and Wilkinson in southwest Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepfather were among those who were rescued near Gloster on Friday.
Hansford, 62, says that water from Beaver Creek, which is usually more than 400 feet away from his house, rose sharply overnight.
He said that another stepson who lives nearby had warned him.
"We woke up and the water flowed and flowed in," said Hansford.
It reached my waist.
His wife told Hansford that she had never seen such a height of the river in the 48 years she lived there.
Hansford said that he and his family members had all the disabilities and he was the only one who could swim.
Hansford said that emergency workers had rescued all three in a large military truck and had taken them to the next fire station in Gloster, where they were accommodated until Friday.
Krautmann said that the flood had "swiftly spread" as there were still severe rainfalls and that the authorities were reluctant to consider evacuation instructions.
According to Krautmann, an observer near Livingstone reported from midnight to Friday morning from 13.75 inches of rain.
Krautmann said that the soil has been largely covered by rain since Wednesday.
The authorities indicated that heavy rains and floods caused the rescue of residents from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and failure to teach in five school districts.
The CBS subsidiary WWL reported that an associate in Tangipahoa reported 200 flooded houses.
The inhabitants were evacuated in two churches, which were now both flooded.
The president of the municipality of Robby Miller said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven pets who were washed up by the flood.
In the cities of Amite and Hammond emergency accommodation was set up to accommodate the evacuated.
"As soon as the water starts to go back, they will be able to go back to their homes," he said.
In the city of Hammond of the municipality of Tangipahoa almost two dozen streets were closed due to the flood and sandbags were provided for the residents to take along, who hope to keep the water from their homes and shops.
"The last major flood we had was in March," said Lacy Landrum from the city administration.
This seems to be a similar incident.
In Mississippi, emergency manager Rupert Lacy of Harrison County said that it continued to rain on the Gulf Coast.
According to his information, a handful of houses were reported as flooded on Thursday, but no one has been reported yet on Friday.
Keith Townson, manager at Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has been living in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places where I've never seen it before," said Townson, "and it's still coming."
Mahaj Brown, 6, "cut by bullets", survives shooting in Philadelphia
The police report that the 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia this week already the second time that a 6-year-old child is shot.
The boy's grandparents identified him for CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown.
The grandparents reported that Brown suffered several gunshot injuries, including in the loin, leg, arm and abdomen, but that he was conscious of his transport to the hospital.
"He has gone through a lot, his little body has been pierced by bullets," his grandmother Delores Melendez told the transmitter.
I just can't believe it.
The boy's condition was classified as critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations.
The boy's family told the transmitter that he was expected to recover.
He should have started the first class in a local primary school.
Brown was one of four people who were shot in Germantown.
Three men were also shot: two at the age of 29 and one at the age of 32.
One of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition; the other two victims are in stable condition according to CBS Philadelphia.
The boy was found shot on the front seat of a car along with the 29-year-old, who is in critical condition, reports the sender.
The other two victims were not in the car and the police were just investigating whether one of the injured men could be among the perpetrators.
Investigators informed CBS Philadelphia that there appeared to have been a crossfire between several shooters.
Tank casings for storm rifles that were traced back to various storm rifles overlooked the scene of the crime.
It seems that this was clearly a continuing struggle.
On the street, on both sides of the walkway, there were Hülsen.
So there seem to have been several armed fighters here who were very actively involved," police chief Anthony Ginaldi told the Philadelphia police.
Several houses and vehicles were also hit in the area.
There were no arrests and the police are currently reviewing reports that the surveillance video.
On Tuesday another six-year-old girl was hit by a crossblow on her arm when she played in front of her house in the residential area of the West Oak Lane.
She's recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That is what I imagine in the women's Olympics in the tournament for more than one reason.
First of all, I have been present at every summer Olympic since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant.
And second, this team has three gymnasiums, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, which inspired many young girls of different skin color.
The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, who is Jewish and Madison Kocian, who is Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This team finally reflects the United States.
It has strengthened the black and hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.
In the last four years, the number one female gymnast was an African-American.
Last year Simone and Gabby were #1 and #2.
That shows strength.
During the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner, and America rejoiced.
Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of three world champions Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they provided unexpected but masterful gymnastics routines.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth, heterosexual American who won gold at an individual multi-game event for women.
Team member Aly Raisman won silver.
We experience the tip of this sport, but that's not how gym class looks all over the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all took the same path as Aly and Madison to make it into the Olympic team.
They are the "Last Five" because the next Olympic team will only have four tournament women in the team. Moreover, this is the last year with Marta Karolii as a coach.
But the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport and gymnastics is primarily in private gymnastics clubs, which are maintained by parents who pay for the training, furnishing, travel, clothing, competition and hotel costs (for the trainers and their gymnastics and families).
The majority of these tournaments are located in wealthy suburbs that can support the business.
In these clubs, the tournaments receive their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment for the families.
Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, have both trained their athletes since they started the tournament.
We must enable the communities of countless young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie to exercise more easily and easily.
I founded my 20-year gymnastics foundation.
At my events we offered free and affordable tournaments in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youths (especially black and Hispanic) and trained national and international winners.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer young people high-quality tournaments that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Turns develop strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.
This combination offers lifelong benefits for health as well as for school and professional success.
It's the inspiration of this team that makes thousands of young girls interested in the tournament and that's great.
It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.
This is such an exciting time.
Thanks to Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this true representation of "Girl Power" by getting the Olympic team gold and thank you for taking so many young girls with different backgrounds motivated to start their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
Assistant doctors want to organize more strikes after they have rejected Jeremy Hunt's proposal
The ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting a reformed treaty with the British Medical Association officials, but 58 percent of the 37,000 assistant doctors who voted in a vote rejected him.
In July, Hunt had revealed plans to force the treaty into being and said that the NHS was located in a "nobody country" and any further delay would be harmful to the employees and patients.
The first assistant doctors are expected to receive a new contract containing changes to night and weekend work to improve care at the end of the week.
Dr. Ellen McCourt, Chairman of the BMA Committee for Assistant Physicians, said in a communication last night: "Assistent doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed Treaty, in particular that it will heat the current personnel crisis and neglect to treat all doctors properly."
Only eight weeks remain until the first group of doctors are covered by the new Treaty, and progress has to be made and the time has run out.
Efforts on the part of the BMA to resolve disputes by means of talks have met with opposition from the government and sometimes with deafening silence.
This was the promise Jeremy Hunt made only last month that his door would always be open.
"Jeremy Hunt must act now, lift the compulsion and address the concerns of the assistant doctors."
If he does not do so, the assistant doctors have made it clear that they are ready to carry out further fights.
The last strike at the end of April saw a postponement of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments, as nurses and specialists were involved to provide coverage for doctors on the strike post chain.
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting the reformed Treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association.
The BMA wants a better weekly salary for the 54,000 assistant doctors who will be subject to the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, Director General of the NHS staff, called on the assistant doctors to stop the strike.
Mortimer said, "Work struggles do not reach anything but little, but burden already overburdened teams and service providers and only cause worries, distress and interruption to the patients, nurses and their families."
In the last two months, we have spoken to the Committee of Assistant Physicians and responded positively to the concerns expressed by the Ministry of Health and other ministries regarding the protection and whistleblowing.
Employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important issues - such as posting, flexibility in training, additional training for those returning from a professional outing, training centres, mutual recognition of the curriculum, training leave and the gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of the seriousness of the employers, health education England and the Ministry of Health regarding compliance with the agreements with the BMA in November, February and May.
The £2-per-day medication that can reduce the risk of heart attack
Thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from one £2-per-day medication after the authorities have recommended that more people be given it for a longer period of time.
The anticoagulant medicine ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease.
The medicine is given for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a stroke or another heart attack.
The NICE Regulatory Authority has recommended a four-year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
The NICE Regulatory Authority has recommended a four-year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
About 140,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer another heart attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulations of fatty materials in the artery walls that form coverings.
If the coating breaks apart, it can cause a clot of blood that clots the blood flow to the heart, causing a heart attack.
If the blood clot dissolves, it can flow through the bloodstream and clot the blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have had a heart attack are at higher risk of having another.
Ticagrelor, produced by the British company AstraZeneca and distributed under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots more unlikely.
The NICE guide, published today, recommends a 12-month dose of 90mg Ticagrelor, followed by 60mg with a twice daily intake of aspirin for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Evaluation Centre, said: "Despite the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of all persons who have suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with disastrous consequences."
The fear of a second heart attack can have a significant negative impact on the quality of life of a person.
Experience shows that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
Through a preliminary recommendation from Ticagrelor, we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from them.
The information on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor, especially the risk of bleeding, is limited to a period of up to three years.
Culture of Political Correctness Makes Electoral Fraud Blossom in Muslim Areas
The former mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year on the occasion of a government report on corruption
A culture of political correctness has led to widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities being deliberately ignored as a destructive government report today revealed.
The former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles verbally attacks the police, electoral observers and town halls for ignoring evidence of electoral abuse due to "hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion".
The former Minister for Integration and Local Government, who is now an anti-corruption king, said that the intimidation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set up barrier bands outside of electoral booths to protect intimidated voters.
He recommends that voters carry a card to prove their identity in elections.
At present, a voter only has to name his name and address.
The report proposes to apply non-removable ink to a person's finger when they cast their vote to prevent someone from choosing twice.
Whistleblower should get more protection, says Sir Eric.
It calls for the press to have more access to municipal documents and decisions of non-official committees or working groups.
"This not only serves against electoral fraud, but is also intended to protect the municipal government from the wider culture of corruption and financial fraud associated with it," he said.
The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of the Tower Hamlet election scandal in eastern London.
Last year, a special election court decided that the current mayor Lutfur Rahman should be removed from his office after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices.
The court found that Rahman had perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community "in a cynical way" and that he had silenced his critics with racist and Islamophobia accusations.
Rahman is said to have "led his campaign on the basis that it was the religious duty of Muslims to elect him."
Up to 300 votes were either doubtful or the result of an imitation in which a person chooses as someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud all over the country.
He was particularly alarming about the fraudulent letter election - among the older members of the Muslim community had pressured people to choose a candidate of their choice.
Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clear the electoral system, including the conduct of ID cards to prove the identity
His report states: "It has been demonstrated that pressure has been exerted on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, to choose according to the will of the elderly, especially communities with Pakistani or Bangladeshi background.
"There were concerns that... state institutions would have deliberately ignored such behaviour due to "politically correct" hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion."
Sir Eric issued 50 recommendations to clean the system, including the ban on political activists working on letter-call documents to stop "choice harvests".
The report under consideration by Theresa May also requires tougher registration checks to prevent the electoral register from being used for immigration and social fraud purposes.
Consider options to ask voters for your identity card before choosing.
Use non-removable ink on a person's finger as soon as she delivers her voice to prevent someone from choosing twice.
carry out systematic checks on the nationality of a person to ensure that they are entitled to vote.
A three-year limitation to requests for an automatic choice of letters.
Prohibited political activists from working on complete letter choices and envelopes of letter elections.
The police have the power to set up lockouts for polling stations.
A legislative amendment that facilitates an accusation of intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983.
Photographer ban in polling stations.
Requirement that only English may be used in the polling stations (with the exception of Wales).
Intensification of training to ensure that employees enforce the rule that voters go to the polling booth alone.
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it "astounding" that after Tower Hamlet's case no criminal charges were made.
"The electoral tribunal has declared Lutfur Rahman and his deputy to be unsuitable for corrupt and illegal practices due to a litany," he said.
He has been convicted for a number of reasons, in accordance with the high standards of criminal law.
He also criticises the ineffective "abscess controls" of the electoral registration departments of the town halls.
Sir Eric said, "The judgment in Tower Hamlets last year was a warning signal.
Our country, as the mother of parliaments, has a proud heritage, but the alarming and covert spread of electoral fraud and denial by some authorities threatens this good reputation.
Crazy after Kate's Radler Double Gambler and other famous double-goers from Olympic athletes in Rio
Fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio have been hit this week by the French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who has proved to be the impressive duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympian is by far not the only gold-fighting athlete who has his own famous double-goer - at least not if you are allowed to believe the social media.
In honor of the Rio Olympic Games and all the famous faces that are currently flickering on our screens, FEMAIL has created a list of Olympics that have more than a certain resemblance to Hollywood celebrities.
The Hunter and the Wolf: Team member of the U.S. team in the bow shooting Brady Ellison, left, is compared with Leonardo DiCaprio since his childhood
Besides Kate's double rider on the bike track, many people on the Internet pointed out how a certain archer might be the twin of A-Promi Leonardo DiCaprio.
The team member of the U.S. team in the Bow Shooting Brady Ellison has caused a storm on Twitter, after pictures he sees of the Wolf of Wall Street Star in a creepy way.
In fact, the archer got the madness into the social media and admitted that he had already heard from his childhood that he looked like Leo.
"I myself see no great resemblance, except for facial hair," said Brady of the Huffington Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I guess I'll take that as a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be even more at the heart of this year: the striking resemblance between British wide jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
The Russian tournament Aliya Mustafina with her large, expressive eyes should be able to go through as a double-goer for the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the swimming pool, the South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared for years with the Glee Star Matthew Morrison.
A gear higher: This user believes that Nathan is the "athletic version" of the Inception actor
Another continuing comparison was made between the tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who has similar heavy eyebrows and lips.
The Russian silver medallion swimmer Yulia Efimova exhibits more than just the sun tanned skin and blonde hair like the actress Annalynne McCord, while the American Nathan Adrian was certified by fans, a "athlete version of Joseph Gordon Levitt".
Strong women: football star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, right, have a similar face shape and eyes
Not the only one: a Twitter user was very happy that others also noticed the similarities
Theory put in space: According to this user there may be a reason for the similarity of the pair
A Twitter user explained her satisfaction that "the rest of the Internet thinks Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are almost identical."
In fact, the American football star Hope Solo and the Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter have an incredibly similar face shape and eyes.
Other popular comparisons included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to that of actress Laura Linney, as well as the gold medalist in the Gabby Douglas tournament, who has her own beautiful, wide smile similar to that of Bring It On Star Gabrielle Union.
CBC commentator for the Olympic Games apologizes for his statement that Chinese swimmer "like a pig has died"
Byron MacDonald's analysis of the fourth place of the 14-year-old Ai Yanhan at Dr. 4x200m free-style swimsuit was outraged by spectators of the CBC live transfer of the Olmypian games on Wednesday
The Canadian broadcaster CBC had to apologize after one of his commentators said that the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "began as Mief" and during the race as "a pig died".
The commentator Byron MacDonalds thought that his microphone was switched off when he gave his own opinions at the end of the 4x200m freestyle rafter.
MacDonald, who had been brought on board the CBS commentator team to give more "color", could be heard saying, "This little 14-year-old Chinese has lost the connection, baby".
Too excited, went off like Mief, died like a pig.
Thanks for that.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the second stage of the 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada's Taylor Ruck, allowing Canadians to unlock the gap to China.
Viewers all over Canada responded quickly online after being shocked by the tone and language
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted, "Did the CBC commentator just say that the 14-year-old swimmer from China "has died like a pig"????
The idiot didn't realize they were still on the air."
Ai Yanhan from China was described at the final 4 x 200m freestyle swim party for women as follows: "This little 14-year-old Chinese has lost the connection, baby."
The criticism of Byron MacDonald on Twitter came quickly and hard, in which many spoke to him
Twitter users did not hold back when they heard how insensitive Byron MacDonald was
Another Twitter user Sarah Paradis wrote: "Wow, #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and make us all look like racists.
A short time later, Scott Russel, who moderated the CBC show, apologized live for MacDonald's comment and said, "We apologize for the comment being broadcast about a swim performance."
It was an unhappyly chosen formulation, we're sorry it happened."
CBC apologized at the end over 90 times to the people who responded to the remark on Twitter
Commentator Scott Russel had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald
CBC copied and added his apology to more than 90 other Twitter users who had complained about MacDonald's comments
The network also apologized quickly and issued a message.
We sincerely regret that these statements have been made and that it has been possible for them to be broadcast.
We quickly apologized to our viewers on the show and to our followers on social media last night.
To clarify one thing, Byron's comments related to the performance of the swimmer and not to her as a person.
Nevertheless, they were inappropriate and an unhappyly chosen formulation. Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized to the show and tried to justify his comment by saying that it was not his intention that it be interpreted as a personal attack.
"I would like to take a moment to apologize for the comment I made after the women's swim party in the CBC Olympics, he said.
"I was referring to the performance of the swimmer and not to her as a person."
Of course, no disrespect was intended and I am very sorry."
Buyers in Primark resents women who try shameless underwear in the middle of business
The buyers did not know where to look when a woman took off her clothes in the middle of a primark to try underpants.
To make the situation worse, she patterned what she looked like in it, pulled it out and put it back into the shelf.
She continued browsing and tried four pairs of underpants in a store at the Bouverie Place Shopping Centre in Folkestone.
The Primark store at the Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone, where the woman tried her underpants before she put them back into the shelf
A mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was in business at the same time, said that after the mysterious woman tried the underwear, "she got dressed again and left the business without buying anything."
She said, "People could not believe what they saw."
Standing in the middle of the sales area, she took a pair of underpants from the layout, took off her own pantyhose and trousers and tried them.
"She didn't even try to find a more discreet place to do it - she just stood there, naughty like Oskar."
"Everyone stared when she took off the underpants that she obviously didn't like, because she put them back on the shelf."
She repeated the same thing with three other underpants before finally deciding that she didn't like anything, got dressed again and went out.
"They didn't seem to bother that she was watching someone - or thinking about the person who might buy the underpants she had tried."
Ms. Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent, said, "How disgusting to think that someone would take underpants home, who had a different person and were not washed."
The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms. Davidson added: "As I got along, the employees tried to pull the clothes out of the sale after she left - which is just as good."
"I would hate to go home with a new pair of underpants and find out that another woman was wearing them and took them off again and they weren't washed."
One speaker from Primark said: "Primark is aware of the incident that took place on Tuesday, August 9 at our branch in Folkstone."
All eligible products have been withdrawn from the sale.
How to Protect Yourself From Arms Attacks with Krav Maga
The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a little safer for you.
We talked to Rhon Mizrachi, a Grand Master of the Krav Maga Association in New York, to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close range.
Regardless of whether you approach from the front or from the back, this video will show you how to turn the spear for your robber.
As you approach from behind, you should turn around first so that you can see your attacker and "get out of the shot line," says Mizrachi.
Then grab the gun between your front arm and your shoulder before you hit him with your free elbow.
Then hit him with your knee in the hand and twist him while the attacker bends against pain, the weapon out of his hands. Hit him with the barrel in the face and move back while they point the gun at him.
In the case of attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot line, grab the weapon and twist it so that the attacker cannot shoot.
At the same time, shift the weight onto the weapon and hit the attacker on the chest, then twist the weapon out of its grip before they move back and aim the weapon at it.
Sounds difficult?
Look at the video to see exactly what it's like for Mizrachi.
But remember, it is safest in a robbery to hand over your money - if you are not a major Krav Maga champion.
Traveler Ian Wright creates his tongue for a guide in the dirtiest places in Europe
A British traveler subjected his immune system and strangler flex to a serious test - by blotting out some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.
The moderator and traveler Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk created his train on a Euro rail, a railing at Piccadilly Circus, a sink button of a train toilet and a public phone in Russia to demonstrate the resilience of his immune system.
Before licking each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he will admit.
But the experiment, which was filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength", brought some surprising results to light.
The idea of licking the sink button of a toilet that has already been used by thousands of others may be completely repulsive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.
On his journey through Europe, Mr Wright spoke with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria and about his own health.
Fortunately, nothing left in his mouth any more than a bad aftertaste.
Mr Wright became known for testing the resilience of his intestines by traveling through the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
From public areas at stations to sinking buttons of toilets, the task definitely put his immune system under a test
In the film he told me: "I was already relatively unconcerned as a child about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water."
In the film he definitely lived up to his reputation.
The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.
His sample strip showed a number of luminometers of more than 4000 units.
Compared to this, the number of luminometers of freshly washed hands is less than 60.
But there was a Russian toilet that he refused to lick after its luminometer number was over 4,000 units, while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60
Mr Wright and the Finnish producer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength", which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom
In the film he says, "This is close to the worst thing I've ever smoked in a toilet."
There's nothing more dirty than that!
I'm not gonna eat anything here because it's disgusting in here.
"The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in cooperation with the Finnish dairy producer Valio.
The company equips Mr Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamins C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system.
Valios Senior Venice President for Snacks, Juices and New Categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the advantages of probiotics.
We did crazy brainstormings that ended up saying, "Let's call Ian."
They claim that the interest in intestinal health becomes a global phenomenon
Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of intestinal health and how it is linked to the immune system.
The growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information about it in an interesting way.
I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who led the film, added: "Let me say this - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had licked some of the things I had told him to lick, like the disgusting Russian toilet shown in the movie."
Of course, there were things where it was easier to get Ian to lick them and others where this was quite difficult.
I'm glad we recorded some of these dirty treats on film."
In a 2015 survey conducted by Valio, 84 per cent of all lactic acid bacteria surveyed, particularly with the well-being of the stomach and intestines, and 58 per cent said that they use at least occasionally products containing lactic acid bacteria.
Asocial family destroyed before delogization Social apartment in Saltash, Cornwall
An asocial family left their social home after a delogation with a damage of £50,000 because she had terrorized her neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown out of their property in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long list of complaints.
After they were violently removed from their property, shocked employees of the housing cooperative found property in an irreparable condition.
The walls showed claping holes, wooden sections were torn up, garbage was scattered on the floor and graffiti was lubricated to the walls.
The family was relocated and it is assumed that she now lives in a private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, who works for the house administration at Cornwall Housing, said she was afraid that the apartment could no longer be repaired.
She said, "It was an absolute nightmare for people here, and I think people don't have to live this way.
There are many things to consider, as this property will probably be considered as not such beautiful part of Cornwalls.
The family is notorious and so is their reputation.
The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror caused by the family involved street fights with baseball battling, intimidating residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive screaming, fighting and curses.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, was given an arrangement for antisocial behavior in June.
In some rooms of the house, which may be demolished, old garbage was found
In the estate where drugs were used in the past, the wooden sections were torn up
Neighbors said they saw them fighting on the street and had to call the police regularly
Cornwall Housing handed her and her partner off the property this week violently after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer.
The delogue was hailed by relieved neighbors who said that their lives were made hell.
One said, "They didn't care about anyone."
We lived 20 years next to them and it was always bad.
The countless times we tell the police here are incredible.
"This morning we couldn't sleep."
We got up because it was so quiet here - we're not used to it!
Now that they're finally gone, it's gonna be beautiful.
Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighborhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said that he had lost the family to cooperate with the local authorities.
The family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals for 20 years
On the overgrown side of the community house, garbage and old toys were thrown down
He added: "It is a shame that the tenant has failed to accept any responsibility for their behavior and that of their family, since delogation is always the last step that Cornwall Housing takes into consideration.
This was a very difficult case because the behavior was extreme and their actions had to be horribly watched for their neighbors.
I appreciate all the work my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall, as well as members of the community who have courageously responded to us and given us the information.
I hope that this development will bring comfort to some neighbours and convey the message that anti-social behaviour is not tolerated.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons lived in the house at different times, but that they were all over 20.
A dirty mattress that is left in one of the bedrooms of the house after the delogue on the floor
Workers of the house administration will now have to clear up garbage dumps that surround the house
In 2014, the police carried out a raid in the house and found over 70g of cannabis as well as scales, paraphernalia and cash in the amount of £1,700.
Skeldon received a fine after she had confessed to the possession of a Class B drug for commercial purposes.
She claimed that the money was for a tombstone for her son Lee Skeldon, who died in 2013 in a car accident.
After being homeless, Tanya and her partner are now expected to live in a private accommodation in Plymouth.
Many of the house's room walls were plastered with graffiti.
The police say they're going to delegate tenants who don't stick to the house rules.
Angela Crow of the Devon and Cornwall police reported that the delegation was a clear warning to the other tenants who did not adhere to the house rules.
"This is about those who think that they can behave without self-accusation as well as those who have been harmed by such behavior," she said.
The Devon and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behavior that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal panic after a deep-flying military jet flies over the beach
Sun worshipers in Aveiro, Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
A Portuguese P-3C Orion aircraft of the Air Force made an incredible crash
Air forces reported that it was on a training flight, but insisted that there was no safety risk
This was the moment to start panicking in the frightened tourists after a deep-flying jet crashes over a full beach.
Dramatic video footage showed how the military aircraft flew almost in close proximity to the sunbathers on the beach section in Aveiro in northern Portugal.
The holidaymakers sprang up when they understoodably began to worry about the noise of the jet engines, without first seeing what was caused by the clouds on them.
The incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova, near Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the many holidaymakers who posted videos about the dramatic Fly-By in the social media, said: "It flew twice really deep and there was a moment when it looked like it was falling."
Nuno Arroja added: "I was just surfing and it felt like the plane was coming down on me."
Tourists at the beach of Aveiro were in panic when the plane came out of the darkness and flew incredibly deep
The Portuguese Air Force today indicated that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and had to fly so deep that this was the only way to recognize them.
The speaker said that due to the poor visibility of the jets due to nearby surface fires, the jets flew a little deeper than usual, but the air forces insisted that safety was never at risk.
This summer, fires destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland, killing four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese air forces today indicated that due to the conditions - strong fog and smoke - the pilot had to fly so deep, which limited his view
The plane was on a training flight where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise
Supercup: Barca with worries about Seville
Seville - Barcelona FC fights for the first step to the first title win in the new football season on Sunday.
The Catalans compete in the duel for the Spanish Supercup against Seville FC, and the replay rises three days later at Camp Nou.
The double winner must refrain from Neymar, among other things, with the lower cuppinalist and ruling European League champion, who argues with Brazil against the Olympic football tournament.
Goalie Marc-Andre is also missing.
In training, the German experienced a scuba diving in the knee, which at least for the time being cleared the one-questioning question at Barca in favour of Claudio Bravo.
The Chilean International and Ter Stegen have been competing for the status of number one in Barcelona for two years.
Coach Luis Enrique has not yet made a clear decision in this regard, leaving Bravo in the league, but Ter Stegen in most other applications.
Before the first compulsory game of the new season, there is doubt in the Spanish champion about the fitness status of the team, which was humiliated on Saturday in a test game of Liverpool with 0:4.
Lionel Messi and Co. didn't really know how to convince even at 3:2 in the test gallop against Sampdoria on Wednesday.
In turn, Seville has the 2:3 defeat to digest after extension in the European Supercup against Real Madrid and strives for the second triumph at the "Supercopa de Espana".
Barcelona is the record winner in this competition with eleven successes so far.
Ma Long in his own league at table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympic champion.
The 27-year-old defeated his compatriot and "title defender" Zhang Jike 4:0 (12,4,4) in a one-sided finale on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro.
Thus, the world rankings first brought the "Golden Grand Slam" with successes at World Cup, World Cup, World Tour Finals and Olympics.
Bronze went to the Japanese Jun Mizutani.
The two Chinese made it into the final game as expected and made up the title among themselves.
This made it clear that for the third time in a row a Chinese would get the single title in the sign of the Five Rings.
The last non-Chinese on the top Olympics was the former S.V.S.N.O. Legionarian Ryu Seung-min from South Korea.
Ma and Zhang were left alone on the record, between the sentences and at time-outs they had no coaches with them.
They had retreated to the stands and left their defenders alone in the fair competition.
"I've played the matches for my country so far."
"I'm playing for myself in the final," said Zhang.
After the game, gold and silver medal winners posing with the China flag.
The match itself was unexpected one-sided.
Ma had to fight with his 28-year-old opponent only in the first sentence.
After that, he set the speed on the record and left Zhang there only 13 points.
Due to Ma's superiority, the expected raging match did not develop.
Nevertheless, there were enough stunning ball changes to be seen.
Mizutani won the match for bronze against 40-year-old Vladimir Samsonov 4:1.
In his quarter-finals, the White Horse had contracted a rib injury against the German European champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov, and was then in medical treatment, had to "finally" be satisfied with sheet metal.
By the way, the Swedes Jan-Ove Waldner (38/2004) and Jörgen Persson (42/2008) had become four in a similar high table tennis age.
Donald Trump admits “great problems” in the election campaign
The leadership of the U.S. Republicans is plagued by massive concerns about losing their majority even in traditional conservative states.
Presidential candidate Donald Trump now admitted weaknesses in his election campaign in the former Republican Hochburg Utah.
A rare moment in which the normally large-scale and self-assured multimillionaire expressed such concerns as those reported by correspondents.
After throwing 16 rivals out of the race within his own Republican camp, doubts about his success in the fight for the White House are growing.
"We have huge problems in Utah," said Trump to evangelical Christians, who he asked for support in important states such as Ohio, Florida or Virginia.
Blame if false reports of his candidacy, he resumed his famous media charge.
Republican Hochburgen Wobble
Utah is usually a safe bank for Republicans.
According to a survey conducted by SurveyUSA in June, Trump and his rival from the Democrats, Hillary Clinton, were on the same page.
Other institutions see Trump ahead, but not by the distance that is common to Republican candidates in the state.
Arizona and Georgia are also considered to be at risk.
In an interview by the broadcaster CNBC, Trump answered the question how he wanted to stop Clinton's advance again: "Just like I've done so far."
And pushed after: This will "either be successful, or I will make a very nice, long holiday".
He does nothing but "to tell the truth."
If it was not enough for him at the end for reasons of political correctness, that would be all right, Trump continued.
Then I return to a very good way of life.
According to press reports, the Trump party was said to have threatened to cancel funds to support its election campaign, he should not be able to present better survey values.
Instead, the Republican candidates wanted to be more impoverished for Congress.
Olympia: Dreister Fraud at Doping Test
The IOC intends to set up a disciplinary committee on the case.
Kenya's light athletes are threatened by the second doping event at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics.
After a fraud attempt at a doping check in the Olympic village, Kenya sent a coach home.
The International Olympic Committee informed that it would immediately set up a disciplinary committee to investigate the case.
A Kenyan official had announced that the former sprinter and today's coach, John Anzrah, in the Olympic village had passed a urine test under the name of the 800-metre runner Ferguson Rotich.
This had been reported by the Doping Controllers to Kenya's team management.
The World Association IAAF has requested the IOC to provide information on the case in order to exert its own investigations, a spokesperson from the IAAF informed.
"Depending on the results of the investigation and the subsequent measures of the IOC, the IAAF will carry out an evaluation," it stated in an IAAF statement.
"He (Anzrah) went to the Doping Control Station and spent himself as Ferguson Rotich, taking the test and signing it," said Kenya's head of mission Stephan Arap Soi.
He was in possession of the athlete's accreditation, which was on the list for the training controls of the World Anti-Doping Agency.
Ferguson Rotich had become more than 800 meters in 2015 in Beijing World Cup fourth.
Four days earlier, the Kenyan athletics Delegate Michael Rotich had been deducted from the Rio games.
He is said to have informed athletes of upcoming doping tests against money payments in his country.
According to media reports, he is said to have been arrested on his return to Nairobi airport.
Kenya has been under special observation at the IOC since many doping crimes for a long time.
In the announcement of the IOC's more than 2000 Doping Goal Controls ahead of the Rio Games, it was unusually pointed out in advance that athletes from Kenya and Russia in particular are being targeted.
Before the summer games in Brazil, the World Anti-Doping Agency had exerted a lot of pressure on the African country to create an anti-doping law and a functioning control system.
The law was passed a few weeks before the Olympics began.
As a result, WADA took Kenya from the list of countries whose doping control is in line with WADA's rules.
Kenya is considered a great runner nation.
The country's light athletes won the most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing.
In a series of TV reports by the ARD, allegations were repeatedly made that Kenya Doping funds are easily accessible and that there should be a considerable mentality of sports fraud.
IOC member Richard Pound recently requested a similar investigation in Kenya, as he had employed them in Russian athletics.
It has been demonstrated that this sport has been shelled in a comprehensive and systematic way.
Russia's light athletes were then excluded from the summer games.
Salzburger "West Side Story" with Cecilia Bartoli
In the Shakespeare Year, the Salzburg Festival presents the "West Side Story" with Tony and Maria as a tragic couple of lovers, similar to Romeo and Julia.
With a surprising Cecilia Bartoli.
A musical conquers Salzburg: the "West Side Story", Leonard Bernstein's masterpiece.
The artistic director, Cecilia Bartoli, wanted to bring the musical into the classical temple and fulfilled a childhood dream with the role of Mary.
In the orchestral grave the Simón Bolívar Orchestra under the direction of the Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel: "This music is full of rhythm," he swears.
We always say that it is very Latin American.
There are many Latin American ingredients in their pace and melody.
It is a wonderful mixture, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.
I'd say we really have Bernstein's music in our blood!
Bartoli plays an older Maria in this production.
She remembers her love for Tony with pity while the younger Maria plays and dances.
The role of Mary has always fascinated me.
First, because it is musically exceptional!
And then there would be Mary's personality.
She says it in her song: "I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty and witty and bright".
So she's smart, of course also naive, and very passionate.
"It is very similar to me, my Italian character, which I have as a Roman," Bartoli laughs.
Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist."
It is such an honor for us to work with her.
She's a tremendously generous person.
And Bartoli gives the compliment: "Dudamel is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate!"
Conducting is a necessity for him.
You can see it in each of his movements, in his eyes, it's his life!
It is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him.
We both have a more southern temperament, a fire, a passion and also a happy approach to life, that is very important at all!
For American director Philip Wm. McKinley, the "West Side Story" is highly up-to-date: "This piece is about prejudice and fanaticism."
Today we have the refugees, then the Puerto Ricans went to New York, and the New Yorkers did not want them.
They are the same topics, and they are as meaningful today as they were then.
59 years later the piece is still relevant.
London schoolgirl who joined ISIS was killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIS, reportedly died in Syria.
Lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said that a few weeks ago her family learned about her death in Raqqa, Syria.
It was believed that she was killed by a Russian air raid in Raqqa, the group's bombing plant in the country, reported ITV News on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, died shortly after she was planning to leave the war-torn country and return to England.
"One can only hope that the only good is in it - as a warning and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going to a war zone - to prevent people from ever making this decision," said Akunjee.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other schoolgirls from the east of London boarded a plane towards Turkey and then entered a bus to the Syrian border.
Sultana's family was told that she married an ISIS fighter in Syria - and became a widow within a few months.
Reid says that Clinton will remain as a candidate for the Supreme Court in the event of a election victory at Garland
Harry Reid, leader of the Democrats in the Senate, is convinced that the presidential candidate of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton, will nominate Judge Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court.
The Republicans in the Senate have blocked Garland's confirmation since his nomination by Barack Obama in March.
The majority leader in the Senate Mitch McConnell believes that the next president will appoint the successor of the late judge to the Supreme Court Antonin Scalia.
Reid said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he expected to select Garland from Clinton "with a certain degree of certainty".
A spokeswoman from Reid later said that he had not yet spoken to Clinton if she would nominate Garland and he was speculating.
He praised Garland and said that Clinton's team would not cause trouble with a new candidate.
Garland is the U.S. Supreme Court of Appeal for the District of Columbia.
Raid said that Republicans blocked the Garland nomination, were Lacaia and helpers of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He also noted that Donald Trump was unsuitable for the presidential office.
Treats want nude calendars for "women and men"
The Treats magazine is working with photographer David Bellemere to bring out a 1970s Pirelli-inspired calendar for 2017.
But instead of famous naked people, they want to find the next generation of top models for their NU Muses Calendar for 2017.
At the beginning of this year, the editor-in-chief of Treats Steve Shaw told us that his nude magazine was different from Oldschool Playboys because "Playboy is for men".
I'm doing this for women.
Apparently, he believes that the Calendar does.
"We need to return to the depiction of timeless and classic nudity, where both women and men feel comfortable and inspired by these images of a female body," said Shaw in a press release on the publication of the calendar.
Women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art.
Models can submit their images online or personally on an open casting call in Los Angeles and New York.
Turkey: Kurdish community expects mass flight
"Whoever does not adapt and praises Erdogan sits on packed suitcases," says Ercan Karakoyun, Chairman of the Gülen-near Foundation Dialogue and World.
In the short term, the Kurdish municipality of Germany expects tens of thousands of people seeking protection to flee from Turkey to Germany.
In the medium term, it could even be "a few hundred thousand", believes the association chairman Ali Toprak.
Due to the hard work done by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the coup attempt, the Kurdish municipality of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany.
"In the short term, I expect tens of thousands, in the medium term, of several hundred thousand people seeking protection from Turkey in Germany when the Erdogan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition," says the Association Chairman Ali Toprak of the "World" of Friday.
Because the government had already covered Kurdish strongholds with criminal action months ago, 500,000 Kurds in Turkey were on the run.
After the vandalized coup, secular and oppositional ethnic Turks would be added.
Many will want to start over in Europe if they are further suppressed in Turkey.
"It can't be that a state that takes refugees into its own country produces refugees," said Toprak.
The head of the Federation complained about the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish, but also in Alevit cities.
Thus Erdogan wanted to increase the exit pressure on the remaining Kurds.
"They are the last large minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have already been exterminated or expelled in the last hundred years," said Toprak, who is also a CDU member.
The head of the Federation demanded that the federal government "position itself as strongly as Austria against Erdogan and his supporters".
A witch hunt against Erdogan critics is also taking place in Germany.
I don't feel safe in Germany for the first time in the last few months.
The German branch of the Gülen movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad.
More Turks will seek asylum in Germany, especially Kurds and oppositionists.
The firemarking as a guild support destroys the professional existence of teachers and other academics.
"Whoever does not adapt and praises Erdogan sits on packed suitcases, by the way also the Kemalists and secularists," said Ercan Karakoyun, chairman of the Gülen-near Foundation Dialogue and Education, the "world".
As reported by the newspaper, referring to figures from the Federal Ministry of the Interior, the Turks presented the largest group of asylum seekers in Germany, recognised for political persecution.
On June 30, this was 11,386 people and thus almost 29 percent of all recognised as eligible for asylum (39,625).
This survey does not include those who fled from war, poverty or lack of perspective.
The right to asylum under the Basic Law is exclusively political, i.e. from the state side, individually persecuted.
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: "Go where it hurts"
Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: The locals get nothing from the summer campaign - and the holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to choose the Landtag.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, they understood.
In 2021 the Landtag elections will not take place again at the end of the summer holidays, the Heavy Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.
It's not as stupid as it's been up to now: summer holidays, heat and country elections - that bites.
The locals, who are to be convinced by the electoral campaigners, are on vacation.
The very most holidaymakers who are in the country, traveling on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee, are not locals, so do not choose the Landtag.
In addition, practical problems arise: In the holidays, helpers, hang up posters, inflate balloons, distribute flyers and at the end count voices, only effortlessly drive up.
Until 4 September 2016, the election day and the last holiday day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern must once again let the campaign pass just past the people.
The hot phase, if you can say so at all, has just begun.
And it is also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Selling, leader of a SPD/CDU coalition, must fear for his office.
The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in surveys.
It's exciting how much newcomer AfD cuts off and what's left at the end of the coalition.
Sellering, 66 years old and since 2008 Head of Government, makes an almost unobtrusive election campaign, you can see from his large posters.
He travels through the country, distributes roses and chats a little with the people, just as his legendary vocabulary predecessor Harald Ringstorff did.
Otherwise, Seelerring got cold feet and blamed Chancellor Merkel on the AfD's blossoming.
Her refugee policy, her "We can do this", has accelerated the rise of the right-wing populists, which will probably cost him the nice office.
The CDU with its top candidate, the Interior Minister Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is when you make a campaign at the right place at the wrong time.
She has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to major conferences; Merkel Bundestagswahlkreis is located in the northeast.
But the target group was wrong, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berliner and Saxony than Mecklenburger and Vorpommern.
"There was probably a majority from other federal states," complained Vincent Kokert, CDU's Secretary General in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in the NDR.
But no one from other corners of Germany is sorry to hear Angela Merkel once.
Otherwise, the Northeast CDU largely refrains from the usual election campaigns at marketplaces and shopping centres with umbrellas and balloons.
That, says Kokert, only plays a "subordinate role".
The Union has also noticed that in the country you are busting the groundwork, that it has to make a lot of effort to find another wire to the people.
You go like the left, the SPD, the green: in the vastness of the country hardly present.
However, the council of the CDU electoral fighter Kokert to his competitors is also self-explanatory: "You must go where it hurts, namely where the people are: village festivals, golden weddings, every birthday celebration must be used".
Because much is at stake, Selling has now called his SPD to a particularly dedicated election campaign.
In polls the Social Democrats were last with 22 percent behind partners CDU (25) and only just a short time before the AfD (19).
In the 2011 election, the SPD had still clearly won 35.6 percent before the CDU (22).
The Greens, a small party with seven percent in the polls, should make the jump to the Landtag.
They make a modern virtue out of the holiday emergency and largely transfer their campaign to the Internet.
"Online election campaign", it is called the country president Claudia Müller.
Otherwise, green campaigners go on a search for local voters among the holidaymakers.
Silke Gajek, the top candidate, just sails through the Mecklenburg lakes with a houseboat and also finds it beautiful.
Your impression: "Electoral leave in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is not a punishment".
B27-Rehabilitation: Restaurants suffer from blockage
At the speed with which the B 27 is refurbished, there is nothing to complain about.
For those responsible for the construction work, which starts at 5.30 a.m. and ends only at 8 p.m., there is praise everywhere.
"They've made everything pretty tight," says Elvira Tetzlaff from the Jet gas station.
It's a super team.
There's no delay either.
The construction site could be moved to the south at the beginning of the week to the mid-term, until the end of October everything should be done.
It is also to be commended for the encounter of those responsible for the construction work, for example when it comes to the establishment of help entrances.
Since the construction site was moved to the south on Monday and the blocking of the Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen has also been lifted and the connection to Rottenburg also exists again, the traffic situation within the place has relaxed.
Citizens can now travel from ofterdingen from the B 27 again on both sides.
The evasive traffic through the place seems to be going back.
"There were some significant complaints," says Florian King, Deputy Head of State for Traffic Management of the Rehabilitation.
The inhabitants of Bachsatzstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise, because many of them were looking for dirt roads and more familiar with their navi than the signage.
This led to some trucks burning in residential areas.
Since the speed limits were also not met, the municipality increasingly demanded the measuring vehicle from Mössingen.
"There were significant exceedances," says King, who once made himself aware of the situation on the ground.
There have already been two to three flashes per minute.
The fastest was on the way with 77 hour kilometers in the tempo-30 zone.
Since the construction site has moved on, be it quieter.
For the businessmen at the B 27 it is only a small comfort that the road is now open again for customers from Rottenburg.
Businessmen don't like looking in the cards.
But that the B 27 refurbishment has led to sales breakdowns, lets everyone you ask see through.
However, some are more and some are less affected.
Those who have less to do with the "end customer", i.e. produce for other companies, for which the refurbishment has little effect.
At the Maier Autohaus, Thomas Sulz also speaks of a "highest slight decrease", but also admits that of course "the running knowledge is lacking".
The most heavily besieged are the locals along the road.
J. Albert Göhner, owner of the Steakhouse, formerly crown, finds clear words.
This is already threatening to exist.
Not only him, but all the restaurants have "hit it hard".
Customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil were missing.
We must be happy about every euro of sales.
He calculates the loss of sales to be "more than 50 percent by far".
The road renovation had "returned its operation for two years".
He had to release half of his employees.
If I had a company with 4,000 employees and half had been released, politics would have reacted differently.
Instead, government president Jörg Schmidt responded to a request from Gohner whether there could be a financial compensation, with the indication that the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the situation at B 27. Now it would also have to bear the disadvantages resulting from the renovation.
Gohner knows about other districts where something more generous was handled.
In all complaints, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist.
Finally, the family business has been located here since 1715, he refers to the long history.
He can understand that other regulars now look by less frequently because of the complicated traffic management.
If you can't drive here, it's nice somewhere else.
Gohner has no doubt that his main clients will return after the completion of the refurbishment work.
Despite the crises with BSE and avian influenza, Gohner maintains the impact of the B27 construction work on his clientele for the greatest crisis that his restaurant has experienced in its long history.
Six months of construction, that's already brutal.
In the name of counter-terrorism, laws are constantly being tightened.
Following the recent attacks, Interior Minister de Maizière is now presenting a thick security package.
But what does a state of tolerance have to do with terror?
And what does the coalition partner say about all this?
Thomas de Maizière gives the reconciler.
All his proposals are "politically reasonable" to the coalition partner, says the Federal Minister for the Interior in presenting his new security package.
They don't overdo anyone.
Other further points would first be discussed within the parties.
I'm also involved.
As Minister of the Interior, however, he was in charge of results and of a "attainable consensus" within the coalition.
After the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, De Maizière allowed a little time before presenting his conclusions for security in the Republic.
But they now fall far more widely.
Some things are already known, announced, suggested: That a new security authority should take care of the cracking of encrypted communications is not new.
Not even the fact that Germany has to implement several EU requirements on passenger data and arms law.
The call for more video surveillance and personnel for the security authorities is also not surprising.
In part, de Maizière starts a second run for proposals that have not been made with the SPD so far: he wants to put sympathy for terrorist groups under penalty and double-citizen jihadists on the German passport.
"These will be difficult points for the SPD," admits the CDU man.
He still considered this to be reasonable and did not demand anything, which the coalition partner had no chance of doing anyway.
Some new ideas are also presented by de Maizière.
They have it partly in themselves: he plans rapid procedures for deportations and more opportunities to arrest people before deportation.
Refugees who are targeted to the country are supposed to have their smartphones checked and to disclose social media accounts for a security check.
When it comes to suffering for rejected asylum seekers, he wants to put some even worse than before - such as those who commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers in order to conceal their identity.
Some of them are politically and legally delicate.
Some things also seem unexplained and leave questions open.
And on some points - for example, when dealing with the unequal treatment of the patient - the question arises: What does this actually have to do with security and terrorism?
Yes, says de Maizière that it is important to differentiate between the issues of refugees and terrorism.
But it cannot be denied that the assassins of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.
Moreover, in view of the high numbers of refugees, many people were concerned about safety.
And things that deeply occupied the people could not be ruled out even in election times.
Internal security has become an enormous focus.
Only the attacks in the neighbourhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.
Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.
The uncertainty is great.
And yes, there are elections on.
The Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly in position on the subject of internal security.
In the past few days, things have gone up between the two parties.
First a heated dispute over the equipment of the federal police, then a security policy idea collection of some Union ministers, in which the heads of the department also demand a ban on Burka and a departure from dual citizenship.
De Maizière also strives for reconciled sounds here.
He doesn't keep anything from turning away from the double pass.
We have satisfied the discussion in Germany.
Reopen them, don't make sense.
And in a Burka ban, he had constitutional concerns.
Whether its own package is constitutionally sound at all corners and whether it is actually "much" for the coalition partner, it has to show itself.
There's a lot in there that could cause a fight.
But the SPD is also currently trying to profile itself on the subject of internal security.
Party leader Sigmar Gabriel first gently signals willingness to talk and says: "The SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to further increase security."
Volkswagen is still passing through.
Despite diesel scandals, delivery figures are rising worldwide.
But not in all markets is it going around.
In the recall action, there are vortexes around a term.
Volkswagen starts delivery in the second half of the year.
Europe's largest car manufacturer can still show an increase in its many brands and some well-running markets in the past year, despite the diesel business.
In July, however, the VW core brand weakened mainly in Western Europe, thus relieving the overall sale, as the company listed in the Dax reported.
The VW brand sold 1.8 percent fewer vehicles worldwide in July with 449100 cars than in the previous month.
Sales in Western Europe alone, the second most important market in China, were 14 percent below the previous month.
In the German home market, deliveries dropped by almost one-sixth.
Brand Sales Manager Jürgen Stackmann returned the weaker figures from July to two sales days less in Europe.
In addition, in some core markets there has been a "change in the economic environment" which has prevented buying.
In addition to the situation surrounding Turkey's attempted coup d'état, the British vote on withdrawal from the EU was also under pressure, one spokesperson said.
In the U.S., where the exhaust gas business first escalated, there is also a reduction in beech emissions.
Great support for VW is the Chinese market.
Overall, the mainly affected house brand of the Lower Saxony is still passing through the diesel scandal: after the first seven months, only a drop-out of 0.9 percent to 3.37 million vehicles is available.
Group Sales Manager Fred Kappler was able to show a sales increase from January to July.
1.3 percent more cars delivered Volkswagen at this time, 5,904 million worldwide.
Volkswagen had manipulated with a software exhaust gas test.
In Germany alone, VW is calling around 2.5 million cars for conversion to the workshops.
In the course of the conversion, VW confirmed that the conversion of the cars has no negative impact.
After the conversion of the vehicles, there is no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine power.
After the conversion, the carmaker issued a "equal guarantee" certificate to the customer, but does not speak of a "guarantee", as it was called on Friday in company circles.
Reasons are legal subtleties.
The "Focus" had reported that Volkswagen now granted its German customers a guarantee for retrofitted diesel models.
This would have been confirmed last Monday by VW representatives at the Federal Ministry of Transport.
The Ministry of Transport confirmed that this meeting had taken place.
"VW has to comply fully with the requirements of my Commission of Inquiry and of KBA."
"Derogations are not accepted," said Federal Minister for Transport Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), according to the Ministry.
VW has taken over the guarantee that no deterioration occurs in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine power after the conversion and all vehicle type approval values have remained unchanged.
Volkswagen himself uses the term "guarantee" but not, as it was called in corporate circles.
With the broad term "guarantee", Volkswagen sees the possibility that, for example, half a year after the conversion, customers might come to a workshop with an engine damage - and this could be due to the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do with it.
It is also important, in the interests of customers, to avoid any other damage that has nothing to do with the exhaust candal, resulting in an uncertainty as to possible warranty arrangements, as it was said.
Therefore, VW does not use the term "guarantee".
The Raiffeisenbank Gmund am Tegernsee requires rich savers to pay penalties in the future - as a second institute in Germany.
Bank Manager Josef Paul said on Thursday, "It's only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on Giro or daily cash accounts."
The Bundesverband Deutscher Banken speaks of a single case and sees no signal in it: Normal savers should "not be afraid to pay for their asparagus penalties".
If banks store money overnight at the European Central Bank (ECB), they have to pay their 0.4 percent penalty rate.
From September, the Raiffeisenbank Gmund will be charging private and corporate customers for deposits of more than 100,000 euros on Giro or daily cash accounts.
"The first 100,000 euros are free."
"The next 100,000 will cost 400 euros a year," said Paul.
For some time now, he has been guarding 40 million euros, which could be lifted from one day to the next and which he could not use.
"They are in my central bank account and cost 0.4 percent," said the bank manager.
"I can't lay down $4,000 for every million."
The cost is now passed on according to the polluter principle.
Leaving the cash in the safes of the Raiffeisenbank would be far too dangerous: "I've already experienced four attacks, I don't like the fifth!" said the bank manager.
Most customers would understand and change to other forms of investment.
Only a few migrated to other banks.
The association Bayern said: "The ECB's extreme monetary policy rate is causing considerable costs for all banks".
To carry them alone is "permanently not possible".
Some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account management, credit cards or transfers.
The Thuringian People's and Raiffeisenbank Altenburger Land made headlines with its Skatbank branch in 2014.
Michael Kemmer, Managing Director of the Banking Association, said: "We do not expect private customers to pay comprehensive fees for deposits, for this, competition in Germany among banks and savings banks is far too strong."
A banker said that on Lake Tegern there is "a clientele that is somewhat richer equipped with wealth".
"This can become a problem for a small bank" if it protects money free of charge.
Founded in 1911, the cooperative bank Gmund has branches in Bad Wiessee, Rottach-Egern, Kreuth and Tegernsee.
There are well-known actors, athletes and entrepreneurs in the region.
"There are currently no other banks known to the Bayern Cooperative Association to calculate a settlement compensation for deposits by private customers," said Spokesperson Ernst.
At the end of June, the president of the Bundesverband der deutschen Volksbanken und Raiffeisenbanken (BVR), Uwe Fröhlich, had declared: "The threshold to go to the negative vis-à-vis the private customer is very, very high".
Competition is tough, and it threatens to emigrate from investors to competition.
Customers in Germany will not be able to enjoy this in width.
Destination Plates: who actually buys records?
Lonely middle-aged men love records.
Before you rush to the comment section to pass it under the pseudonym NotAllRealMen Middle Ages with rough insults, this statement is derived from current data.
According to YouGov, the much discussed recovery of records is not due to a boom in millennials that wants to welcome the news of physical objects, but rather to midlife nostalgia.
Those who recently bought a record are expected to be between 45 and 54 years of age.
In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely buyer group.
There is also no horde of hobby collectors - it has an emotional significance: older plate buyers keep their feelings rather to themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).
But are the results of YouGov correct?
If this blog were a news report on TV, the camera would follow me while I was running in the middle of a busy street in Soho, wearing a modest grey suit and stealing wildly before I stopped, holding my hands and saying something definite like, "So, let's take a closer look at it."
So, let's take a look at it.
Even though the heart of Sohos slowly loses its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where once independent sellers were located - there is still a handful of fantastic record specials.
I would probably ask the cameraman to switch off the camera for the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such shops and try to evaluate their age and mind by observing.
Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I follow from Sister Ray (data count: two young women, three middle-aged men) to the Reckless Records (data count: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably around 20), is one day because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.
Is he a collector?
"I guess so," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I didn't follow him home), undress the walls of his living room.
The reason why he owns such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records that he could not afford when they appeared and buy again items that he sold when he was young and broke.
"Many things I buy are from the late '60s, early '70s, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. Things I was probably a little too young to buy them for me," he says.
He agrees that those who buy records are rather introverted and like to spend time alone, adding: "I don't smoke and I don't drink very much.
That's my vice.
Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many customers he meets match the YouGov profile.
However, he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media hpe, people who have heard about the comeback and who are getting to see themselves buying their old records again.
Of the conversations I have had, people have usually disposed of their collection around 1998 or 1999.
Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again," he says.
That would explain the boom to supporters of the plate revival of a certain age.
But what about the alleged emotional meaning of plates?
It takes only a few seconds in a business like Phonica to realize that record stores offer a soothing community of like-minded people.
According to Wez, some of the older customers started the contactless payment system.
Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to withdraw to the stability of familiar record covers, from objects that wake up happy youth memories.
"I think sometimes it can be the filling of an emptiness or the possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort," says Wez.
This is the case with me as a collector and I think it is the case with many people.
It is an easy way to engage spiritually.
"We are like their social workers!" a staff member floated from a record pile.
A survey by the ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of the people who bought a record last month have not heard them yet.
The survey also found that 41% have a record player that they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record do not have a record player.
At this time of the news report, I would probably look very worried, as I browse through a pile of Bossa Nova compilations.
Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (data count: three middle-aged men), has noticed a "trophy aspect" of the Revival.
"Someone just came in here and said, "I don't have a record player, but I would like to buy a radiohead record so I can put it on the shelf," he says.
This is not a large percentage, but it definitely happens.
More product-intensive, less musical.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player."
These are younger people, not older ones who come in slowly.
Fool, who has devoted almost a whole floor to the records, has a colorful audience when I go in.
There are couples around 70, tourists who take photos, teenage boys and mid-age women.
Although the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - Wild Beast's latest synthesizer and sex-packed pop instead of experimental jazz roars from the speakers - it is good to see such diversity among customers.
None of them look particularly lonely, but nagging mental traumas are hard to detect when standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been running around the business for a few minutes and is looking at the variety of plates available for sale.
She makes a shop window boom rather than a big one.
She doesn't deserve much, so collecting records is not a real option, she says.
It costs a lot.
It is easy to hear music from a computer or in other ways, but the beauty of records is..." it drives off with a infatuated sigh.
I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.
My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: Urban Outfitters.
As I appear to pattern the jeans hotpants, I watch a group of young teenage girls grouping around Polaroid cameras for a moment before a father and his daughter think about buying a Crosley record player.
On the left is a staircase, a wall full of records by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, the essential records for an average collection.
No one looks at them - perhaps because they are just decorative, some so far up that it is impossible to touch them.
It's pure "plattenkunst".
But given that any attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry and send some customers to the deep Sohos for more, there is nothing to complain about.
It is no surprise that a population that has more time and money than others is also the one that spends the most on luxury items such as records.
Although my research revealed that the results of YouGov are correct, they ignore the large number of female collectors and record lovers who exist in reality, record stores and online forums, at least in record stores in Soho.
These people probably work hard at school or in offices.
They certainly do not spend their Thursday morning strolling through Berwick Street record shops and sheets while avoiding the staring gaze of an uncanny, 30-year-old false moderator, who raises nothing on the shoulders of men of middle age.
The Greenland shark is the longest living vertebrate - video report
Scientifically say that the Greenland shark has the longest life span of all vertebrates on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who investigates sharks, says that the record was with a female who is assumed to be between 272 and 512 years old and five meters long
French court rejects offer of demolition of shops in the jungle refugee camp
A French court has rejected an offer from the Calais authorities to demolish dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the Calais jungle, where thousands of refugees live.
At a court hearing this week, the Calais authorities argued that the state should be empowered to break down 72 provisional shops in which persons within the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, sell, hairdressing services or tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants.
The prefecture of Calais argued that these places should be demolished because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which pose a fire and health risk.
Humanitarian groups informed the court that the shops and restaurants were important because the free meals offered by the state-supported association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.
They also explained that the provisional shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.
A court in Lille decided that there was no legal basis for expelling people who were engaged in the 72 provisional transactions, but admitted that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais were "absolutely understandable."
Judge Jean-François Molla said that grocery stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much greater role than just feeding people who "live in extremely precarious conditions."
He said that the areas provided quiet meeting places between refugees and volunteers.
One of the places threatened by the downpour was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the Camp, which is run non-profit and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as advice on asylum matters for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed the petition to preserve the kids' café.
In a letter to the Guardian, it was said that the closure "was for these children a disaster of which the recent eight years are old."
The two aid organizations Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle rose to over 9,000 people - the highest number up to now - after a steep increase in new arrivals during the summer.
Despite Olympia disappointment: Martin remains militant
Despite his disappointing appearance in the Olympic time trial, Radprofi Tony Martin does not want to be defeated.
"I continue to watch the World Cup, remain confident and fight further," the 31-year-old wrote to Facebook on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro.
He doesn't have an explanation for his miserable twelfth place on the sugar hat.
"I honestly find it difficult to comment on yesterday's time driving," said Martin.
He had to analyse in peace what reasons led to the debacle.
Martin actually wanted to compete for the title at the time trial in Qatar in October.
"I'm going to look at everything that we've changed lately."
"This also includes my position," wrote the three-time world champion, who lost more than three minutes on Wednesday to the 54.5 km Olympic champion Fabian Cancellara (Switzerland).
Olympia: Tennis pro Siegemund misses semifinals
The victory of Laura Siegemund ended in the Rio quarter final: the world ranking 32. from Metzingen missed by a 1:6, 1:6 against Monica Puig (Puerto Rico/WTA-Nr.
34) The semifinals of the Olympic tennis tournament are clear.
Siegemund, who was plagued by back problems, could only spend its supplement once and seemed powerless compared to the previous rounds.
On Thursday, the medallion Angelique Kerber (Kiel/No. 2) had the chance to jump to the preliminary round.
The Australian open winner met the British Johanna Konta (No. 10).
As the last German tennis professional, Tommy Haas had won a silver medal in Sydney in 2000.
There were two German DTB starters in the quarter final of summer games last in 1992.
Never before had a German duo in an Olympic single-half finale.
Group starts on startup for live video game transmissions
Seeing other people playing video games is a big deal - Microsoft also wants to benefit from it.
The technology group buys the start-up Beam, which specializes in this hobby.
How much money flowes for the takeover, Microsoft did not announce on Thursday.
Beam only started his offer in January and already has more than 100,000 users.
You can watch others play, but you can also intervene yourself.
For example, they can give up missions to players and confront enemies as well as provide equipment items.
The Blizzard Activition launches a new HD video service for the booming world of e-sports.
On the way to the global media event is supposed to help Facebook.
The advertising industry is already stopping.
The employees of the start-up, previously based in Seattle, Washington, United States, are moving to the Microsoft headquarters in Redmond, California, as Beam co-founder and CEO Matt Salsamendi announced.
Therefore, for the customers, the takeover is not intended to change anything.
Beam is integrated into the video game department around the Xbox console according to Microsoft.
The market for live streaming of video gaming activities is currently growing rapidly.
Known platforms are Twitch and YouTube Gaming.
Twitch was bought in 2014 by the online retailer Amazon - for almost a billion dollars.
YouTube Gaming is part of the Google Mother Alphabet.
Here comes the Enforcement Trailer
Germany's shaver must adapt to the next generation of speedometers: in various federal states, including Hessen and Brandenburg, new flash devices are tested, which are to transfer temposünder especially effectively.
The futuristic-acting Enforcement Trailer by Vitronic from Wiesbaden can be used, for example, in accident areas where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police.
For example, at motorway construction sites or bridges to be refurbished with temporary speed limits, there is often no infrastructure needed to ensure compliance with speed limits with a stationary lightning.
However, a durable mobile setup can be too dangerous or cumbersome.
The Enforcement Trailer is self-sufficient: Its battery lasts for continuous measuring for five days, the case data is transmitted encrypted via a modem.
With laser measurement technology, all vehicles can be recorded over several tracks at the same time.
Variable speed limits as well as traffic bans after time, lanes and vehicle class can also be monitored.
The trailer can be moved in high-end condition, according to the manufacturer, with each car with trailer coupling.
In order not to be easily stolen, it is lowered in the operation of the measurement, so that the wheels disappear in the armored and, by the way, bulletproof outer shell.
In addition, a built-in alarm system is designed to protect the lightning from vandalism.
Since 2015, according to Vitronic, the trailer has been tested in various federal states and is now also used.
Also foreign authorities are flashing with the new technology: recently France re-ordered 100 pieces, after an order of 150 pieces last year.
Great Britain gets silver in the 7 rugby after Fiji Masterclass gets gold
Britain's impressive performance at the 7 rugby came to an abrupt halt on Thursday evening at the last hurdle in the shape of Fiji, when they were beaten here in Rio with a result of 43-7 at the Deodoro Stadium.
Fiji awarded a master class in handling, side-stepping, racing, and raw strength to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any color.
The defeat was sweetened by the not too bad consolation price of the silver medal - Britain's fourth on that day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The clear defeat of the box, 7-5 in the semi-final on the same day could fall back on them in the final.
But regardless of this, Fiji would have beaten a 15-man team in the best form in this form.
It could be a comfort to GB - but it probably won't - that at least one British will have a gold medal hanging around his neck tomorrow: Fiji's head coach Ben Ryan, the former head of England from Wimbledon.
GB had a difficult path behind it.
Eight years ago she lost under Ryan every game at the Adelaide Sevens.
Here they only lost one.
This slumber will hurt, but progress is amazing.
Fiji began wonderfully and let the attacks of GBs blow out of fun.
It felt like it was for Captain Tom Mitchell and Co. as if you were running in driving buses. The World Series winners went up 5-0 when Osea Kolinisau went over the corner.
With four minutes of playing time, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner, which he converted.
12-0 and GB barely touched the ball.
An outstanding tackle by Mitchell stopped the mountain of Man Leone Nakarawa to reach a third gate, but it only stopped Fiji.
In the seventh minute Jasa Veremalua looked in the right corner a touchdown and it stood 0-17 for GB.
Nakarawa added a new one since the resumption and there was still over a minute playing time ... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou praised the GB team's other weak tackles and stormed up to the line to make a goal.
The conversion brought a 29-0 to the break.
It's like Fiji was born to play the 7 while GB is still learning.
That's the way it is.
GB made fundamental changes to the mid-term and closed the Fijian gap...for a total of four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half until Joshua Tuisova went through after a brilliant intermediate play by Fiji.
Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game was long in favour of the South Seas islanders, whose fans sang, flags waved and danced on the stage.
It was not difficult to admire Fiji's playful approach.
Mata Viliame put the i-dowel with another attempt in the last seconds.
The Pfiff sounded, the Fijis hugged and GB kicked to death in the lawn.
Earlier in the day Fiji had defeated Japan in the semifinals with 20-5 and Great Britain pushed South Africa into a tight semifinal match from the race - Great Britain's transformation of the difference.
Kyle Brown brought the box forward in the first half, but Dan Norton broke the line with an impressive footwork and scored a goal among the posts in the second half.
A brilliant late tackling by Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-sided team, secured the win - and thus the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by battle with the cancer of the coach for rowing victory
There will be no more emotional gold than in these games and that's what it means.
From the first rowing to the last, 220 hard hieve that goes into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.
Although it was only the two who sat on the rower, there were three voices in the boat. The echo of coach Robin Williams, was omnipresent when they rowed the second Olympic gold in the two without taxwoman in a row in succession, the first women in the history of British sports who set such a scale.
Her dominance was absolute, at least her 39th unbeaten commitment, which is also unprecedented.
What we see are two brilliant athletes who glide across the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not reflect the kind of triumph to all.
Behind every gold in the row is a battalion of willing helpers who contribute to the incremental progress that makes the difference and it was no more helpful than the coach who did not know 30 months ago if he would survive this day at all than was diagnosed with cancer.
Like he said, he's a little risky.
I had bladder cancer, which is operable, and they did.
If you don't, he'll spread everywhere.
It would have been a pretty bad situation.
It changes the view a little.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio was lucky that he was able to start treatment at the beginning of 2014, outside the season, which kept the interruption to a minimum, if under such circumstances this is the correct term at all.
I needed money, so I had to get better soon.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suffice.
That's how it starts.
Rowing in itself is already a challenge, but that makes it an even bigger one.
In the instantness of the victory went her first thoughts to Williams, who spent a nervous morning talking a little more than usual and trying to process his own fears.
Stanning, who was a captain of the Royal Artillery regiment in an operation in Afghanistan, said, "I was an emotional wreck this week. This may be something extreme, but it means so much."
It just repeats how much this means to me, how much I and Helen and Robin have worked.
It was three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin we wouldn't be anyone, so a massive thank you goes to him. He is the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have wanted a better person to train or a better trainer.
Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a race in the last five years.
The couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up.
Even in the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to open up, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.
We were very caught at the moment.
Helen called "Stay in the process, stay in the process".
It's really important not to get caught.
We had a good start and at the same time we weren't interested in doing something great.
We didn't want fireworks today, we just wanted to get a good result, go out and win the race, whatever we did.
The couple will take a break for a year before it will make decisions about its future.
Glover has to appear at a wedding next week, her own with the TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean to say that was my last race.
That would have meant too much pressure.
In London it took about six months to understand that I am an Olympic champion.
It was all so new to me and I was so stressed.
It took about four minutes here.
It feels so much better," she said.
31 years of exemplary clarity provided
The managing director of the "Veitensteingruppe", Ruppert Göller, is retired.
The association is considered "bayernwide exemplary".
A small Franconian drinking water association as a model for the large water producers.
So it was called in the original tone a while ago in a contribution by the Bayerische Rundfunk.
A little later, the Water Forum of the Government of Lower Franconia acknowledged the purpose association.
The work of the Veitenstein Group considered "bayernwide as exemplary".
Rupert Göller, who worked for 31 years in the Association of Purposes, is behind all this for 28 years as Managing Director.
Now he was retired at the age of 65.
The Veitenstein group's drinking water destination association, based in Kottendorf, Breitbrunn, supports about 150000 cubic metres of water annually and provides 32 places and hamlets with about 5500 inhabitants.
The municipalities of Kirchlauter, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the city of Baunach are members.
Water supply agreements exist for other cities and municipalities.
The current president, Breitbrunn's mayor Gertrud Bühl (FW), recalled that Rupert Göller was appointed water guard in 1985 and was appointed as the director of the Association of Purposes in 1988.
"His tasks have been very diverse and they ranged from water pipeline construction and maintenance work to office and organisational work, budget planning, calculation of fees and contributions, to emergency weekends," said the president.
As outstanding events, it mentioned the commissioning and inauguration of the new well (1994), land purchases in the new well (1998) and compensation for farmers, the refurbishment of the high reservoirs (1999), the repurchasing of a central computer control (2004) and the partial renewal of water pipelines.
There has been no stoppage, and there have been innovations, because water means life and drinking water is the most important food.
In her laudatio she praised Göller's faithful, reliable and correct service over 31 years.
He has worked with much heart blood for his water destination association and he has lived the water destination association as if it were his own company.
A few weeks ago, as a real practitioner, he was allowed to present the success concept of the Veitenstein Group for nitrate reduction to the Water Forum of the district of Unterfranken.
He received a great deal of recognition and praise for it.
Rupert Göller praised Alfons Griebel, who had worked with him for 28 years.
He's the best waterguard and he was a faithful button.
Together we were an unbeatable team.
From his point of view, he described the well construction and the restructuring of the association of purposes.
However, the biggest challenge and the most difficult use was the pipe break on the high tank at Kirchlauter on January 3rd.
Here, at minus 17 degrees, the whole night will have to work so that the villages could be supplied with water.
Also, the supply of Neubrunn could only be maintained once because one filled the high tank from Pettstadt with hoses.
The management of the Drinking Water Association was handed over to Daniel Stürmer from Lauter, who succeeds Rupert Göller.
Soprano Anna Netrebko is openly involved with the autism of her son Tiago - and addresses other affected parents: "You must have the courage to talk about it."
"Medicals have made great progress," said the 44-year-old Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera.
When the disease had been recognized by her son, she believed she had to die.
Meanwhile, the eight-year-old Tiago had made good progress and now learn privately in New York, where there are the best therapists.
"To give an example, if I ask him something that is two years away when I sang Scala at Milan, he doesn't remember anything," Netrebko said.
But he is the happiest man on earth.
Tiago comes from Netrebko's connection with the bass baritone Erwin scrapt.
She is now married to the tenor Yusif Eyvazov.
Relationship state in Bargteheide - Man shoots at his partner
A 35-year-old man shot at his partner in a multifamily house in Bargteheide (Kreis Stormarn) on Friday at 10:45 a.m. and injured her to death.
"The man himself called us and said that he had shot his partner," said a police spokeswoman.
The perpetrator was on the run, and after him was publicly found.
Meanwhile, nationwide, since Sven S. could be on the road by car.
The man is about six feet tall, muscular, brownish and has a glass.
Meanwhile, the police have published a photo of him.
However, it is a few years old.
In the meantime, the man wears a glass.
The man should not be addressed directly.
He could still carry the gun with him, the police say.
If you see Sven S., call the 110.
The police are talking about a "relationship state".
The victim was born in 1988, the perpetrator in 1981.
The police responsible in Lübeck initially did not want to provide any information about the tantrum or the relationship between perpetrators and victims; however, they confirmed that a person had been killed.
"It's a murder crime."
"We don't say more at the moment," said a police spokeswoman in Lübeck.
According to eyewitnesses, there was a Special Command (SEC) at the scene of the crime.
Steel - light vision for the German steel industry
The crisis-stricken and energy-intensive German steel industry is spared at an additional cost of millions.
Financial burdens that threatened the sector from the eco-electricity promotion are off the table.
It remains in the liberation from the renewable energy surplus of the existing plants for so-called self-electricity production in the German steel industry, said Federal Minister for Economic Affairs Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" (WAZ, Friday issue).
"I'm really glad we could finally achieve this after two years of tough negotiations."
The European Commission had therefore initially planned to ask steel producers to pay for their own consumption to use the gases from the blast furnace for electricity generation.
According to the German Industry Association, the steel industry was at risk of additional costs ranging from EUR 120 million to EUR 240 million per year.
Gabriel told WAZ that there was now a principle agreement with the EU Commission after discussions with Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.
Only when the generators are replaced in the steelworks will an EEC levy of 20 percent be applied.
But neither is this raised in the steel industry.
The IG Metall welcomed Germany's agreement with the EU Commission on the generation of own electricity.
This will largely determine the status quo of the previous scheme.
Special importance is attached to Gabriel's successful efforts in the steel industry.
"With regard to our 'Steel Is Future' campaign, this is a first step."
"More must follow."
"Climatic and employment targets should also be considered in the reform of emissions trading," said IG Metall-Chef Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt.
The steel industry in Europe has been suffering from overcapacity and significant price pressure since the financial crisis of 2008.
Last year, the situation worsened further when the world's largest producer country in China, in view of the weakening domestic demand, threw massive steel on the world market.
European producers charge Chinese steel companies price dumping.
During this spring, the situation has relaxed somewhat.
On the one hand, import duties imposed on imports of steel have an effect, and on the other hand, the economic prospects in China have been clarified.
It is unclear how sustainable the price recovery is.
The German industry primer Thyssenkrupp remained cautious on Thursday.
Last but not least, prices would have stagnated.
The industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.
Thyssenkrupp did not want to exclude the closures of individual works at last.
At the end of 2015, some 86000 people were employed in the German steel industry.
In July, despite rising prices and increasing orders, German steel producers remain cautious.
With 3.4 million tonnes, they produced well six percent less crude steel than in the previous month, as the Steel Association announced on Friday.
After a short increase in May, the quantity produced now went down the second month in a row.
Since the beginning of the year, production has been below the previous year's level by two percent.
In the coming months, the association will expect an increase in emissions due to an improved order situation.
Community, mind, health: singing does seniors well
The singing has been with Ursel Kipp her whole life: as a young girl she was in a school choir, in her teaching degree she took the subject of music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a senior choir.
"Singing moves me - emotionally and physically," she describes.
After a test she feels balanced, cheerful and overall more alive, she says.
By the way, she does something good to her health and mind.
Because Singen is a great hobby for seniors right from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler from the Deutsche Seniorenliga.
Most seniors sing in the choir and share the joy of music with like-minded people, says Hackler.
Through regular association, seniors can establish and maintain social contacts.
Because often social and family structures dissolve in old age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.
This experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir: "To agree and organize, to be able to rely on the others and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together".
Singing can be challenging in a positive sense, says Hackler.
Because in doing so, seniors train a deep and controlled breathing.
Anyone who regularly demands his lung does not get out of the breath so quickly in everyday life.
Even if it's about getting the sound of the voice at the age, singing is an optimal hobby.
Singing often has a very special effect on older people, says Ursula Lenz of the Federal Labour Association of the Senior Organisations.
In the older generations the joint singing had a much higher priority, it was part of everyday life, both in school and in leisure, she explains.
Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs in older people arouses many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth.
Through lyrics and melodies in particular, even people with a disease think of long-standing events.
In addition, the singing requires a special performance for the head, explains Lenz.
At the same time, focus on your own voice and on a predefined rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.
Especially older people living alone practice this way, not just focusing on themselves.
Another positive aspect is the recognition of singing in the choir, says Hackler.
An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.
The self-esteem also grows by singing in the choir.
Show yourself: If I practice for a long time, I get better and grow beyond myself - this experience strengthens.
So there's enough good reasons to start singing.
Anyone who wants to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks he has little talent, advises Lenz.
You don't sing alone - with 50 people singing, who hears when a sound goes by?
Looking for the right offer, seniors have different opportunities, says Hackler.
If someone from the circle sings in a senior choir, you can just join in.
Many cities also offer overviews of the choirs in the area.
Those who want to sing in an ecclesial choir can contact the church or the head of the church directly.
Many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet.
If you do not have access to the Internet, the family, friends or neighbors can ask for help in Internet searches.
Whoever wants to sing should definitely join a choir, advice Hackler.
Singing does the soul well and has something liberating - that applies to any age.
Cats react more sensitively than cats to the cries of the young
Biologists in Hanover have investigated the effect of calling cat babies on adult animals.
To their surprise, the Miauen also did not leave the males cold - but they were always the same in contrast to the females.
Female cats can see the excitement of cat babies at the Miauen of the Little Ones.
They react by ten percent faster to the sounds of kittens who are in great need, as scientists from the Veterinary College and the Hannover Medical University (MHH) have found out.
Kater also responds to the calls of kittens - but always the same.
"The acoustic differences between the Miauen of less and strongly excited young animals are either not perceptible or not significant to the males," said biologist Wiebke Konerding of the MHH.
She is the first author of the study, which was published this Friday in the "BMC Evolutionary Biology" magazine.
In a previous study, the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the kitten screams differed with the urgency of their need for help.
A total of nine adult cats and eight kittens from the animal husbandry of the MHH were observed.
On the one hand, they were played by little ones who were taken out of the litter box for three minutes and separated from mother and siblings.
On the other hand, they were confronted with cries of more excited kittens, who were raised up in addition.
Despite the small sample, the researchers consider their results to be significant.
"All women, even those who had no offspring of their own, responded differently to the cries," Konerding said.
They turned to the speaker faster when these calls of the very excited kittens played.
This ability may have been inborn or developed with sexual maturity.
"A surprise was that the males had ever responded," said the biologist.
In the past, scientists have already repeatedly investigated the reactions of women and men to baby noises in humans.
Some studies also showed that women reacted more sensitively to infants, whether they were mothers or not, the biologist Marina Scheumann reported.
Podolski handles Supercup with "Gala"
Hakan Sükür is a football legend in Turkey.
In Turkey, a warrant has been issued against former football star Hakan Sükür.
He is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
An important football game takes place in Turkey for the first time after the coup attempt.
Before the duel of the archrivals between Besiktas Istanbul and Lukas Podolskis Galatasaray Istanbul around the Supercup in Konya, the official line is clear: "Business as usual" is fashionable.
Even when the state of emergency was imposed after the July assassination attempt, the government claimed that the everyday life of ordinary citizens should not be affected.
But this does not apply to those who are suspected of belonging to the movement of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, who is responsible for the coup attempt.
Even before the football game, they don't stop.
The prosecution issued a warrant against the former Starkicker Hakan Sükür.
Thus, the Sukuur, now living in America, is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
Sükür is to be a follower of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, who is being held responsible by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for the coup attempt.
Although the first state of emergency imposed for 90 days is still valid until October, this actually has no impact on the lives of most Turks.
The nightly "democracy-watching" in public places throughout the country, Erdogan declared it closed on Wednesday.
Like the whole country, sport is divided into followers and opponents of Erdogan.
Especially fans of the workers' club Besiktas are traditionally not one of the president's friends.
But what is common to the great Turks in the face of dramatic experiences in history is the strict rejection of military coups.
There even the fans agree with each other - whether their hearts beat for Galatasaray or Besiktas.
Lukas Podolski will be particularly popular with the "Gala" cup winner.
The Cologneer demonstrated its sporting value in the end of the season: With 17 goals and nine templates in all competitions, the 31-year-old finished his first playing time as the top scorer of his club.
In the final game against Fenerbahce, he scored the 1:0 win hit.
The newspaper "Fanatik" cheered him: "He was the best in the place."
He finished the season in an excellent way and secured his team's trophy.
Thanks to "Poldi", the disappointing season for the record champion found a conciliatory conclusion.
After the pre-run K.o in the Champions League, the lions also retired early in the Europe League.
In the Süper Lig it was only enough to rank six.
The season wasn't good.
The trophy was the only way to win something.
"We did that and that's the most important thing," said Podolski.
For Master Besiktas, the season was better.
Especially thanks to Mario Gomez, who laid the foundation for the 14th title with 26 season hits as Süper-Lig-Turschüschenkönig.
This is also why the fans continue to hope for the return of the 31-year-old.
At the same time, Gomez, who was under contract with the AC Florence and loaned to Besiktas only after the coup attempt, had announced that he would not return after his EM vacation because of the political situation in the country.
"If Mario wants to come to us, he just has to say it," quoted the specialist magazine "Kicker" Club Manager Fikret Orman.
But the stormer would have to be willing to give up about one third of his estimated annual salary of EUR 7.5 million, Orman made it clear: "We cannot pay his salary at Florence".
Despite Doping: These athletes still have medal opportunities at Olympia in Rio
The 34-year-old Justin Gatlin was already locked twice for Dopings (2001 and 2006).
Rio de Janeiro - Whistleblower Julia Stepanowa is not allowed to start in Rio.
Other transferred athletics sinners can only laugh about it - they are fighting in Rio for medals.
The theme Doping continues to determine the headlines at the Rio Olympics.
The Russian swimmer Julija Jefimowa, who had claimed her right of start shortly before the games after a doping bar, was mercilessly knocked out and bent out at her start (100 meters chest).
There was a strange scene: with a smile she was still proud in the hall and had provoked her appearance.
When it became clear that she was not going to get gold, the audience burst into a cheerstorm.
However, there are many more athletes who, despite the doping past, are taking off at the Rio Olympics.
Here's an overview:
Justin Gatlin (100, 200, 4x100-m-staffel/USA): The 34-year-old is one of the most controversial figures in athletics.
He was already locked twice for dopings (2001 and 2006 to 2010).
Since his ban, the 2004 Olympic champion and former World Champion have been running even faster than before, being over 100 m in 9,80 seconds the number one in the world and considered to be the biggest challenger of Usain Bolt.
Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce (100, 4x100-m-Staffel/Jamaika): The two-time Olympic champion and seven-time world champion had to put off a six-month ban in 2010 after she was shown to take the painkiller Oxycodon.
She had had severe toothaches after surgery, the 29-year-old defended herself.
Sandra Perkovic (Discus/Croatia): In 2011, the 2012 Olympic champion, World Champion from 2013 and European champion from 2010 to 2016, was positively tested for the prohibited stimulant methylhexanamin.
Perkovic disputed the knowledgeable intake and was blocked for six months.
The four biggest throws this year go to the account of the great gold favourite.
LaShawn Merritt (200, 400, 4x400-m-staffel/USA): The Beijing Olympic winner and two-time world champion over 400 m, was positively tested in 2010 and was shut down for 21 months.
A remedy for penis enlargement was responsible, Merritt claimed.
This year the 30-year-old is more than 200 and 400 m the fastest man in the world.
Ivan Tichon (Hammerswurf, Belarus): Hardly an athlete was subsequently recognized by so many medals.
Tichon lost his 2005 World Cup title nine years later after he was found to be a testosterone doping player.
The 40-year-old also had to give Olympic silver in 2004 for steroid dopings and the 2006 EM title for testosterone abuse.
He also won the bronze medal of the 2008 Olympics due to a judgment of the International Sports Court CAS.
At 80.04 m, he is ranked second in the world rankings.
Liu Hong (20 km Go, China): The world record and gold favourite was tested positively only in May, but may still start in Rio.
At the 29-year-old World Champion, indications of the intake of a prohibited food supplement were found, the WADA World Anti-Doping Agency's block fell out mildly and expired on July 13th.
Bomb terror in Thailand - Austrian injured - Several dead
The Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman, said the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Thomas Schnöll, Friday early.
She had suffered cuts and had been treated in the hospital but had already been able to leave again.
She planned her home trip for the beginning of September.
Whether further explosions on the holiday island of Phuket as well as in the southern cities of Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon also affect Austrian citizens is unclear for the time being.
In this respect, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities, according to Schnöll.
Hua Hin, located about 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok, was first exploding two bombs in an outing quarter on Thursday evening.
According to the police, a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people injured, including the Austrian, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.
On Friday morning, two bombs went up again, and another person was killed, according to the authorities.
Phuket also reported a bomb explosion in the early days.
At the detonation near Patong's popular beach, a taxi driver was injured after police reports.
In Surat Thani on the south-east coast of the country, another bomb exploded, killing an urban employee.
According to the authorities, the explosion had gone into the air in a flowerbed in front of the Coastal Police Department.
Finally, detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the south-west coast as well as in Chumphon on the southeast coast claimed several injuries.
One assumes a connection with the explosions in Hua Hin, it said.
"The bombings carry the same handwriting," said Army General Danai Kritmethavee Friday early in front of journalists.
"We assume this is a coordinated attack."
It is too early to comment on possible motives - but probably it is about the actions of Muslim rebels.
Thai media also wanted to recognize a pattern typical of the bombings of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.
The Thai police, on the other hand, stated that the attacks were not related to the Islamist uprising movement or to international terrorism.
"This is only local sabotage, which is limited to limited areas and provinces," said a spokesman in Bangkok.
It is rather assumed that the bombs were placed by opponents of the ruling military junta.
Over the past few days, the authorities had received classified evidence of imminent attacks in the south of the country, but they had not been informed of the exact time and places.
It is still unclear which group is behind the attacks.
The police instructed their officials throughout the country to strengthen security around important government buildings as well as airports, railway stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts.
In Thailand there are always smaller bombings, but they usually do not target tourists.
In Hua Hin lies a palace that was used for years by Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej.
Following the recent bomb explosions, the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends on its homepage that the instructions of the Thai security authorities be followed.
High security risk (level 3) applied to the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla as well as to Preah Vihair and the surrounding area.
After discussions between security forces and Muslim sections of the population, before unnecessary travel to these provinces, it is advised.
Increased security risk (level 2) applies to the rest of the country.
The attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drawn up by the military junta.
In the years to come, the military will have great influence.
Junta-chef and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said that the bombs were an attempt to cause chaos while the country was moving towards stability, an improvement in the economic situation and tourism.
The militaryunta, which had taken power after a phase of bloody unrest in 2014, benefits itself from having restored stability and order to the kingdom.
However, the military has also failed to catch up with the uprising of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country for years.
More than 6,500 people have already been killed in the conflict.
Nearly a year ago, 20 people had been killed in Bangkok in an attack on a popular Hindu scream - most of them foreign tourists.
It was the bloodiest attack of the younger history of the country.
The right "Identitarian movement" has become the focus of the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection.
After several national offices, the constitutionalists in the federal government also put the group under observation.
"We see in the 'Identitären Bewegung' points of reference for efforts against the free democratic basic order," said the head of constitutional protection Hans-Georg Maaßen of the German press agency in Berlin.
Immigrants of Islamic faith or from the Middle East are defamed in an extremist way.
That's why we're watching the movement now.
The "Identitarian Movement" is a French-rooted group that has been active in Germany since 2012.
It turns against "multicultural madness", "uncontrolled mass immigration" and the "loss of one's own identity by alienation".
Constitutional protectors in nine federal states - Bremen, Bavaria, Hessen, Berlin, Baden-Württemberg, NRW, Lower Saxony, Saxony and Thuringia - already observe the "Identitären".
Mr Maaßen said that his authority had closely agreed with the national authorities in the decision.
"Groups like the 'Identitarian Movement' are trying to pick up their target group where it stands," said the head of constitutional protection.
In general, extremists try to address them with a youth-right language, often with poppy music.
Islamists did this as well as right-wing extremists.
This is not a meaningful advertisement for one's own business.
The propaganda is supposed to appeal to people emotionally.
Young people are particularly vulnerable.
That's dangerous.
Most recently there had been reports from several federal states about contacts of the "Identitarians" to AfD politicians.
Maaßen said he had no knowledge of that.
Possible contacts of this kind are only relevant to constitutional protection from a certain point of view.
It depends on whether the respective party - in this case the AfD - changes its direction by certain people who are extremist, and becomes so extreme.
So it is crucial whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party.
This is not recognizable.
In view of the significant increase in legitimate crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee accommodation, Maaßen said that he would not yet be talking about new right-wing terrorism in this context.
But we have seen in recent years that there can be right-wing terrorist structures.
There was the group 'Old School Society' or the Freital group.
It may well be that other right-wing terrorist groups or micro-groups plan to attack asylum seekers, refugee homes or attacks from other right-wing extremist motives.
However, a German-wide or pan-European control of legal terrorism is not recognizable.
The previous groups were created at regional level or in social networks.
Maaßen expressed concern that many abuses occurred on the account of people who had not appeared in the right scene before.
That's the cause of concern.
Many of the suspects in attacks on asylum accommodation had not been known before as criminals, politically motivated criminals or supporters of the right scene.
"Many people have thus committed crimes that previously had nothing to do with right-wing extremists, who may have been politically indifferent or who have chosen, for example, CDU, SPD or Left, but then radicalized by right-wing extremist sentiment."
Rio 2016: Robel Kiros Habte becomes the internet hit
Not always the Olympics or world records determine the headlines at the Olympic Games.
This shows the courageous appearance of Robel Kiros Habte at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro.
In the Aquatics Center the slightly overweight swimmer from Ethiopia swam so slowly that he was temporarily unable to see it in the TV pictures.
He simply disappeared - no matter how far the neckline was selected.
In the social networks, Habte became a viral Internet hit.
In fact, the 24-year-old finished his career with a 48-second residue and took 59th place of 59 starters.
But it was rather his not just sporty figure that attracted the attention of the international media.
Why does the 24-year-old still participate in the Olympics?
The Ethiopian got a special start right from the international swimming association.
This is distributed to make swimming in underrepresented countries more familiar.
Since most athletes are running in Ethiopia, I just wanted to do something different.
Preparation is all: Robel Kiros Habte is getting ready for the big race.
The first nicknames quickly made the round.
Some media called him "Robel der Wal".
The English boulevard magazine "The Sun" and "Dad Bod" made fun of him.
His time, he first hit with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meter freestyle, played no part.
Comparisons with "Eric the Eel" were also drawn.
At the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Eric Moussambani's race attracted media attention.
Unforgettable was the appearance of the swimmer from Equatorial Guinea, when he had to enter freestyle alone in a prelude over 100 meters.
Frenetically, Moussambani was fired at that time.
The 22-year-old learned to swim only eight months before the Olympics and had never completed such a long distance before the competition.

Geretsried - The owner of a store in New Square has been stolen.
According to the police, 67-year-old Geretsrieder left her business on Monday at 5:30 p.m. and forgot to close a window on the ground floor.
When they returned at 8.15 a.m. the next morning, about 250 euros had disappeared from the checkout.
Traces of the perpetrator could not be found.
There is no video surveillance either.
Trump doesn't see the impending defeat of the election so closely.
The Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is speaking at an election event in Florida.
If there's nothing to do with the election to the U.S. President, Donald Trump already has an alternative idea.
He'll go on vacation.
If Donald Trump lost the US presidential election in November, he would not care: "Finally, it will either work, or I have a very, very nice, long holiday," said the Republican candidate in a telephone interview with the US TV channel CNBC.
If it was not enough for him at the end for reasons of political correctness, that would be all right, said Trump.
He called the US President Barack Obama and the Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton the founder of the Islamic State Terrorist militia (IS).
Within his party, more and more resistance was formed.
Post enters the trade with electric transporters
An electric auxiliary vehicle of the Deutsche Post in action.
The interest of other companies in the vehicle is obviously high.
The post office is also planning to sell their electric vehicle StreetScooter.
In the near future, the Group intends to start trading with the transporter.
The post office wants to offer its electric transporters on the free car market from next year.
"We want to start selling to third parties," said a post-speaker on Friday.
For months, the company has been testing whether to sell their own developed StreetScooter, with which letters and packages are delivered, to other companies as well.
Post-Chancellor Jürgen Gerdes had said that there were always demands, for example of craftsmen.
According to information from the news magazine "Der Spiegel", the Bonner Group is about to enter the mass production of the vehicles.
In the post-own production, the company plans the construction of up to 10,000 cars per year and shift.
Gerdes had announced that the Group wanted to significantly expand its fleet of electric cars and in the long run, it would suggest a complete change to the environmentally friendly vehicles.
"We will take a very, very robust step towards 2020," he said at the end of July.
I can imagine we're changing the entire fleet.
The StreetScooter has been active on Germany's streets since 2014.
GfK management resigns after disappointing business figures
The consumer research company GfK exchanges its boss Matthias Hartmann.
The resignations came suddenly - but not quite surprising.
The difficult situation of the market research company GfK suggested that the chair of CEO Matthias Hartmann is becoming all the more uncertain, the longer the successes promised by him remain.
Turbulence at the head of the Nürnberg market research company GfK: After disappointing business figures and the resignation of the company management, the global number five of the industry is facing a new start.
GfK CEO wants to leave the company at the end of the year.
The Chairman of the GfK Supervisory Board Arno Mahlert is already leaving the Supervisory Board with effect from 12 September.
As early as 1 September, the management board member Gerhard Hausruckinger informed the company.
He should officially assume the function of a "responsor" until a successor was found for Hartmann.
As a reason for resignation, the company called "different views" on the long-term direction of business policy.
Details didn't want to mention a company speaker on Friday.
Who will lead the market research company in the future is still unclear.
In investor circles it was said on Friday that the shareholders were most disappointed by the continued success of the restructuring launched years ago.
Mr. Hartmann has been at the GfK-Spitze since 2011.
"The fruits of the restructuring are not yet to be seen after 5 years," it said.
Given the last bad GfK business figures, any shareholder will at some point become uneasy.
"If this were the case with BMW, the Quantets would do the same," it said.
After setbacks in the previous quarters, the company had not been able to stop its loss journey even in the second quarter of 2016.
With EUR 361.2 million, sales were 6.1 percent below the level of the comparable quarter of the previous year.
With respect to the first half of the year, sales fell by 3.4 percent with EUR 721.2 million.
Profits in the second quarter have mainly affected the company's decline in value in view of its difficult economic situation.
The company depreciation of 139 million euros became necessary in the Consumer Experience business segment provided the Group with a loss of 148.2 million euros.
In the second quarter of 2015, GfK generated a further Group profit of 19.7 million.
Accidents - Bus slides in corner of curvature in trenches: Eight injured
On Thursday, eight people were injured in Krummhörn, Aurich County, in the event of an accident involving 43 senior passengers.
Two of the inmates suffered serious injuries, the police reported.
According to the report, the 66-year-old driver of the bus of a travel company from Eisenach had to avoid an oncoming truck that was partly on the counterrail.
The bus came off the road to the right and slipped into a ditch, as a police spokeswoman Aurich/Wittmund reported.
"Because of the location of the bus, people could not leave the bus on their own," she said.
The fire department freed the inmates.
Six rescue cars and an emergency car arrived at the accident site on Landesstraße 2.
The uninjured travelers were brought back from a bus to the Pewsum district of the Krummhorn.
There they should wait for a replacement bus from the travel company.
The investigators asked the trucker and possible witnesses to report to the police.
The fees per cubic metre of waste water for the waste water treatment plant Neudorf/Reuth/Welschenkahl 3.44 instead of 2.10 Euro; for Zultenberg/Lindenberg/Lopp 3.36 Euro (up to 2.26 Euro) and for Azendorf 3.64 Euro (up to 2.18 Euro).
At the plant in Azendorf, the waste water fee will increase at the latest when appropriate improvement measures are necessary.
After over-calculating, the waste water price in Azendorf will then be 4.37 euros per cubic metre.
As Mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, when authorising the budget by the Landratsamt Kulmbach, it was found that there are undercovers for these wastewater treatment plants.
On the basis of legal bases, the Kasendorf market is obliged to operate the facilities on a cost-effective basis.
From 1 October 2016, the citizens as well as the commercial and industrial companies from Welschenkahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to take a deeper look at the wallet.
The increase in fees is between 48 and 67 percent.
As indicated by the board’s managing director, Herbert Schmidt, a recalculation of the fees for the wastewater treatment plants of the market community was necessary.
In the period from October 2016 to September 2020, there were also over- or under-covers from the previous calculation period.
The significant increase in fees was due to Schmidt's fact that all three wastewater treatment plants were relatively small facilities with a very small waste water attack, which was between 6800 and 12000 cubic metres per year.
Thus, due to the low distribution base, for example, expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact.
In addition, the volume of waste water in all three plants was slightly reduced.
Furthermore, not least in the past calculation period for all three plants due to their age, renovation and repair costs were incurred to a significant extent.
The plant in Azendorf is almost 30 years old, the plants for Welschenkahl, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp are almost 20 years old.
Schmidt pointed out that in the waste water plant Azendorf the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to damage.
At the Welschenkahl pump plant, the almost 20-year-old conveyor systems had to be overhauled from ground to ground, and at the Lopp pond sewage treatment plant, after almost 20 years of operation, the first sewage treatment pond had to be excavated, the sewage sludge was disposed of and an additional ventilation facility was installed in order to be able to comply with the water regulations in the future.
Schmidt said: "To these extraordinary expenses came the continuing maintenance and maintenance costs to be taken into account in the new calculation period."
The same applies to electricity costs, which in the previous calculation in 2011/2012 were still significantly below the current level.
Stonehouses made it clear that in the case of a small waste water attack in the three plants, the costs of operation and maintenance are "fully passed through".
In addition, Schmidt added that the market community has been spared major entertainment costs in wastewater treatment plants over the past 20 years.
In the view of Steinhäuser, the situation for these plants will remain precarious in the long term, since the supply area of the waste water destination association Friesenbachtal cannot be extended by these plants because they are deficit facilities.
Bulgaria accounts for the first time in 8 months of inflation
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1% on a monthly basis in July.
This is the highest value (since June 2012) and the first above zero since October last year, when positive 0.2% were booked.
The annual average inflation of the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was -0.8% as measured by the CPI.
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101.0%, i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0%.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) was -0.2% and annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -0.2%.
In July 2016, a price increase of the following groups of consumer goods was observed compared to the previous month: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%); transport (1.8%); leisure and culture (6.3%); restaurants and hotels (1.2%); various goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell for clothing and shoes (2.2%); furniture, household appliances and routine maintenance (0.5%); health (0.1%).
Prices remained as in the previous month for alcoholic beverages and tobacco; dwellings, water, electricity, gas and other fuels; communication; and education unchanged.
Snapchat "Anime" effect criticized as Asian cartoon
Snapchat says that this filter is an anime-inspired, but some observers say it is insensitive to breeds.
With its filter tool, Snapchat enables around 150 million daily users to change reality and to play with identities in such a way that limits themselves to absurdity.
You can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Lichtenstein painting.
The filters are unleaded, property distorting tools that generate more than 30 million improved selfies per day.
All mistakes are made to the public.
Snapchat filters have been criticising themselves in the past, in which they were accused of promoting or promoting white skin as a beauty ideal.
This week, when some users proposed a filter that gave them loop eyes, false teeth and bloated cheeks, some critics called it a racist cartoon of Asians - "Yellow Face".
They wondered if these repeated controversy pointed to a larger problem that the company has with diversity.
The news and outrage were widespread on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, one day after Snapchat announced that it had disabled the feature.
The company offered an apology: The filter was a tribute to anime characters and was not thought to be a cartoon of Asians.
But outsiders who have experienced racism reminded the filter of hurtful clichés.
Others strongly rejected the anime comparison.
In an e-mail, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet was widely spread over the photos, wrote that the filter was "harmful and uncomfortable to say."
She added that "it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very reprehensible Asian caricature and the filter effects.
It shows that the filter is not yellow-faced, but that the yellow face has been pulled into the degrading extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural barbed wire.
American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity and integration struggle, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in our hands.
And Snapchat's large audience of young people - who are more diverse in race than their older counterparts - could be more likely to expect sensitivity.
If one of Snapchat's filters creates an image that is offensive to a user, "it is much more difficult that such things remain unnoticed than it used to be," said 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.
On Thursday, Zhu, who works as a product manager and engineer for medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account, others asked to do the same.
In an essay for medium and in a phone interview, she said that she believes that racial controversy reflects a lack of diversity in Snapchat's recruitment practices.
Zhu criticized the mostly white, male leadership and ended her essay with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
"either she has no different representation of people with different skin colors in her workforce so that they can make such decisions," said the Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have people with different skin colors who work there, but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say something against."
Others share their opinion, a complaint that Snapchat has left largely unanswered.
The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the cultural backgrounds of his employees, but according to one speaker, the company recently hired a human resources officer who focuses on underrepresented populations and on internal integration efforts.
Zhu, for her part, said that she would close her Snapchat account and added, "I wonder if she needs more users like us to be able to say that this is not OK."
Military leadership falsifies ISIS intelligence information, notes Congress Committee
Military members of the United States Central Command changed intelligence information to draw a more optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic state in Iraq and Syria when it would have allowed the actual conditions on the spot, a congress investigation committee reported in a report on Thursday.
The preliminary report, prepared by a task force of the Republican members of the Armed Forces Committee, the Secret Service Committee and the Military Budget Committee, reports great dissatisfaction among Central Command intelligence analysts who reported how senior officers changed their assessments of the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State.
The Central Command, in short Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls the U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"Nachrichtdienstinformation, which was typically cut off by high-level Centcom commanders, regularly drew a more positive picture of American efforts against terrorism than it would have allowed for the actual conditions on the ground and were consistently more positive than analyses of other news services," one newspaper article quoted the report.
"What happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," said Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives.
The leadership errors in the Centcom range to the top of the organization.
The 10-page report presents in detail persistent problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of the Iraqi armed forces.
Although there is no direct indication that government leaders under Obama have given instructions to change the reports, it shows how analysts were under pressure to draw a more optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic state, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
"During the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and statements before Congress were significantly more positive than they correspond to the facts," the report noted.
For example, a Centcom member publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mossul could begin in April or May 2015.
Mossul, Iraq's second largest city, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"After months of investigation, so much is clear." said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congressman from Kansas, in a statement.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the Central Command's tops changed the news reports in order to reduce the risk from ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans brought the Task Force to life after they were told that analysts were concerned about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State.
The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings while the investigations continue.
In addition, further investigations of Centcom reports by the General Inspector of the Ministry of Defence are under way.
Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday, which were consistent with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.
"In 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an excessively limited process for the production of intelligence assessments of ISIL and Iraqi security services," said the senior committee member, member of the Adam B. Schiff House, in a statement.
This process, said Mr. Schiff, "delayed the publication of intelligence reports," damaged morals among analysts and "provided excessive room for dissenting opinions."
But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats stated that they had found no evidence of a White House intervention by the Centcom analysts regarding a "certain political opinion".
The preliminary results of the congress investigations were published on Tuesday by "The Daily Beast".
Last August, the New York Times reported investigations by the Pentagon's general inspector, who was admitted after complaints by Centcom analysts.
Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon press spokesperson, stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on Congress reports while the investigator-general's investigations were still ongoing.
But he also stated that "experts sometimes have quite divergent opinions about the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defence welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence."
The investigations have repercussions beyond the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (a claim made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence).
However, the accusations made last year raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.
Criticism regarding the secret information about the Islamic State reminds us of disputes over ten years ago when a Centcom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a paper on how the then government under George W. Bush, contrary to the recommendations of many analysts, provided only a small crew force in Iraq and spent little time thinking about the consequences of the 2003 invasion.
Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the uprising against the current reporting on the Islamic State.
Last year, Mr. Hooker's team stated that, contrary to government statements, air strikes against the Islamic State's refineries would not have a significant impact on the terrorist group's financial situation, since these provisional refineries would have started to sell oil on the black market.
However, this finding was not published, the Times reported in September.
Centcom's then commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the legislature for his excessively positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel at the Central Command.
The U.S. wins fourth match in women's field hockey, a showdown with Britain is ahead
One day after she shot three goals during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two goals for the American women's field hockey team in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3-0.
Five goals in two games should actually represent a memorable achievement, but Bam (27) said she could not remember having ever done that.
"I have no idea," she said.
I'm not one of the people who keeps their gates in memory.
However, she knows this: the Americans are at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are equally in their group with the British in the first place, which remain unbeaten after their 2-0 victory against Japan.
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.
Both teams have already qualified for the quarter final, the game will decide which of the two will win the first and second place within their group of six teams.
The first-placed will leave the strong Dutch women a little longer out of the way that the other group leads.
Whatever the game may be on Saturday, the Americans have triggered a surprising vortex due to their success story, four years after they landed at the last of the last of the 12 games in London.
Bam was part of this team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had a hockey bat in her hands for the first time at the age of three (their two older sisters played sports at the Drexel University), at the age of 16 she became a national player in the United States, the youngest in the history of the team.
She missed the Olympics in 2008 because she could not qualify for the cadre.
Then came the year 2012, in which everything went wrong for her and her team.
The following year, Craig Parnham, an English coach of the national team, began to turn things around for the better.
"A cultural change, a mental change and a physical change," said Bam.
We didn't have the work grant in London that we have now.
We've been able to rip the rudder around completely.
On Thursday evening Bam opened the Torreigen in the first half of the game with a handshake from the nearby area.
India had gone into the game without victory in the tournament, but the team showed surprisingly tough and held the level from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into her hands.
She performed a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then pulled into the middle and slipped the ball into the gate to give the Americans a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter.
The Shutout was the first of the entire tournament for the U.S. goalkeeper, Jackie Briggs, who had so far had to book a goal in each of the previous games.
She's got a run.
Just like Bam.
"We are in a good position," said Parnham, but how well will depend on the result of the next game on Saturday.
Amidst the ravine of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the Trampoline
No matter where you are, no matter how late it is, it's the Olympic Games.
The events in Rio de Janeiro feel constant and inevitable, a race of seasons between competition and striving.
It's like the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod, which is passed from the crossbow to the swimmer to the triathlete.
You can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor in the queue in the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, who is at the Olympic Games for the first time and a women's swarm with dimples, could well have been among these well-known names sent to Prime Time, built up by sponsors and well-being TV advertising if he were a swimmer, a gymnast or even a fighter.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for gold in the Olympic trampoline tournaments.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event the same.
Further from the center, partly in the shadow, there are the sports that are not generally recognized: air gun shooting, archery, Badminton, Taekwondo.
We will always have the breast-swim and may it reign for a long time.
But if I should modestly make arguments for my particular darling, then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.
Although trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000 when it had its debut in Sydney, it has been so scarcely perceived for the last 16 years that many who I had questioned did not know it was an Olympic sport at all.
This could also be regional ignorance.
Although the USA sent athletes to the competition, it has never won a medal in the trampoline jump and had an athlete until 2012 who made it to the final round.
The Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians that for the women.
Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.
The trampoline jumping has a certain exterior charm, partly because it sounds more suitable for the unexplained ear for a clown school than for the Olympic Games.
At this point I should admit that I am not an expert, but only an earthbound enthusiast.
It has humorous potential - the cartoon shaking of its never-ending impact - but also the grace of the turn and diving, the two sports that essentially unite it.
The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, which means as much as "jumpboard."
Rising victors jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost 30 feet into the air and have to make a series of falling movements (turns, hedges and salttos) before they land on their feet.
According to the official Olympic program, they are rated according to execution, difficulty and "flight time".
Twenty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will face each other in Rio.
The most common Olympic vector is straight.
Medal Hopers must continue in their quest for gold, faster, go up and over, sometimes to the finish, sometimes back and forth, up and down on the playground.
They hunt not only the finish line or the starting wall, but also in television broadcasting another target: that of the world or the Olympic record.
The goal-oriented striving is noble, admirable, even fanatical - and it is enough to even touch a spectator to tears.
But it is also what I feel even when watching these games as something tiring.
The trampoline offers a breather.
The vector of the trampoline jumper is above.
A forward movement is not the goal.
He or she blows off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly up again.
There is also a competition here, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity.
It is as Zen as the competition at the Olympic Games can only be.
The women's qualification and final rounds will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men's on Saturday, also at 13.00.
NBC will broadcast the final rounds as part of an afternoon block on both days from 14.00.
In the midst of the Olympia Mania, they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is likely to be overlooked in general.
If the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the angling and objectification of male athletes - as the male U.S. tournament according to The Wall Street Journal recently suggested - then Mr. Dooley expects his air-strikeing new prison.
"A generation protests" in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the USA
Violent Protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrators calling for political change in Ethiopia encountered violent opposition from the government.
Witnesses say that dozens of protesters were killed during the clashes with the police in the event of a shooting.
Is Ethiopia just about to collapse?
In the last ten years it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid ally of the West with a fast-growing economy.
But in recent months, protests against the government have shaken the country and spread into more and more areas.
Last week thousands of people stormed the streets demanding fundamental political changes.
According to human rights organizations, the government's response was merciless.
Witnesses reported that policemen shot and killed dozens of unarmed demonstrators.
Videos of the protests that are probably from last year or at the beginning of this year show how security people beat young people with sticks, while they were forced to make a handstand against a wall.
The head of the UN Human Rights Authority is now calling for an in-depth investigation.
"It has always been difficult to keep this country together and it will become even more difficult in the future," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group.
According to Nigeria, Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West.
American military and secret services work closely with the Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats beyond the region, especially in Somalia. Few countries in Africa, if any, receive so much Western aid.
Ethiopia's economy expanded at a considerable pace.
His infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa.
The streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
Even though Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organizations have continually led the government to oppress - the opposition in the country was restricted, with dissidents effectively silenced.
Many were sent to exile or prison, killed, or driven to the desert.
But that could change.
"If you suppress people and have no other options except to protest, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in Central Ethiopia.
The whole youth protests.
One generation protests.
There are numerous complaints covering everything from land use to stranglehold in relation to the power of the ruling coalition.
After a widely criticised election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now controls 100 percent of Parliament.
At the same time, tensions rise along the border to Eritrea; a struggle for this tough, controversial line took hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, who have been defeated more or less in recent years, could exploit and rearm the turbulence.
Several factors explain why, after years of simmering under the surface, feelings of bitterness are now exploding.
The first one seems harmless: smartphones.
Only in recent years have many Ethiopians been able to communicate through social media, as cheaper smartphones have become increasingly common and Internet services have improved.
Even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, what it does at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people can still communicate via Internet proxyes that hide where they are.
Several young Ethiopians said that they gathered for protests.
The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.
Since the eons, the Amharas, who come from Ethiopia's predominantly Christian highlands, have prospered in politics and economy, while exploiting the Oromos, many of whom are Muslims and live in flatland areas.
But that is also changing.
"We are coordinating under a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of Oromos.
The largest protests took place in areas of Amhara and Oromos.
Many Amharas and Oromos feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray, which make up around 6 percent of the population and which are dominant in the military, secret services, trade and politics.
The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was the prime minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until he died of an unpublished disease in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could think about corners.
Analysts say that he was particularly well versed in observing early signs of dissatisfaction and using special agents to deal with opponents and make them harmless.
"The current regime lacks this basic skill," said Mr. Abdi, a conflict analyst.
Ethiopia's new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively opaque reasons to take Mr Meles' position.
Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say he does not enjoy the trust of the security services controlled by the Tigray.
Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.
The last time that Ethiopia experienced such an uproar was in 2005, after thousands protested against elections, which, according to analysts, seemed to be lost by the government and subsequently stolen.
During the subsequent raids many protesters were killed, even though it was less than in the last months and this time of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, and for their measurable progress in poverty reduction.
But obviously this did not prevent the intensification of the Ethiopian government's internal disfavor.
And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month protesters attacked shops run by Tigray in Gondar, an amharic city, and hatred for the Tigray is becoming more common in social media.
Analysts say that the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a strange position.
The U.S. government used Ethiopia as the basis for drone flights across neighboring Somalia, even though it recently announced that it has closed this base.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it does not want its ally to collapse in an already volatile area.
"This," said Mr. Abdi, "is a very thin gratification."
Donald Trump explains his claim Obama had founded ISIS had been "Sarkasmus"
Donald J. Trump tried to disperse the last controversy surrounding his campaign on Friday, stating that his repeated assertion, President Obama and Hillary Clinton, had not been seriously meant to be the "founders" of the Islamic State terrorist group.
This clarification raised new questions about the communication capabilities of the Republican presidential candidates, as to whether he was able to communicate clearly and intelligibly with the American public.
It also brings his fellow workers, who are trying to protect him during an eventful phase, into the peculiar position of having to explain statements that he could not have meant at all.
After he made the suggestion at an election event on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump rowed back with regard to the claim on Thursday and insisted in interviews that he really did not intend to indicate that the president and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.
But in an early morning tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was just sarcastic.
The tweet was the contrast to the previous day when Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews that he meant the accusation completely serious.
When conservative radio moderator Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr. Trump soften the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wanted to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate wanted to know nothing about it.
The last storm of criticism is pouring down on Mr. Trump, while he tried to direct the focus of his campaign to the economic situation because of falling survey values.
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton gave speeches on the economic situation in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Mr. Trump tried to return to this subject.
Reporting on Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring.
Mr. Trump has already brought Sarkasmus to his defense.
At the end of July, he drew strong criticism when he said that the Russians were supposed to hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but later he said, "Of course I meant that sarcastically".
This method allows Mr. Trump to move the linguistic boundaries in politics and then to row back as needed.
"I think it is one of his methods to test how certain messages are received by his fans, how they arrive, and then, if necessary, to "clarify" depending on how the reaction fails." said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who observes the language of both candidates.
But I also think he is smart enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.
Instead of defusing the tone for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump has adopted an even more edifying tone, as his survey values have continued to decline.
A new survey of NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist, published on Friday, showed a tour with great head start in the states of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.
While Mr. Trump generally tries not to apologize for his provocative remarks, he often accuses his critics of distorting his statements or misunderstanding his humor.
But while he is increasingly in the focus of attention in the last months of his presidency campaign, Mr. Trump's joke has brought his loyal associates into the uncomfortable situation of having to stand up to him, no matter how provocative his statements may be.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trump's most prominent advocates, made great effort to defend the candidates today in a CNN interview on Thursday.
"I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments," said Mr. Giuliani, so he was questioned about the accuracy of Mr. Trump's statements as to whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State.
In this sense, it is true that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called them backbenches, completely wrong and that is why it happened because he removed the troops from Iraq.
Most mainstream Republicans are trying to argue that the government under Obama, in which Mrs. Clinton served as Foreign Minister, allowed ISIS to expand by refraining from aggressively controlling the situation in the Middle East.
Before the election campaigns in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of riding around on each of his words and being biased against him.
He mocked the "poor, miserable" TV experts who tried to understand him and said, "You can't!"
Some of the Democrats scoffed at Mr. Trump's apology as just another proof that he was unfit for the presidency.
Once repressed by the price of the market, café comes back in Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a shaky café in Williamsburg where you could only pay cash, which had no Wi-Fi, but served good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, the prizes from his Bedford Avenue shop front were removed.
The Soap Cherie business, which replaced the verb in summer 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.
Locals mourned it as the last loss in a gentrifting city.
The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know New York is a change, but I still can't believe that CBGB dead, the Chelsea Hotel excluded and Verb is now a soap business."
But if New York is a change, then it's also a new invention.
A revived Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same employees and a similarly simple atmosphere.
Coffee's still good.
The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the old café, who is the owner and managing director of the new café.
He started working at Verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end.
When a customer offered him money for a new outpost, he was excited to do so, he said.
Rodriguez, 36, kept much going.
Verb uses the same distributor for the bags bought the same espresso machine model.
It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.
But Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment too.
He introduced new ingredients.
On the menu there are sandwiches with bacon and cheese and there are garnishes like capers and sautéed onions.
There are nature travel bowls.
The café no longer serves beer, for which there are fresh juices.
After nine months, Rodriguez said he noticed a steady flow of old regular customers.
"Many old customers were also repressed by Williamsburg prices," he said.
Recently on a Sunday Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer.
Oliveira, 34, lived in Williamsburg and visited the verb regularly.
Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she would take the road.
After the verb closed, she gave up drinking coffee for a while, she said.
"I realized that it was at the coffee and culture in the verb that I liked," she said.
Now she drinks coffee again, even if on this day she ordered a blended chai tea instead of her usual iced coffee, which is another new addition.
Tom Rosenthal has been another long-standing and faithful customer since the beginning of the 2003 verb.
He went there before work and invariably ordered the same thing.
"I came quarter after seven, every day, like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Everything-Bagel with butter," he said.
Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and include new ingredients in the menu.
Today, Rosenthal still receives his usual order, but sometimes he changes his Everything-Bagel with bacon, egg and cheese.
Rodriguez said he didn't resent the fact that the soap business took over the old business room.
In fact, the owners of Soap Cherie offered to make a special soap for verbs with the cold-brown coffee of the café as an ingredient.
"I think we're still going to come up with their offer," said Rodriguez.
And the traditional Polish inhabitants of Greenpoint have also accepted the café.
A new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodriguez said he intends to exhibit it soon so that his new neighbors feel welcome.
The location also has other advantages.
A local juice room wants to fill and sell the cold-brown coffee in the bottles.
There is a chance that the café will expand to a neighboring building.
For many customers a new verb is enough to get their old favorites.
Joseph Witt was a pedigree and said he was destroyed on the ground when the café closed.
When the new café opened, Whitt said that entering the restaurant and ordering a new coffee felt like a homecoming.
"I had to smell that," he said.
The depressing food of the economic crisis in "a plentiful meal"
In March 1933, shortly after his appointment as president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch at the Oval Office.
As a taster, President Roosevelt had a facility for refined delicacies on Fifth Avenue such as Pâte de foie gras and Maryland water turtle soup.
His menu on this day was a little more modest: filled eggs in tomato sauce, potato juice and as a dessert a plum pudding.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added, "It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat."
The couple live in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.
Coe's last book "Chop Suey" was about Chinese cuisine in the USA, while Ziegelman in her book "97 Orchard" tells about life in a residential house on the Lower East Side from the food perspective.
Their latest collaboration, "A decent meal", which will appear on Tuesday at the Harper publishing house, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.
They showed culinary solidarity when they met with a reporter at the Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small, unscrupulous snack in the Flatiron District, which has been in business since the exchange crash in 1929.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces, while Coe, 57, turkey with potato and vegetable mixture ate.
When the reporter ordered hackbread, the couple found this appropriate for a discussion about eating in the Great Depression era.
"Real foods were very popular," said Ziegelman.
There was peanut bread, liver cheese, and bean bread.
They were prepared from an ingredient and something cheap that stretched the ingredient.
Imagine eating so many peanuts that they serve them as dinner.
Coe laughed.
"It must have been like lead in the stomach," he said.
In the years before the Great Depression, the table was in an American household, especially in rural areas, an all-you-can-eat buffet.
Women's teams cooked for male field workers and freshly baked pastes were served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to hungry Europeans during the first world war. "A Square Meal" records the ways in which the country dealt with being no longer the sloppy country.
"It was a time when food became a central, tense topic for the Americans," Coe welcomed why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
The new budget diet was just as tense: mysterious foods such as bread and cashier rolls became basic foods, the cashier's roll as "wonderful way to recycle food leftovers," Ziegelman noted, as chefs could hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dry fruit.
Meat, which was the center of American cuisine for years, became a rare luxury.
Strange mixtures were tried out, as a high-calorie and nutritious satisfaction had priority over taste or even healthy kitchen sense.
During her research for the book, which also includes recipes, Ziegelman prepared a dish from this era, baked onions with peanut butter.
"It wasn't a popular addition to lunch," says Coe.
Ziegelmann continues: "It was surreal."
Groundnut butter and baked onions are not suitable for each other.
It was typical of many of the household recipes.
As never before, or ever since, household economists - including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - promoted the country's eating habits.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "household politicians" and the challenge of turning pumpkins like creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals.
"A Square Meal" is a feast of historical treats.
In particular, the reports on the government's response to the starving citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's Lass-me-cake-eating-holding.
While publicly praising the simple Iowa farmhouse kitchen of his kitchen, he fed like the millionaire man of the world to whom he has become.
"He liked continental cuisine like fish with cucumber sauce," said Coe.
He ate in an almost gold-plated dining room and wore a smoking.
He was wonderfully alienated from reality.
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had not asked him to make an example with his stomach.
As described in the book, the hiring of a housekeeper with no interest in tastes by Mrs. Roosevelt led to the White House producing the most boring food in Washington, but also one of the most consolingly prepared."
Many of the species from the era of Great Depression to deal with food were rejected as soon as the country got back on its feet.
The legacy is based on our continued focus on calories and food, said Ziegelman, as well as on how science was applied to food.
The couple stated when writing the book that they understood the eating habits of Ziegelman's mother-in-law better - for example, how she could not throw away food.
"She had a real fear of wasting food," said Coe.
Ziegelman remembered, "She actually made people sick."
There was the windbag incident.
After the plates were cleared at Eisenberg's, they and Coe produced a dessert that they had prepared at home: the plum dessert, which President Roosevelt ate at noon.
"It's called Prune Whip," said Ziegelman and added that it was a common trick to miss modest recipes a fancy name.
There was no whipped cream, only plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone reluctantly dipped a spoon into the tough, brown gliber.
Amazingly, it didn't taste bad.
Coe picked up a hit three times.
Like a can do-budget he said to his wife, "A few chopped walnuts would help."
Killed in bombing: He was the hero of Aleppo
He put his own life at risk to help others: Khaled Omar.
He was the hero of Aleppo: Khaled Omar dedicated his life to people in Syria.
He risked everything to save the lives of others.
Now the 30-year-old himself died in a barrel bomb attack by the Assad regime.
Omar was a member of the "White Helmets", a civil protection group that, according to the photo paper, saved nearly 60,000 lives.
2900 volunteers risk their own lives to draw people from bombed houses and to provide first aid in the war zone.
They are the heroes of the war in Syria.
Omar was the face of the group: A video of the civil protector showing him in an 11-hour rescue of a infant from the ruins of a house went around the world in 2014.
It made the Syrian a shining symbol in the horror of the war.
As a hero, however, he never saw himself, said according to the picture: "For me, this is the real jihad."
"When I die saving life, I think that God sees a martyr in me."
Shortly before Omar himself fell victim to an attack, he had spoken in a video about the last bombings in Syria.
The helicopters threw four barrel bombs over the Alzadia district, one was filled with chlorine gas.
One woman and two children died, seven people suffer from respiratory distress.
"We now eliminate the poisonous remains of the bomb so that children don't play with it," the image quotes his last words before he died.
The Assad regime's deadly bomb was supposed to hit terrorists.
Greenland shark: The oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old
It's a rare sight.
Greenland sharks usually only come to the surface in winter.
This shark was allowed back to the sea after an investigation on board the research ship Sanna.
He was born in 1624 and swims with a good 1 km/h through the North Atlantic - to this day.
Greenland sharks only get young at the age of 150.
The Greenland shark swims conveniently along the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour it gets on average just 1,220 meters away.
Only when it comes to it, the five-metre-long animal accelerates to full 2.6 km/h - and is half as fast as a seal at this maximum speed.
This life-style, characterized by slowness, however, seems to be a patent recipe for a high age.
Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal "Science" a Greenland shark that could be 392 years old.
"Wonderful," Alexander Scheuerlein of the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock comments on this life span, which means a world record for vertebrates.
The evolutionary biologist has long suspected that Greenland sharks will be stoned.
Only the evidence was missing.
Greenland sharks are difficult to observe, after all they live mainly in the Eismer off the thinly populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitzbergen.
Because they prefer water temperatures around six degrees Celsius, they mostly appear on the surface only in winter.
Researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland sharks.
They measured their time-lapse rate when they equipped six animals with a transmitter in front of Spitzbergen.
These sharks still make prey: In the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, and another had swallowed the jaw bone of a young polar bear.
They may be hunting sleeping animals or patrolling at the bottom of the ice-cream and looking for cadavers that are drying down from higher water layers.
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues have now investigated 28 Greenland sharks, which fishermen took to Greenland or Spitsbergen between 2010 and 2013 as by-catches from the depths of the North Atlantic.
The smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the largest was 502 centimeters.
To determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the shark’s lens core using the carbon-14 method.
This center of the eye lens arises before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained in it will not be renewed later.
The two smallest sharks had a striking amount of carbon-14 in the lens core.
Her birth should therefore be after the early 1960s, when nuclear weapons experiments carried larger amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.
The lens core, on the other hand, contained a small surplus of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons experiments in the 220 centimetres length of the third smallest animal, so it should have celebrated its 50th birthday in its 2012 study.
All major Greenland sharks, on the other hand, had normal carbon-14 amounts in their lens core, which is produced by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.
In fact, the carbon-14 clock for a 493 centimetre long Greenland shark showed an age of 335 years, while the record shark with 502 centimetres should be even 392 years old.
The fact that Greenland shark females only get offspring when they are more than four meters long was well known.
Now the researchers of length could assign an age.
Since one of the animals with 392 centimeters was probably at the threshold of sexual maturity and its age was determined at 156 years, Greenland sharks can obviously be propagated for at least one and a half centuries.
This too should be a world record for vertebrates at the moment.
The fact that such methusalemes live mainly in icy waters is no coincidence.
The previous record holder, a 211-year-old Greenland whale in which bacon was a 120-year-old harpoon peak, was also caught in front of Alaska.
Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there often also runs on sparflame.
So they mature later - and age slower.
In order to keep warm in cold water, the animals often become particularly large.
Because the volume grows much faster than its surface through which the animal loses heat.
The heat loss of a gram mouse is therefore much greater than that of a gram elephant.
Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.
"A smaller animal thus lives more dangerously and should focus on having as many offspring as possible as possible early," explains the evolution biologist Scheuerlein.
A very large animal, on the other hand, should invest its resources in a long life.
Construction ground in double pack
In the recent meeting, the municipal council focused on construction issues.
With ease, the board received the communication from Mayor Robert Putz that "the marketing of the recently designated residential areas can finally begin".
After the land, parcels and development questions were clarified and the applications for survey were submitted, the sale of the land in the residential areas "Strasßlweg" and "Schönau-West" (area Binderstraße - extension section 1) is no longer in the way of interested parties.
The municipal council is convinced that the building areas in the rural and quiet residential community Schönau address young families and restful seniors alike.
As it was said, construction volunteers can now report to the City Hall, and the municipal council is expected to discuss the allocation of the plots in its September session.
In order to be able to comply with requests for the establishment of other commercial enterprises linked to the creation of jobs, the Municipal Council decided to amend the land use plan in sub-areas, which was only newly created in spring of this year.
For example, in the field of underzeitlarn, the already designated commercial area is extended by two parcels towards Staatsstraße 2112.
Frankfurt benefits from Brexit
In competition with Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg, the city of am Main thus has the best chance of attracting jobs and companies transferred from London.
"Frankfurt is very likely to benefit most from the Brexit vote," says Michael Voigtländer, Head of Finance Markets and Real Estate Markets of the IW.
After the Brexit referendum, it is uncertain whether money houses may continue to operate from London from financial activities throughout the EU.
For the so-called EU passport, they have so far been admitted to the UK.
It's using big U.S. banks right now.
Several banks have already announced to move jobs.
The lobby association "Frankfurt Main Finance" expects 10,000 new jobs on the Main within five years.
For Frankfurt, according to the IMF, speak of the headquarters of the European Central Bank (ECB), which combines responsibility for monetary policy and supervision over the largest banks of the euro area, as well as other important authorities such as the European Insurance Supervisor EIOPA and the ESRB Risk Council.
Although the Headquarters of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) was in Paris, it was less important for the financial sector than the ECB.
"The proximity to the central bank is important for banks, as they can communicate directly with supervision," says IW Professor Voigtländer.
Luxembourg, while home to a large fund sector, is less able to cut off infrastructure, as is Dublin.
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the large airport.
In addition, the city points with easily available commercial properties.
"It is not so easy to find free high-quality offices in Paris," says Voigtländer.
At the Seine, the rents for first-class commercial properties were 50 percent higher than at the Main.
In addition, Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime.
In a ranking of Mercer's management consulting, the city ranked seventh, Luxembourg ranked 19, Dublin ranked 33rd and Paris ranked 37th.
Although quality of life is a matter of preference, "With its already strong position as a financial location for the European internal market, Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors," the IW concludes.
However, despite Brexit-Votum, London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe, according to economic researchers.
The power ratios also speak for this: In London, according to the figures of the Landesbank Helaba, around 1,400 people worked in the banking sector at the end of 2015, in Frankfurt it was 62,500.
Gilead receives legal costs from the hepatitis C patent dispute with Merck
A U.S. judge decided that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to reimbursement of the legal costs incurred by it in the Hepatitis C dispute with Merck & Co Inc. pharmaceutical company.
In June, Gilead was released from a $200 million damages payment for the violation of two Merck patents associated with the blockbuster drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni of Gilead, after a U.S. judge discovered a pattern of misbehaviour on the part of Merck, including the perjury and other unethical acts.
When the lawsuit was brought on Thursday, U.S. judge Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead is entitled to the costs incurred during the defense of the case.
Merck tries to compare with Gilead, which dominates the market of a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other and claimed ownership of laboratory work on which Sofosbuvir was based, the active ingredient in the medicines of Gilead.
U.S.-supported troops say they have regained complete control of Manbij from the Islamic State
U.S.-supported troops have recaptured full control of the northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border after the last IS fighters in the city have left it, said a spokesperson of the group on Friday.
The Democratic Forces of Syria (DKS) are currently fighting the city after the extraction of the remaining group of fighters who have buried themselves within the city.
They have liberated over 2,000 civilians who were held hostage by the fighters, Sharfan Darwish announced the Manbij Military Council of Reuters, allied to the DKS.
"The city is now under complete control, but we're just doing cleaning up," he told Reuters.
Clintons earn 10.75 million in 2015 and pay 34.2% federal taxes
Hillary Clinton published her tax return for 2015 on Friday, which for the presidential candidate of the Democrats and her husband gave income of USD 10.75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 34.2%.
In 2015, Clinton's USD 1 million donated for charitable purposes, mainly to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton generated almost USD 5.3 million in speech fees; the former Foreign Minister gave USD 3 million in income from publishing house Simon & Schuster for her book on her term in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Clinton's candidate for the vice-presidentship, Senator Tim Kaine from Virginia, together with his wife Anne Holton, published his tax returns for the last ten years.
They paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3% in 2015.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Caine continue to set standards regarding financial transparency," Clinton's campaign assistant Jennifer Palmieri announced in a statement.
In a sharp contrast to this, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and withdrawers in terms of his previous promises to publish his tax returns.
It is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax returns, although they are not required by law to do so.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers have indicated a tax audit by the tax authorities as a reason for his refusal.
"You're on the move," wrote Clinton's campaign assistant Ian Sams on Twitter, regarding the publication of the presidential candidate of the Democrats.
On Thursday, Michael Cohen, Trump's Special Advisor, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish anything before the tax audits are completed.
Trump's critics, including the Republican presidential candidate of 2012 Mitt Romney, have already made it clear that his refusal raises issues regarding assets, his donations to charitable organizations, his business behaviour and various other links, particularly with Russia.
Clinton has already stumbled on the subject and posted a video on the Internet on Friday in which high-ranking Republican Trump asks to publish his tax return.
On Thursday, she also addressed the subject during a speech on the economy in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what any other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and to publish his tax returns," she said to the crowd.
Politico reported that during the 1990s, Trump paid no or only very little taxes, and a New York Times economic journalist quoted on Friday a number of tax lawyers and tax advisers who indicated that this could still be the case.
Federal taxes have become a topic in the campaign.
Clinton supports a scheme named after the billionaire and investor Warren Buffett, which would ensure that people who earn more than USD 1 million pay a tax rate of at least 30%.
President Obama also supports the proposal.
During an election campaign for Hillary Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway industrial conglomerate is located here, asked Trump to meet for a meeting to exchange their tax returns.
Buffett said that he was also subject to a tax audit by the IRS and Trump had "anxiety" before the voters and not before the tax authorities.
Clinton's campaign published tax returns by 2007.
The Clintons, who now live in Chappaqua, New York, paid on average an effective federal tax rate of about 32% between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 40.5%.
The 2015 Clinton tax return showed that it only earned USD 100 of its income as a wage, unlike most Americans.
Their main investment was a cost-effective index fund from which Clinton's dividends and revenues of USD 109.000 were taxed.

Condoms with Chilipuder, Fireworks Promote Tanzania's Elephant Protection
Nature conservationists in Tanzania use an unorthodox way to keep elephants from going to settlements inhabited by humans - they throw condoms at them filled with chilipuds.
The method has proved to be effective and the Honeyguide Foundation, which had the idea of doing so years ago, has, together with US nature protection, intensified its promotion by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non-violent four-tier method to protect their homes and crops without harming animals.
Previously, many spears used to defend themselves.
Friday is World Elephant Day dedicated to animal welfare.
"Since we developed the ... Toolkit, we have been able to observe a change of attitude within these communities, while they are much more confident that they can keep the elephants from their fields without harming the elephants," said Honeyguide Damian Bell in a communication.
The first two steps include lighting the elephant with a torch and blowing into a horn.
If he is not deterred, a so-called "chili cloud" is thrown.
Chilipuder mixed with earth is packed together with a fireworks body into a condom whose end is turned to the spark cord.
When it is lit, the condom bursts with a bang and sprays fine dust on chilipuder into the air.
A touch is usually already out to chase out the elephants.
One last possibility is a thrower who shoots a gold rain fire station into the air, causing a loud, bright explosion.
City Council decides unanimously: No Kioskneubau on St. Goarer Rheinuper
Usually, the St. Goarer investment projects of commercial operators take on with kissing hand - especially the retail trade in the core city is considered to be clearly expandable.
However, the city council now unanimously rejected the request for the new construction of a sales kiosk on the Rhine near the Rhine Balcon.
"In principle, we welcome new businessmen, but this kiosk does not fit into this exposed location on the Rhine," explained Michael Hubrath for the CDU Group.
Jewish director smashes Berliner Hotel because Israeli pre-election was removed according to "Arabic" request - RT News
A French director with Jewish roots unleashed a media riot after he had betrayed him that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin had not listed any Israeli pre-elections, since it had "requested" Arab guests according to an employee.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentation "Shoah" left his trouble at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his last stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the hotel's country pre-election list.
However, the country was not listed between the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, that Israel was eliminated and deleted?
Lanzmann wrote.
Instead, the Kempinksi Bristol offers an opportunity to choose Israel via its own call center.
Looking for an explanation, the director turned to the hotel reception.
The answer he received there "shocked him", as Lanzmann wrote.
The hotel employee said that the measure was a "wilful decision of the management of Kempinski hotels."
The reason behind this caused even more anger in the director.
"The majority of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the default be deleted," Lanzmann's employee was quoted.
The Israeli ambassador in Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called this a "great shame," reports the Süddeutsche Zeitung.
We were horrified and shocked by this event.
This is really very embarrassing.
The fact that this has happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even more disgraceful.
There's no need to explain that.
We expect the hotel to "draw the right conclusions," said the official.
The incident triggered a pretty big reaction on the Internet, where people called it a scandal.
Some assumed to the Kempinski Hotel that it "had submitted to the alleged calls of Arab guests".
"Pity to you," it said in another contribution, which pointed out that the hotel, located on the noble Elector's Dam, is near a synagogue.
The hotel quickly dismissed all accusations and called the incident an "accused" and "excused" at Lanzmann, reports Der Spiegel.
"There was never a direct instruction," the Süddeutsche Zeitung quoted a spokesman for the Kempinski Hotel.
It adds that the country pre-election has now been added.
Police use tear gas & rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students
On Thursday, students met with the police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo when they assembled to demonstrate against government reforms for the public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the demonstrators.
The difficulties began when police officers tried to dissociate the students, which led the police to use rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstrations to express their dismay over the plans.
According to the proposals of the governor of the state of Sao Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, slightly less than 100 public schools are closed, while 300,000 students are implemented to save money.
Some of the protesters were seen spraying graffiti against the provisional president Michel Temer on walls.
The recent protests took place a few days after protesters went on the streets in mass to support the suspended President Dilma Rousseff, who had been expelled from office by a Senate vote.
Trade between Russia and Iran suddenly rises to 71% - RT Business
According to the Russian ambassador in Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan, the trade turnover between Moscow and Tehran grew by 70.9 percent annually.
Since the international sanctions against Iran were lifted, Russian companies' interest in business in the country has grown strongly, the Ambassador announced.
Russian companies establish existing links with Iran, while new companies are ready to gain access to the market.
Of course, further trade expansion is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," said Dzhagaryan.
He noted that trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent in the first five months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 and was $856 million.
In particular, Russian imports to Iran rose by 91.5% jumps and amounted to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $158 million.
The trade boom was achieved by the supply of machinery, land vehicles and weapons," said the Ambassador.
Dzhagaryan expects a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia for this year.
Last year, the Russian Foreign Office issued some 35,000 visas, mainly travel visas, to Iranian citizens.
Furthermore, Iran reached the top 20 of the countries with regard to the number of tourists in Russia.
One could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia from last year are being broken," he said.
At the same time, few Russians visit Iran, something the Ambassador hopes it will change.
"I personally can recommend the visit of the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, which have received monuments of ancient Persian civilization in a good condition," he said.
Witnesses Wanted: Drinking market attacked in Waldbroöl
A robbery was carried out on Thursday evening on the beverage market of Rewe XXL on the Waldbroler Gerberstraße.
With a gun in mind, three darkly dressed people who had disguised their faces demanded cash from the drink market employee and then fled on foot and probably with a silver VW golf.
The police don't tell us how much money has been spent.
The perpetrators should have been between 1.60 and 1.70 meters in size, that is, relatively small.
The beverage market is directly accessible and barely visible from the park deck of the Rewe market.
The perpetrators must have run after the attack towards Gerberstraße, Friedrich-Engelbert-Weg and fled from the gravel parking lot opposite the parking entrance by the silver car, possibly towards B 256 (Schladernring).
Anyone who has made observations at the time of the robbery (at 7:45 p.m.) should urgently report to the police.
Nagold: Play and fun at summer leisure
Eight beautiful and happy days were spent by the children and young people of the social educational daily group/social group work of the Children's Protection Association Nagold with their caregivers during their summer vacation in Nussdorf, near Mühlacker.
In the quiet leisure home Hardtwäddle, the life-loving group was accommodated during the first week of school holidays.
Several full-day trips were on the programme.
On the one hand, it went to boards with the visit of the pet zoo.
On the other hand, to Maulbronn, where there was a special children's guide in the world-famous monastery.
The third trip led to Pforzheim.
In the Celt Museum in Hochdorf, the group learned a lot about everyday life and the food of the Celts.
On the hot days, the group at the deep lake in Maulbronn, who invited to jump, swim and plank.
Culinary children and caregivers were spoiled with their self-prepared body dishes such as the Sauren Spätzle, the Seebronner Pfännle, Iselshauser-Bloff, the English-Breakfast and Tübinger Bolognese.
In workshops, beautiful jewellery was created from beads and stones or made from wood a Roman mill game.
Other highlights of leisure were fishing in a nearby pond, the evenings at the fire and the final "Colorful Evening".
On the day of the journey home, the sun laughed, and the children and young people returned home happy.
Haigerloch: Pilgrims to the Gate of Mercy
The ministrants from the Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna were on their way on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.
Four stages were taken together.
In order to bridge the time to the next Rome pilgrimage of all ministers in two years, the Supreme Ministerial Round of St. Anna has decided to prepare and carry out a multi-day pilgrimage of pilgrims.
Various pilgrimage goals were examined and finally decided for the Bishops' City of Freiburg, where this year, on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy, a special pilgrimage goal was offered with the gate of mercy on Freiburg's Münster.
16 Minis from Bittelbronn, Gruol, Haigerloch and Heiligenzimmer made their way.
The evening before, Father Storost sent the pilgrims out in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrim crosses and gave the pilgrimages.
From Horb it was driven by train to the starting point of Villingen, where there is also a Münster of Our Lady and thus the pilgrimage of the Münster was started.
The individual daily tours were framed by a brief impulse each morning and evening with various prayers, songs and texts.
On the way, however, the minis also rested on cross-fields, chapels or churches in order to sing together a song from a specially assembled pilgrim song.
The parishes of the local parishes were available for overnight stays.
At the stages Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller provided a tasty as well as strengthening dinner and breakfast.
On the second day, Furtwangen went to Gütenbach.
On the following days, the stage to St. Peter, which was the most strenuous route, had to be reduced to about 500 metres in height in the case of hive heat and then climbed again.
The deserved reward was a common barbecue at the bathing pond in the evening.
After the morning impulse on the fourth day of pilgrims in the imposing monastery church of St. Peter, it was the final stage to Freiburg.
Visiblely facilitated and happy, the minis arrived at Freiburg's Münster in the afternoon and passed through the gate of mercy.
With a little impulse, God was thanked here.
In the evening fair in Münster, the minis arrived at the pilgrimage destination were welcomed by co-operator Markus Obert.
After worship, the pilgrims were able to visit the Sacristy and the high altar.
The next day was still time for the Breisgaumetropole.
In the afternoon it went back to Horb by train.
In the end, all participants agreed that the days were marked by spirituality and a strong community experience.
Shooter Callum Skinner storms home when Brite Gold for cycling hits
Scotland's Callum Skinner crashed into fame last night in the men's team sprint in the Velodrom in Rio, when the British team defended the title of London in 2012.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow took over the anchor roll, which his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy had made himself his own. The boy spund made the legend proud when he stormed home to home a victory of the favorite New Zealand.
England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic gold medals.
They repeated the trick after taking only a modest sixth place at the London Railway World Championships in March, despite Hoy's resignation.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.
They did this in time as hinds appeared.
Hoy's retirement created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.
Skinner was the man they stayed with when they saw potential in the Scotsman who has now unfolded.
Hindes, Kenny - who won with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner set an Olympic record in the qualifying rounds, but in the standard rounds the New Zealanders won in the first round.
And the British trio won the duel with gold.
Hindes was barely back after his round, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it.
A change of strategy was a major part of the transformation in which Hinds went in a higher pace to slow him down and to enable Kenny and, above all, Skinner to keep pace.
Hoy looked out of his position as a BBC expert and noticed Skinner, Kenny and Hindes as they rose to the podium.
The 23-year-old skinner from Glasgow said, "It's a flattering comparison."
I'm just here to do my best and make a name for myself.
We set up an Olympic record in the final round and defeated the World Champions.
It was just incredible.
There is no better way to win this.
After the 2012 triumph at Kennys and Hoys, Hindes admitted that after a weak start he deliberately fell on the track.
He later withdrew this statement and there was no objection from England's rivals.
With such an outstanding victory there was no such problem this time.
Hindes said, "It feels like all GB flags on the stage like London."
We've met as a team in the last three months.
We got away so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win back at the Olympics.
This is an event, a gold medal for the nation that was won seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and in London.
If this is a barometer of our progress in the last five months, we expect successful five days in the Velodrom.
With the form Kennys it is possible that he repeated Hoy's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.
This would mean for Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (a seemingly sacred date for British sports; on that day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were also born) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.
That would be Hoy's.
Kenny will be participating in the Sprint, which will start today and go for over three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said, "I only enjoy this for the moment."
The team event is always the best.
You can win it with your colleagues.
It feels a little lonely to win alone.
Hindes said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be defeated as a knight."
It was the only medal contest of the day, but there were other good news for England.
Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-kilometer race.
They arrived at the finish line in 3:51,942.
The world record that won gold in London in 2012 was 3:51,659.
The first and final round (22.42) takes place today on the second day of the contestant, where Wiggins will certainly be the focus.
He had argued yesterday with officers before the qualification when officials called him to measure his body size.
In the corresponding women's competition, which continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie advanced in world record time in 4:13,260.
The GB team relies on its strong wheel team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to get a crowd of medals.
After a truly extraordinary portrayal of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were cut.
Dramas took place in the background, according to the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April in the midst of sexism and bullying accusations as well as the retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, if one looks at the first evening of the competition in the Velodrom, it looks quite like the now legendary call of GB, which has reached its peak at the perfect moment, could be repeated.
The future of Portland's meltdown due to the repeal of the Energy Treaty is at stake
The future of Portland's aluminium melt in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workers' jobs - is at stake, as the plant operator terminates the energy supply contract and will thus terminate all supply contracts, as the supply company announced.
This step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year not to grant any further subsidies to operate the plant.
A 20-year subsidy will expire in November.
Up to 2000 jobs are at stake in the Alcoa plant in Portland.
No less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk of closure.
In addition, there could be domino effects, as the melting industry consumes around 10 percent of Victoria’s total electricity generation.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the point Henry Melterei, which led to a closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
Alcoa's meltdown in Portland loses money and risks closing.
This step follows years of speculation regarding the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and lastly due to the electricity price for the plant.
AGL, which supplies the large aluminium melting plant with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, announced that it is expected that three other owners will terminate their contracts.
The facility is located in the majority holding of a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller shares.
"AGL expects that the plant will continue to operate in Portland, which means further physical demand for electricity from the melting industry," the company announced.
AGL continued to state that the contracts were so-called "security transactions" which should have entered into force from November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month notice period, so they will end in 2017.
"That is why AGL expects contracts to contribute to revenue in fiscal year 17," said the electricity supplier.
All potential effects on revenues on AGL from the year GJ 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong forward markets for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL announced that it had already written down the value of the contracts in its year-end of $187 million in "expectation of termination".
Alcoa said that the decision to book the contracts does not affect the "ability of Alcoa to operate the melting plant or to ensure the power supply to the melting plant".
The US company said that in 2010 it had concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, which should have entered into force from November this year, even if it still owes a statement as to why it has resigned from the contract.
Analysts warn against the potential closure of the Portland melting plant in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to the poor economic conditions of the industry.
Referring to the analyst's statements at the beginning of the week, the Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland consumes about 600 megawatts of electricity annually and about 900 megawatts of tomago.
If both plants were to disappear from the market, this would significantly reduce demand on the [electricity market].
And that wouldn't be good for us as a power generator," he said.
More than just a Kardashian reality TV star, Kendall is on the cover of the September issue of the Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of Kardashian-Jenner Clans Kris is on the cover of the coveted September issue of the US Vogue.
Kendall, the brand ambassador of Estee Lauder, who ran on the Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
"In a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover made me cry," wrote Kendall.
The cover's revelation was followed by a bizarre (or simply keeping up with the Kardashians similar?), scripted reality video showing the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (with the exception of the problems Rob and Caitlyn, and in the presence of the most popular showbiz uncle and producer of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest), as she forgets the cover of her sister and ends with a classic turn: they all have planned a surprise party.
This is the cliché-ridden act almost every birthday episode of a children's show (Seacrest brought the phrase, "You thought we had forgotten you?", with the honesty of a cartoon rabbit on a station at 8 a.m.), but Kris had to have her other girls participate in this publicity somehow.
With regard to the September issue of the Vogue, a new era of the Cardashians has certainly begun.
Kendall's big sister Kim likes to beat her as to the Vogue cover (she and her husband Kanye West were on display in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for themselves.
The September issue is the most widely sold edition of the year for Vogue.
With a scale that resembles a picture tape rather than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a large number of advertisers (Lut Fashionista was of the 832 pages of the 615 pages advertising).
The revelation of his coverstar is so longingly expected that in the last two years, pictures of the magazine have been leaking through before the official announcement.
Women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there has been clearly more "remarkables, models" than "models, which are celebrities" on the cover.
Oscar Award winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, one year after Lady Gaga had the honour.
But even with the small chance that Mrs. Jenner - described by the magazine as the "breakthrough model" of her generation - falls under the previous category, she is in good company.
These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or youths of today who know how to make a good Snapchat video (even if it all applies to Jenner).
They are truly talented women who excel in the entertainment industry.
Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the publication of Lemonade.
Of course, Jenner's success does not please everyone.
Jenner's position in the fashion world was always somewhat tense with her reality TV story.
In June, the former Victoria's Secret Model criticized Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid and called them "the bitches of the moment."
These feelings boiled up again when the news came out with Jenner's appearance on the Vogue cover.
But it seems to pass by on the point of dissatisfaction.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of the Vogue.
It is a supermodel in the truest sense of the word.
She's running for Marc Jacobs.
She advertises your founding of Estee Lauder.
You and all your sisters sell pictures of themselves on their respective paywall apps.
She sells her photos of Cindy Crawford's daughter to the magazine LOVE.
And in her spare time, she can be seen on reality TV, probably just to see her sister Kourtney and their children.
Community law centres reject 160,000 people each year
More than 160,000 of the country's most in need of assistance are rejected annually by the municipal law centres, while the sector is concerned with the impact of further cutbacks on already overburdened transactions.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly elderly people, immigrants, needy workers, victims of violence and those who have no means of unjust delegating and similar - are already denied free legal advice and legal advice when applying for them.
Legal services of the municipality, which are already over-exploited, are ready for further cuts.
As of June next year, these legal centres will lose another 30 percent of their federal funds.
The director of the Common Law Centers of Queensland James Farrell said that the last survey of the National Association of Municipal Law Centres revealed that thousands of people are already being rejected each year.
Farrell said that the situation would only get worse without repealing the federal government's decision.
"Queensland Municipal Law Centres are chronically underfunded, which means that thousands of people of important services you need are rejected," he said.
People who leave violent relationships, people with insurmountable and oppressive debts, families who go through separations, workers who have been unjustly released - all these people have problems of a legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot get the help they need.
As of June 2017, the Federal Government will reduce the budget by 30 percent, which means that thousands of people in need of greetings from Queensland will be forced to deal with their legal problems without any help.
We call on the Federal Attorney General and the Federal Minister for Justice and Senators of Queensland George Brandis to remove these austerity cuts immediately so that people can get the help they need in the event of legal problems.
Last year, the government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal aid to the national average.
It is now time to look at the needs of community law centres and their client communities and that the government is investing in this important work.
Donald Trump campaign accused after employees allegedly pulled gun
New York: Donald Trump's campaign was accused of alleged inactivity after she was informed that her campaign manager for North Carolina had directed a gun to an employee in February while they were on their way in a jeep.
The incident is described in an indictment file filed on Wednesday at the Court of Charlotte by Vincent Bordini, a former software programmer for the campaign in this state.
Bordini stated to have waited months for the matter to be settled internally before he realized that "this would not happen."
The campaign leader, Earl Philip, "took a gun, put his right index finger on the trigger, and rammed the run into Vincent's kneecap," Bordini in his charge.
After complaining to the local and regional campaign management, Bordini found that at least four more people had already had the same experience with Phillip, he stated in the prosecution.
"Weapon doesn't have to be fired to cause damage," said Bordini.
The charge comes only two days after the Republican presidential candidate triggered a riot when he told a crowd in North Carolina that the "Second Amendment People" - gun owners and gun lovers - should take action if his rival Hillary Clinton is elected and judges should be appointed.
Trump's campaign made it clear that the media had torn his words out of context and that he would not incite to violence.
Bordini's complaint demands damages from the campaign for violation of the duty of care and from Philip for bodily injury and permanent mental damage.
Trump's press spokesperson Hope Hicks was unable to reach an opinion.
Attempts to contact Philip also failed.
WCCB, a local news channel in Charlotte, reports that Phillip is no longer a member of the campaign.
No response was made to calls from his consulting company, Innovative Consulting Services.
The Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has conducted a controversial campaign so far.
Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, Supreme Court, County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Berlin/Schwerin: Survey before country elections: SPD and CDU lost
In the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (4 September) and Berlin (18 September), there are significant losses for the government parties SPD and CDU.
This resulted in representative surveys of the INSA opinion research institute for the "Picture" newspaper (Friday).
While the red-black government coalition in the north could hardly continue to rule, this is not possible according to the survey values in Berlin.
In both federal states, however, the SPD would be the strongest party and would thus have a good chance to continue to position the head of government.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the SPD fell from 35.6 percent five years ago to 24 percent.
According to the survey, the party was only just ahead of the CDU, which could return to 23 percent.
The third place is disputed between the left and the AfD.
The left would reach 19 percent (previously 18.4 percent), the AfD would be represented for the first time in the Landtag with 19 percent.
Despite slight losses, the Greens moved back into the Heavy Landtag with 6 percent (as opposed to 8.7 percent).
NPD and FDP would not be represented in the Landtag by 3 percent each.
According to the survey, the SPD would only reach 23 percent (election 2011: 28.3 percent).
The CDU reached only 18 percent after 23.4 percent.
It was still behind the greens with 19 percent (2011: 17.6 percent), but before the left with 15 percent (formerly 11.7 percent).
The AfD would be represented for the first time in the House of Deputies with 14 percent.
With 5 percent, the FDP could hope for a return, but the pirates would miss the move in in contrast to 2011.
Nokia 9000 Communicator: The first smartphone
E-mail and Internet in time loop: 20 years ago, the Nokia Communicator came onto the market.
The successors dominate the world today - his manufacturer experienced a disaster.
The device weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.
It was thicker and bigger, so it was not well in hand.
On the contrary, it was pretty clumsy.
The built-in memory was initially eight megabytes, which would today be enough for about two high-resolution selfies.
An iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gigabytes.
The "Nokia 9000 Communicator" came into business exactly 20 years ago, on August 15, 1996, and it was the first smartphone.
For a few euros, lovers can still buy the devices on the Internet, but they kind of come from the Stone Age of the Internet.
20 years ago, however, the communicator was a sensation.
The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the computer trade fair Cebit in Hanover as a " western pocket office".
In fact, the new mobile phone could be sent and received a lot for at that time standards: SMS and e-mails could be sent and received, even by fax the communicator was to be reached.
Even access to web pages was possible via HTML browser, although painfully slow.
A calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.
There was a small antenna, and the phone could be folded up similar to a laptop.
Then there was a small keyboard and a black and white screen.
The price was fairly proud: 2700 D-mark, i.e. about 1400 Euro.
The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015.
Nobody in August 1996 could imagine that the communicator would be the beginning of the smartphone era.
Since then, everything has been different.
The smart phones are a success story, though not for Nokia.
The Finnish mobile division experienced an unprecedented disaster and was finally sold and handled to Microsoft.
Today, the market is dominated by suppliers, all coming much later than Nokia.
Being online all the time, this is everyday for a lot of people today.
In 2015, there were almost two billion smartphone users worldwide.
About 1.4 billion devices were sold, including Samsung and Apple alone 555 million.
Worldwide sales with the equipment are around 400 billion euros.
In addition, the well running business of the countless app providers and the telecommunications companies.
An entire industry has emerged around the smartphone.
The decisive breakthrough to the mass market came only in early 2007, when Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced the introduction of the iPhone on Mac World.
He promised three devices in one: a music player, a phone and an Internet communicator, all easy to use via touch screen.
Apple's winning move began, and today the iPhone is the company's most important product.
Nokia, Motorola and Blackberry, who dominated the market, had the regrets.
They finally disappeared, Blackberry has to fight.
The saying now has Apple and Asian providers like Samsung.
The smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after its invention.
On average, every German now looks at his mobile phone 88 times a day.
"We all need to learn to remove the smartphone, too," said Janina Kugel, in the Siemens Executive Board responsible for personnel.
Permanent accessibility is now considered both a curse and a blessing.
England must direct the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London, but throughout the country.
For me, this was the biggest attraction of Heathrow, just as it was then in London in 2012, when we made a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games.
The Olympics brought great benefits to Stratford and the East End.
And this will be achieved again by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near Heathrow.
For our local communities alone, we will already create 10,000 new apprenticeships, create 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment.
Just as they were ahead of us in London in 2012, there will be those who will think that the challenge of expanding Heathrow is too great.
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be blaming ourselves on the world stage.
The doubters were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong at Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers every question he asks.
Like the Olympic Games Heathrow is for many and not for individuals an infrastructure project.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 billion in scientific growth and a legacy of skills and employment both for the airport and for the whole of GB.
We have a great team in Heathrow, which has implemented a £11 billion infrastructure investment program in time and budget, from the T5 - which was chosen five years in a row as the world's best airport terminal, to the T2, which was built in the midst of the two most frequent running stages in the world.
Now they are ready to deliver a third rung, which is supported by £16 billion in private investment.
The 2012 London Games were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of Heathrow will also be one.
It is time that we steer this Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow while securing our future trade and creating a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is Chairman of the Heathrow Board and former Commercial Secretary to the Treasury
Adblock Plus, Facebook in "Katz- und Mousespiel" regarding ad-blocking
For companies that earn money with online advertising, according to one of the software manufacturers, attempts to avoid ad-blocking are equal to a "cat and mouse game".
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced that it would block ad blockades on its desktop page, Adblock Plus published a blog post in which it announced that users could update their filters in the program to block advertising again in the social network.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that its desktop page would change the coding of its advertisements to make it difficult to detect ad blockades about which part of the site advertising is.
But Adblock announced that it has found a new way to bypass the new codes.
In a blog post the speaker of Adblock Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of back-and-back struggle between the ad-blocking open source community and the surrounding community has been underway since the invention of ad-blockers," and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come up with a new solution.
The fact that the world's largest social media company has engaged in the fight is a strong indication of how worrying advertising blockers have become for the industry.
Worldwide, according to a study by Pagefair and Adobe last year, around 200 million people use display blockers; almost four times as much in 2013.
With 1.03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook via their mobile devices, mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of Facebook's advertising revenue.
The company has set it aside on ad blockers on desktop PCs, as mobile ad blockers have no effect on Facebook's mobile app for the social network and Instagram, a speaker told.
Advertising on desktop PCs accounts for a sufficient proportion of revenue, so Facebook makes the investment of such a step seem worthwhile.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that it would update its "advertising preference tool" in order to have more control over people's advertising aimed at them.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblocks would be a new filter of concern because they would also block content on the site that is not advertising.
"For the users, this is not a positive experience, so we plan to address the problem," said a speaker from Facebook in an e-mail message.
Adblockers are a dull tool, so instead we have focused on developers such as Ad Preferences to put more control into people's hands.
Woman driving on Swiss highway in case of suspected suicide
The victim was on the highway in the middle of the night.
The police call witnesses after a woman was run over on a highway in the early hours of the morning on Thursday in the event of a suspected suicide of several vehicles.
The incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight.
A woman lay on the road in the dark "in an act of despair" and was hit by several cars, the police in Vaud said.
It is obvious that a Swiss woman of 49 years of age, who was driven by several vehicles, including a truck, wanted to kill herself.
She still died on the scene.
Several drivers have already been heard, but some have still not been identified, said the police who are asking these as well as every witness of the incident to report.
Gilles Hofstetter informed the Le Tribune de Geneve of an investigation which is a "logical" step in such a situation.
However, it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be shown.
Was a collision avoidable?
This is something the prosecutor has to decide," said Hofstetter.
Two similar cases in the last five years show that drivers are not taken into account.
In each of the two cases - in which a person was running on the highway in the dark - it was decided that the drivers did not have to assume that a pedestrian was running on the highway in the middle of the night, as the newspaper said.
Last year, a policeman was acquitted of negligent killing after she had run over and killed a man who was on the A1 in August 2014 near Payerne.
The 22-year-old victim had drunk and has become unconscious on the street, the court heard.
The court found that the policeman -- who had responded to an emergency call -- was operating in a justified manner and that the presence of a man on the street was a "perfect extraordinary and unpredictable situation," the judge said.
Anyone who has further information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should report to the police under the number 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus was once habitable
According to the projections of a new NASA climate model, Venus was probably once habitable.
Scientists at the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those of climate researchers.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus could have had similar conditions with its hot, waterless surface and CO2 dense atmosphere.
Scientists have previously suggested that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus might have had a thin, earthlike atmosphere and yet slowly continued.
The model also illuminated the topography of early Venus.
The planet probably had more dry areas than the earth, but once it had enough water and geographic variability to accommodate life and protect it from rapid evaporation.
Early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent matter.
"In the Giss model simulation, the slow rotation of Venus exposes its daily side of the sun for almost two months," said Giss scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release.
This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from much of the solar heat.
The result is average temperatures that are a few degrees cooler than those of the earth today.
The model produced a history of Venus similar to evolution previously suspected by planet scientists.
Although it was once probably habitable, Venus -- over several billion years -- was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light.
Her oceans evaporated and her water vapor was burned away by ultraviolet light.
When their hydrogen escapes, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect remained -- the Venus, as we know it today.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns as coach of the Avalanche
Patrick Roy resigned from the Colorado Avalanche on Thursday as coach and Vice President of Hockey Operations, leading to too little participation in the team's decision-making process.
Alternative President/General Manager of Colorados Joe Sakic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will immediately search for a new coach.
"In the last three years, I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and vice president of hockey operations of Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination," said the 50-year-old Roy in a statement.
I've been thinking for a long time and a lot about how I could improve this team to give it more depth, it needs it and bring it to a higher level.
To achieve this, the vision of the coach and Vice President of Hockey Operations must be perfectly matched to that of the organization.
He must also have a right of participation in decisions affecting the performance of the team.
These conditions are currently not met.
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked him for his contributions to the team.
"Patrick has informed me of this decision today," said Sakic.
We all appreciate what he has done for our organization and wish him the best for the future.
Roy was the winner of the Jack Adams Award at the 2013-14 Avalanches in his debut season as the best coach of the league.
He led the club to 112 points and first place in the Central Vision, but Colorado was beaten in the first round of the Minnesota Playoffs and missed the postseason in each of the last two years.
The Avalanches recorded a 39-39-4 brand in the 2015-16 season and fell behind the game for a second Wildcard spot in the Western Conference by five points.
As Hall of Fame Torwart, Roy won four Stanley Cups -- two pieces with the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche.
North Sea Oil Workers start talks again, strike off
Labour struggles over the remuneration of North Sea oil workers are being postponed, while all the parties are sitting at the table for a new round of talks, said the negotiators.
Strikes against the Wood Group oil field service provider were sporadically carried out on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group as well as the Unite and RMT trade unions can confirm that we have agreed to re-start the settlement process of the current dispute," says a joint statement.
We will hold a few full-day meetings in the next few weeks, which will begin at the beginning of next year to re-examine the problems.
The unions said that their last strike, which is the first in over 25 years, was a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent.
This year Wood Group reduced the rates of its North Sea contractors by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure.
The company’s rate reduction follows a 10-percent reduction for onshore contractors in 2014.
The company said that additional cuts give the company the space needed to get through the market downturn.
Shell has dismissed thousands of people for its part and has announced plans to abandon its oil and gas activities in up to 10 countries as it rationalises its business activities as a result of its mega-couple with the UK energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure because of the lower road trip, an economic situation that was strengthened by the British decision to leave the European Union in June.
At the beginning of this week, Scottish MP Dave Anderson met with workers to discuss one of the biggest labour disputes that have been taking place in the North Sea for a generation.
The North Sea is important for the regional economy, he said.
"In the North Sea and throughout the country we need an economy that works for many and not only for a few," he said in a statement.
In 2016, less than $1.4 billion of expenditure is expected for new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of about $7 billion in the last five years.
Kepler measures rotation rate of stars in the cluster of Pleiades
The latest mission with the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers to collect the most complete catalog of rotational rates among the stars of the star cluster of Pleiades.
The new data helps the astronomers to understand why stars rotate at different rates in the cluster and in what connection the rotation periods are with the formation of the planet.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other star clusters, we will learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.
The star cluster of Pleiades is 445 light-years away from the earth.
Many stars in this cluster of stars, which emerged about 125 million years ago, now reach adulthood.
They're turning faster now.
At peak rotation rates, these maturing stars emit large amounts of star winds.
As these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a braking effect on the stars.
When a star ages, its rotational rate begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotational rate of each star by detecting the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- like sunspots.
The latest catalogue of rotational rates points out that more massive stars spin slower than less massive stars.
Rebull compares the stars to dancers, with larger stars turning slower pirouettes than smaller ones.
"In the "ballet" of the Pleiades we see that slow rotors tend to be more massive, whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," Rebull said.
Since the star cluster of Pleiades is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities such as rotational rates.
"The cluster of stars of Pleiades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions, younger and older," said Rebull.
There is still a lot ahead of us that we would like to learn more about how the How, When and Why Stars slow down their rotational rates and hang up their "dancing shoes" as it were.
Rebull and her colleagues have reported in detail in three newspaper reports on their latest analysis of the Pleiades' rotational rates, which will soon appear in the Astronomical Journal.
A controversial baseball star resigns
The tears ran faster with Alex Rodriguez than the US baseball star in the best days from base to base.
After his emotional resignation, the 41-year-old professional will last wear the jersey of his New York Yankees against the Tampa Bay Rays on August 12th.
"I love this game and this team."
"I say 'Goodbye' to both," explained the 14-time all-star game participant of the Major League Baseball (MLB).
Rodriguez was selected three times as the most valuable player of the league, and in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yankees.
His signature under a ten-year contract has given him $27 million a year since 2007.
Until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017, he will act as a consultant and youth coach - with full pay.
As a player, it paid Rodriguez back with performance for a long time.
With 696 homeruns, 3114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ("Runs") for the Seattle Mariners (1994 to 2000), the Texas Rangers (2001 to 2004), and since 2005 he has made several milestones.
With the Hall-of-Fame members Hank Aaron and Willie Mays, only two more baseball players have similar values in the most important statistics.
However, the 41-year-old should not be admitted to the hall of fame of the baseball.
Because so successful Rodriguez - nicknamed "A-Rod" - was on the field, so controversial is his appearance outside the place.
Already in 2009, the superstar admitted to "ESPN" to have taken on banned steroids between 2001 and 2003.
In August 2013, due to involvement in the so-called Biogenesis scandal, he was blocked for 211 games by the end of 2014.
Rodriguez is considered the main suspect to have received performance-promoting funds for years through an anti-aging clinic in South Florida.
After a dispute, the block was reduced to 162 meetings.
"The league could even have done me a favor for 2014, because I played 20 years without a break," Rodriguez said süffisantly.
His farewell days also do not run silently.
While many baseball legends in their last games once again received the big stage, Rodriguez often had to sit on the bench.
"My job doesn't include a farewell tour."
"My job includes trying to win every game," said Yankees Coach Joe Girardi.
After all, Rodriguez, who was married to the actress Cameron Diaz and was told the relationship with Popstar Madonna and actress Kate Hudson, received sympathy from the fans of the Yankee Archival Boston Red Sox.
"We want A-Rod", the followers sang at the 4:9 defeat against the Rodriguez team.
Olympia 2016: Chen Xinyi, Silwia Danekowa and Adrian Zielinski are first doping cases
Captured: Due to a positive doping sample, weightlifter Adrian Zielinski is not allowed to start from Poland in Rio.
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are overshadowed by the first official doping cases.
A caught athlete would have won almost a medal.
Before the seventh day of the competition, the first official doping cases became known at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics.
The Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 3000-metre Hindler Silwia Danekowa from Bulgaria and the Polish weightlifter Adrian Zielinski were positively tested and excluded in Brazil - just before the start of the already critically viewed athletics competitions, these news are coming to an end.
At Chen last Sunday, the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide, which is used as a masking agent for doping substances, had already been proven.
The International Sports Court CAS confirmed its exclusion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon local time.
On Sunday, the 18-year-old had won the fourth place in the final over 100 m butterfly, only about 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal.
On Friday, Chen should have participated in the performances of over 50 metres of freestyle.
Chen asked the International Olympic Committee (IOC) for the opening of the B-probe and for a hearing.
The National Association takes the matter "very seriously and requires Chen to cooperate fully in the investigations", Xinhua quoted from a communication: "We will work together with the International Sports Court CAS and will accept the verdict".
For the first time in history, the IOC is no longer responsible for the sanctioning of athletes with positive cases.
Also in the night of Rio, the news of the positive test at Danekowa went through, and the 33-year-old went into the offensive himself.
"I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," this was "an incredible shock," she said to the Bulgarian TV station BNT.
She was innocent, "the only explanation could be dietary supplements," said the athlete.
According to the report, the prohibited substance is intended to be the blood-doping agent EPO.
Danekowa was temporarily suspended, according to BNT the B-probe should have already been positive.
Bulgaria's Prime Minister, Bojko Borissow, immediately spoke out with criticism of the athlete.
"I don't understand why the athletes don't draw the right conclusions," he said, "We Bulgarians are under observation, so many have already been excluded."
For example, all weightlifters from the chronically doping-loaded nation may not participate in Rio.
On Friday the case "Adrian Zielinski" was also known, the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested positive three days earlier like his brother Tomasz on the anabolic steroid Nandrolon.
Both deny the intake, but both must not start in the class up to 94 kg.
Before the start of the athletics, especially the Danekowa case is another serious blow to the reputation of the whole sport.
The World Association IAAF had forbidden the launch of the entire Russian team except for one exception because of systematic dopings, also the running Kenya produces many bad news in Rio.
In addition, the previous crimes in China had caused fierce confrontations between athletes.
So the Frenchman Camille Lacourt attacked the Chinese Olympic winner Sun Yang Harsch.
"Sun Yang pink purple."
"When I see the podium more than 200 m freestyle, I want to surrender," said Lacourt on French radio.
Sun was also at the heart of an engagement with Australian Mack Horton.
"I have no time and no respect for doping frauds," he said.
Sun had been positively tested for the Stimulant Trimetazidin in 2014 at the Chinese Championships, but only had to remove a three-month lock.
Data Claw: This is how perfide hackers blackmail their ransom
Programmers of blackmail malware currently target companies - and are successful in doing so.
According to a recent survey of malware defense specialists malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America, the UK and Germany, 40 percent of the companies surveyed have been at least once in the past 12 months, partially multiple victims of an attack using extortion software.
In Germany, almost 20 percent of the companies were already aiming for Ransomware extortion.
40 percent of the victims willingly paid the ransoms demanded by the perpetrators in order to be able to reuse the affected systems and data.
The perpetrators specialize their extortion software according to the observations of malware bytes on attacks in corporate networks.
If they are successful there, the potentially extorting ransom is significantly higher than for private users.
"We are currently observing a horrifyingly fast evolution of malware," explains Malwarebytes chief Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "world".
In 2008, most malware programs were still designed to send advertisements.
Then the perpetrators discovered extortion software for themselves.
First, private users were the target, but the switch to corporate attacks has taken place in the past few months with a terrible speed.
Ransomware works for a simple pattern: Once active on a victim's computer, it searches specifically for recently modified files such as Word, Excel or Database files, as well as for archives of images and videos.
These files encrypt the Ransomware and permanently delete the originals.
Then the software presents the demands of the extortioners.
In order to get the encryption code to the files, the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of the cryptocurrency bitcoin.
However, where the personal photo database is at stake for private users, companies are dealing with sensitive customer data or project databases without which production is suspended.
Accordingly, the damage is higher when a Ransomware strikes.
22 percent of the affected German companies reported sales losses through Ransomware, 13 percent even had to stop their business completely, in one case people were at risk of life.
In Germany, several hospitals were already victims of attacks, whose patients may be at immediate risk from the loss of medical records.
"We always say to the victims: Don't pay, you only promote the problem," explains Kleczynski.
But 80 to 90 percent of the companies that pay get their data back.
For managers it is difficult to reject the claims of the perpetrators in view of the downtime in operation.
The hackers, in turn, know this and try everything to build a good reputation.
In a recent study, F-Secure security researchers have examined the user interfaces and contact with the extortioners and come to the conclusion: The perpetrators are actually trying to build up some kind of customer service to take more money.
They explain to their victims via chat how they can pay via Bitcoin, set up or decrypt free-access support websites for example files.
And if private individuals are redeemed after payments of a few hundred euros, companies have to negotiate hard and pay five-digit sums to get their data back unencrypted.
In view of the potentially high and relatively risky gains from the Ransomware extortion, the hackers are becoming more and more professional and share the work," explains security expert Chester Wisniewski from the antivirus provider Sophos: "A single person can write a Ransomware about a week."
However, it is more likely to be three or four people.
The programmers then sell their malicious software in the form of a software builder to the actual extortioners.
The previous malware kits were created by buying the malware itself, consulting and additional tools for a one-time, fixed price between $1000 and $10,000.
"The scope of delivery includes a customization tool so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.
The extortioners then look for more hackers to spread the freshly purchased software among the victims.
We live in a service economy.
So you log into one of the underground forums, buy the set from a criminal and order another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.
Payment is made per infected computer.
"The criminals usually then order spammers to spread," explains Wisniewski.
The risk of Ransomware is now known to many companies that better backup their data.
Over 50 percent of the company IT managers in the malwarebytes survey trust to be able to prevent Ransomware using file backups and scanner software.
Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.
"If the encryption of data alone is no longer a sufficient threat to successful recharging, the perpetrators threaten instead to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations," explains Malwarebytes chief Marcin Kleczynski.
This means that, depending on the type of data, the damage potential is much higher than before.
In the future, the perpetrators could also take on board completely new goals on the Internet of Things.
At the hacker conference Defcon, security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the Internet under their control.
In the middle of winter, the release of such blocked heating could be worth a ransom to some victims.
If the perpetrators then block an entire production road in a factory instead of heating in the future, Ransomware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0.
One for all cases
HONDA HR-V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
In the small HR-V Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupé and also the versatility of a minivan.
Sounds quite overcharged, but the HR-V, which was designed on the same new platform as the new jazz, actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life.
Although the only 1.60 m high HR-V seems rather small, passengers have a lot of space both in the first row and in the fund, it doesn't seem tight at any point.
The materials of the interior are well processed and seem pleasant, only the cockpit top falls a bit.
The HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles at the storage space.
Not only is there a luggage compartment of 453 l with raised and 1026 l with folded backrests available, but there are the "Magic Seats".
This is less magical than it sounds: The back seat seats can be folded up like a cinema chair and thus offer storage space, which is 1.24 m high from the floor to the ceiling.
The luggage compartment can be loaded well, but the loading height with 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008.
The tested 1.6-l diesel with 88 kW/120 hp accelerates the HR-V very powerfully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.
However, he should do his work a little less slowly.
Happy is the daily consumption of 4.7 l/100 km.
There is another motorization: a 1.5 l gasoliner with 96 kW/130 hp.
An all-wheel drive is not offered.
The driving behaviour is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort.
But the steering should be a bit more direct.
The equipment leaves no wish in the top variant "Executive" tested.
One of the safety systems is the City emergency brake assist (working up to Tempo 32), the collision warning system and the track hold assistant.
The collision warner sometimes annoys because when he ranks many obstacles as "approaching objects".
The main light assistant works very reliably.
And the intelligent speed controller reacts to traffic marking and thrushes the speed if necessary.
The full connectivity is only available for the top equipment: 7-inch touchscreen, navi, app integration and more.
Two USB and one HDMI sockets are under the armrest and are therefore something to be reached.
The approximately 29000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are all right.
If you don't want to invest that much, you will get the petroler from 20000 euros, the diesel from 23000 euros.
The engines meet the Euro-6 exhaust gas standard.
With the HR-V, Honda offers a versatile and everyday car.
Airline is not liable: Fall on passenger bridge
An airline is not liable for the fall of a passenger on the passenger bridge.
The Oberlandesgericht Düsseldorf (Az.: 18 U 124/14) argued that liability could only be considered in the event of hazards typical of air transport.
The plaintiff had broken a kneecap at the crash.
However, the accident could have happened anywhere - it was a general risk of life, the court said.
The airline didn't have to pay the man any damages.
Disease case: When paid by the organizer
Ailing holidaymakers only get money back after their journey if the cause of the illness is undoubtedly found in the hotel.
But this is only the case if more than ten percent of the guests show the same symptoms.
In the negotiated case, a family was severely affected by diarrhoea and vomiting on the second day of their leave in Turkey.
She spent almost the entire holiday in the room.
Her illness led the holidaymakers back to a defective sewage treatment plant, which allegedly had polluted the seawater.
The family felt that the trip had been defective - and complained against the organizer.
The plaintiffs had no success in court.
Although the sewage treatment plant was indeed defective.
However, the organiser only found out about it shortly before the plaintiffs left.
He had to assume that the seawater was fine by then.
He therefore did not violate his information obligations, the judgment states.
In particular, no contamination was found in the water samples.
The illness of several hotel guests, possibly due to infection among themselves, is a general risk of life.
Of 691 guests, only 38 were ill.
De Maizière said that after the violence committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ansbach in July, many people were worried about further attacks.
The state had to consider and at the same time resolutely respond to terrorist threats.
Surely our country will not answer the violence of the perpetrators with hatred and division.
We will not allow this triumph to happen to the terrorists.
If criminals had to leave the country more quickly, however, this increased security and also strengthened public support for refugee policy.
De Maizière wants to achieve implementation of the proposals until the 2017 Bundestag election.
He also announced a further personnel reinforcement of the security forces, namely "in a medium four-digit order over several years".
The campaign for sympathy for terrorism had to be punished again.
Video surveillance is intended to improve, arms law is being revised to make it more difficult to purchase weapons on the Internet.
The last much discussed duty of silence for doctors is to be observed in the words of de Maizière.
However, in dialogue with the doctorate, he wanted to look for solutions to reduce the risk to the public, he said with regard to, for example, mental disorders.
In order to prevent radicalisation of refugees, the Minister considers that better social care is necessary.
Teachers should be better prepared for dealing with traumatized people.
In order to persecute criminals in special areas of the Internet (Darknet), de Maizière plans to use hidden investigators.
SPD Chief Gabriel said, "The SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to further increase security."
It was important that the Minister of the Interior clearly opposed actionism.
"This was an earring for the sharpsmen in the CDU/CSU," said Gabriel to the newspapers of the Funke Mediengruppe (Friday).
De Maizière had previously rejected calls from the Union following a ban on Burka and the abolition of dual nationality.
He considered that a general ban on full secrecy was a constitutional problem.
You can't forbid everything you refuse, and I refuse to wear the burka.
You can talk about rules, for example, in road traffic or for witnesses in court.
Green Chief Simone Peter accused the Minister of wanting to simulate with ever new anti-terrorist packages action and ability to act.
Left Party leader Bernd Riexinger said: "Faithful sayings and a tightening of the right of residence no longer bring security to the people in this country."
Better traffic flow on the motorway conveyor
It regularly staggers on the bypass road - here is a picture of November.
But this is to change: the right-hand side is to be extended.
This is good news for all car drivers who are in traffic on the surrounding road every night in traffic congestion when they drive over the highway toller (A 43).
The Landesbetrieb Weseler Straße will extend the right turnaround by 700 metres in the area between Hammer Straße and Weseler Straße on Tuesday and Wednesday (16/17 August).
Motorists can then thread directly from Hammer Straße to the right.
The big advantage: the traffic splits up early, thus improving the overall flow on the much-traveled section of the federal road 51.
The idea with the extended exit had the CDU faction in the district representing Münster-West.
The road narrowing on the feeder makes the drivers particularly nervous between 17 and 19 o'clock.
On working days, the backstood reaches to the bridge over the Albersloher road and sometimes beyond.
The reason is the needle tube on the B 51 just before the exit Weseler Straße.
From here the traffic is only guided in a single-track way over the motorway bridge.
The second track had to be rebuilt well over a quarter of years ago.
The reason: Static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer has the necessary load capacity to take on two-lane traffic in particular.
How long this congestion and the associated working-day congestion will last cannot be said by the competent national operator.
However, years are to be expected: because the bridge has an official residual service up to the year 2034.
For the extension of the right-hand drive, the country's operation has deliberately chosen the weaker time in school holidays, because disabilities are expected.
The traffic is passed by the construction site on Tuesday and on Wednesday.
Intercultural Travel: Cultural Offers for Schools
The international class of the forest school attended the play "The Invisible House".
The Nima's Association and the Young Theatre are now planning a music project.
The association Nima's enables young people with a migrant and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster.
The "Class International" of the Waldschule Kinderhaus has visited an idea of the award-winning piece "The Invisible House" of the Young Theatre Münster.
In the context of the "Intercultural Journey" initiated by Nima's association, 19 students from eleven to 15 years of age attended the production in the Kleinen Haus.
Since the beginning of the year, the association, which has set its sights on the cultural integration of young people with a migration and refugee background, offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster within the framework of this project.
Most of the young people in the class had come to Münster from Afghanistan, Iran, Serbia and Syria between September 2015 and March 2016 and speak little German.
Thanks to the choreographies, the scenes and video animations, they were able to follow the course of action, according to the press release of the Young Theater Münster.
The association Nima's, founded by Dr. Tannaz Westerberg from Sprachel, and the Young Theatre will work together in the coming season as part of a music theatre project.
From October to December, young people will be able to attend professionally guided courses in the fields of singing, dance, acting and music with and without a refugee and migration background between 14 and 20 years.
Offers for children and families in the field of theatre play and theatrical language mediation are planned.
The project "Intercultural Travel" continues.
In view of the increased numbers of refugees, the association expects many classes to participate.
Rain instead of star snooping: hope for weather improvement
The weather made the star snooping guckers in the southwest of Germany a line through the bill at night to Friday - but there is still hope.
The night was bad enough because of clouds and rain to observe the celestial spectacle, said the chairman of the observatory Welzheim, Hans-Ulrich Keller, on Friday morning.
Our hope is on the night of Saturday.
The weather is supposed to be good, then we'll see a lot of star snooping in the sky.
The starships are Perseides, which are among the fastest starships at 26,000 kilometres per hour.
They have their name because they seem to come from the constellation of Perseus, which rises in the northeast.
Restful Night: Tips for Sleep Disorders
In the evening you roll around forever, at night you lie awake for hours, in the morning you can no longer think of sleep.
This is all but relaxing.
After all, you are in good company with such problems: According to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults have sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep often or permanently unresponsive.
How do sleep problems or sleep disorders occur?
There are several forms of sleep disorders, and they can be responsible for a variety of causes, says Hans-Günter Weeß, Member of the Board of the German Society for Sleep Research and Sleep Medicine.
But what you understand by country is insomnia, i.e. a sleep disorder.
Many people feel that sleep-through is unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, Member of the Board of the German House Doctors Association with practice in the Low Saxon Varel.
What's behind sleep disorders?
The causes of sleep disorders are complex.
Behind this, organic, mental or behavioural factors, but also medications, may be involved.
Not infrequently, sleep disorder is an expression of another disease.
"Very early awakening is common especially in the case of depression," says Weß.
And it can be that different factors depend on each other.
For example, if you have a disc incident, it can be bad, wakes up every two to three hours, and you may start to think about everyday problems and worries, Weeß gives an example.
This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.
When should you go to the doctor with sleep disorders?
If you do not sleep well in at least three nights per week for a period of one month and are affected by day, go to the doctor, advises white.
The impairment may look quite different: you are worn out, tired, unsleep, have difficulties with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical discomforts such as stomach or headaches.
To alleviate the sleep disorder, it is important to find out its causes.
Treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioral therapy or medications - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and no more than two weeks.
Lowered sleep doctors are hardly available in Germany, emphasizes Prof. Ingo Fietze, Head of the Interdisciplinary Sleeping Medicine Center of Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin.
Therefore, it is advisable to contact the general practitioner first in case of sleep problems, weß advises.
It can determine with investigations whether the problems have a physical cause.
Who was supposed to go to the dorm, and what's going on?
For example, doctors advise on snoring with atemouscers, sick daytime fatigue, sleepwalking, or if you do not find the cause of sleep disorder, explains Fietze.
You don't really have to prepare for the investigation.
You should spend the day normally.
"Just don't sleep for lunch," says Fietze.
After cabling you go to bed at his normal time.
Next to the electrodes on the body you wear a nostrils, a chest strap and a feeler on your finger.
In addition, a camera on the ceiling records the sleepers.
How can those affected deal with the problems?
There are quite a number of adjustment screws that can be used for better sleep.
Weeß counts in: regular bedtimes and bedtimes, not too long in bed, not sleeping by day, not watching TV to sleep, not avoiding alcohol and not looking at the clock at night - then you start to count immediately, and that is completely unfavourable.
What the Jungle Camp has to do with missing medals in swimming
The former German swimmer Markus Deibler spoke on Facebook about the disappointing cut-off of the DSV team at Olympics.
In December 2014, he made his first world record at the Short Track World Championships in Doha.
Now, the former DSV athlete Markus Deibler has stood up to protect himself from his former teammates in criticism via Facebook.
"In a country where an Olympic winner gets 20,000€ prize and a jungle king 150,000€ no one should wonder about missing medals," wrote the 26-year-old on his Facebook page at night to Friday.
The support system in swimming sports is bad, but the doping controls are very good.
This means that we cannot compete with countries that promote a great deal and do not look at or even operate it on the subject of doping.
"I'm not saying that the controls should be stopped here," he continued.
If he wanted to start a comeback, Deibler would have to be reported already nine months before his first launch of the National Anti-Doping Agency Germany (NADA).
That is exactly how we should keep it with countries.
"Whoever cannot be controlled by independent controllers of WADA/FINA for a certain period of time prior to the WM/OS must not participate," asks the election hamburger, who now operates an ice-cream parlor.
Airport: Gangs of Baggage Thieves Arrested
Professional thieves at Düsseldorf Airport
On Thursday, two women and two men between 50 and 61 years of age were arrested by the Düsseldorf police.
The suspects had committed several bag and luggage thefts as gangs.
At 9:30 p.m., civil servants in Düsseldorf Airport recognized a gang known to the police from past theft crimes.
The two women and two men had committed several crimes since mid-July of this year and were engaged in joint, part-time and particularly professional activities.
The specialists of the Criminal Commission 34 can prove four acts to the thieves, who had come to Germany specifically to commit crimes.
They had taken a total of more than 15,000 euros.
Old buildings, a few linden trees, sometimes still a rest of the cobblestone pavements: The Rigaer Straße in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not at first look like this, but the police count it among the "hazardous places" of the city.
If you walk along the street from east to west, you pass playgrounds, a freshly painted kindergarten and a organic shop.
To the facade of a gray house someone has sprayed "disgusting!"
Opposite a Lidl, which is to be demolished soon, is already being built: by 2017, a house with high windows and 133 new rental apartments will be built here.
However, articles about this "trendous district", as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain calls, are best illustrated in recent weeks with burning cars.
Reason is the house with number 94: It was once occupied, the residents now have leases, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events.
Since the beginning of the year, especially Berlin's interior senator Henkel has repeatedly advocated a tough action by the police against the project, calling the area a "no-go zone" for policemen and 94 as the starting point for autonomous violence.
After the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterssmiths, had been cleared with 300 police officers on 22 June, the police patrolled official statements for three weeks that 30 to 40 officers and three local team cars blocked parts of the road and prevented visitors from entering the house with the number 94.
Meanwhile, construction workers refurbished the rooms on behalf of the unknown homeowners.
On 13 July, a Berlin administrative court decided that the evacuation had been illegal, and one day later, police and construction workers withdrew under the cheer of sympathizers and residents.
On this summer afternoon the road seems peaceful: parents walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others entertain themselves late.
In the immediate vicinity of the house projects lies a primary school and kindergartens.
Left violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in the Kiez since 1999, and Jana*, who is raising three children here, are especially annoyed by the police presence.
With the inhabitants of the house projects they share the concern about increasing rents and gentrification.
It doesn't sound like a kiez who wanted most police protection from the vandalizing left.
The trenches opened by the Berlin interior senator and the police between housekeepers and their neighbors do not seem to exist.
Friedrichshain in eastern Berlin was actually a traditional working district, which today has a low average income and a high risk of poverty compared to the rest of the city.
House occupations and the housing projects born from them have also long been part of the Kiez: in 1990 numerous houses in the former GDR were occupied, including almost all of Mainz's street near the Rigas.
While the Mainzers had been cleared in a real street battle under great police command, many of the projects were legalized in Riga and are still inhabited by the people they had occupied 26 years ago.
At the same time, in recent years, the district has increasingly become a magnet for tourists and electoral Berliners from all over the world: inhabitants from GDR times and former homeowners now share their choice with them.
This is also noticeable in the case of rentals, which have increased by almost 60 percent since 2009 in the case of new rentals.
Many of the new buildings in Riga are being attacked as symbols of this development: they are recognized on cast-in disks or freshly painted facades, which were thrown with coloured bags.
No other street was mentioned so often this year together with the words "left-wing violence".
One reason why not all neighbors view this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: According to statistics, crimes such as physical injury are almost exclusively directed against policemen.
Most of the crimes are material damage, which tend to be more likely to affect the new buildings and newly renovated houses.
For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a rental house next to the controversial 94 for 17 years, there can be no mention of uncertainty.
As far as violence is concerned, it is gratifying: the people in the 94 are their neighbors, they certainly were not.
Even the famous burning cars are no longer available directly in Riga.
For the studied architect, her street is not a criminal focus, on the contrary: "Here you help each other, live together on the road and get more from each other than elsewhere."
New builders have deliberately moved into Riga street - and remained.
That is why it was so important to her that the residents get back their streets: from the police, the politics and the media, all of whom suddenly claimed the power of interpretation over the district in July.
But in the eyes of residents like new builders, the road continues to take them away: through faceless new buildings in former building gaps that crowd out the old inhabitants.
"In the end, these are condominiums that are not interesting for many here - rather, people who are not so well-documented live here," she says.
"I absolutely cannot approve of violence and destruction."
But what if you never listen to someone?
There is frustration on all sides, including the police and the residents.
Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding for those who are annoyed by colour bombs: The house projects and the left scene were part of the Kiez.
Anyone who moves here should be aware of this - just as someone who moves into a pub neighborhood can complain about noise there badly.

Urbach: Annika Deuschle is a new refugee officer
Annika Deuschle is the contact person in terms of integration and organizer.
She is also a social worker on site.
Since July, Annika Deuschle has been the refugee officer for Urbach.
The social educator supports the management team around Achim Grockenberger.
She sees herself as a contact point for all stakeholders: refugees, the working group on refugee aid, administration, authorities and anyone else involved.
Regine customer from the working group suggests that the volunteers are more than grateful that Duschle is here now, the egg-laying wool milking sauce, which has a problem above all.
For example, some - less ridiculed than rather aimed at the variety of desirable tasks - had meant that the administration wanted to outsource the job.
An administrative expert was sought with a talent for languages and people, coupled with a long experience in the field of social work, just an egg-laying wool-milk sauce.
However, administrative work is not their central area, says Annika Deuschle.
Above all, it is about organization, working with people on site and also behind the scenes as well as networking.
The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.
She has a 50 percent post for three years.
"It was high time," says Regine Kunde, that Annika Deuschle supports honour and full-time actors.
There are big and small problems, organizational, human and understanding problems.
Soon new containers will be standing in the Wasenstraße
It has been a serious problem for some time to find homes for the refugees who have been recognized.
The municipalities are responsible for the connection accommodation.
They must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented living quarters.
The costs of the construction, rental or renovation of these accommodation must be borne by the municipalities themselves.
The responsibility changes from the Landratsamt to municipalities and job centres.
Problem: There are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.
The search has been a very difficult one for some time.
In fact, the administration does not find any private apartments.
It doesn't work up to now, it depends on private homes, says Deuschle.
Therefore, community apartments need to be refurbished, as it is so beautiful.
So soon new containers will be put up on the Wasenstraße.
But only with apartments is it not done.
Perspective is the keyword, Regine Kunde and Annika Deuschle agree.
In addition to a permanent stay, there are internships, training places, school places, one-Euro jobs and relief services for refugees and migrants who need to be found or set up.
"More places would be good," Regine Kunde reports.
Many work in the Bauhof or help housekeepers, do non-profit work - and this is motivated and very orderly, as Annika Deuschle reports.
It hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive external effect.
That's "no employment therapy."
Activity, however, does not mean just work.
The day needs a firm structure, say German and customer.
People should develop a sense of belonging.
So it needs offers such as sports, contacts with locals and, above all, language courses.
Professional courses are nice.
So here too, administration and volunteers jump in.
It is central that the refugees get the feeling that they are wanted and welcome in Germany.
The long duration of the proceedings was a problem.
They have to explain to the refugees that it takes time and they can bridge the time meaningfully, for example with language courses.
Whoever at some point develops the feeling that he can't help anyone in Urbach, can't work and be useless, he'll never integrate.
The clear majority was motivated.
But there are also problems, Customer honestly says, "People where nothing is going on." The work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always also to motivate others.
All of this is already a "mummy task".
A difficult question: Are the two afraid of radicalization after the recent events, even in a small community like Urbach?
"No," says Regine Kunde quite clearly, "what some might call naive." A residual risk could and would not exclude it.
But the helpers are already sensitized.
These incidents are also the subject of refugees.
They'd be afraid the killers would bring them all into disrepute.
"They want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regine Kunde.
Many would like to stay in Urbach.
Thus, the main and volunteering authorities in the local and regional areas must look for activities.
In doing so, they always have the background that soon a new encounter of refugees and migrants could come to Urbach.
Does Germany need an upper limit?
To answer this question clearly, politics is afraid.
Actually, it's unfair to put her helpers on site.
"We haven't arrived in Urbach where we like to go," says Annika Deuschle.
No new refugees, that would relax the situation.
Regine Kunde also makes it clear that the Urbachers are already used to integrate the people up to now in a reasonable way.
These are currently about 100 people, mostly young men.
But when people are in need, they have to be helped, both women agree.
The political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers.
Schorndorf: burglar with helicopter sought
The police helicopter flew off different areas for about an hour - unsuccessfully.
