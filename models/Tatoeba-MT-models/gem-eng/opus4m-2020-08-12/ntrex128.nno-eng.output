Welsh members of the National Assembly are afraid not to be taken seriously
Several members of the National Assembly were recently appalled by a proposal to rename members of the Assembly or AM (member of the Assembly) to members of the Welsh Parliament or MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The reaction came because of plans to change the name of the National Assembly of the Welsh Parliament.
Members of several political parties are concerned that they may be ridiculed.
A Labour member said that his group is worried about your "MWP rhymes on Twp and Pwp"
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh, twp means stupid and pwp.
A member of the Plaid Party said that the group is not naked and has proposed alternatives.
A Welsh Conservative member said that his group has an open mind when it comes to renaming, but added that MWP is not far from the word "muppet".
In this context, the Welsh letter w is not dissimilar to the English Yorkshire dialect's pronunciation of the letter u.
The National Assembly delegation, which is now writing legislative proposals to introduce the change of name, said: ‘The final decision as to which members of the National Assembly should be called will, of course, be up to the members themselves.’
An official Welsh decision of 2017 gave the National Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the delegation published the results of a public hearing on the name proposals which demonstrated great support for calling the Assembly the Welsh Parliament.
When it comes to the title of members of the National Assembly, the delegation prefers Welsh MP or WMP, while the MWP election received the most support during the public hearing.
National Assembly members have, of course, come up with other proposals, but the struggle to become a few has given the head of the delegation, Elin Jones, the main piece of work.
The legislation of the reforms includes other changes to the way in which the delegation operates, including rules on disqualification of members of the assembly and the design of a committee system.
Assembly members will be able to vote on their names when debating the legislative proposal.
Macedonians voice in popular resolution to change the country's name
On Sunday, the voters will vote to change their country’s name to ‘North Macedonia’.
The referendum was decided to resolve a conflict that has been going on for decades with the neighboring country of Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its neighbouring country in the north represents a claim on the territory and has had many objections to Macedonia’s membership applications to the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the referendum on the change of name, said he's going to ignore the result.
Those who support the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change of name is simply the price of becoming a member of the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin stop while the churches of Harlem, New York, strive
"The old ones I've talked to said that in the old days there was a bar and a church on every corner," said Adams.
‘Today there are none.’
He said he understands why the bar is gone.
"People socialise in other ways nowadays," he said.
‘Bars are no longer in the neighborhood that people visit normally.’
As far as the churches are concerned, he is concerned that the money from selling the property will not last as long as the leaders believe, ‘and sooner or later they will be back where they started’.
He added that churches can be replaced by condominiums filled with the kind of people who don't care about helping the historical places in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of those who buy condominiums in these buildings are white," he said. "And this is the day when all churches are connected, because it is not likely that these people who move into the apartment will become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white socks before Harlem became a black city - Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin Church a decade later.
The original White Methodist Congregation moved out in the 1930s.
A black socket that had served nearby, moved into the building.
St. Martin was taken over by a black sock led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who also led the boycott of the shop in 125th Street, a main merchant in Harlem where the owners were opposed to adding or promoting the black.
The building was badly damaged in a fire in 1939, but when Reverend Johnson's followers planned to rebuild him, they also ordered a new bellplay.
Pastor David Johnson, son of Johnson's senior and successor in St. Martin, was proud to call the bellplay "the bells of the poor."
The expert who played the circus in July called it something else: ‘Ein Kulturt tax’ and ‘ein historisk instrument ein versicherung öberreplacen’.
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also commented that it was the first oeuvre in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who left the church to play on the larger bellplay in the Riverside church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said that Saint Martin could not find a replacement for him.
What has happened in Saint Martin in the last few months has become a complicated story about architects and construction workers, some of whom have been appointed by the leaders of the lay people in the church, and some of the episcopal episcopal bishophood.
The Sacristy, who leads the parish and consists of the leaders of the lay people, wrote to the bishop's judgment in July with concerns that the bishop's example "would ask the sacristy to pay," although the sacristy was not involved in the episcopal judgment of the addition of architects and building workers.
Some of the members of the parish have complained about the lack of openness from the bishop's judgment.
13-year-old shark injury during hummingbird dives in California
Authorities report that a 13-year-old was attacked by a shark on Saturday as he dived for lobsters in California on the opening day of the Hummar season.
Placed her just before 7:00 in the morning near the Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel commented on KSWB TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard that good people were crying for help.
Hammel said that at first he thought only good was enthusiastic about having caught a hummar, before he realized that good yelled «yet bit me!
Something bit me!’
"His whole collarbone was torn off," said Hammel, "that he observed when he reached good.
‘I shouted that everyone had to get out of the water: there is a shark in the water!’ said Hammel.
Guten was picked up by an air ambulance and taken to Rady Hospital for children in San Diego, and his condition is critical.
It's uncertain what kind of shark it was like attacking good.
Captain Larry Giles said in a press conference that a shark was observed in the area a few weeks earlier, but that shark was not a dangerous black shark.
Giles added that good people had serious injuries to their upper body.
The authorities linked access to the water from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours to investigate and secure the area.
Giles commented that there were more than 135 different species of sharks in the area, but most are unlikely to be dangerous.
Storejeda Sainsbury's bets on beauty product
The British retail chain Sainsbury's is going to compete with Boots, Superdrugs and Debenham's beauty product and offer storm warehouse services at the store.
As part of an investment in the United Kingdom's beauty market, worth £2.8 billion and continue to grow as fashion and interior sales go down, Sainsbury's will test out their beauty products in 11 stores next year, and more shops if it's a success.
The investment in beauty product comes at a time when the shelves that used to be filled with televisions, microwaves and interiors are now empty.
Sainbury's said they should double the number of beauty products to 3000 products and offer the brand Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
They will give L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees more space and have separate areas for each brand, as in Boots stores.
The store will also relaunch its own boutique makeup series and make most of the products vegan, which will attract more young customers.
In addition, the perfume negotiator Fragrance Shop is to test the hall of its perfumes in two of Sainsbury's shops.
Online action and a shift towards buying small amounts of food every day from local retail stores means that large retail chains need to find new ways to reach customers.
Mike Coupe, managing director of Sainsbury's, has commented that the stores will look more and more like the storm store, while the store chains are trying to fight the low-priced stores of Aldi and Lidl with several non-food services and goods.
Sainsbury's has joined the interior chain of Argos in hundreds of shops and introduced several Habitat stores, since they bought both chains two years ago. Sainsbury's claim that this has increased the grocery store and thus defended the purchase.
The store's previous attempt to renew the beauty and pharmacy departments was not a success.
Sainsbury's collaboration with Boots in the early 21st century, but this was the end of the day when the parties didn't know how to share the profits from pharmacies in the shops.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold pharmacy chain Celesio, which had 281 pharmacies and Lloyds' own pharmacy chain, £125 million three years ago.
They added that Lloyds still has a role to play and will offer an extended luxury series of skin products, including brand La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, commented, "We've changed how the beauty shelves will look and feel to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also appointed colleagues with special skills to offer beauty services.
Our brands are designed to suit all needs, while the attractive environment and the practical positions mean that we are now an attractive beauty destination that challenges the old way of acting."
Peter Jones "rapid" after Holly Willaghby withdraws from the deal worth £11 million
The star from Dragons Den, Peter Jones, is “rapid” after the TV host Holly Willoughby withdrew from an agreement with his lifestyle worth £11 million to focus on their new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time to promote their interior and accessories.
The couple's cooperation has been compared with Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop mark.
The host from the program This Morning, 37, made new arrivals on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has left the star of Dragons Den, Peter Jones, in the midst of the development of their new collaboration on a life-style brand to focus on their own contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources report that Jones was “rapid” when the Golden Holly confessed during a strenuous Tuesday meeting at Jones’ headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that Holly’s new contracts – worth up to £1,5 million – mean that she no longer has time to cooperate on the interior and accessories brand True.
The collaboration has been compared with Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop mark and was supposed to double Willoughby's estimated fortune of £11 million.
Willoughby, 37, used Instagram to make sure she wasn't going to work with Truey, while Jones escaped the United Kingdom to relax in one of his holiday homes.
One source said, "Truly was absolutely at the top of Holly's priorities.
It was to be her long - term plan for the future, and it was to last for many decades.
Her decision to withdraw has surprised everyone involved.
No one thought their own ears on Tuesday; True was so near the launch.
There is a department store in Marlow filled with goods ready for sale.’
Experts believe that the decision of this morning host, which is one of the richest stars in the United Kingdom, can cost the company millions due to heavy investment in the product, from cushions to candles to clothes and interiors, and can cause delays with the launch.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, who is the mother of three, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have our close friends of Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby created the brand True together with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined the board in March.
Couples vacation together and Jones owns 40 percent of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby shall become the M&S brand ambassador and shall replace Ant McPartlin who shall host ITV’s I’m A Celebrity programme.
A source near Jones said last night, "We don't comment on his business."
Cool conversations "and then we fall in love"
He told about the criticism he was going to get from the media to make a comment some might experience as ‘unpresident’ and to be so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Said Trump with his customs vote as a "newsman".
"I haven't given up anything."
He commented that Kim was interested in a new meeting after their first meeting in Singapore in June, which Trump called a major step towards the disarmament of the nuclear program in North Korea.
But the negotiations on the nuclear programme have stopped.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, the top diplomat from North Korea Ri Yong Ho said to the world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea has not received a ‘correspondent response’ from the United States regarding the early disarmament of North Korea.
Instead, he added, the United States continues with sanctions to push North Korea.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech.
"It's great between us and North Korea," he said.
«We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
Now we have a great relationship."
He added that his work to improve relations with Kim has brought positive results - the end of rocket testing, help to free hostages and return the remains to American soldiers.
He defended his unusual procedure when it comes to relations with Kim.
"It's so easy to be presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get in, we had about 200 people standing right there," said Trump and pointed to the group that stood before him.
Tsunami and earthquakes in Indonesia destroy island and kill hundreds
After the Lombok earthquake, foreign aid organisations were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the residents of Lombok had to flee, no one declared a national state of crisis, needed to obtain international relief.
'Unfortunately, in many cases they have been very clear that they do not want international help, so it's a bit challenging,' said Sumbung.
While the Redd Children make up a team to travel to Palu, it is still not safe to add foreign passports allowed to work in the field.
Sutopo, spokesperson of the National Crisis Agency in Indonesia, said that the authorities assess the situation in Palu to see if international organisations are allowed to provide relief.
Although Indonesia is often exposed to earthquakes, it is not specifically foreordained by natural forces.
In the Aceh area, they have built shelters for tsunamis, but they are not common in the rest of the country.
Despite warnings against tsunamis in Palu, there was no alarm, which most likely led to more victims.
Traveling between the Indonesian islands is usually quite challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that docked in Lombok to treat those who were injured in the earthquake is now on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the place of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo focused on the embodiment of the infrastructure in Indonesia during the presidential elections, spending a lot of money on new roads and railways.
But lack of funding has made it difficult for President Joko's administration, and next year there are elections again.
President Joko is also under pressure when it comes to sectarian tensions in Indonesia, while members of the Muslim majority have accepted well the conservative threat of his.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands had to flee when Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets using machetes, arrows, and bows, and other primitive weapons.

Number of victims in Indonesia tsunami increases to 832
The number of victims in the Indonesia earthquake and the tsunami has increased to 832, reported the crisis agency in the country early Sunday.
Many people were trapped in the ruins of buildings that collapsed in the earthquake, like her on Friday and had a force of 7.5 followed by 6 meters high waves, the spokesman for the crisis bureau, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, reported in a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, is now covered with collapsed buildings.
British police arrest man, 32, suspected of killing after the woman became knife pieces to the dead
A homicide investigation has begun after a woman was found dead in Birkenhead, Merseyside today early.
The 44-year-old woman was found knife pieces at 7:55 in Grayson Mews, John Street, while a 32-year-old man is arrested, suspected of killing.
The police have requested tips about the event from local residents.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said, "The investigation is still in an early phase, but I ask everyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead who saw or heard something suspicious of contacting us.
I also encourage everyone, including taxi drivers, who can catch something on the dashboard camera, to contact us in case they have important information."
A police officer has confirmed that a woman who was found is from Birkenhead, and that she was found in a home.
This afternoon friends who think they know the woman came to the area to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation continued and the police have stated that they are informing the family of the victim.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has tried to get into his own apartment, but has been informed by the police that no one is allowed to enter or leave the building.
He did not know what to say when he found out what had happened.
The residents have been told that they cannot enter their apartments in many hours.

Parliamentary statue of Cromwell becomes the last victim of the «rewriting of history»
The removal of the statue would be karma for Cromwell and the Taliban-like destruction of several cultural and religious objects in England that his Puritan followers did during the 17th century Civil War.
But the Cromwell League describes Crick's proposal for the removal of the statue as "noise" and "an attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell League, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of statues that the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster Palace would be a goal.
The iconoclasm during the English Civil War was simply ordered or performed by Cromwell.
Perhaps Cromwell's mistake would have been the victim of the actions of his ancestor, Thomas, in the century before.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's outstanding representation of Cromwell is evidence of public opinion in the 1800s, and is part of the history of a figure that many still thought it worth celebrating."
Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was in the nineteenth century, and is still today, seen as a defender of Parliament against external pressure, and in his case it was, of course, against the monarchy.
Whether this representation is correct or not is still a discussion theme in historical debate.
What's certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 1600s has shaped the development of our nation, and Cromwell was an individual that we know represented one side of that distinction.
What he achieved as Lord Protector is also worth celebrating and remembering."
Homicide attacks and kill Chinese peasants
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a South West China market, according to local media reports.
The man, named Yuan, was found dead, with cut artery and covered with blood, near a pig bunge on the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou Province, reported South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing to give pigs vaccines on a garden on 30 May, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He had recently traveled with his cousin from the neighbouring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning he found his cousin's death, and discovered that the gate to one of the piggybacks was open.
He said that in the pygmy there was a large male pig with blood around his mouth.
The autopsy showed that a 250-pound pig had killed the farmer, according to the report.
"Benue to my cousin was bloody and ruined," said the cousin, named Wu, to Guiyang Evening News.
The surveillance camera shows that Yuan came to market at 4:40 on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His like was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed him, did not listen to Yuan or his cousin.
The market leader told Evening News that the pig had been locked up to prevent him from attacking others, while the police collected evidence of the incident.
Yuan's family is now negotiating compensation with the leader of the market.
Although it is rare, such measures from pigs have taken place before.
In 2016, a pig was arrested by a woman and her husband in Massachusetts, causing serious injuries to the man.
Ten years earlier, a 295 kilos of pig kept a Welsh peasant trapped between him and a tractor, until his wife scared the pig away.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba reported to CBC News that pigs are not aggressive to the ordinary, but that the taste of blood can cause the animals to go.
'They just want to play.
They like to bite a bit, they're curious... they won't hurt you.
You just have to have enough respect for them," he said.
Rests of Hurricane Rosa Brings Rain to South West America
As predicted in the weather forecast, Hurricane Rosa becomes weaker over the cool waters along the northern coast of Mexico.
Nevertheless, Rosa will bring with her bitter rains to North Mexico and South West America the next days.
Rosa had wind strength up to 136 km/h and was a Category 1 hurricane until 05:00 in the Eastern Time Zone in the United States on Sunday, and the hurricane center was 620 kilometers southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa has to move northwards on Sunday.
Meanwhile, there is a low pressure above the Pacific that moves east towards the west coast of the United States. Rosa comes closer to the Baja California Peninsula on Monday in the form of a tropical storm, and will move tropical humidity northwards to the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring up to two inches of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
The tropical humidity will react with low pressure and cause thick rain in the south-west of the next few days.
Locally, between 3 and 10 centimeters of rain can create dangerous flukes and possible landslides in the desert.
Tropical humidity will lead to rains of between 5 and 7 centimeters per hour in some parts of South West America, especially in parts of Southern Nevada and Arizona.
Between 5 and 10 centimeters of rain is expected in parts of southwest America; especially over large parts of Arizona.
Dangerous whistles may occur due to scattered terrain and tropical rain.
It warns against trips in the desert on foot because of the danger of tropical rain.
The rain can turn chasms into flowing rivers and lightning and tower storms will bring strong wind and dust.
The coming low pressure will also bring rain to parts of the coast of southern California.
Total rainfall of more than 1 centimeter is possible, which can create small flutters and smooth paths.
This will be the first rainy town for the season in the region.
Scattered tropical rain cities will start in Arizona late Sunday evening and early Monday morning, before the rain increases late on Monday and Tuesday.
The Four Corners region can expect a lot of rain on Tuesday and Wednesday.
October can witness intense temperature fluctuations throughout the United States while the Arctic gets colder, but tropical strokes will still be quite hot.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic differences in temperatures, even between small areas.
Sunday was an example of dramatic temperature differences in central parts of the United States.
There is almost 20 degrees temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
The next few days, late summer heat will try to build up and spread again.
Many of the central and eastern United States are expected to experience a warm start in October, with 25 degrees upwards from the southern part of the large plains to parts of the northeastern United States.
New York City can reach 25 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above the average.
The long-term warning indicates that there are high chances of above-average temperatures in the eastern US during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watch the Brett Kavanaugh ring
On Thursday, more than 20 million people witnessed Brett Kavanaugh in the U.S. Supreme Court and the woman who owed him sexual assault in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six different television channels.
At the same time, the political debate on the subject continued, with interruptions in the usual television programs of various broadcasters to reveal the latest news on Friday: an agreement reached by Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake that the FBI will investigate the debt over the next week.
Ford told the High Court Committee that she is 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh felt her when he was drunk and tried to take her clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh said, during a sensitive hearing, that he's 100 percent sure it didn't happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people saw on Friday, according to Nielsen.
The company came up with this number by finding the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News and MSNBC.
The number was not clear from other channels that showed the right hand side, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen also has trouble counting viewers who look at the office.
To put this into perspective, there's a similar number of viewers looking at an American football final or the Oscar distribution.
Fox News' hosts have supported Kavanaugh, and the channel was also the one with most viewers during the day with 5.69 million viewers, said Nielsen.
ABC was at second place 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million, said Nielsen.
People are still interested after the hearing.
Flake was in focus during the drama on Friday.
After Flake, a moderate Republican, declared that he was on Kavanaugh's side, he was filmed by CNN and CBS while Protestants called after him on his way to a hearing with a judgment marmot on Friday.
He stood and looked in the ground for several minutes while the Protestants fell upon him on CNN live.
"I'm standing right here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he'll tell the truth to our country?"
Some said to him, "You have power, while so many women are powerless."
Flake said that his office had spoken, and before he went into the elevator he said that he wanted more to say during the committee hearing.
The Broadcasting Bureau showed the call on television when the Judiciary Committee was to vote for or against the nomination of Kavanaugh to a full Senate and to a further sedition.
But Flake said he could only do that if the FBI investigated the allegations against Kavanaugh during the next week, which the Democrats have also requested.
Flake was partly overwhelmed by talking to his friend, the democrat, and Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and several other senators afterwards, Flake took a decision.
Flake's decision proved to have power, because it became clear that the Republicans could not vote for Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the complaints against Kavanaugh.
Theresa May owes critics to 'play politics' when it concerns Brexit
The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Theresa May, owes the critics of her plans to leave the EU to ‘play politics’ with the future to the United Kingdom without regard to national interests, in an interview with the newspaper The Sunday Times.
Theresa May is in Birmingham, England, to attend the Conservative Party's conference on 29 September 2018.
In addition to the May interview on the front page of the Sunday Times, there is an interview with former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson, where he commits himself to the Chequers Plan for Brexit and says that the proposal for the United Kingdom and the EU to collect each other’s fees is ‘very absurd’.
Wayde Sims Shooting in the United States: Police arrest the suspect Dyteon Simpson for Sims Shootinga
The police have arrested a man suspected of the fatal shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player from Louisiana State University (LSU), was killed.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, is arrested and imprisoned for deliberate killing, reports the Baton Rouge Police, Louisiana.
An official video shows the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police said that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police found the glasses on the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, according to a report from the WAFB channel, which is linked to CBS.
After the hearing with Simpson, the police said he admitted to having shot Wayde.
The deposit for Simpson was set at $350,000, reports local visas The Advocate.
The Corona in East-Baton Rouge published an early post-mortem report on Friday that showed that the cause of death was a bullet in the head that went into the neck.
Baton Rouge police thank the state police in Louisiana for their special forces, the state police's crime lab, the Southern University police and local residents for helping them find Simpson.
The athletic director of LSU, Joe Alleva, thanked the local police for being “vigilant in the pursuit of justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
The 2 meter tall basketball player grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
On average he scora 5.6 points with 2.6 setbacks per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team is "insolent" after Wayde was killed.
'This is what we're always afraid of,' said Wade.
Volcano Spewing out ash over Mexico City
The ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached southern parts of the capital of Mexico.
The National Crisis Prevention Centre asks Mexicans to stay away from the volcano on Sunday after increasing activity in the crater and the centre recorded 183 gas and ash emissions in 24 hours.
The centre had observed several jolts and tremors.
Social media images show thin layers of ash on cars in different neighborhoods in Mexico City, including Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noted an increase in activity in the volcano, which is 72 kilometres southeast of the capital, since a 7.1 earthquake hit central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano is known as "Don Goyo" and has been active since 1994.
Police collide with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independent hearing
Six Protestants were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after demonstrations of independence collided with police forces, and thousands of other demonstrators protested against self-employment one year after the hearing about possible detachment from Spain.
A group of masked separatists were held back by police forces as they threw eggs and powdered paint that created dark clouds of dust in streets that are usually filled with tourists.
The noise also broke out later in the day, and the police used batons to prevent escalation.
For several hours, the separatists shouted ‘Don’t forget, don’t forgive’, while the Protestants shouted ‘Long live Spain’.
Local news channels reported that fourteen people were treated for minor injuries after protests.
The vote is still held in the region and many will still have their own seats one year after the October 1 hearing, which was called illegal by Madrid, but was celebrated by separatists in Catalonia.
Most of the voters voted for independence, but there was also a low vote against self-employed and boycotted voices.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1000 people were injured last year after the police tried to prevent the noise and elective conspiracies occurred in the region.
Groups who were too self-employed to sleep in tents on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the state police.
The demonstration, however, went off the stack, but it was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated in the separatist protests with his wife, said that he no longer has the hope of self-employment in Catalonia.
"Last year we experienced one of our beauties.
I saw my parents crying for joy to be able to shake for independence, but now we're stuck again," he said.
Although they won the regional elections last December, the Catalan parties that are too self-reliant to hold power this year, while many of their leaders are in exile or arrest while waiting for the legal cause for their role in the organisation of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who filmed the protests in support of the police on his phone, said that the conflict was a mess of politicians on both sides.
"Voltage increases more and more," he said.
On Saturday, Mr Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who has been part of the ongoing legal proceedings since last year, declared that he should stand for election in the European Parliament next year.
"The best way to condemn the decline of democratic values and the repression we have experienced from the Spanish state is to stand as a candidate in the European elections," he said.

A crossbow may have been used to shoot at the car.
Menga shots give Livingston 1-0-story over Rangers in Scottish football
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston Sikers says
Excited Livingston surprises Rangers and Steven Gerrard experiences his second saying after 18 fights that train for the Ibrox Club in Glasgow.
Dolly Menga's shot proved to be making the difference while Gary Holt's side softened with the Hibernian in others.
Gerrard's side has no victors in the Scottish Premiership league this season, and is going to play against Hearts, as they are eight points behind, next Sunday.
Before that, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the European League on Thursday.
Livingston has six consecutive victories, and the head coach Holt still hasn't lost since he replaced Kenny Miles last month.
Livingston misses chances against the away layer
Holt's team should have suffered long before they scora, and created more problems for the Rangers with the direct play say.
Scott Robinson broke through, but had low efforts towards goal, which meant that Alan Lithgow had to work hard after the meeting with Craig Halkett's heading over the goal.
The home team was content to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could create trouble for the away team.
And that's how the decisive goal was scora.
Rangers joined a theme park and Livingston made an opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson went against Menga, who took a touch and scora from the middle of the penalty field.
Before then, Rangers dominated the ball, but saw that the home defense was solid and the keeper Liam Kelly was focused.
This pattern continues into the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to save a target.
Scott Pittman tried to score, but was stopped by Rangers' keeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgow girled far after the ball was returned from Livingston.
Passports were sent back and forth in the Livingston Penalty field, while two sentences--after Halkett's challenge to Glenn Middleton, and one by one--were waved away.
'Synonymous 'from Livingston Analysis
BBC Scotland its Alasdair Lamont in Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal battle and a phenomenal result for Livingston.
Each player played fantastically and still impresses on the curve upwards.
Their style of playing and playing has hardly changed since they returned to the top class, but much of the thanks go to Holt for the way he has made the shock since he became a coach.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was intense, and organized a defense at the military level, while Menga distracted Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall throughout the battle.
The Rangers, on the other hand, were not motivated.
Even as good as they've been under Gerrard, they weren't good enough this time.
They didn't play well enough, and they only cut up the home half once, which should make Rangers realize they're not getting there anymore.
Erdogan gets mixed welcome in Cologne
The heads of state in Turkey and Germany smiled under the blue sky when they met to eat breakfast on Saturday 29 September in Berlin.
It's the last day of Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany -- which it's hoped will repair relations between the two NATO countries.
The countries have been disunited when it comes to human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s role in the EU.
Erdogan went to Cologne to open a large new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police are preventing a population of over 25 000 from gathering in front of the mosque because of “security causes,” but many of Erdogan’s supporters met up to see their president.
Hundreds of Protestants against Erdogan - many of the Kurdish - also met up to condemn Erdogan's policy and the German state's decision to welcome him to the country.
The dubious Protestants reflected the distinction between German Turks, who view Erdogan as a hero, and others, who view him as an autocrat.

Long Lartin Prison in England: Six Guards Insurrection Damage
Six prison guards have been injured in a rebellion in a men's high-security prison, says the prison office in England.
Current disorder broke out in the HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire around 9:30 a.m. local time on Sunday.
Special ‘Tornado’ forces have been acquired to calm down the insurrection, involving eight prisoners in a separate part of the prison.
The guards have been treated for minor injuries in the face.
A prison spokesperson said, ‘Special interest rates should calm down the ongoing uprising in HMP Long Lartin.
Six guards have been treated for damage.
We do not tolerate the power of our prisons, and we are aware that those responsible will be reported to the police and may need to be in prison any longer."
There are more than 500 people in HMP Long Lartin, including one of the most dangerous criminals in the United Kingdom.
In June, it was reported that the prison director was being treated for injuries, after a prisoner went into action.
And last October, special forces had to come to the prison to calm down a serious uprising, where prisoners threw billiard bullets at the guards.

It can range from 2 to 5 centimeters in other areas of the south-west desert, including central parts of Rocky Mountains and Great Basin, with isolated totals of up to 10 centimeters.
For areas outside the risk of flooding, Rosa may be a benefactor in the drought.
Although flooding is a serious concern, this is likely to be beneficial to south-west US areas that are exposed to drought.
According to drying monitors in the United States, extreme droughts in over 40 percent of Arizona, which is the second highest drying category, report weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa moves over the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
With wind over 135 kilometers per hour, Rosa is on Sunday morning 619 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and moves northwards at a speed of 19 kilometers per hour.

Trump says Kavanaugh «suffered» under the choir «slut and anger» the democrats were against him
‘The voice of the Kavanaugh rulings is a voice against the merciless and unruly tactics of the Democrats,’ said Trump during a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh has suffered under the chorus of ‘bad and angry’ democrats through the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified in front of the Congress on Thursday, and emotionally denied the debt of Christine Blasey Ford that he attacked her sexually decades ago, when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified about her debts during her hearing.
The president said on Saturday that the "American people got to see how brilliant and brave" Kavanaugh was that day.
"Ought to hear Kavanaugh's verdicts, one of the best lawyers in our time, a lawyer with no faults in public service," he said to a lot of followers in West Virginia.
The President also referred to Kavanaugh's nomination when he talked about how important it is for the Republicans to voice in the middle of the United States.
"Five weeks to one of the most important choices in our lives.
I don't do it, but I really do it," he said.
‘That’s why I travel around to fight for good candidates.’
Trump argued that the Democrats are after ‘resisting and blocking’.
The first important hearing in the Senate about the nomination of Kavanaugh is expected to take place by Friday at the latest, said a Republican representative of CNN.
Hundreds killed in earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia, numbering killed increases
At least 384 people are killed, many of them taken by huge waves on beaches, while a powerful earthquake and a tsunami frame the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, reported authorities on Sunday.
Hundreds of people were gathered to participate in a festival on the beach in Palu City on Friday when the waves, which were six metres high, struck the beach at sunset, and took many people while they ruined everything they came across.
The tsunami came after a 7.5 earthquake.
"When the tsunami came yesterday, there were still people on the beach who didn't go at once and they became victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the crisis relief agency in Indonesia GDPB, in Jakarta.
"As if not the tsunami was enough in itself, he took cars, wooden trunks, houses; he rammed everything on land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had traveled over the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coast.
Some climbed up in wood to avoid the tsunami and survived that way.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Photos from the air published by the crisis agency show many damaged buildings and shops, twisted and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
Aftershocks continue to hit the coastal town on Saturday.
Earthquakes could be marked in the area around, with a population of 2.4 million.
Indonesia's Technology Testing and Testing Agency (BPPT) stated that the energy from the Friday earthquake was about 200 times stronger than the energy from the nuclear bomb over Hiroshima during the second world war.
The geography of the city, which lies at the end of a long, narrow wave, may have increased the size of the tsunami, said the Agency.
Nugroho described the damage as “comprehensive” and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels have collapsed.
The bodies of the deceased have been found under the remains of collapsed buildings, he said, and added that 540 people were injured and that 29 still are missing.
Nugroho said that the number of fatalities and the size of the wreckage may be greater along the coast 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the quake.
"We haven't heard anything from Donggala, communication is cut," Nugroho said.
‘More than 300000 people cage there,’ said the Red Cross, adding and volunteering to the random areas.
'This is already a tragedy, but it can get a lot worse,' said the Red Cross.
The crisis agency was criticized on Saturday for not informing us that a tsunami had hit Palu, even though the authorities said that waves came before the time that was announced.
An amateur video shared on social media shows a man on the top floor of a building crying desperately to people down the streets to warn them of the coming wave.
A few minutes later, a wall of water hits the coast, taking with it buildings and cars.
Reuters couldn't verify the video with the first one.
The quake and tsunami caused a power cut and cut the communication around Palu, which made it difficult for authorities to coordinate the emergency aid.
The military has started the process of returning loading aircraft with emergency aid from Jakarta and other cities, reporting to the authorities, but refugees still need food and other basic needs.
The city airport was reopened to receive emergency aid, but will continue to be connected until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit the evacuation centre in Palu on Sunday.
The number of deaths in Indonesia exceeds 800.
It's very bad.
They added to the World Vision from Donggala have come safely to Palu City, and have set up tents in the backyard of their office.
"They told me they saw a lot of broken houses," he said.
It's very bad.
While relief agencies are starting work to help those who have been hit by the tsunami, some complain that foreign relief workers with expertise in crisis management have been denied entry into Palu.
According to Indonesian law, foreign aid organisations and their staff cannot start work until Indonesia has declared the area to be a national crisis zone.
It hasn't happened yet.
‘It’s a provincial crisis,’ said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Red Cross in Indonesia.
‘When the country says ‘OK, this is a national crisis,’ we can open up international relief, but they have not yet updated their status.’
There's another night in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, and friends and family of those still missing hope for a miracle, but know that such natural disasters don't end well.
On Saturday a little good was saved from the sewer.
On Sunday, a woman was scared from the rest of a collapsed building, where she had a doctor prisoner next to the dead mother saying for two days.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian paragliding team, trained two of the missing paraglidders from the Asian games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
A man named Mandagi said that some of the prisoners in the Roa Roa hotel were his students.
"As a person with a lot of experience in paragliding, I have my own emotional burden to bear," he said.
Gendon told me that he desperately sent whatsApp messages to the paragliders from Palu, who had participated in the local beach festival, after hearing that the Roa Roa hotel had collapsed.
But his messages showed only one grey pick, instead of two blue hooks.
'I think it means that the messages didn't come out,' he said.
Thieves make $26,750 from the Newport Minibank, Levee, U.S.A.
On Friday, thieves stole $26,750 from a worker in the company Brink's in what he was about to fill up a mini bank in Newport, Livee, U.S.A., following a press release from the Newport police.
The worker had just emptied a mini bank in the entertainment area and was about to deliver more money, said Detective Dennis McCarthy in the press release.
While the worker was busy, a man jumped up behind the worker and stole a bag of money to be delivered.
Witnesses observed several suspects while they escaped from the scene, according to the press release, but the police could not determine the number of people involved in the robbery.
If someone has information about who was involved, they should call the police in Newport on 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper renames to Ye
The Kanye West rapper renames - to Ye.
He declared the name change on Twitter on Saturday, and wrote: "The creation previously known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has had Ye as his nickname for a while, and used the name as the title of his eighth album, which he released in June.
The change of name came right before he was going to perform on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album Yandhi.
He replaces the singer Ariana Grande at the show after she canceled because of "emotional reasons," said the software host.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current artist name, West has previously stated that the word has a religious meaning for him.
"I believe the word 'ye' is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," said West earlier this year when he discussed the album title with the radio host Big Boy.
"So I am you, I am us, it is us.
The name has changed from Kanye, which means the only one, to Ye -- to reflect the good we do, the bad we do, our confusion, everything.
The album reflects on who we are.”
Kanye is one of several famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs is formerly known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he declared that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who has collaborated with West before, has also changed the writing style of the name with and without hyphens and capital letters.
Future President of Mexico promises not to send the military against civilians
The future president of Mexico, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has promised never to send military forces against civilians, soon to mark the 50th anniversary of the bloody treatment of students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he “will never use the military to oppress the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, the military shot at peaceful demonstrators and killed about 300 people, at a time when left-wing student movements spread in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly support to students and opening more free universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of access to education have led young people to join criminal gangs.
The US should double investment in artificial intelligence
Since China works more actively with artificial intelligence, the US should double its investments in research on the subject, winning the investor and user of artificial intelligence, Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
His comments came after various parts of the U.S. government expressed themselves on artificial intelligence, although the United States lacked a formal strategy for the use of artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China introduced its plan last year, aiming to be number 1 in artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
‘To double the budget for researching artificial intelligence would be a good start, as all the other countries are so far behind the United States, and we are looking for the next breakthrough in artificial intelligence,’ said Lee.
A doubling of funding could double the chances of the next major breakthrough in artificial intelligence happening in the United States, said Lee to the CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, who published the book ‘AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order’ this month via the publishing house Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the largest companies for artificial intelligence in China, Face++.
In the 1980s he worked at Carnegie Mellon University with a system of artificial intelligence that beat the highest ranked player of the game Othello, and later he worked as a leader in Microsoft Research and was chairman of Google in China.
Lee recognized former technology competitions organized by the U.S. state, such as ‘Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Robotics Challenge’, and asked how time the next competition should be, so that he would be with and identify the next visionaries.
Researchers in the United States usually have to work hard to get support from the state, said Lee.
"It's not China that takes the academic leaders, it's the big companies," said Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired excellent university students to work with artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy can also help the United States to strengthen research on artificial intelligence.
"I thought that before artificial intelligence, doctoral students should be given automatic residence permits," he said.
The Government of China published its plan for the next generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
China's National Science Association finances students at academic institutions, not unlike the American National Science Association and other government agencies its way of distributing money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, said Lee.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a joint centre of artificial intelligence, which is intended to involve partners from industry and academia, and the White House declared the formation of a committee of artificial intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI (artificial intelligence) Next.
The National Science League invests more than $100 million a year in research on artificial intelligence.
At the same time, no one has worked on the legislative proposals on national security and artificial intelligence in several months.
Macedonians voice in popular resolution to change the country's name
The Macedonian people voiced on Sunday in a referendum if they should rename the Republic of North Macedonia in order to resolve a decades-old conflict with Greece, which has tried to prevent Macedonia from becoming a member of the EU and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, insists that the name of its neighbouring country in the north represents a claim on their territory, and has used veto to vote against membership of Macedonia in NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the new proposed name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change of name could undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority of the population in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that he should not vote in the public hearing, and a boycott has raised doubts about how far the public hearing is going to reach the least 50 percent of the population it needs to be valid.
The question on the public hearing seat is ‘Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership and agreeing to the agreement with Greece?’
Supporters of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the price of the change of name is worth membership of the EU and NATO. Macedonia is one of the countries that gained independence after the collapse of Yugoslavia.
‘I am here today to voice for the future to this country, for the youth of Macedonia, so they can live freely under the umbrella of the EU, because it means a safer life for all of us,’ said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although not binding under the law, an adequate number of Members of Parliament have said that they will follow the outcome of the hearing to make it decisive.
In order for the change of name to take place, Parliament needs two-thirds of the total.
The State Election Committee reported that nothing unusual had happened by 13:00.
Only 16 percent had voiced, as opposed to 34 percent in the previous parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 of all registered voters were voiced.
'I hear for my children, we belong in Europe,' said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voiced in Strumika in the referendum in Macedonia to change their name and open their doors to join NATO and the EU on 30 September 2018.
Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, organized a boycott of the public hearing in front of Parliament in Skopje, by setting up tents and chairs.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we are not to change the name of our country," said Kavadarkov.
«We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want us under the name of Macedonia, we can go to others, like China and Russia, and become part of the Eurasian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev has stated that membership of NATO will attract investors to Macedonia, which has more than 20 percent unemployment.
‘I believe that the majority will vote for the change, of your 80 percent of our citizens will join the EU and NATO,’ said Zaev after having voiced.
He said that a "yes" result can be interpreted as a "confirmation of our future."
An opinion poll last Monday by Macedonia's Policy Research Institute showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will participate in the public hearing — which is below the required number.
Another polling of the Telma TV channel in Macedonia showed that 57 percent of voters plan to voice on Sunday.
Of these, the channel said that 70 percent was going to vote yes.
For the public hearing to be closed, at least 50 percent must be voiced, plus one voice.
If the public hearing is not closed, it could damage the policy of the left-wing government that took over in May.
See: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero navigates through Brighton Defense and scorar
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling wrecked the Brighton defense which led to a 2-0 win for Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy, then he scora for 65 minutes.
The Argentine peak received a midwayer at the beginning of the sequence.
He drove past three Brighton defense players and reached an open path.
Suddenly, Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He got around one defender, before he jumped past several others on the edge of the Brighton-penalty field.
He got past a passport on the left and found Sterling.
The English point used its first kick in the field to give the ball back to Aguero, who used the right foot to hit Brighton keeper Mathew Ryan with a shot right into the right end of the goal.
‘Aguero still wears with his feet,’ said the City Trainer Pep Guardiola to the reporter.
‘We talked about him playing 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scora when he did."
But it was Sterling who gave them the sky blue the first advantage in the Premier League game.
That target came in the 29th minute.
Aguero took the ball deep inside the Brighton territory.
He kicks the ball beautifully along the left end of the track to Leroy Sane.
Sane held on to the ball while he led Sterling towards the goal.
The sky-blue point kicked the ball into the goal just before he slipped out of the path.
City will play against Hoffenheim in the Champions League Group Phase at 12:55 on Tuesday in the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer will play spoilers against Rockies in American baseball
With Nationals eliminated from playoff content, there was not much reason to force a new start.
Scherzer has a strong competitive instinct, and hopes to take the 'mound' on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if it can lead to the 'playoff' for Rockies, who leads with one game over Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West.
Rockies won at least 5-2 against the Nationals Friday night, but looks forward to locking up the first division title.
"Even if we don't play for anything, it's worth playing because of the atmosphere here in Denver, with the audience and the other layer that most likely plays at the highest level so far this year.
Who does not want to play with such relationships?’
It is still uncertain who is going to start in the Nationals on Sunday, but Scherzer may have to ‘pitche’.
Scherzer, who will then start for the 34th time, will throw a 'Bullpen session' on Thursday and will have 'pitche' normally on Sunday.
Scherzer, who comes from Washington, is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump collects voters in West Virginia
The President referred uncannyly to his first election to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while he talked about how important it was for the Republicans to vote in the middle elections in the United States.
«Everything we've done so far is at stake in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our lives.
This is one of the big, big -- I don't say, but I'm running around everywhere to fight for the best candidates," he said.
Trump continued, 'You can see this terrible, terrible group of democrats, you can see that it's happening right now.
And they're over-enjoyed that they're absolutely going to take back power, you see how bad they are, how ugly they are.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to take power and control, that's what they want, power and control, we shouldn't give it to them."
Democrats, he said, are on a mission to ‘oppose and block’.
"And you can see it based on the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "sinny and bad and ugly and dishonest."
He referred to Senator and Democrat Diane Feinstein, who made his audience bow.
"Do you think of her answer?
You're the one playing papers?
Uh, uh, what?
No, no, I'm waiting--it was really bad body language--the worst body language I've seen."
Labour is no longer tolerant.
They're intolerant to those who say what they mean
When the Momentum activists in my local party voiced to censor me, it was not surprising.
I'm the last in a series of Labour MPs who have been told that I'm not welcome - just to say what I mean.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated in the same way because she protested against anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
In terms of the importance of running responsible economy, national security, Europe, and other similar themes that Jeremy ironically disagreed with previous leaders.
In the convocation for the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday, it said, ‘We want the meeting to be inclusive and productive.’
In my last eight years as a Labour MP, Friday meetings have been just like that.
Unfortunately, today's meeting was not like this, and the promise that "smart" policies are long forgotten if they were followed at all.
It has become increasingly clear that different views are not tolerated in Labour, and that each opinion is judged by the leaders of the party.
This happened shortly after Jeremy became a party leader, when colleagues I used to be politically united with suddenly expecting me to change my mind and agree on matters I would never agree with - whether it was national security or the internal market in the EU.
When I speak in public, it doesn't matter what I say, I always get fucked up on social media and people want me to leave while they criticize central politics and say that I shouldn't be a member of the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
I know that I'm luckier than some of my colleagues, because the comments to me are at least political.
I admire my colleagues who get sex discriminating and racist harassment directed at them every day, and who are still professional and do not go off.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this time period is how normalized it has been to harass politicians.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should be more tolerant.
In fact, we are no longer a tolerant party that has something for everyone. Every proposal of censure and every change in the rules of a party, the party becomes narrower and narrower.
I've received a lot of advice in the last two years from people who have said I have to take it easy and not be so loud, so maybe people will "like me better."
But that's not why I chose to join the politics.
When I joined Labour, when I still went to school 32 years ago, it was because I was angry at Thatcher and how the government failed the country.
I have never hidden my political views, nor in the previous elections.
No one in Nottingham East could have doubted what I stand for and which of the current leaders I don't agree with.
To those who voted for the proposal on Friday, I can only say that when the country is heading towards a Brexit who wants to harm private, local businesses and public services, I don't understand why people care about throwing away energy at asking questions about my loyalty to the Labour Party leader.
But in fact, not the only message I've addressed to Nottingham Momentum, but to the voters in the constituency, whether they're Labour voters or not: I'm proud to serve you, and I promise that no one can make me go off or change my policy and prevent me from tying you in the way I think is best for you all.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Invincible Ayr goes to the top of Scottish rugby
Two seine «tries» may change the result a little bit, but there's no doubt that Ayr has begun to win this very entertaining Tennent's Premiership match today.
They are now on top of the pallet as the only invincible layer of a total of ten.
It was their sovereign defense and ability to take chances that gave home the team and coach theirs, Peter Murchie, good reason to be naked.
"We've been tested in the last fights, and we're still invincible, so I have to be naked," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said, "Ayr hastens praise, they were better than us to take chances."
Grant Anderson had a «try» in 14 minutes, where Frazier Climo tried a «conversion» that put Ayr in the front, but a yellow card from Scotland Captain Rory Hughes from Warriors Lot Melrose gathered, and Jason Baggot took an «unconverted try».
Climo got a penalty just before the break, he scora and «converted» a «solo try» to give Ayr 17-5 before the break.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson’s ‘try,’ which was ‘converted’ by Baggot, reduced the slingshot by five points.
There was a long break when Ruaridh Knott was seriously damaged and laid on a stretch, and from the reboot Ayr passed through a try from Stafford McDowall, like Clima 'converted'.
The working captain of Ayr, Blair MacPherson, got a yellow card, and again Melrose tried an unconverted Bruce Colvine try, at the end of a series of aggressive games.
The home team played back, and then Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card to deal with Climo without the ball from the penalty line, scora MacPherson a «try.»
Clio "converted" again after Kyle Rowe took David Armstrong's "box kick" and sent the "flanker" Gregor Henry away from his home team's fifth "try."
The star from the Scottish series, Still Game, starts a new career in the restaurant industry
The Scottish Still Game star, Ford Kieran, seems ready for a new career in the restaurant industry, after it was discovered that he is the director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC program, which he writes and plays with partner Greg Hemfill.
The duo has announced that the coming ninth season will be the last, and it seems like Klrun is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official lists, he's the director of the Akrifmorn Limited.
The actor won't comment on it, but a source from the Scottish Sun newspaper has suggested that Klär would be involved in the successful restaurant industry in Glasgow.
«The sea is ours»: Bolivia hopes the court will open the waterway to the Pacific Ocean
Sailors patrol the Marine Headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings flags with sea blue flags.
Marine bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazonaselva are covered with the motto: 'The sea is ours. We're right.
and the obligation to return to it.»
In landlocked Bolivia, the people can still remember a coastline lost to Chile, in a bloody conflict of resources in the 1800s, longing to sail in the Pacific again.
These hopes may be stronger than in many decades, while Bolivia awaits the judgment of the International Court of Justice, which is due on 1 October, after five years of jurisdiction.
‘Bolivia is driven, calm and united, and of course expects a positive result,’ said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians are going to look at the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice, hoping that the Hague court will support Bolivia's claim, and that, after decades of negotiations, Chile will provide an independent exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia - who strives to be re-elected next year - has good reason to hope for a positive outcome.
"Now we will soon get back to the Pacific," he promised late in August.
But some analysts don't think the court is going to let Bolivia have access to the ocean -- and that little would have changed themselves if they got access.
The Netherlands-based UN Court of Justice does not have the power to transfer Chilean territory to Bolivia, and has stipulated that they will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
According to Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law, that the court’s ruling comes only six months after the last hearings.
The last four years have far from come to Bolivia's end, they've done the opposite.
‘The issue of access to the sea has been taken over by the current Bolivian administration,’ said Zárate.
Morales, with his contentious rhetoric, has killed what was said of Chile's goodwill, meant Zárate.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss the issue afterwards.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
The former president, Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, who is Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision was unusually quick.
On Monday, Bolivia will have an ‘extraordinary opportunity to open up new relations with Chile’ and a chance to ‘put a line at 139 years of disunity and rather benefit both,’ he said.
Calzadilla also rejected the fact that Morales, still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, used this maritime issue to win voices.
‘Bolivia will never give up the right of access to the Pacific,’ he added.
"The judgment is an opportunity to see what we need to do to forget the past."
North Korea says they won't abolish nuclear weapons if they can't trust the U.S.
The North Korean Foreign Minister, Ri Yong Ho, says that his nation cannot be the first to abolish, if they cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
He encouraged the United States to follow up on the promise they gave during the Singapore meeting between the American and North Korean leaders.
Ri's comments come at a time when U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pomepo, seems to want to relaunch his locked nuclear weapons diplomacy, more than three months after the Singapore meeting with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Un.
Ri says the United States has a false hope that North Korea will submit if the United States persists in sanctions and opposes any statement of the end of the Korean war.
Washington refuses to agree to a possible declaration of the end of the war, without Pyongyang abolishing it first.
Both Kim and the U.S. President, Donald Trump, will hold a new meeting.
But many are critical that Pyongyang is serious when it comes to degradation and that the country most likely sees its weapons as a guarantee of security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare the second Kim-Trump meeting.
Paris shows that massive headgear is the last fashion on the way to a handy man near you
If you want to upgrade your hat collection or block the sun completely, you will no longer need to search.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne have revealed a series of large and special headgear in their SS19 collection. The main concerns amazed the audience during the fashion week in Paris.
The highest impractical hats can be seen on Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their shocking creations right on the catwalk.
The most magnificent garment was an elaborate, beige Valentino hat with a feather-like, at the broom that covered the models' heads.
There was also another oversized accessory during the fashion show, including a jewel-sprayed watermelon, a trollman's hat, and even a pineapple - but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a collection of bizarre masks--just in time before Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had lips that were sewn together and resembled more on Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One of the creations resembles diving equipment, complete with snorkel and mask, while another looks like a melted ice in biscuits.
If you like this enormously dramatic fashion, you can just forget.
Fashion experts find that the huge hats come for sale in a handy manner near you.
The oversized hats come straight after La Bomba, the straw hat with the 60 cm wide brim that has been seen on celebrities from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult-brand behind the most impractical hat, which was everywhere on social media, has now sent a new creation out on the catwalk -- a straw beach bag of the same size as the bikini-dressed model that carried her.
The beach bag, with the colour of burnt orange and frowning the top with a white leather handle, was the most eye-catching part of Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection during the fashion week in Paris.
The celebrity stylist Luke Armitage commented to FEMAIL: “I expect to see big hats and beach bags in the fashion shops next summer – the designer has made such a big impression that I doubt it is possible to ignore the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Global Citizens Need Language Knowledge
Private schools in Scotland are known to be at a high academic level, and this continues in 2018 with excellent exam results, which are only amplified by individual and shared success in sports, art, music and other social activities.
With over 30,000 elephants across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS), are working to provide the best services to their students and parents.
Self-employed schools aim to provide their students with further and higher education, career paths and the role of global citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a tailor-made curriculum, we see that modern languages are popular choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, the message goes to his head.
If you speak with him in his own language, the message goes to his heart."
This is an important reminder that we can't just lean on English when we want to build relationships and trust in people from other countries.
By looking at the exam results from this year, we can see that languages are at the top of the league tables with the highest grades of independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of the elephants who took the lead got A.
The data collected from SCIS's 74 member schools shows that 72 percent of students got A in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who took German, 69 percent of those who took French, and 63 percent of those who took Spanish also got A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support leading languages as vital characteristics, which children and young people will definitely need in the future.
Languages that are considered to be equivalent to STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curriculum of independent schools and other places.
A study carried out by the UK Addition and Properties Selection in 2014 showed that 17 percent of employers failed to fill settings because of the lack of language skills of the applicants.
For this reason, languages in schools are increasingly important for preparing young people for work.
With more job opportunities for language professionals, these properties are essential in a globalised value.
No matter what kind of career a youth chooses, if they have learned a second language, they have a good advantage in the future with such a quality.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically provide a multilingual person with a competitive value.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adult British in 2013, 75 percent couldn't speak any other language than English well enough to keep a conversation going, and French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage, 15 percent.
This is why it is so important to invest in language training for our children.
Being able to speak more languages, especially the languages used in developing countries, can give children a better chance to find good jobs in the future.
In Scotland, each school is different when it comes to the language they teach.
Many schools focus on the classic modern languages, while others teach in languages classified as important in the United Kingdom when we look forward to 2020, for example mandarin and Japanese.
Whatever your child is interested in, there will always be a lot of languages to choose from in independent schools, and teachers who are specialists in this area.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated and want to create a learning environment that will guide children and give them the qualities they need to close, no matter what the future brings.
One cannot deny that in this global business-oriented environment, languages are vital for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in the education sector.
Modern languages should be called ‘international communication characteristics’.
Self-employed schools will continue to offer this option, providing skills and skills for their young people in Scotland.
Il fout bien le faire.

LeBron debuts in Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
Waits are soon facing fans who are looking forward to seeing LeBron James debuts at the Los Angeles Lakers basketball team.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James is going to play in the preseason game on Sunday, against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how long to play has not yet been determined.
"There will be more than one minute and less than 49," Walton announced on Lakers' official website.
The Lakers reporter, Mike Trudell, tweets that James is most likely to play a limited time.
After training this week, James was asked about his plans for Lakers' schedule for the preseason.
"I don't need preseason games at this stage of my career to get me ready," he said.
Trumps West Virginia Rally Time, YouTube
President Donald Trump starts on a whirlwind of campaigns tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
That's the first of Trump's five planned stops the coming week, including stops at friendly places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With a confirmation voice waiting to fill out the vacancy of the Supreme Court, Trump aims to build up support for the upcoming midway elections as Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when voting in November.
How time should Trump be in West Virginia tonight, and how can you see it online?
Trump's collection in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 19:00 this evening, Saturday 29 September 2018.
You can see Trump's West Virginia collection online below, via live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to record this week's hearings by the Supreme Court-nominated Brett Kavanaugh, who was excited about the debt of sexual abuse, with an expected affirmative voice from the Senate waiting for up to a week while the FBI is investigating.
But the primary goal of this cave of collections is to help the Republicans meet the November elections and get some momentum (drive).
So says President Trump's campaign that the next week's five collections are aimed at "raising up volunteers and followers who the Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
‘Congress control is so critical of his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible when we enter the busy campaign season,’ says a Trump campaign spokesman who refused to be informed to Reuters.
Planned for Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the collection for the evening can bring supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and take cover from Pittsburgh media, according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state he won at more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is in demand in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come and try to give him a boost in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a political researcher at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team The United States is showing stomach for fighting to keep hope alive on singles on Sunday
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday afternoon's foursomes could only be what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging pendulum of moment is a completely invented sport, but one that the players really believe in, and never more than in competitors like these.
So where would they say that the moment is now?
"They had a six-point lease, and now it's four, so we take it as a little moment, I guess," said Jordan Spieth as he walked off for the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, four points leading to twelve more in play.
Americans, as Spieth says, know that they have some wind in their sails, and they have a lot to encourage, not least the shape of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day, and each has three points from four.
Spieth has been mortal from tea to green and rents by example.
The guttural screams of the celebration were higher as his round continued, seeking an important putt to take the match four all-squao.re when he and Thomas had been two down after two.
His pit that won the game at 15, was met with a similar scream, the kind that tells you that he thinks that the American team is not out of this.
"You've only had to dig deeply and worry about your own struggle," said Spieh.
There are all of these players left.
18 holes to create an emblem.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the invincible history of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's strange, but cute couples are four out of four and can't do anything wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who weren't supposed to shoot a bookey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bookeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nine (the last nine holes on a track with 18 holes) on Friday morning.
It's the race, and the way their energy seems to flow to and from this noisy, committed audience, that they're the players to fight on Sunday, and there wouldn't be any more popular players to seal a potential European saying when the sun goes down over the Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both at the same time on different holes.
Talk about European honour is still too early.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson did short work by Sergio Garcia, the four-ball hero of the morning, when he was married to Alex Noren.
A bowey and two doubles on the first nine, the rough Spanish and the Swede into a hole they never came near climbing out of.
But on Sunday, no one can help you out of your hole.
The fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to look at closely because of the interaction between opponents, the advice they give, and the advice they don't give, and the way a strategy can change at a glance.
Europe has been playing better as a team so far and taking a considerable lead in the last day, but this foursome session also showed that the United States team has the stomach of the fight that someone, especially Stateside, had doubted.
Europe takes 10-6 lead in the Ryder Cup final
Europe will have a healthy advantage in the last day of the Ryder Cup after coming out of Saturday's fourballs and foursome games with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
Inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari rented the cargo with two victories over a giant Tiger Woods to take their fight so far at the Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European side offered to keep the trophy they lost on Hazeltine two years ago, dominated a misguided American side tomorrow fourballs, and took the series 3-1.
The U.S. added more resistance in foursomes and won two battles, but they couldn't get the bottom.
Jim Fury's side needs eight points from the 12 singles matches on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row while he and Molinari, called "Molliwood" after a spectacular weekend, are just the second pair to win four points from their opening in four matches in the Ryder Cup history.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed in fourballs, they looked so great to beat an outcast Woods and American rookie Bryson Decambeau with an even more intriguing 5 and 4.
Woods, who slid through two fights on Saturday, showed sporadic brilliance, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who slept for the morning's fourballs, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in foursomes to a 2 and 1 defeat by Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - ranked one and three in the world.
Europe didn't even get everything they wanted on a nice, windy day southwest of Paris.
Three times the winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the reference to Americans with two points on Saturday.
They won a brave 2 & 1 say about Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Paulter in fourballs and came back later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 & 3 in foursomes when they had lost the two holes in the opening.
Only twice in the Ryder Cup history has a layer come back from a four-point base and entered singles, although as holders, the Feark page only needs to draw to keep the trophy.
After being the second best for two days, it still looks as if a Sunday mot attack will be outside them.
North Korea says that it is not possible to rust down unilaterally without trust
The Secretary of State of North Korea told the United Nations on Saturday that if sanctions continue to increase the mistrust of the United States, and that the country would by no means give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly of the World Power that North Korea had taken “significant action” to improve the situation in the last year, for example they have stopped nuclear and missile tests, dismantled the nuclear test site and promised not to spread nuclear and nuclear technology.
“We do not get anything similar back from the United States,” he said.
‘Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances, it is not possible that we unilaterally disarm ourselves first.’
While Ri, a well-known North Korean, has filed several complaints about Washington's opposition to a 'phase' approach to the abolition of nuclear weapons, where North Korea would be paid to take gradual steps, his inquiries showed themselves significantly by not rejecting unilateral nuclear degradation, as Pyongyang has done before.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a first summit ever between a seated U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim promised to work for ‘reduction of nuclear power in the Korean peninsula’ while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea’s security.
North Korea has wanted a formal end to the Korean war from 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to facilitate tough international sanctions in North Korea.
‘USA insists on ‘reduction of nuclear power first’ and increases pressure by sanctions to achieve its purpose by force, and they even oppose the ‘declaration of peace’, said Ri.
"The fact that sanctions can break us is a false hope among those who are not interested in us.
But the problem is that when the sanctions continue, our mistrust becomes only greater."
Not to mention the plans for a new summit between Kim and Trump, as the U.S. President highlighted in the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister weighted three meetings between Kim and South Korea's leader, Moon Jae-in, in the last five months and added: "If the party in this call for nuclear disarmament was South Korea, and not the United States, the degradation of the Korean peninsula would not have stopped as it has now done."
Nevertheless, the tone of Ri's speech was dramatically different from last year, when he told the General Assembly in F.N. that it was not possible to stop North Korean rockets against the mainland of America, after President Trump called Kim a rocketman on suicide mission.
Trump, who last year threatened to ‘totally destroy’ North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take steps to disarm, but said that much work still had to be done and that sanctions had to be in place to North Korea to liquidate his nuclear weapon.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he didn't have a time frame for this, and said, "If it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia claim that the F.N. Security Council should pay Pyongyang for the measures taken.
But the United States Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, told F.N.'s Security Council on Thursday that 'pensions to the Security Council must still be maintained strongly and without failure until we have the complete, final, verified liquidation of nuclear weapons.'
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in order to channel funds into Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met Ri on the sideline of the general assembly in F.N. and then said that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare a new summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times already this year, but his last trip was not going well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said that it had made progress, but a few hours later he condemns North Korea for coming up with "gangster-like demands."
North Korea promised in a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle a missile site and also an atomic complex if the United States did ‘similar action’.
He said that Kim had told him that the “corresponding measures” he was applying for were security guarantees promised by Trump in Singapore, and progressed towards normalizing his relationship with Washington.
Harvard students take the course to get enough sleep
This year, a new course at Harvard University has helped all students to get more sleep, trying to fight the growing macho culture of studying caffeine all night, that is, a user of caffeine to stay awake all night to study.
An academic found out that high school students often carelessly when it comes to the most basic -- how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, Professor of Sleep Medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed the course, as he thinks is the first of his battle in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after talking about the influence sleep deprivation has on learning.
"At the end of it, a girl came up to me and said, "Why am I being told this now, at an adult age?"
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleeping-- something that surprised me, he said to The Telegraph.
The course, rolled out for the first time this year, explains what is important for how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, and improves their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Managing Director of the University's Health Services, said that the university decided to introduce the course after the students got seriously worse sleep during the week.
The hourly course involves a number of interactive tasks.
In one section, there is a picture of a dormitory where students click on coffee cups, curtains, trainers and books to be told about the effect of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by sleep deprivation, as well as how important it is with evening routines.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
A map of the campus, with interactive icons, invites participants to think about their daily routines.
'We know that it won't change the behaviour of the elephants right away.
But we think they have the right to know - just like you have the right to know, the health effects by choosing to smoke cigarettes, added Prof. Czeisler.
The culture of pride over the dawn still exists, he said and added that modern technology and ever-increasing pressure on students mean that sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
Ensuring that you get enough sleep, of good quality, should be the student's secret weapon against stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said -- even to avoid gaining weight, since lack of sleep puts the brain in a state of state of starvation and makes them constantly sullen.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old from California who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler develop the course, having our student with him last year, his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course had opened his eye and inspired him to press for a course for the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all doctoral students to complete a similar study programme before they start at the high-precision institution.
Prof Czeisler advised that students should consider setting an alarm when going to bed, and then when waking up, and be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" coming from electronic screens and LED lighting, which can transform the internal clock completely, leading to problems of sleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga goals bring down Gerrard's men
Rangers went on a new track defeat when Dolly Menga's post sent Steven Gerrard's page to a 1-0 loss on Livingston.
Ibrox's page was on the lookout for taking its first say on the road since the 4-1-trium of St. Johnstone in February, but made to Gary Holt cause only Gerrard's second defeat on 18 battles as leader, and gave eight points, a round under Ladbroke's leader of the Premier League, Hearts.
Menga beat up to seven minutes before half-time, and a Ranger line-up with a lack of inspiration never seemed to equalize.
While the Rangers now fall to the sixth place, Livingston climbs to the third place and lies only behind the Hibernian on the finish line.
And there may be further problems in storage for the Rangers after the lineman Calum Spence had to be treated for a wound in the head, after an object apparently was thrown from the far side.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that feia Ayr entered the Betfred Cup semifinals.
Holt , on the other hand, went with Livy 11 who took a point with a dream shot last week, and he would have been thrilled by the way that his wildly charming suit took the stranglehold of his opponents on every shift.
Rangers might have had the ball most, but Livingston did more with the ball they had.
They should have scora after only two minutes when Menga's first post sends Scott Pittman over to Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder failed in his giants.
A long kick from Keaghan Jacobs found then Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner, Alan Lithgow, could only shoot far on the retreat.
Rangers took control, but it seemed to be more hope than belief in their game in the last third round.
Alfredo Morellos certainly knew that he should have been punished on the 20 meter mark when he and Steven Lawless collided, but the judges Steven Thomson waved away the wish to the Colombian.
Rangers could only hit two shots in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was hardly concerned by Lassana Coulabary's head and a tame shot from Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi's opening in the 34th minute may have been against the glints, no one can deny that they only lit it because of the shot.
Again, Rangers failed to handle a deep deadball from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher beat the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept himself cool to pick out Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard acted as if he were switching Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and changing the spring cause an immediate effect when the winger made a hatch for Morelos, but the impressive Kelly rushed forward to block.
But Livingstone continues to overlist the guest layer to play exactly what they liked, with Lithgow and Halkett sending out long shots in long shots.
Holt's team could have increased the lead at the end, but McGregor succeeded in preventing Jacobs in it, until Lithgrow left a long post from the corner mark.
The Reserve for Ranger, Glenn Middleton, had a new claim to punishment when he supported with Jacobs, but again Thomson overlooked it.
Almanac: Inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our «Sunday Morning» Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and WE REKNAR ... the day when he who was to become the physicist Johannes Wilhelm «Hans» Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the apparatus known as the Geiger counter.
As a scientific support beam all the way since then, the Geiger counter was also a pillar of pop culture, as in the 1950 film 'Bells of Coronado', with the seemingly improbable late cowboy researchers Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: What in the world is it?
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, it can be used to find radioactive minerals, for example uranium.
When you put these earphones on, you can actually hear the effects of the atom that comes from the radioactivity of the minerals.
Evans: ‘Yes, no bubble it!’
His Geiger died in 1945, only a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the invention that asks his name lives on.
New cancer vaccines can teach the immune system to “see” red cells.
New cancer vaccines can learn the immune system to “see” red cells and kill them
Vaccine teaches the immune system to recognise red cells, as part of the treatment
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient and changing them in the laboratory
They can then see a protein that is common to many cancers, and then reinject.
A sample vaccine shows promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
One woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize red cells, experienced that the ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, changing them in the laboratory, so that they can ‘see’ a protein that is common in many cancers, called HER2, and then reinjecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said, "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "is driving the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovary, lung and colorectal cancer," explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to extract immune cells from patients and ‘teach’ them how they target cancer cells has worked when treating a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West launches a Pro-Trump-diatribe, wearing a MAGA-lue, after he's hosted the TV show Saturday Night Live.
It wasn't that good.
Kanye West was beeped in the studio during Saturday Night Live after an unlikely achievement in which he praised the President of the United States, Donald Trump, and said he would stand for election in 2020.
After taking his third song for the evening, calling Ghost Town, where he was wearing a Make America Great-caps, he gave the Democrats a tirated and repeated supporting saying to Trump.
"How many times do I talk to a white person, and they say, "How could you like Trump, he's racist?"
Well, if I were concerned about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago, he said.
The SNL started the show with a song with comedian Matt Damon, where the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh in the Senate's legal selection on the debt of sexual assault from Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not sent, the recording to West's tirating was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock tried to mock West with the post.
The West also complained to the audience that he had the difficult backstage because of his headgear.
"They bullied me behind the scenes.
They said, don't go out there with that hat on.
They're bullying me!
And then they say I'm in a sunken place," he said, according to Washington Examinor.
West continued: 'Do you want to see the sunken place?' says he would 'put on the superman caps, because this means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try love.’
His comments led to beeping at least twice by the audience, and the SNL cast members seemed embarrassedly affected, Variety reported, with a person who told the publication: ‘The whole studio was dead silent.’
West was brought in as a late replacement for the singer Ariana Grande, when her former girlfriend, the rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days ago.
West confuses many with a performance of the song I Love it, dressed like a Perrier bottle.
West received support from the head of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner as a twitter: «To one of the most courageous spirits, please join the mob.»
But talk-show hostess Karen Hunter twittered that West 'was pretty simple just the way he is and it's absolutely amazing.'
‘But I DON’T choose to pay anyone (by buying his music or dressing or supporting his ‘art’) whom I think embraces and spews out ideology that is harmful to my society.
He's free.
We also did so.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and said that he was now ‘officially known as Kanye West’.
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Medrappar, Snoop Dogg has been named Snoop Lion and, of course, the last music legend Prince, changed the name to a symbol and then the artist who was formerly known as Prince.

Game of Thrones star Kit Harington goes against toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for the sword-winging role of Jon Snow in HBO's elective medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, has gone against the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that such roles on the screen often lead young guys to feel that they have to be tough to be respected.
In conversation with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that he thought something has gone wrong and asked how to tackle the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo age.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones partner Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he knew quite strongly to address the problem.
"Personally, I'm convinced that something has gone wrong with the masculinity." he said.
‘What have we learned when men grow up, when this is the problem we are now seeing?’
Kit believes that TV is partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to very male characteristics.
He goes on: 'What is innate and what is being taught?
What is taught on television and in the streets, what makes young guys feel like they have to be this particular side of being a man?
I think it's really one of the big questions in our time -- how do we change that?
For it is clear that something has gone wrong for young men.'
In the interview he also admitted that he would not do the Game of Thrones precursor or successor when the series ends this summer, saying he is ‘completed with battlefields and horses’.
From November, Kit will play in a new recording of Sam Shepard's True West, which is the story of a filmmaker and his brother, who is an ass.
The actor recently revealed that he was watching the meeting with his wife Rose to be the best thing that came out of the Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in this show, so that way it gave me my future family and my life on," he said.
Rose played Ygrite, the handsome to Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are in the country, say health-enhancing.
Some 40,000 new issues were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
Most new cases were transmitted through sex, marking a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly through some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who received HIV in this way was reduced to almost zero, said Chinese health professionals at a conference in Yunnan Province.
From year to year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute problem in China’s LGBT environment.
Homosexuality was decriminalised in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT/HBTQ people is reported to be widespread.
Because of the conservative values in the country, speech parties have studied that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases come from inadequate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medication as part of an attempt to tackle the problem.
Maxine Waters nectar added to paint information from the GOP Senator, it explodes in 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiracy theories'.
The United States Rep. Maxine Waers condemned on Saturday allegations that a member of her staff had published personal information about three Republican U.S. senators on the Wikipedia pages of the legislators.
The Los Angeles Democracy claims that the claims were pedaled by extreme right-wing surveys and web pages.
'Lies, lies, and more horrible lies', said Waters in a question on Twitter.
The published information included, for information purposes, home addresses and telephone numbers of the Americans Sens. Lindsey Graham in South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared on Thursday, was sent by an unknown person on Capitol Hill under a Senate Panel hearing about the debt of sexual assault on the Supreme Court-elected Brett Kavanaugh.
Leakage came once after the three senators asked Kavanaugh questions.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pondit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was linked to Waters' office and released the information to a member of the Waters' staff, Hill reported.
‘This baseless claim is entirely false and an absolute lie,’ continues Waters.
'One of my associates - who has got his identity, personal information and security compromised as a result of these dishonest and false claims - was by no means responsible for the leakage of this information.
This baseless claim is entirely false and an absolute lie."
Questionnaires to Water quickly received criticism on the Internet, among others from former Press Secretary of the White House, Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is angry," wrote Butcher.
"This suggests that she does not have a temperament to be a member of the Congress.
When someone becomes guilty of something they didn't do, they can't be angry.
They must not be tough.
They may not ask questions about the debtor's motives.
They must be calm and peaceful.’
Fleischer proved to compare Waters' reaction to the criticism of the Democrats of the Kavanaugh judgments, which were owed by critics to be apparent to anger during the hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who tries to take over Waters' place in the mid-term election, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Very much if that's true," he tweeted.
In fact, Waters said that her office had warned ‘they're the right government and the law enforcement units of these false claims.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are revealed," she continues, "and that they will be held legally responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to each of my employees."
Johnny English Strikes Again - Spy Customs of Weak Rowan Atkinson
It's traditional to look for Brexit in all new films with a British turn, and it's current for this revival of Johnny England's action-comedie spoof-franchise - which started back in 2003 with Johnny English and was revived in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will self-ironic satire that deals with how open-minded we are become the new export potential of the country?
At any rate, the great-great, incompetent Johnny English with the rubber face has for the second time renewed his right to fuck things up -- his name signals more than anything else that he is a broad comedian for cinematographers in non-English-speaking countries.
He is, of course, the foolish, secret agent who, despite his bizarre desire to spread a little glamour, has received a little bit of Clouseau, a dash of Mr. Bean and a portion of the guy who contributes a simple melody to the Firecars, the theme of the Olympic opening ceremony in London in 2012.
He is also originally based on the travelling and international mysterious man Atkinson once played in the now forgotten Barclaycard TV ads, which left chaos behind.
There's one or two nice flashes in this last JE escape.
I love Johnny English who approaches a helicopter while he was dressed in a medieval armor suit while the rotor blades hit his helmet.
Atkinson's gift to physical comedy is on the screen, but the humor is quite weak and strangely unnecessary, especially since "serious" movie brands such as 007 and Mission Impossible even now safely offer comedy as an ingredient.
The humor is as if he's directed at children instead of grown-up, and to me Johnny England's noisy accident is not as ingenious and focused as Atkinson's replication claw is in the person of Bean.
The current permanent mandate is that the United Kingdom is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated the United Kingdom's super-secret web network of spies, which uncovers the identities of all UK agents in the field, to the dismay of the agent at work -- a sadly small role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last straw for a prime minister who is a pompous and warlike figure, who already has a complete breakdown of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing his very best with this quasi-Theresa-May character, but there's not much in the script to work with.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that when every active spy has been in debt, she has to pick up someone who is retired.
And that means that the incompetent Johnny English himself, who works as a learner of a somewhat elegant establishment, but gives unofficial lessons on how to work undercover: a few fine jokes here, since English offers a School of Rock-Type Academy of Spying.
English is sent back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunite with his former understanding assistant Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, moving over to a submarine driver's job, an over-enthusiast role where Vicki Pepperdine is a little wasted.
So Batman and Robin's ability to get things to get terribly crazy in Hennar Majesty's Secret Services is back too fully in the meeting with Olga Kurylenko's beautiful five fatal, Ophelia Bulletova.
In the meantime, the prime minister falls dangerously under the spell of the charismatic technology of the billionaire, who claims he can solve the United Kingdom's data problem: the scary Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their journey of farce-like wild games: disguised as waitresses, they set the guys at a fine French restaurant; they create chaos and smuggle on board Volta's yacht; and English triggers pure anarchy when he tries to use a Virtual Reality headset to get acquainted with the interior of Volta's house.
All the stops are probably pulled out to the last sequence, but as lovable and undisciplined as it is, there's a lot of child TV all over the place.
Pretty moderate stuff.
And like the other Johnny English movies, I couldn't help thinking, can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really makes justice to his talent?
Labour Workers' Party denies that they are working on a plan for the English to work for a four-day week, but are paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party now evaluates a radical plan that wants the British to work a four-day week - but gets paid for five.
According to the report, business leaders will forward savings made through the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to employees, by giving them an extra day off.
Then the addition would benefit a three-day weekend - but still receive the same salary.
Sources said the idea would match with the party's economic agenda and plans to increase employee benefits.
The change to a four-day week has been approved by Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to benefit from the changed economy.
An older source from Labour told The Sunday Times: A policy message is expected to be announced before the turn of the year.
'It doesn't happen overnight, but a four-day workweek is a wish that fits into the approach the party has to balance the economy for the benefit of the worker, as well as overseeing the party's industrial strategy.'
The Labour Party would not be the first to approve such an idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day week of work in its election campaign in 2017.
At the moment, however, the ambition is not accepted by the entire Labour Party.
A Labour spokesman said, 'Eight-four-day working week is not party politics and it's not being judged by the party.'
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour Conference to reinforce his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said that he was determined to take back power from "faceless directors" and "profits" in rich companies.
The plans of the shadow chancellor also mean that current shareholders in water companies cannot get their entire efforts back when a Labour Government could make a ‘deduction’ because of perceived misbehaviour.
He also has confirmed plans to put employees on corporate boards and create Inclusive Ownership Funds to add 10 percent of the equity of private sector enterprises, which would receive annual dividends of up to £500, about £5,000.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy, reports in the 60 Minutes TV program about the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh could change their thinking.
The FBI investigation into complaints against sentences Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least one week, and it raises the question of to what extent the Agency found could influence some Republican senators to withdraw its support.
In an interview sent on Sunday, correspondent Scott Pelley in '60 Minutes' asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could uncover something that would change their mind.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mine, of course," said Kennedy.
‘I said on the way into the earring, I said, I talked to the judges Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, that statement came out and said, 'Have you done it?'
He was destined, fixed, open-ended."
Graham's voice still seemed to be stoned.
"I've made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh, and it would take a dynamite charge to change me," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it, "la Graham till, and referred to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And all its names could not verify it.
It's 36 years old.
I don't see anything new changing."
What is the Global Citizens Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday is New York hosted by the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that has a tremendously impressive array of stars that perform and an equally impressive mission; ending poverty in the world.
No in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people flocking to Central Park's large lawn, not only to see Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes acting, but also to raise awareness of the true goal of the event to end extreme poverty by 2030.
Global Citizens Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international support group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you were willing to pay for a VIP ticket), concert presenters had to complete a number of tasks, or ‘actions’ as voluntary work; email a world leader, call a phone call or other meaningful ways to help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been with 12 years to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a real way to persuade people to demand a call for action, or just another case of so-called 'clicktivism' - people feel that they make a real difference by signing an online appeal or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says that it has registered more than 19 million ‘actions’ from its support players, and participated in and pressed for a variety of goals.
It says that these actions have helped world leaders to publish commitments and policies equivalent to more than 37 billion dollars, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group had 390 commitments and publications resulting from their actions, including at least $10 billion already paid or collected.
The group estimates that so far the secure resources have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the most important obligations are The Power of Nutrition, a British-based partnership of investors and entrepreneurs who are obliged to ‘help children reach their full potential’; promises to give Rwanda $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from global citizens.
“With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and global citizens, just like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history,” - told Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, audience during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after taking more than 5,000 actions to demand that the United Kingdom improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the UK government announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition treatment.
In answer to one of the usual questions on the website, they ask, ‘What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?’
Global citizen said, "It will be a long and difficult road - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But as the major civil rights and anti-separation movements lead us, we will be happy, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among some of the actors who perform at this year's event in New York, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Fleet as 'blockade' to prevent Russian energy sports - interior secretary
Washington may 'if necessary' resort to its fleet to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including in the Middle East, international secretary Ryan Zinke has revealed, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinc claimed that Russia's commitment to Syria -- especially where they operate at the invitation of the legitimate government -- is a boost to explore new energy markets.
‘I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to pass on energy, just as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern part of Europe,’ he said.
And according to the official, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States has this possibility, with our Fleet, to ensure that the sea roads are open and, if necessary, blocked to ensure that their energy does not enter the market," he said.
Zinc spoke to the participants at the event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that presents itself as the ‘stimma to the energy consumer’ in the United States.
He compared Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, and noted that they're actually the same.
‘The economic solution in Iran and Russia is more or less to exploit and replace fuels,’ he said, referring to Russia as a ‘one-trick pony’ with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The declarations come as the Trump administration has been tasked with increasing exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, the much cheaper option for European consumers.
In this context, Trump officials, including US President Donald Trump, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the ‘inappropriate’ Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, made Berlin the ‘capture’ of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly underlined that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is set to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economical project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's fierce resistance to the project is driven only for economic reasons, and is a case of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a tool to exert pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," said Russian energy minister Alexander Novak after a meeting with US energy secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. fan has withdrawn a setback from Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading organisation for industry, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has encouraged the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country disrupts our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, leader of the German Industrial Association (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will ‘run hard’ to stand as presidential candidate in 2020, says Massachusetts Senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would take a "deep look" to stand as a presidential candidate after the mid-term election.
During a council house meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider her candidate status.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our bad government, and it includes a woman on top," she said, according to The Hill.
‘After 6 November, I will consider making a thorough proposal as a presidential candidate.’
Warren addressed President Donald Trump during the town hall meeting and said that he is ‘misleading this country’.
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren has been scratched in his criticism of Trump and his high-ranking Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
A poll issued on Thursday, however, showed that the majority of Warren’s own voters do not believe that she should be a candidate in 2020.
51 percent of the "probable" Massachusetts voters said the senator shouldn't be a candidate, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Centre/ Boston Globe investigation.
Thirty-two percent support such a candidate.
The investigation showed more support for a round of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting a potential candidate and 48 percent against.
Other highly profiled democratic names discussed with regard to a potential 2020 candidate include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
The Biden said he would decide officially in January, reported the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin argues for Track Palin's PTSD at the Donald Trump collection
Track Palin, 26, was a year in Iraq after being recruited in September.
He was arrested and charged with a power incident in the world on Monday night
"What my own son is going through, what he's going through when he comes back, allows me to relate to other families that are affected by PTSD and some of the wounds with which our solar data returns," she said to the audience at a collection for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in space" and said about his son and other war veterans that "they're coming back a little different, they're coming back here, they're coming back and wondering if the respect for what they and fellow soldiers and pilots and all the other military, have done for the country, exists."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and was responsible for physical power in the world against a woman, for disrupting a report on the power of the home and the safekeeping of a weapon while he was rushing, according to Dan Bennett, spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. Support challenge for new asylum policies
Eighteen states and districts in Columbia support a legal challenge to a new American policy that denies asylum to victims who flee from repatriation or are elected in the world.
Representatives from the 18 states and districts submitted a friend-of-court brief Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker who challenged policy, reported NBC News.
The plaintiff's full name in Grace v. Sessions fits in with the fact that the American Civil Liberties Union (U.S.) filed in August against federal policy has not been revealed.
She said that her partner ‘and the elected members-sons’ abused her, but U.S. officials refused her application for asylum on 20 July.
She was arrested in Texas.
Lawyers of the States that support Grace, describe El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, who produce a large number of applicants for American asylum, who are faced by nations with profound problems of gangs and elections in the world.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision from immigration laws, which allowed illegal immigrants fleeing the empire to seek asylum.
District of Columbia Minister of Justice Karl Racine said on a Friday morning that the new policy ‘ignores many decades of state, federal and international law’.
‘Federal law requires all asylum cases to be judged for the specific facts and circumstances of the claim, and such an obstacle is contrary to this principle,’ said the friend-of-the-court brief.
Lawyers further claim in the summary that the policy that denies immigrants access harms the US economy, saying that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and ‘provide necessary work’.
Advocate General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges no longer to grant asylum to victims who fled abuse and repatriation in June.
‘Asylum is available to those who have left their country of origin for persecution or fear of racial, religious, national or political reasons,’ said the Sessions of 11 June in their policy-making.
Asylum was never meant to alleviate all the problems -- even all the serious problems -- that people face every day all over the world.
Desperate rescue work in Palu while fatal doubles in the race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation was increasingly serious.
"It feels very exciting," said 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, who comforted his feverish baby son at an evacuation centre in the ruined city of Palu.
"Every minute ambulances with bodies come.
Clean water is difficult to find.’
Inhabitants have been observed on their way back to their broken worlds, as they search for water-damaged properties and try to save everything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and the hospitals destroyed by the earthquake, which had a force of 7.5, were flooded.
Some of them injured, including Dwi Haris, who had broken back and shoulder, sedated outside of Palu's Military Hospital, where patients were treated outdoors because of still strong aftershocks.
Tears filled his eye as he told him that he knew the powerful earthquake shook the hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter on the fifth floor.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was pushed into the ruins of the wall, I think, « told Haris to the Associated Press, and added that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife call for help, but then it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
US Ambassador owes China for ‘bulking’ with ‘propaganda ads’
One week after an official Chinese newspaper ran a 4-page commercial in an American daily newspaper highlighting the mutual benefits of trading with the United States and China, the American ambassador owed to China Beijing to use the American press to spread propaganda.
The United States President Donald Trump last referred Wednesday to China Daily's paid contributions in the Des Moines register -- the state of Iowa's largest salsavis -- after having owed China to try to interfere in the US Congressional elections on November 6, a debt of China nectar.
Trump's indebtedness that Beijing tried to interfere in U.S. elections, marked what U.S. officials told Reuters was a new phase in an escalating Washington campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign government to place advertising to support trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in an increasing trade war that has seen them in rounds increasing taxes on each other's imports.
China's retaliation tariffs early in the trade war were designed to meet exporters in states like Iowa who supported Trump's Republican party, Chinese and American experts have said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and the former long-standing governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said that Beijing had damaged American workers, farmers and businesses.
“China,” wrote Branstad in a sentence in the Sunday’s Des Moines register, “doublar no bullying by running propaganda ads in our own free press.”
‘In its communication of propaganda, the Chinese government takes advantage of America’s dear tradition of freedom of expression and a free press by placing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines register,’ wrote Branstad.
«In contrast, at the newspaper outlet down the street here in Beijing, you find limited dissenting voices and will not see any true reflection of the different opinions that the Chinese people may have on China's problematic economic path, given that the media are under the fixed thumb of the Chinese Communist Party » he writes.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers deviated from the offer to publish" his article, even though he didn't say what kind of newspaper.
Republicans lead female voters in the middle term with Kavanaugh Debacle, warning analysts.
Since many top republicans are a stand-by and defend the high-ranking Brett Kavanaugh in a meeting with several sexual assault debt, the analyst has warned that they will probably see a setback, especially from women, in the coming midway elections.
The feelings about this have been extremely high, and most Republicans have registered that they already wanted to move on with one voice.
These things cannot be undone, says Grant Reeher, Professor of State Science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, to The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said that he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) the last moment of pressure for an FBI investigation would be enough to relax angry voters.
"Women won't forget what happened yesterday - they won't forget it tomorrow, and not in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive MoveOn group on Friday, Washington, DC Newspaper.
On Friday morning's song Protestants 'November is coming!' while they demonstrated in the hall of the Senate when the Republicans, who run the court committee, chose to proceed with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
«Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are going to be outside the diagram,» said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst, to the news page.
'People say it's already been high, it's true.
But there can be higher, especially among female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18 to 29 years old, who, while not like the president, often don't vote."
Even before Ford's public testimonies detailing the claims of sexual assault against the nominee of the nominee, analysts suggested that a setback should be followed if Republicans press forward with confirmation.
«This has been a confused root for the GOP,» said Michael Steele, former leader of the Republican National Committee, early last week, according to NBC News.
‘It’s not just about the vote of the Committee or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh is on the bench, it’s also about how Republicans have handled this and how they have treated it,’ Guy Cecil, director of the Priorities United States, a group involved in the election of Democrats, pointed to the news channel.
But the Americans seem to be a little bit divided over who they should trust in the cool water of Ford's and Kavanaugh's testimonies, with a little more sidings with the last name.
A new poll from YouGov shows that 41 percent of the respondents definitely or probably believed Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they definitely or probably believed Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they believed that Kavanaugh was probably or definitely lying under his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford, and besides at least another complaint, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Forewarn the Senate Legal Board Committee during the last week's ownership that Kavanaugh completely violated her at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the high-level nominee showed her the genital organs while they attended a party during the time they studied at Yale University in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to meet Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a launch that seeks to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the Technology Legend, Inrupt, is a company built by Berners-Lees open source Solid platform.
Solid lets users choose where to store the data and which people have access to the data.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee spooked that the meaning of Inrupt is “world domination”.
'We have to do it now,' he said about the launch.
‘It’s a historical moment.’
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own personal online repository or POD.
It may include contact lists, memo lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive; Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in a browser and all at the same time.
What is unique about the personal online store is that it is entirely up to the user who can access all kinds of information.
The company calls it ‘personal authority through data’.
The idea of Inrupt, according to the managing director of the company John Bruce, is that the company should include resources, process and appropriate capabilities to make Solid available to all.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM and some contracted developers to work on the project, as well as a community of volunteer encoders.
From this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralised apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team don't talk to "Facebook and Google about not introducing a complete change where all their business models are completely turned on their heads overnight.
"We do not ask their permission."
In an article on media published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new Solid-built network collection.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been a voice with great influence in the debate on online neutrality.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will be the current founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
‘I’m unbelievably optimistic for this next era online,’ said Berners-Lee ti l.
Bernard Vann: WW1 Victoria Cross divine celebration
The divinity of the only English church that won a Victoria Cross during World War I as a fighter has been celebrated in its hometown 100 years later.
Lt Col Pastor Bernard Vann won the prize on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglish and Lehaucourt.
He was nevertheless killed by a sniper four days later and never knew he had won the highest British military honor.
A memorial stone was deflected by his two grandchildren on a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "brilliant symbolic," that the stone would be deflected exactly 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning achievement.
According to London Gazette, Lt Col Vann led his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin on 29 September 1918 “through a very thick wooded and under heavy fire from the field and machine gun.”
He later jumped up to the front line, and with the 'greatest gallantry' he led the line forward before he simply rushed forward with a field gun and struck out three of the group.
Lt Col Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - a little over a month before the war was over.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "whatever I know I could never live up to, but something I'm humble for."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid a wreath after the parade, which was led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he felt very honored to play a role in the parade, and added that "the value of a real whole is shown by the support given by many people."
The MMA fan was up all night to see Bellator 206, they got Peppa Gris instead
Imagine this, you've been up all night to see a package of Bellator 206 but you won't see the main event.
The bill from San Jose contained 13 matches, including six on the main card and was displayed live through the night in the United Kingdom on channel 5.
At 6 o'clock in the morning, right in the Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald preparing to meet each other, viewers in the United Kingdom were again stunned when the covers changed to Peppa Gris.
Some were not impressed after they had kept awake until the early hours especially for the fight.
A tab on Twitter described a switch to the children's comic book as 'a kind of sick joke.'
“It’s public regulation that at 6:00 p.m. when the content was not owned that way, they had to switch to the program for the children,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president for marketing and communication, when he was asked about the transfer.
‘ Peppa-pig, ‘yes’.
Bellator Company President Scott Coker said they're going to work on planning to include British viewers in the future.
"I think when I think about replay, I think we can find out," said Coker.
"But the clock is six in the morning on a Sunday, and we can't figure this out until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Trust me, when it went over, there were a lot of lyrics going back and forth, and everyone wasn't friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical mistake.
But it wasn't; it was a public problem.
I can promise you, the next time it won't happen.
We keep it to five fights instead of six -- which we usually do -- and we tried to hand over to the fans, and we just went over.
It is an unfortunate situation.»
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley knew the ‘underlying’ because of sexuality
The Olympic diver Tom Daley says that growing up he felt worse than anyone because of his sexuality -- but that gave him the motivation to become a success.
The 24-year-old said he didn't understand until he went to the secondary school that "not everyone is like me."
When he spoke on the first Radio 4 Desert Island discs presented by Lauren Laverne, he said that he talked out about his gay dishes to give others hope.
He also said to become a parent made him care less about winning the Olympics.
The permanent reporter in the cross-country skiing show, Kirsty Young, has taken several months off because of illness.
What could look like a lost in the Lavender's first program, Daly said he knew himself 'less than' everyone else who grew up because 'it wasn't socially acceptable to as boys and girls.'
He said, "From today on, feeling less than and feeling different is the real things that have given me the strength and strength to happiness."
He wanted to prove that he was "noco," he said, so he didn't disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The two-time bronze Olympic medal has been a professional LGBT campaign and used its appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to several countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said he spoke out because he knew himself lucky who could live open without discrimination and wanted to give others hope.
The three-course world champion said it was falling in love with a man -- the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 -- "surprise me."
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than he was, last year, but he said that the age difference had never been a problem.
"When you go through so much at such a young age" -- he went to his first OL at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later -- he said it was hard to find someone of the same age who had experienced similar heights and depressions.
The couple were parents in June to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that his whole perspective had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, everything was about me having to win a gold medal," he said.
"You know what, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
Mi Olympic gold medal is Robbie.»
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father didn't accept that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked about was if they had tickets to London in 2012 -- when he wanted to be in the first row.
"I couldn't tell him that you're not going to be on the front row," he said.
"I held my hand when he stopped breathing, and it wasn't until he had actually stopped breathing and he was dead that I finally acknowledged that he wasn't invincible," he said.
The following year Daley competed at the Olympics in 2012 and won bronze.
"I only knew that this was what I had dreamed of my whole life--to dive into front of a home audience at an Olympic game, where fans don't feel any better," he said.
It also inspired his first song choice -- Proud of Heather Small -- who had vibrated with him in the construction of the Olympics and still gave him goose bumps.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Out of shape his Mickelson on the bench of the Ryder Cup Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he must reverse form to say that it is an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who played in the two-year event for a record 12 times, was seen on the bench by Captain Jim Fürk in front of the laurday golf game in fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being in the middle of the action, as he has often been to the United States, the five-time winner splits his day between being a cheerleader and working on his game before reaching out for the hope of correcting what plagues him.
Never the most competent long shots. Not even at the top of your career, 48-year-olds are best off with the long shots on the throne, the French main course, where balls hit outside if the golfer's not exactly with the punch.
And if the course itself isn't scary enough, Mikkelson will meet in the ninth game on Sunday, the exact British Open Master Francesco Molinari, who has joined rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four battles theirs this week.
If the Americans, four points down by starting the 12 single battles, get to a warm start, Mickelson's fight can be absolutely crucial.
Feark expressed confidence in his husband, not that he could say much else.
“He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a clapping on my back and put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow,” said Fürk.
"He has great confidence in himself.
He's a Hall of Famer, and he's added so much to these layers in the past and this week.
I probably didn't think he was playing two games.
I saw more, but that's how it happened, and that's how we thought we had to do.
He will be out there, just like everyone else."
Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record in most Ryder Cup games played on Sunday.
It can mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never quite matched the heights of his individual record.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 losses and seven halves, although Fürk said his proximity added some intangible properties to the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, entertaining, likes to have fun with people and he's a nice guy to have in the storeroom," he explained.
'I think the younger players had fun playing with him too, this week, which was fun to see.
He contributes much more than just playing.’
Captain Thomas Bjorn, Europe knows that great leadership can soon disappear.
Thomas Bjørn, the European Captain, knows from experience that a considerable rent on the way into the last days' singles of the Ryder Cup can easily be turned into an unpleasant trip.
The Danish made their debut in the 1997 Valderrama battle, where a side captain of Seve Ballestero held a five-point advantage over the Americans, but only came over the finish line with his nose leading with the narrowest margins, winning 141⁄2-131⁄2.
“You keep reminding yourself that we had a big rental on Valderrama; we had a big rental on Brookline, where we lost, and on Valderrama, where we won, but only so far,” said Björn, after he had seen Class 2018 win 5-3 both on Friday and yesterday to hire 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So history will show me and everyone on that team that this isn't over.
You're going to the full opening tomorrow.
Go out there and do all the right things.
This is not over until you have placed the score on the board.
We have a goal, and it's trying to win this trophy, and that's where the focus stays.
I've been saying all along, I'm focusing on the 12 players that are on our side, but we're so well aware of what's left over on the other side -- the biggest players in the world."
Happy about how his players have behaved on a tough golf course, Bjørn added: 'I would never take the saying in advance.
Tomorrow's another day.
Tomorrow, there's the individual achievements that come out, and there's another thing to do.
It's great to be out there with a partner when things go well, but when you're out there individually, you get to be tested out of your capacity as a golfer.
It is the message you need to convey to players; get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner, and he must go and get the best out of himself too."
In contrast to Bear, the opposite number Jim Fürk will be on the lookout after his players will perform better individually than they did as partners, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Fear itself has been at both ends of the spin-offs in the last few days, having been part of the winning team in Brookline before he stopped losing when Europe withdrew from the ‘Miracle of Medinah’.
"I think every single word of it," he said in response to being asked how Captain Ben Crenshaw, in 1999, had gathered his players on the way into the last day.
«We have 12 important battles tomorrow, but you want to get started with the quick start that you saw on Brookline, as you saw on Medinah.
When the moment goes by, there is a lot of pressure on the middle of the fights.
We set up our line-up like that and put the guys in motion in a way that feels good, you know, we're trying to do something magical tomorrow.'
Thomas has been assigned the task of trying to lead the fight and meets Rory McIlroy in the top game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter the other Europeans in the top half of the scheme.
"I went with this group of guys in this order because I think it covers all the way through," said Bjorn about his choices of singles.
Germany's new warships once again suspended
The newest frigate of the German Navy would have been ordered in 2014 to replace aging warships from the cold wartime, but it will not be there until at least next year due to faulty system and gleaming costs, reported local media.
The launch of the Rhineland-Palatinate, the leader ship until they split the new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit-avisa, which quotes a military spokesman.
The ship should have joined the fleet in 2014, but the troubling problems after delivery caused the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships The Navy ordered back in 2007, coming as a substitute for the aging Bremen-class frigates.
It is understood that they will contain a powerful cannon, a number of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some hidden technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important functions include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to deploy the latest frigates for up to two years away from the ports at home.
Nevertheless, continuous delays mean that the groundbreaking warships, which apparently allow Germany to exercise power abroad, will already be out of date when they enter service, notes Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 frigate made headlines last year, when the German fleet officially refused to accept the ship and returned it to Blohm & Voss yard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the German fleet has returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
The reasons for the return were not well known, but German media quoted a number of important ‘software and hardware errors’ that rendered the warship useless if they were placed on a combat mission.
Software errors were particularly important as the ships in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class will be driven by a crew of around 120 sailors - only half of the workforce of older Bremen frigates.
It also appeared that the ship is dramatically overweight, which reduces performance and limits the fleet's ability to add to future upgrades.
The 7000-tonne 'Rheinland-Pfalz' is assumed to be twice as heavy as similar ships used by the Germans in World War II.
Apart from the wrong hardware, the price of the entire project - including training of the crew - will also be a problem.
It is said that it has reached a staggering €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) - up from the initial €2.2 billion (EURO)
Problems associated with the latest frigates are particularly important in the light of recent warnings that Germany’s fleeting power is decreasing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's defence committee, acknowledged that the fleet is in fact 'near the end of a ship competent for distribution'.
The officer said the problem has been over time, because old ships were closed down, but no replacement vessel was delivered.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates were able to join the fleet.
National Trust Thieves on Secret Life to Bats
New research carried out on a property in the Scottish Highlands aims to reveal how the bats use the landscape in search of food.
It is hoped that findings will shed new light on the behaviour of the unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study of researchers at the National Trust for Scotland will follow common and soprano pipistrelles and then brown langøra and Daubenton bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recordings will be placed in important locations around the property to track the flag mouse activities throughout the entire season.
NHS adders and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
Expert audio analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of the flag mouse calls and the species doing what.
A habitat map and report will then be produced to create a detailed landscape scale image of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a natural scientist for NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which habitat, natural worlds are most important to the bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management activities such as the purchase of meadows and how best to maintain a similar forest area for bats and other associated species.
Flag mouse populations in Scotland and over the United Kingdom have decreased significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects sleep and habitat/buses loss.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose risks, as well as fly paper and some chemical treatments for building materials, as well as pet cat attacks.
Flag mice are not really blind.
But because of their nightly hunting habits, their ear is more useful than their eye when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echolocation technique to detect errors and obstacles in their flight panel.
NTS, responsible for caring for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, takes the bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who regularly carry out investigations, place of rest inspections, and sometimes save lives.
The organisation has even created Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve at Threeave Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
Property manager David Thompson says that ownership is the ideal territory for them.
"Here at Threeve we have a great area for bats," he said.
«We have old buildings, many veteran trees and all the good habitats.
But there's a lot about bats that are still unknown, so the work we do here and on other property sites will help us understand more about what they need to thrive."
He emphasises the importance of checking for bats before performing maintenance within the domain, since it is possible that the infinite destruction of a single bus can kill up to 400 female bats and young people, and perhaps annihilate a whole local population.
Flag mice are protected and it is illegal to kill, pest or disturb them or destroy their sleeping places.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to come in and help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many of our species, we don't know how their populations are moving."
Ronaldo rejects the jurisdictional debt in which the lawyer sues the German warehouse
Cristiano Ronaldo has labeled the electoral debt against himself as "false news" and says that people "want to emphasise" by using his name.
His lawyers are set to sue the German newsmagazine Der Spiegel, who published the claims.
Portugal and Juventus, on the other hand, have been indebted to elect an American woman, called Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is alleged to have paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the event, reports there mirror on Friday.
In a live instagram video, Ronaldo, 33, says to his 142 million followers only hours after the debt is ‘false news’.
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, fake news, says five times the Goldball winner into the camera.
‘They want to market themselves using my name.
That's normal.
They'll be familiar with saying my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything good, 'make the player happy and smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are prepared to sue Der Spiegel for the allegations, which they have called 'an inadmissible report on privacy suspicions', according to Reuters
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player would seek compensation for «moral damage in an amount of the seriousness of the crime, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.»
The alleged event is said to have found its place in June 2009 at a suite at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga went back to the player's room, where a claim that he should have chosen her anal, according to documents filed at Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the assumed event and said that he was a '99 percent' a good guy and failed by 'one percent'.
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was consent.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had photographed of her injuries at a hospital, but was later agreed on a settlement because she felt “frightened by retribution” and was concerned about “being publicly humbled.”
The 34-year-old says that she is now trying to change her place of residence as she continues to be traumatised by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer he moved to the Italian giant Juve in a €100 million deal.
Brexit: UK 'would undo forever' losing car manufacturers
The United Kingdom ‘would undo it forever’ if it lost its world-leader status before car production after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was ‘about’ that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if the United Kingdom left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop production at the Burnaston plant, near Derby.
"We need an appointment," said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said the effect of border delays in case a non-agreement with Brexit could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant - which makes Toyota's Auris and Avensis - produced almost 150,000 cars last year, where 90% were exported to the rest of the EU.
"My opinion is that if the United Kingdom leaves the EU at the end of March, we see production stops at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's Managing Director in Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers have raised fears of leaving the EU without agreement on how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW says, for example, that it will close its Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are what car manufacturers say is the risk of supply chains in the event of a non-agreement with Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is driven on a just-in-hour basis, with parts coming every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the United Kingdom and the EU for cars ordered.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there may be disruptions at the border that the industry claims can lead to delays and a lack of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day's worth of inventory at its Derbyshire factory, said the company, and thus the production would be stopped.
Mr Clark said that Theresa May's Checker's plan for future relations with the EU is "just calibrated to avoid border controls."
"We must have an agreement. We want the best agreement that will allow, as I say, not just to enjoy the success today, but for us to seize this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's daily program.
‘Prove from not only Toyota, but other producers are that we must be able to continue with what has been a very successful supply chain.’
Toyota could not tell how long the production would be stopped, but in the longer term they warned that additional costs would reduce the cost of the installation and eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years, and is the Unite Union Association at the plant, said that his members are more concerned about: "In my experience, when these jobs go, they never come back.
One spokesperson to the government said: ‘We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.’
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, says White House
Donald Trump's high-ranking meeting with Vice-Chancellor Rod Rosenstein could be 'pressed back a week' as the fight against the Supreme Nominated Brett Kavanaugh continued, said the white house on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Councillor Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian valance interference, links between Trump helpers and Russia and potential obstruction of the President’s justice.
Korvidt Trump will cancel the general of the lawyers or not, thus endangering Mueller's independence, has given nourishment to Washington gossip for several months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing a lease to register conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president by means of the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday he went to the white house, and it was reported that he was about to quit.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then with the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would "advanc" not to kick Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid collapsing with the Senate Commission's hearing where both Kavanaugh and one of the women who have accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testify.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation of allegations against Kavanaugh, which delayed full vote from the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, showed up on Fox News Sunday.
When she was asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said, "There has not been a date set. It may be this week, but I can see that another week is delayed because of everything else that happens in the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I always like to keep the press up to date."
Some reporters might disagree: Sanders has not held a press orientation for the White House since September 10.
The host, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of information was not due to a dissatisfaction with the TV reporter's game for the gallery, although she said, "I don't disagree that they do."
She mentioned that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
‘The President holds more press conferences than any president has ever done before,’ she said, quite rightly without giving evidence of the claim. ‘We have looked at numbers.’
Sanders says that updates will still happen, but ‘if the press gets the chance to ask the president directly, it’s much better than talking to me.
We've been trying to do a lot of this, and you've seen us do it often in the last few weeks, and it's going to take over instead of a press orientation if you can talk directly to the president of the United States."
Trump accepts questions whenever he travels from the White House or attends open sessions or press conferences with visitors.
It's unusual for the president to hold a press conference alone.
In New York this week, the president may have demonstrated why, where he acted without shame, and almost bizarre.
Health Secretary writes about Brexit fear to EU workers at NHS in Scotland
The health secretary has written to EU workers working at the NHS in Scotland to express gratitude and a wish that they continue after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter even if it is less than six months left before the United Kingdom withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed itself to addressing the costs of applications that have the status of EU citizens working in delegated public services.
In the letter, Freeman wrote: ‘During the summer, negotiations on withdrawal between the United Kingdom and the EU have continued and are approaching the expected end of the autumn.
Nevertheless, the British government has stepped up preparations in the absence of an agreement.
I understand that this must be a difficult time for you all.
So I want to repeat how much I see on the contributions to all of them, no matter what nationality they have.
Colleagues from the EU, and beyond, have valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health sector and are beneficial to patients and communities.
Scotland is clearly your home, and we would like you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes acute surgery after head injury
The linemaker Christion Abercrombie, who plays at the Tennessee State Tigers, went through an acute operation after wearing a head injury when the team lost 31-27 against Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, reports newspaper The Tennessee.
The main trainer of Tennessee State, Rod Reed, reports that the damage occurred just before the break.
'He came to the sideline and collapsed, in a way,' said Reed.
Trainers and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sidelines before placing it on a stretcher and took him behind for further evaluation.
An official Tennessee State spokesman told WSMV that Abercrombie had completed surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
There is no detail about the extent of the damage yet, said Harris, and added that Tennessee State is still trying to figure out when the damage occurred.
Abercrombie goes to college for the second year, and is in his first season after being transferred from Illinois.
He had a total of five tackles before he was injured in Saturday's fight, and is now up in 18 total this season.
Foreign buyers have to pay a higher document fee when buying property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher document fee when buying property in the United Kingdom. The extra income will be used to help the homeless, according to the new plans of the conservatives.
The decision will neutralise the success of Corbyn in attracting young voters
The increase in the document fee will be added for those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
State Treasury expects an increase of up to 120 million pounds a year to help the homeless
Theresa May today announces that foreign buyers will have to pay a higher document fee when buying property in the United Kingdom. The extra income will be used to help the homeless.
This decision will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success Jeremy Corbyn has had in attracting young voters who feel a lot, with the promise to offer reasonable housing.
The increase in the document fee will be added for individuals and companies that do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and the extra money will strengthen the government’s desire to reduce the number of retraders.
The fee, which comes in addition to the current document fee, includes the higher levels introduced two years ago on the number two residence and rentals, may be as much as three percent.
The Treasury expects that the decision will receive up to 120 million pounds a year.
About 13 percent of new buildings in London are purchased by non-British residents, which makes prices higher, and entry into the housing market is more difficult for first-time buyers.
Many prosperous areas in the country - particularly in the capital - have become ‘ ghost cities’ because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of the time in other countries.
This new policy comes only weeks after Boris Johnson wanted to cut the paper tax to help more young people buy their first home.
He appealed to a large construction company to keep prices up by obtaining property, but not using them, and asked Theresa May to give up the quotas on reasonable housing to fix the United Kingdom's housing shame.
Corbyn has announced a series of eye-catching proposals for housing reforms, including controlled rentals and the termination of displays without a reason.
He wants and gives the advice of greater power to build new dwellings.
May said, "Last year I said that I wanted to dedicate my position to bring back the British dream -- that life should be better for every new generation.
It means fixing the ruined housing market.
Great Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
Nevertheless, it may not be right for individuals who do not live in the United Kingdom, or a foreign company, to purchase housing that is too hard-working, British residents.
For many people, the dream of own housing has gone too far away, and the humiliation of being strippers is real.
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate ambition is to lead Scotland'
The head of Sunderland, Jack Ross, says that his ultimate ambition is to become the manager of Scotland at some point.
The shot (42) will slide over the challenge of reviving the club from the north-east. Currently, they are in third place in League One, only three points from the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer, having led St. Mirren back to the Scottish elite series in the previous season.
‘I wanted to play for my country playing.
I got a B-land battle, and that's it," said Ross to Scotland's BBC Sportsound.
‘But I wake up to see Scotland on the Hamden along with my father, and it has always been something that has pulled me back.
That possibility can only come if I have succeeded as a club manager."
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocaat, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Alloa Athletic says he hasn't been afraid to come after so many established names in such a big club since he's previously turned down approaches from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"For the moment, success for me will be measured in whether I can get this club back to the Premier League."
Based on the structure and facilities of this club, there is no doubt that they belong at the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to get them there, but I can probably only think of myself as successful if I can get the club back there."
Ross is only three years in his career as manager, after a period of assistant chief of Dumbarton and a 15-month period in the Hearts trainer.
He then helped Alloa to get from the downfall to the third level, and turned St. Mirren, who was about to move down, into the title winner of the championship series the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did while playing in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren, and Hamilton Academic.
"It was enough a roadside divider," he says, "to lead Alloa.
"I really thought that being a manager suits me a lot better than being a player.
It's the rightmost bit out, because I did it well, I did it well and I liked it relatively well.
But gambling can be tough.
There's a lot of things you're forced to get through every week.
I still notice it when it comes to stress and pressure with the job, but it feels right to be a manager.
I've always wanted to be a manager, and now I am. It's the most comfortable I've felt in my own body throughout my adult life."
On Sunday 30 September you can right the entire interview on Sportssound, Radio Scotland, between 12 and 13.
The examination shows that the perfect time for a pint is 5:30 p.m. on a Saturday.
The heat wave of summer has led to an increase in the inflection of strenuous pubs in the United Kingdom, but also to an increase in the pressure on restaurant chains.
In July, the sales increased by 2.7 percent in the barn industry - but for the restaurant industry it went down by 4.8 percent, the statistics show.
Business consultant Peter Martin, who is behind the statistics, said: 'The current sun, and the fact that England was in the World Cup longer than planned, means that July followed the pattern of June when pubs rose 2.8 percent, only that restaurants became even harder.
The decrease of 1.8 percent in the restaurant industry was only worse in July.
Pubs and bars selling drinks made it significantly better and went up more than restaurants went down.
Pubs selling food got and noticed the decline in the sun, although it was not as dramatic as for restaurant owners.
It might seem like people just want to go out for a drink.
Among pubs and bars, the drinking room had increased by 6.6 percent this month, while food had fallen by three percent.
Paul Newman, RSM’s travel and leisure analyst, said: ‘These results are the continuation of the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The value, and the impact of an enormous social or sports event, will still be the main factors when it comes to outdoor halls.
It is no surprise that the restaurant industry will still wear out. A 4.8 percent downturn in the hall every year will be a bad thing to get at the top of a running cost pressure.
The long, warm summer could not come at a worse time for food-powered operators. Time will show if the more moderate temperatures that have been in August can give a prolonged breathing room.»
The total increase in sales across pubs and restaurants, including new shops, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the slowdown in the release of branded goods.

One in five children has secret profiles on social media that they hide from parents
One in five children -- some as young as 11 -- has secret profiles on social media that they hide from parents and teachers, show an investigation.
Examination of 20,000 students on ongoing shows an increase in false Insta profiles
This news item has raised the fear that sexual content will be posted
Twenty percent of the students say they have a 'head' profile they show parents
One in five children -- some as young as 11 -- makes profiles on social media that they keep secret from being grown up.
A survey of 20,000 students in the secondary school revealed a strong increase in false Insta profiles, a reference to the Instagram image sharing platform.
The news has heightened the fear that sexual content will be posted.
Twenty percent of the students say they have a sterile 'head' profile they refer to parents, as well as having private profiles.
A mother who stumbled over the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who encouraged others to ‘elect me’.
The research, done by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) in various schools, found that 40 percent of those between the ages of 11 and 18 had two profiles, and half of these admitted to having private users.
The head of HMC, Mike Buchanan, said, "It's amazing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online places where parents and teachers can't find them."
Eilidh Doyle becomes the voice of the athletes of the Scottish Sports Board
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Board of Scottish Friedness as non-executive director of the Board's annual general meeting.
Doyle is the most decorated sportsman in Scotland, and director Ian Beattie describes the event as a great opportunity for those who lead the sport to take advantage of her extensive international experience during the last decade.
‘Eilidh has a great deal of respect across Scotland, the United Kingdom and the world’s recreational societies, and we are sure that freedom in Scotland can benefit from getting it into the board,’ said Beattie.
Doyle said, "I'm eager to act as a voice for the performers, and I hope I can help and contribute to the sport in Scotland."
The American, who has gold from both 200m and 400m in Atlanta in 1996 among its four OL gold and now is a regular guest at BBC, was unable to go after a drop.
On Twitter, he wrote, "Today it's a month since I got a blow.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said that it was only time to tell me if I was going to be okay again, or to what extent.
It's been exhausting work, but I've become quite good again, learned to walk again, and today I'm doing flexibility sleeps!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!’
Split Internet views about breast pumping clamps that compare mothers to dairy cows
A breast-pump company has split opinion on the Internet with an advertisement that compares breast-feeding mothers to dairy cows.
To mark what is described as “the world’s first silent, poking breast pump”, the technology company Elvie released a small group of commercials inspired by music videos to demonstrate the freedom of the new pump provides mothers with milk.
Four real mothers dance in a high-filled barn with cows, to a song that includes text like, "Yes, I'm milking myself, but you don't see tails" and, "In case you don't mark it, this isn't tension, it's my dolls."
The report continues: "Pump it out, pump it out, I feed these kids, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my ladies."
The advertisement, which has been published on the company's Facebook page, has, however, created controversy on the web.
With 77 000 views and several hundred comments, the video has received mixed reactions from the viewers, and many say it illuminates the horror of the dairy industry.
‘Very poor decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and feed to produce milk, only that calves are trusted from them just days after birth," writes one.
Elvie breast pump is discreet in a suckler bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment: ‘Intelligible enough traumatic for both mother and child
But yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who can keep their kids?’
Another added: ‘For a remote advertising’.
Others defended the advertisement, and a lady admitted that she seemed to sound "festivities."
«I think this is a brilliant idea.
I would have had one if I still had to breast-feed.
Pumping made me feel just like a cow.
This advertisement is a little crazy, but I took him for what he is.
This is a brilliant product," wrote one.
Another comment: ‘This is a fun advertisement directed at mothers like pumps (often at work or in the toilet) and feels like cows.
This is not an advertisement that boasts or condemns the dairy industry.’
At the end of the video, the group of women reveals that they have all danced with the discrepancy pumped into their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women like pumps say they feel like cows.
On the other hand, the Elvie pump is quite quiet, has no rents or pipes, and its discreet inside a breast-fed bra, which gives women the freedom to move, keep their kids, and even go out while they pump.
Ana Balardin, partner and creative director of Mother, commented: «The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it ignites a wave and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between mothers producing milk and dairy cows, wanting to put searchlights on breast pumping and challenges attached to it, and simultaneously demonstrating the incredible freedom of the new pump will bring, in an entertaining and recognizable way.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump has created headlines.
During the fashion eucalyptus in London, a mother appeared two times on the podium for designer Marta Jakubowski, while she used the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children move quietly to tent camp on the Texas border
The number of immigrant children in prison has peaked even though monthly border crossings have remained relatively stable, partly because the strict policy put in place by the Trump administration has made it more difficult to place children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors have been undocumented immigrants themselves, and they fear that standing up and receiving a child may threaten their own ability to stay in the country.
The risk of it increasing in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult family members are required to submit fingerprints, and that these data will be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week Matthew Albence testified to the immigration and customs enforcement of Congress and said that the Agency has arrested dozens of people who have applied to be sponsors of single minors.
The Agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of the arrested persons had nothing on their flyer already.
‘Nearly 80 per cent of those who are either sponsors or family members of sponsors are illegal in the country, and a large proportion of these are criminal foreigners.
So we're going to continue to persecute these people," said Albence.
According to the additions to the camp, new rules have now been introduced to manage the children. The rules require that some of them now have to go to court before a month has passed, compared to 60 days earlier.
Many people want to participate via video calls and not at personal meetings, to get the case tried to lead an immigration court.
Those who are not qualified for freedom will be deported quickly.
The longer the children are in custody, the more likely it is that they develop anxiety or depression, which can lead to elective outbreaks or freedom of escape, they say they add to the camp. Reports that have appeared in recent months say the same thing.
Speakers say that these concerns are greater in large facilities such as Tornillo.
They added that moving children to the tent camp without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally, or say hate to friends, can intensify the trauma that many have already had.
Syria is asking US, French and Turkish occupying forces to withdraw immediately.
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also asked for Syrian refugees to come home, even though the country is now at war in the eighth year.
Moualem, who, and acting as Deputy Prime Minister, said that forward forces are acting illegally on Syrian soil under the impulse of counter-terrorism, and ‘will be dealt with from it’.
'They must withdraw immediately and without premeditation', he said to the Assembly.
Moualem insisted that the ‘war on terror is almost over’ in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011, and millions have been removed from their homes.
He said that Damascus will continue to “fight a holy battle until all Syrian territory has been cleansed” for both terror groups and the “illegal presence of the future.”
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly for training and consulting both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in that warring country.
When it came to refugee problems, Moualem said that it was safe for them to come back, and he blamed 'some Western countries' for having 'spread irrational fear' of the environment that made refugees stay away.
‘We have asked the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate the return,’ he said.
‘They make policy out of something that would be a purely humanitarian problem.’
The United States and the EU have warned that there will be no help in rebuilding Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war is in place.
Diplomats of the United Nations say that a recently created agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in Idlib, the last major insurgent fortress, has created an opportunity to continue pushing forward with political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement averts a major attack from Russian-Stretched Syrian forces in the province where three million people live.
Moualem nevertheless underlined that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed the hope that military action would be directed against jihadists, including warriors from the nura front, who are attached to Al-Qaeda, who "will be exterminated."
The UN member, Staffan de Mistura, hopes to soon gather the first meetings of a new committee consisting of a member of the government and opposition to draw up a post-war law for Syria, and pave the way to the elections.
Moualem lays down the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the Committee, saying that the work of the panel should be limited "to review the articles of the current constitution", and warns against disruption.
Why Trump is going to win another semester
With that logic, Trump will win the 2020 re-election if not, as many liberal seers probably hope, the presidency will end early because of scandals and national law.
It would undoubtedly be 'the most dramatic end of a presidency ever!'
At the time of writing, there are no signs that the viewers have fainted.
Since 2014, CNN has doubled its rating to 1.05 million, while MSNBC has almost tripled its rating to 1.6 million.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in the best transmission time, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has doctors at the top of the cable rating with as many as 3.5 million viewers on evenings with great news.
"This is a fire that people are attracted to, because there's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer in the ABC drama "Designed Survivor," which is about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the congress building.
Nell Scovell, an old comedy writer and author of «Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Snowing Into the Hollywood Boys' Club», has another theory.
She's thinking about a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver said he was going to vote on Trump.
Why? she asked.
"Because he makes me laugh," he replied according to Scovell.
It's entertaining in the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, history that comes from Washington can decide for the future to Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families get to be together again and salute the global economy.
Disabling is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet it goes further than being an informed citizen when you find yourself at six o'clock to see a panel of experts debating Bob Woodward's use of sources with a "deep background" for the book "Fear," Paul Manafort's bomber jacket of strutslayer to $15,000 ("one garment thickened by arrogance," said Washington Post) and the implications of Stormy Daniel's scary description of Trump's, eh, anatomy.
Personally, I'm never going to look at Super Mario in the same way again.
‘Part of what he does that makes it feel like a reality program is that he gives you something every night,’ said Brent Montgomery, daily leader of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creates by ‘Pawn Stars’, about the show that goes with Trump’s employees and everyday disputes (go into a fight with NFL, Rose Kim Jong-un).

When I met Fleiss this week, it was over 25 degrees and sun outside his home on the north coast of Kauai, but he sat in and looked at MSNBC while he took up CNN.
He couldn't turn away, not when Brett Kavanaugh was facing the Senate Commission and the future to the Supreme Court was hanging in a thin thread.
'I think when we did all these crazy shows in the past and people said, 'This is the beginning at the end of Western civilization,' said Fleiss.
'I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right.'

Money from outside flows into the densest intermediate election match
It's not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th district sees an abundance of money, thank you for a conversion of the Congressional district that led to two sitting members fighting for the same seat.
The recently converted district of Pittsburg brings forward Democratic representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district through a special election in the spring of last year.
Lamb is fighting against another sitting member, republisher Keith Rothfus, today a representative in the 12th district of Pennsylvania, which largely overlaps with the 17th district.
The maps were redrawn after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in January found that the old districts were illegally designed to benefit Republicans.
Competition for the 17th district has launched a arms draw on the funding of the campaigns, between the large parties their monetary arsenal, the Democratic Congressional Committee and the Republican Congressional Committee.
Lamb was a known name in Pennsylvania after a button says in a closely followed special election in Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
The seat had been listening to a Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by over 20 points.
Political experts have given the Democrats a scarce advantage.
United States considered punishing El Salvador on the basis of support for China, but withdrew
Diplomats note that the Dominican Republic and Panama already have recognized Beijing without negative reactions from Washington.
Trump had a warm meeting with the president of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama for partners to throw out the Trump organization's leadership group.
The state secretaries decided to bring back the U.S. Chiefs of Diplomatic Missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over the "last decisions to stop recognising Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, the ministry's spokeswoman, in an early month.
However, punishment was only assessed against El Salvador, which received an estimated USD 140 million in US aid in 2017, including for drug control, development and financial support.
The penalties imposed, which contained cuts in financial support and targeted restrictions on visas, would be painful for the Central American country and their high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings developed, North American and Central American officials postponed a conference on security and economic prosperity to follow up a similar gathering last year that was seen as a step forward to prevent immigrants from coming to the United States.
But in mid-September, the top administrators informed them that they wanted the conference to continue, putting a stop to the evaluation of the punishment for El Salvador.
It has now been said that Vice-President Mike Pence will meet the conference, which has been planned in mid-October, as a signal of the relevance of the administration at the meeting, said the diplomats.
And the three U.S. broadcasts returned silently to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new tough messages or punishments from Washington.
A spokesperson for Bolton would not comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who were some about discussing the internal considerations on the premise of anonymity.
Their description was confirmed by an outside analyst who works closely with the administration and spoke during anonymity.
Study History
One is waiting for Special Advisor Robert Mueller's report on Trump's possible obstacles to justice, which is now significant evidence in the public protocols.
According to the reports, Mueller should have focused his research on whether Trump's campaign was conspiring with Russia's idea of attacking our choice.
If Congress were to switch controllers, Trump would have to be at the mercy of this body, preparing himself to overinterpret the voters and possibly a jury of his peers.
There's a lot of 'what about', and I don't mean to suggest that Trump's case is inevitable, either for his counterpart in Europe.
It's a choice to take for all of us on both sides of the pond, which will affect how long the battle can be.
In 1938, the German officer was ready for a coup d'état against Hitler, only the West had opposed him and helped the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed, and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of bloodbathing that resulted.
The course of history revolves around such turning points, and democracy's unvoting march accelerates or postpones.
Americans are facing several of these turning points now.
What if Trump kicks Deputy Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls Mueller's investigation's fate?
Rosenstein has been in deep water all along since this newspaper revealed that last year he proposed to intercept the president in hiding, and wondered if he was unfit for his role.
Rosenstein says The Times' description is inaccurate.
‘How will we react if the recently requested FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair — or he is accepted by the Supreme Court despite the permissive guilt of sexual assault, and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we in the middle election vote for a congress that holds Trump responsible?
If we fail these tests, democracy will face a long winter.
But I don't think we're wrong, because of what I learned in Praha.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied the country I have my embassy in.
She survived, immigrated to the United States, and 60 years later she sent me off guard to light the Sabbath light on the table that begs the swastika.
When this is my legacy, how can I not be optimistic about the future?

Rangers Graham Dorrans is optimistic before the meeting with Rapid Vienna
Rangers welcome Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that they are saying about the Austrians, following an impressive decision in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will provide them with a good starting point for qualifying from Group G of the European League.
A crooked midfielder, Graham Dorrans, prevented his first performance this season before the 2-2 score against Villarreal, but he thinks Rangers can use this result as a stepping stone for bigger things.
‘That was a good point for us, because Villarreal is a good team,’ said the 31-year-old.
"We went into the fight with the belief that we could get something, and came out again with a point.
Maybe we could take it to the end, but all in all, it's probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half, and then we got into the second half and we were better off.
On Thursday there will be another great European evening.
Hopefully, we can get three points, but it's going to be a tough fight. They got a good result in their previous fight, but with the audience behind us, I'm sure we can run on and get a positive result.
The last year has definitely been our tough, with everything that has happened to my injuries and changes in the club, but now everything feels good.
The stable is good and the guys thrive; the training is good.
Hopefully we can run now, put the previous season behind us and be successful."
Women lose sleep over this fear of pension saving
Despite the fact that participants in an investigation had clear thoughts about how they would be taken care of, there were few who talked to family members about it.
About half of those who participated in an investigation by the insurance company Nationwide said to their spouses about the costs of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they were talking to their kids about it.
"People want a family member to take care of themselves, but they don't take the necessary steps to have that conversation," says Vice President of Nationwide, Holly Snyder.
Here you go.
Talk to your spouse and your children: You cannot prepare your family to take care of you unless you make your wishes known in advance.
Cooperation with an advisor and your family to discuss where and how to receive care, as these options can be a major part of determining costs.
Get a financial advisor: your advisor can also help you find out how to pay for these expenses.
The funding options for long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance, a life insurance with a cash value to help you pay the costs, or that you cover yourself with your own wealth - as long as you have the money.
Create legal documents: Avoid legal fights before they start.
Get a health authorisation in place, so that you appoint a person you trust to supervise your medical treatment and to ensure that professionals act in harmony with your wishes in case you cannot communicate.
You can also evaluate an authorisation for your finances.
You should choose a person you trust to make financial decisions and make sure that your bills are paid if you do not have the ability to do so yourself.
Don't forget the small details: see if your old parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Could you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Write all these details into a written plan so you are ready.
'It's not just the finances it's about, but who's legacies?' asked Martin.
‘What kind of medicine is that?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Have the plan ready.’
Man shot several times with air gun in Ilfracombe
A man has been shot several times with an air gun in what he was on his way home after a trip to town.
The victim in the 40s was in the area around Oxford Grove in Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hands.
Political tables describe the shooting, which occurred around 02.30 local time, as a ‘random action’.
The victim did not see the attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police are asking for a witness.
Indonesia earthquakes and tsunamis
At least 384 people have been killed by a powerful earthquake and a tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, says public service personnel. The number of deaths is expected to increase.
Without the ability to communicate, help workers have not received any information from Donggala, an area north of Palu that is nearer to the epicenter of the quake with a strength of 7.5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster was a fact.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central Sulawesi province, and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island. Estimated population in 2017 was 379 800.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the quake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is a region extending over 300 km of coastline northwest of the island.
The region, which is an administrative region lower than a province, had an estimated population of 299 200 in 2017.
Fishing and gardening are the pillars of the economy of the central Sulawesi province, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel extraction is and is important in the province, but is mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the other side of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years, as a result of the disaster reduction office in Indonesia.
In 1938 more than 200 people were killed and hundreds of houses destroyed by a tsunami in Donggala.
In 1996, the west side of Donggala was struck by a tsunami that killed nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Seismic Ildring in the Pacific Ocean and becomes a constant framework of earthquakes.
Here are some of the major tremors and tsunami in the last few years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of the Aceh province of northern Sumatra on 26 December, triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries and killed 226 000 people along the coast of the Indian Sea, more than half of these in Aceh.
2005: A large wave hit the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and the beginning of April.
Several hundred died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-forced quake hit south in Java, the most populous island in Indonesia, triggering a tsunami that crashed into the south coast and killed almost 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-forced quake struck near the city of Padang, capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people lost their lives.
2010: A 7.5-force earthquake hit one of the Mentawai islands outside Sumatra and triggered a tsunami of about 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A little shock hit Pidie Jaya area in Aceh, causing destruction and panic when people were reminded of the tremor and tsunami in 2004.
No tsunami was triggered this time, but more than 100 lost their lives due to buildings that fell.
2018: Large earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok and kill more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The quake destroyed several thousand buildings and left several thousand tourists temporarily stranded.
The oldest son of Sarah Palin arrested and targeted for power in the world
Track Palin, the oldest son of former Governor of Alaska and Vice President candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested, targeted for assault.
Following a report released by the Alaskan State Police, Palin (29) was arrested for suspicion of power in the home, interference in reporting of power in the home, and opposition to arrest.
According to the police report, he took the phone from a female acquaintance when she tried to call the police to report the crime.
Palin becomes custody prison in Mat-Su prison, and is held against bail for $500, KTUU reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday and declared himself "not guilty" when he was asked, gave up the network.
Palin is facing three class A felonies, which means he can be jailed for up to one year and get $20,000 in fines.
He has also been targeted for a Class B offense, which can be punished by a day in prison and a 2000 dollar fine.
It's not the first time Palin's been charged with anything criminal.
In December 2017, he was charged with having attacked his father, Todd Palin.
Mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
Saka's up in Alaska's Veteran Court.
In January 2016, he was targeted for attack in the world, interfering in a reporting of power in the world and holding a weapon while he was intoxicated in connection with the event.
His girlfriend had claimed that he beat her in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups after having linked the son's elective behavior to PTSD that stems from when he served in Iraq.
earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of lives lost
At least 384 people have lost their lives since an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The quake, with the force of 7.5, triggered a tsunami and has destroyed several thousand homes.
Electricity and communications networks are down, and the number of deaths is expected to rise in the next few days.
The earthquake struck right outside the central part of Sulawesi, which lies northeast of the capital of Jakarta.
Videos that show the dramatic moment at which the quake hits, thrive on social media.
Several hundred people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the shore.
Federal actors will rarely have the death penalty for suspicion in New York terrorism
Federal actors in New York want the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, suspected of the terrorist attack that killed eight people -- a rare punishment that has not been carried out for a federal crime in the state since 1953.
Saipov (30) must have used a Home Depot rental car to attack a bicycle path along West Side Highway in lower Manhattan in October, where he ran pedestrians and cyclists down the road.
In order to justify a death penalty, the actors must be able to prove that Saipov killed the eight victims 'willfully' and that he 'willfully' inflicted serious, physical damage on them, following a note archived in the southern district of New York.
Both of these events may give rise to a possible death penalty, as stated in the legal document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal jury handed over a list of 22 points of appeal, including eight counts of murders aimed at extortion, usually used by federal actors in connection with organized crime, and a screening for the election and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack claimed ‘significant planning and thinking’, said the actors and described how Saipov carried out the attack as ‘disgusting, cruel and corrupt’.
‘Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov causes damage and loss to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleveland, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco’, the note states.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been ten years since the last South District in New York has sentenced the death penalty in one case.
The aim, Khalid Barnes, was condemned to have killed two baptismal suppliers, but was finally sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time a death penalty was carried out in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after being sentenced to conspiracy for spying on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
On June 19, 1953, both were executed in the electric chair.
Saipov, originally from Uzbekistan, showed a lack of information in the days and months that followed, according to legal documents.
He told the detectives that what he had done most well, said the police.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching videos from ISIS on the phone, it is stated in the charges.
He also asked to have the ISIS flag in the hospital room, said the police.
He has declared himself guilty not at all points of appeal.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, says that they are 'clearly disappointed' with the decision of the prosecution authorities.
‘We believe that the decision to go after the death penalty, rather than accept a declaration of debt for life in prison without the possibility of release, will only prolong the dream of the event for all concerned’, said Patton.
Saipov's defenders had previously asked the actors not to go after the death penalty.
Member of Tory my Nigel Farage should be renting Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the public army" today, during a protest at the Tory National Assembly.
The former leader of the British Independence Party said that the politicians had to ‘feel the pressure’ from the Eurosceptics, since one of Theresa May’s MEPs suggested that he should rent the negotiations with the EU.
The conservative, mystified MEP Peter Bone told the protesters in Birmingham that Britain had 'our way out' no, whether Farage was the Brexit minister.
With the challenge of May reconciling its deeply divided rails, a separate protest in the city, held by Tories who want to stay in the EU, has been underlined.
The Prime Minister struggles to keep up with the Chequers compromise on the right track after attacks by Brexitians, Remainers and the EU.
Allierte insists that she will press for an agreement with Brussels, despite the step backwards – and force the Eurosceptics and the Workers' Party to choose between its package and ‘chaos’.
Bone told Leave Means Leave-grouping in Solihull that he wanted to "reject Chequers"
He proposed that Mr Farage should give us a decent rank and be given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had run, we would be out now," he said.
The Housearian from Wellingborough added: 'I will fight for Brexit, but we must reject Chequers'.
To show resistance to the EU, he said: ‘We do not fight world wars for subordination.

Bone denies the claim that the opinion of the people has changed since the elections in 2016: ‘The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to be is completely false’.
Brexit fighters from Tory, Andrea Jenkyns, also participated in the march. She told the reporters: 'I only say: Prime Minister, listen to the people!'

Please drop Chequers and listen to»
In a message addressed to May, she adds: 'State Ministers keep their jobs when they keep what they promise'.

"Now it's about trust between us - the people - and the political class," he said.
'They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell them that they're not going to let them get away with it.'

Warren plans to take a 'close look' at the presidential election
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she's going to take "a close look at making the presidential election" after the November election.

Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title after stock orders give say about Sebastian Vettel
It became clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the team orders from Mercedes were going to have a big role in the run-up.
Bottas got a good start on the race, and let Hamilton take care of himself defending his position on the first two rounds and inviting Vettel to attack the teammate.
Vettel was first into the depot and let Hamilton get into the traffic at the back of the loop, which should be crucial.
The Mercedes ran into the depot a round later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton landed at the front after some action side-by-side which meant that the Ferrari driver had to leave the inside free in order not to be able to defend himself at the third corner.
Max Verstappen started, on his 21st birthday, in the back row and was in seventh place at the end of the first round.
After that, he led large parts of the race as he went for a quick finish with the goal of running past Kimi Raikkonen who was in fourth place.
He entered the depot in the 44th round, but couldn't increase the speed of the last eight laps while Raikkonen got fourth.
It's a difficult day, because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend, and was a real gentleman who let me by.
The team has done an exceptional job that has both first and second," said Hamilton.
It was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump made fun of Senator Diane Feinstein at an election meeting on Saturday because of her insistence that she did not accept the letter from Christine Blasey Ford in which she appeals to the Supreme Court-nominated Brett Kavanaugh for sexual assault.
During a speech at an election meeting in West Virginia, the president did not mention Ford's testimony to the Senate Commission directly, but rather commented that what goes on in the Senate showed that people were 'bad and ugly and talk false'.
"The only thing that can happen, and the beautiful thing that has happened in the last days of the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and bad and uncomfortable and talk dirty," he said.
"When you look at publications and leaks and then say, "Oh, I didn't.
I didn't do it."
You think?
Diane Feinstein, did you paint that?
You think of her answer... you close the document-- "Oh, uh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't paint it."
Please wait.
No, we didn't, he added, while he was imitating the senator.
Feinstein received the letter with details of the charges against Kavanaugh from Ford in July, and it was played earlier in September - but Feinstein refused to leak came from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's appeals, I didn't like her story," said Feinstein to the committee, following The Hill.
“She asked me to keep it confidential, and I kept it confidential, which she asked for.”
But her nods don't fall in good ground with the president, who commented on it at Saturday's election meeting: "I say to you, it was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen."
While he continued to defend the Supreme Court nominee, who has been charged with bad sexual conduct by three women, the President proposed that the Democrats use the charges for their own gain.
"They are determined to take back power in every way they see it necessary.
You see the malaise, the collusion, they don't care about who they hurt, who they have to run against in order to gain power and control," said the president of Mediaite.

Pilot loses his life to ensure that hundreds of planes escape earthquakes
An air traffic controller in Indonesia will be hailed as a hero after he loses his life in what he continues to ensure that a plane with several hundred passengers got safely into the air.
More than 800 people have lost their lives and many are missing after a great earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi and triggered a tsunami on Friday.
Strong aftershocks continue to disturb the area, and many are trapped in wreckage in the city of Palu.
But despite the fact that his colleagues fled for life, Anthonius Gunawan Agung (21) refused to leave his post in the control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu, even if the swinging game.
He stayed again to make sure that the plane that was on the runway, Batik Air Flight 6321, took off safely.
He then jumped down from the control tower when he thought it collapsed.
He died later in the hospital.
The spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said that the decision may have scared hundreds of lives, reported ABC News Australia.
We sent a helicopter from the Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in a larger city.
Unfortunately, he left this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
‘This is heart-stirring,’ he added.
In the meantime, the authorities are afraid that the number of deaths will increase to thousands, while the country’s crisis management agency says that access to small towns in Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The number of deaths increases while we find bodies trapped under buildings. Many of them we can't reach," said the bureauman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves up to six meters have destroyed Palu, who's going to make a mass grave on Sunday.
Emergency aid comes in with military and commercial aircraft.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, said to Sky News, "Every minute an ambulance comes with multiple bodies.
It's hard to find clean water.
Small shops have been bullied.’
Jan Gelfand, leader of the Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross strives to help the survivors, but we do not know what they will find when they arrive.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get a lot worse."
The president of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, came to Palu on Sunday and said to the military In the country, "I ask you all to work around the clock to do everything they can to help with the evacuation.
Are they ready?" reported CNN.

Air traffic control in Micronesia: Air Niugini reports no man missing from lagoon air traffic control
The airline that operated an aircraft that operated in a Micronesian Pacific lagoon reports that a man is missing, having previously stated that all 47 of the passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the plane before it sank.
Air Niugini said that from Saturday afternoon they don't know where the human passenger is.
The airline said they work with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline gave no more details about the passenger, and the age and nationality are unknown.
Local boat owners helped save other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water when it tried to land at the airport on the island of Chuuk.
The authorities stated on Friday that seven people have been sent to hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday, and everyone was in a stable condition.
It's still unknown what caused the crash and what actually caused it.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon not far from the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane was flying past the runway.
The American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was very low.
"That was extremely good," said Jaynes.
Jaynes added that he and other passengers could water through the water, which brought them up to life, to the near exits on the plane before it sank.
He said the flight crew was panicking and screaming, and he suffered a head injury that was not serious.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors nearby, working to repair a dock, also scared passengers with a rubber boat that they used to carry passengers to land before the plane sank about 30 meters.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network website shows that 111 people have died in the airfields of PNG-registered airlines in the last 20 years, but none of them flew with Air Niugini.
Analysts create timeline overnight when woman was burned alive
The Public Prosecutor's Office presented all the evidence on Saturday under the defendant's trial for a man charged with burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice's analyst Paul Rowlett testifies for several hours as an expert witness in intelligence analysis.
He made for the jury how he put together recordings from cell phones to find out what happened at night when Jessica Chambers (19) was killed by the defendant, Quinton Tellis (29).
According to the newspaper The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett told me that he was using location data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with the Chambers night she died, as opposed to what Tellis explained earlier.
When the location data showed that Tellis' cell phone was with Chambers' cell phone at the same time as he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford witnessed on Saturday and said he was out of town that day.
Then the charge asked Tellis if he told the truth when he said he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said he was "laughing because my car was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was that Tellis said that he had known Chambers in about two weeks when she died.
But their cell phone bills showed that they had only known each other for one week.
Rowlett said that a while after Chambers died, Tellis deleted messages, conversations, and Chambers' contact information from his mobile phone.
"He deleted her from his life," said Hale.
The defence shall close the case on Sunday.
The judge said he's expecting a trial to go to the jury later that same day.

Another black person?!
New York babysitter sues couples for being fired for "racist" text message
A babysitter in New York sues a couple to fire her on the basis of discrimination after she received a text message from her mother that complained that she was “another black person.”
The couple have denied that they are racist and compare the case with ‘expression’.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two, was dissatisfied when she saw that the babysitter she had planned, Giselle Maurice, was black when she came to work for the first time in 2016.
«NEEEEEEEEEEEEEING, ONLY A BLACK PERSON,» wrote Plasco-Flaxman in a text message to her husband.
But instead of sending the message to her husband, she sent him to the babysitter Maurice, twice.
After realizing her error, the inappropriate Plasco-Flaxman fired the child caretaker Maurice, and said that the previous child caretaker, who was African-American, had done a bad job, so now she wanted someone from the Philippines, according to The New York Post.
Maurice was paid for one day's work before they sent her home in a Uber.
Now Maurice sues the couple for compensation for having fired her, she wants $350 a day for six months for the job she should have had, even if it was off the contract, where she was supposed to stay with her family.
"I will show them that it is not right to do so," she said to The New York Post on Friday, adding, "I know there is discrimination."
The couple have denied that they are racists, and said that to fire Maurice was the only thing they could do after insulting her, because they were afraid that she would take revenge.
"My wife had sent something to her that she didn't mean to say.
She's not a racist.
We're not racists," said Joel Plasco of The New York Post.
'But would you let someone you have offended take care of your children, even if you didn't mean to insult them?
Your newborn baby?
Think about it.’
Plasco compared the case with ‘expression’ and said that his wife was seven months pregnant and was in a ‘very difficult situation’.
‘Are you really going to take action against a person in such a situation?
It's not a nice thing to do," said the investor Plasco.
As the case progresses, the public has been quick to judge the couple on social media, criticizing them for their behaviour and logic.
The publishing house behind the Paddington books was afraid that people wouldn't like a talking bear, revealing a new letter.
The daughter of author Michael Bond, who was born shortly after the first book was accepted, commented, "It's hard to imagine what it was like to read the book for the first time before it was published.
It's very fun to know how successful Paddington was."
Jankel said that her father, who worked as a cameraman for the BBC before he was inspired to write the children's book about the little teddy bear, would be optimistic even if the book had been rejected.
When it came to Paddington, whom she described as a very important member of the family, she added that her father was proud inside of how much success he did.
"He was a pretty quiet man, and he never laughed," she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having kids who achieved something: you get proud of them even though you're not really behind it.
I think he saw Paddington's success that way.
Although it was his creation and imagination, he always gave all praise to Paddington himself."
My daughter was going to die and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
When she landed, the daughter was taken to the hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice in no time, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to say it was really bad, that they didn't think she was going to make it," said Ednan-Laperouse.
"So Nad called to say that she was going to die during the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I'm so happy for you, dear.
I'll be right back to be with you.
I'll be right there.
The medical doctors had given her so that her heart would continue pumping was slowly going out of her system.
She had already died and now the body was about to turn itself off.
I just sat there, knowing that this happened.
I couldn't roar or scream, because I was in a room surrounded by families and people.
I really had to keep everything."
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, who now looked after the loss of her daughter, had to board the plane with other passengers who did not know what she had just gone through.
"No one knew anything," she said.
‘I sat with my head bent while my tears fell.’
It's hard to explain, but it was on the plane that I knew how much sympathy I had for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how happy he was with her."
Suffering women hang notes on bridges to prevent suicide
Two women who lost their loved ones who took their own lives trying to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are partying on a bridge in Wales to inspire and get people thinking of taking suicide to change their mind and call the numbers on the notes.
Davis's son Tyler was 13 years old when he started to struggle with depression and took his life when he was 18.
‘I don’t want any parents to feel the way I do every day.’
Davis, who is 45 years old and lives in Lydney, said her son was a talented cook with a smile that infects.
"Everyone knew him because of his smile.
They said his smile lit up all the rooms."
But before he died, he ended up at work, because he was in a "really dark place."
In 2014, the 11-year-old brother of Tyler was the first to find Tyler after he had taken his own life.
Davis said, "I'm still worried that the weasel brother may have been affected by Tyler's death."
Davis wrote the notes 'in order for people to know that there are other people out there who care and they can talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don’t sit there alone – you need to talk to someone.’
Humphreys, who has been friends of Davis for many years, lost Mark's partner after they had been together for 15 years and he had recently lost his mother.
"He never told me he was tired or depressed or anything," she said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed that he began to behave differently.
He was in the basement emotionally on Christmas Day, when the children opened their gifts he did not see at that time."
She told me that his death was very traumatic for the children, and they kept working through the trauma: "There's a big void in our family now.
We're completely destroyed.
But we all have to fight to live on."

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in a thin thread while the FBI starts investigating
"I thought that if we actually got something similar to what he was asking for – a limited investigation – we might get a little loneliness," said Flake on Saturday, adding that he was afraid of the committee "collapsed" in the middle of a partisan-backlock.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
They hesitate because of the timing.
The averages in the United States are only five weeks away, on November 6th, and if the Republicans don't do well, this will make it hard for them to choose Kavanaugh in the U.S. Supreme Court.
George W. Bush has called senators to get them to support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House of Bush and was introduced to his wife Ashley in that way, then was the secretary of Bush.
What happens when the FBI presents its report?
They're going to shake in the Senate, 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It's still unclear if Kavanaugh is able to collect at least 50 voices in the Senate, and with 50 voices, Mike Pense, the vice president of the United States, can give him the last voice and confirm him in the Supreme Court.
Number of dropoffs in North Korea under Kim
The number of North Korean divers to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, reports a South Korean legislator
Park Byeong-seug referred to data from the South Korean department of unification, and said there were 1127 divers last year – compared to 2706 in 2011.
Park said that stricter borders between North Korea and China and more expensive smuggling charges are the main reasons why the number has fallen.
Pyongyang hasn't spoken out in public.
The vast majority of the people from North Korea get the citizenship of South Korea.
Seoul reports that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed borders illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of the flights via China, which have the longest border with North Korea and are easier to cross than the strictly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Korean countries.
China sees divers as illegal immigrants and not as refugees, and often sends them back with coercion.
Relations between North and South Korea – which are still at war technically – have improved in recent months.
This month the leaders of the two countries of Pyongyang met to negotiate the disarmament of nuclear weapons.
These conversations come after the June historic meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they became a few people working for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho owed the United States nothing since then.
"Without being able to trust the United States, we cannot trust that our country is safe, and in such a situation, we cannot disarm our weapons first," said Ri in a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical," saying that he cannot join the Supreme Court.
Minority leader Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh, who is nominate to the Supreme Court, "hysterical" and said he has too much temperament to serve in the U.S. Supreme Court.
Pelosi calls Kavanaugh "hysterical" in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas, on Saturday.
‘I know that if a woman had behaved that way, she would have been called ‘hysterical,’ said Pelosi about the testimony to Kavanaugh in front of the Senate Court on Thursday.
Kavanaugh was emotional and denied all the appeals that he sexually harassed Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
In the opening speech to Kavanaugh, he was very emotional and sometimes yelled with lumps in his throat as he told of his family and years of going on.
He criticized the Democrats in the committee, calling the charges against him "grotesque and a planned attack on his reputation," organized by liberal politicians who were angry that Hillary Clinton did not win the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi added that she believes Kavanaugh's testimony proves that he cannot stand in the Supreme Court, because it shows that he is prejudiced against democrats.
"I think the way he behaved he disqualifies, and what he said about the Clinton family and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi made an objection when she was asked if she would try to get Kavanaugh off if he is elected to the Supreme Court, and if the Democrats obtain a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I can say this – if he doesn't tell Congress or the FBI the truth, he can't stand in the Supreme Court, nor in the court he's now in charge," added Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is a court of appeal in Washington, D.C.
Pelosi also said that as a democrat she is concerned about potential judgments from Kavanaugh against the law known as Obamacare and the case of Roe vs. Wade, because Kavanaugh is known to be a conservative judgment.
In the hearings to confirm Kavanaugh, he avoided answering questions about whether he was going to reverse certain decisions in the Supreme Court.
‘It’s not the right time for a hysterical, prejudiced person in the Supreme Court to expect us to say he’s great,’ said Pelosi.
And women must swing the sword.
It's a fair, bitter criticism, after months and years of rage, and she doesn't get it out without crying.
"We cried when we were angry," said Steinem to me 45 years later.
'I don't think it's unusual, do you?'
She continued, "I got a lot of help from a woman in a high company position, who said that she branched when she was angry, but developed a technique where she said to the person who made her angry that she branched, "You might think I'm sorry because I cried.
I'm angry.'
And then she just keeps going.
I thought it was brilliant.
Tears work as a way to get your mind out, but there are a lot of people who misunderstand.
In one of my strongest memories from a previous job, where most of my colleagues were men, I was in a situation where I was angry, and a woman who was older than me took me by the neck – she was a cold leader for whom I had always been alive – and pulled me out of the hallway.
'Never let them see you cry,' she said to me.
'They don't know you're furious.
They think you're sorry and that they won because they made you cry."
Patricia Schroeder, who at the time was a congresswoman, a Democratic from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, Hart was taken to be an outlaw on a boat called Monkey Business, and withdrew from the campaign. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, thought that she could as well stand for election as President himself.
"I hadn't really thought through it well enough," she said to me while she laughed, 30 years later.
‘There were already seven other candidates who made elections, and the last one they needed was another candidate.
Someone calls the situation «Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.»
Since the campaign had already taken a while, she had not collected enough money, so she promised that she would only quiet if she could collect $2 million.
It was impossible.
She discovered that her supporters who gave $1,000 to men only gave her $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she asked.
When she declared that she was not going to make choices anyway, she was so emotional and full of gratitude to those who had supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to collect money and aim at the voices instead of the divider streets, and anger against gender discrimination, that she started crying during the speech.
"You should have thought I had a nervous breakdown," said Schroeder about how the press reacted to her story.
"You should have believed that Kleenex was my main sponsor.
I think I thought, what are they going to write on my tombstone?
‘Ho branch’?’
How the trade war between the United States and China can be good for Beijing
The opening stage of the trade war between the United States and China was bleak, and while the battle continued, a rift between the two countries could be an advantage to Beijing for a long time, say experts.
U.S. President Donald Trump skated the first shot this year to tax important Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The battle escalated this week, with tariffs on articles worth over $200 billion, which in effect means that half of all goods from China to the United States are taxed.
Beijing has taken home and set the rate of between five and ten percent on American goods worth $60 billion.
China has promised to answer the U.S. every time they shoot the guys off, and the second largest economy in the world is most likely not going to go down with the first.
To get Washington to end, China has to do what the United States wants, but bowing to the United States is too fluent for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Nevertheless, experts say that if Beijing keeps its head cold, the US press can have a positive effect on the Chinese economy in the long term, by reducing the degree of dependence between the two economies.
‘The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can make both economies go down is more dangerous than people dare to admit before,’ said Abigail Grace, a researcher who focuses on Asia at the Center for American Security, a think tank.
Syria's 'ready' for the return of refugees, says the Foreign Minister
Syria says they are ready to accept refugees who will return voluntarily, and ask for help to rebuild the country that has been destroyed after more than seven years of war.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that relations in the country are progressing.
‘Today, the ground situation is more stable and secure, thank you for the progress made in the fight against terrorism,’ he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by terrorists in order to regain normal territory.
All initiatives are now in place to allow refugees to return voluntarily to the country in which they had to travel on the basis of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that went beyond their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million acids have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
More than six million people in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian government would like to receive help to rebuild the ruined country.
But he stressed that they will not accept assistance or help with conditions from countries that sponsored the uprising.
Europe secures say in the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the Ryder Cup 2018 when they beat the American team with a final score of 16.5 against 10.5 in the Le Golf National outside Paris in France.
The United States has now lost six times in a row on European soil, and they have not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe took back the crowns of that team of the Danish captain, Thomas Bjørn, reached the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who swept away most of the tournament, beat the ball in the water from the tea by hole 16, pair 3, and gave it to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari did well in all his rounds and became one of four players who have ever received 5-0-0 since the tournament started its current format in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was turned off 5/4 by the lowest-ranking player on the European team, Danish Thorbjørn Olesen.
Dustin Johnson, with the world's highest rank, was 2 and 1 after English Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
The Spanish veteran Sergio Garcia, who has participated in eight Ryder Cupar, became the most winning European with 25.5 points in his career.
‘I usually didn’t cry, but today I can’t help it.
It's been a tough year.
So thankful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I'm so, so happy to get the trophy back.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I could help," said an emotional Garcia after the European saying.
He passes the baton to compatriot John Ram, who beat the American golf legend Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in singles on Sunday.
“I know a tremendous pride in beating Tiger Woods, I am growing up to look at him,” said Rahm (23).
Woods lost all four of his matches in France, and now has a 13-21-3 record in the Ryder Cup through the career.
A strange statistic from one of the world's best players, who have won 14 major titles and are only turned off by Jack Nicklaus.
The American team failed to find the fairway throughout the weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who impressed with high-level golf throughout the tournament.
Jim Furyk, the U.S. captain, spoke after a disappointing show from his team. "I'm proud of these guys, they fight.
There were periods this morning where we made it hot for Europe.
We're in trouble.
The hat off for Thomas.
He's a unique captain.
All of his 12 players played very well.
We're going to regroup, I'm going to work with the PGA in America and our Committee for Ryder Cup and get us on with it.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be captain.
One has to take off his hat.
We were played around.’
