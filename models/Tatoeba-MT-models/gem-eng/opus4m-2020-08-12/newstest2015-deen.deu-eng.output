The prime ministers of India and Japan met in Tokyo.
India's new Prime Minister Narendra Modi has met his Japanese counterpart Shinzo Abe in Toko on his first important foreign visit since his election victory in May to discuss economic and security relations.
Mr Modi is on a five-day trip to Japan to consolidate economic relations with the world's third largest economic nation.
Plans for greater nuclear cooperation are at the very top of the agenda.
According to reports, India also hopes for a defence cooperation agreement between the two nations.
Karratha Police Arrested 20-Year-olds for Fast Motorcycle Hunt
A motorcycle was confiscated after the driver had driven it at 125 km/h in a 70 km/h zone and through Bushland to escape the police in Bilbara.
Traffic police in Karratha tried to stop a blue motorcycle this morning after watching it leave a gas station on Bathdate Road at 125 km/h.
The police reported that the driver then ignored the stop signals and continued on Burgess Road before he debossed into the bushland, where the officials lost sight of it.
The motorcycle as well as a person who corresponded to the description of the driver were later seen at a house in Walcott Way in Bulgarra.
The police of Karratha accuse a 20-year-old man of not paying attention to a stop signal as well as reckless driving.
He is scheduled to appear before the court in Karratha on 23 September.
The motorcycle was secured and confiscated for three months.
George Webster accused of hotel rape in Naim and Pitlochry
A man is in court for the rape of women in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, was read in a hearing of the Supreme Court in Glasgow.
He is accused of having raped a woman at Scotland's Hotel in Pitlochry in Perthshire on June 7, 2013.
The charge is that Webster attacked her while she "was unconscious, slept, and could not signal consent."
Webster is also accused of having raped a second woman at the Golf View Hotel in Naim in the Scottish Highlands on 4 May 2014.
Judge Lady Rae started the hearing on 17 November at the Supreme Court in Edinburgh.
Reconciliation with the very American ideal of labour rights as human rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have tabled a bill to establish the organisation of trade unions as civil law.
"Just as trade unions die, so do middle class jobs," said Ellison, a democracy from Minnesota and deputy chairman of the Progressive Caucus Congress.
That is why I proudly present the Staff Authorization Act together with the citizens' rights icon John Lewis.
This groundbreaking law gives workers the same legal opportunities for discrimination on account of the organisation of trade unions as for other forms of discrimination - and thus stops anti-trade unions.
The addition of the national labour law law to create an opportunity for workers exposed to discrimination to organise a trade union representation in order to complain to a civil court about justice - and to receive damages or penalty payments - is a sensible and necessary initiative.
But it is certainly not a radical initiative - certainly not according to American standards.
In fact, the best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and the other sponsors of their bill are proposing is to connect back to a very American idea.
Despite the setbacks that the trade unions have suffered in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states throughout the country - Americans have once encouraged countries around the world to recognise, expand and uphold labour rights.
There was a time that millions of Americans still remember when this country called democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right of association in one breath.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas Mac Arthur and his staff encouraged the country to adopt a constitution to ensure that the militarized autocratie Hedki Tojos would be replaced by democracy.
In full awareness that workers and their trade unions had a role to play in creating a new Japan, they used a language that explicitly acknowledged that "the rights of workers to union and joint bargaining and action are guaranteed."
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight urged David Eisenhower and his staff to write to the Germans a constitution that would ensure that Adolf Hitler's fascism would be replaced by a strong democracy.
In recognition of the fact that the workers would have to organize themselves and raise their voice in the new nation, the Germans introduced a clause that explicitly stated: "The right to establish associations in order to secure and improve the working and economic conditions is guaranteed to every individual and every profession or profession.
Agreements which restrict this right or aim to reduce it are null and void; measures aimed at it are illegal.
When the former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt presided over the International Commission on Human Rights, from which the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was designed, as adopted in 1948 by the United Nations as a global agreement, Roosevelt and the other authors offered a guarantee that "everyone has the right to form or join trade unions to protect his interests."
For generations, Americans have accepted the basic premise that labour rights are human rights.
When this country advised other countries on how to shape civil and democratic societies, Americans stated that the right to establish a trade union - and that this union should then participate in collective bargaining as an equal partner with companies and government bodies - must be protected.
After these rights came under fire in America, it is indeed very wise to re-examine the American ideal, which means that the working population must have the right to unite and to be heard in a free and open society.
As Pastor Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:
The story is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the workers' movement did not restrict the strength of the nation, but enlarged it.
By raising the standard of living of millions of people, work has miraculously created a market for industry and has raised the whole nation to unimaginable levels of production.
Those who attack the work forget these simple truths, but history preserves them.
History remembers, and so should we.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of civil rights as a protection against discrimination in the creation of employee representations - are long overdue.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis are renewing the ideals that America has built up in the past and that have replaced the promise of democracy.
Judge temporarily stops law that all abortion clinics in Louisiana could force closure
A U.S. federal judge temporarily stopped implementing a law in Louisiana on Sunday, the lawyers say that it would probably have led to the closure of all five abortion clinics in the state.
This measure, imposed by Bobby Jindal, Governor of Louisiana, in June and intended to enter into force on 1 Sept., would force doctors carrying out abortions to acquire a right of admission to a hospital within 30 miles of their practice.
The judge's decision, however, means that doctors may temporarily continue to carry out legal abortions while applying for such a right.
"The plaintiffs can continue to work in accordance with the law while they are trying to obtain these rights," wrote Federal judge John deGravelles in his judgment.
Within a month, a hearing will be held for the judge to bring about a more permanent decision for the law.
Abduction advocates welcomed the decision to take the most recent in a series of judgments against similar measures and said that doctors were taking more time to obtain hospital admission rights.
"Today's decision means that women in Louisiana are deprived of an insidious law that wants to take their health and their rights," said Nancy Northup, President and Chairman of the Centre for Reproductive Rights, who had complained on behalf of three of the five clinics in the state to stop the law.
It was not immediately clear whether the judgment also extended to the doctors from the two clinics who had not joined the proceedings and had also applied for the right of expulsion.
Louisiana is one of 11 states which have adopted similar laws, while courts have recently declared such measures in Alabama and Mississippi to be non-constitutional.
Key points of a law in Texas that would have forced most of the hospitals remaining in the state to close were stopped by a federal judge on Friday.
The abortion advocates and the American College of Ostretricians and Gynecologists as well as the American Medical Association say in agreement that doctors' inauguration rights require unnecessary restrictions.
Absorbants are opposed to measures being used to protect the health of women, although some also welcomed the effects of hospital closures.
Only a doctor who carries out abortions in Louisiana has patient admission rights, notified the Center for Reproductive Rights.
If all the other doctors in the state were forced to stop carrying out abortions, this doctor would no longer perform the surgery because of fear of his safety, said the group.
In their argument against the verdict, representatives of the state of Louisiana said that they would not punish doctors for carrying out abortions while their applications for patients' admission rights were still pending.
Delayed diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment options lead to higher death rates of ovarian cancer in rural areas.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have posted a video hommage for their mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
For women in rural areas of Australia, there is a higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than for women in cities.
Researchers analysed the medical data of more than 1,100 Australians, where ovarian cancer was detected in 2005, and found that only 25 percent were still alive five years after the diagnosis.
Research director Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said that for those living in rural and remote regions of the state, the risk of mortality was 20 percent higher during the study than for those living in urban areas.
SMALL STUDIES: New drugs may slow lung and ovarian cancer
The researchers investigated the medical care of women over seven years of age.
Dr. Jordan said that the age of a woman in diagnosis, type of ovarian cancer, pre-existing diseases and social and economic status also affected the chances of survival.
For older women and those whose cancer was already advanced at the time of diagnosis, the survival rate was lowest.
For those living in rural and remote regions of the state, mortality risk was 20 percent higher during the study than for those living in urban areas.
Although the study did not investigate why women living outside the city died with a higher probability of ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan suspects that there is a delayed diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment centers than possible factors.
"This disease is best treated by gynecological oncologists, and these are usually found in larger cities," she said.
Despite improving telemedicine services to counter distances, she suggested, as a possible remedy, strengthening the service of infused doctors in order to allow specialists to provide women with closer care at their place of residence, as well as treatment programmes for people outside their region.
Dr. Jordan said that regardless of geographical status, the study showed a poor long-term survival rate in women in ovarian cancer and underlined the need for better treatment and prevention strategies.
The study financed by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2013, Elisha Neave, a 33-year-old mother of the Gold Coast, learned that she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
Garden centres regret falling houseowners
The decline along with an increased decline in the number of house owners under 35 years could result in garden centres losing tens of thousands of pounds a year when, according to a study by HTA, as reported in the Financial Times, today’s young consumers reach the “core age group for garden products”.
The report says that tenants spend an average of 55 percent of the amount that people with their own home spend on their garden.
The increase of people living in highly urbanised areas without gardens, the popular method of asphalting courtyards for park purposes and the declining garden size are other factors that threaten the industry, in which an estimated £5 billion are being implemented annually in sales.
In the Greater London area, where over a period of 6 years the share of homeowners fell from 61 to 43 percent, the lowest expenditure on garden products per household is mentioned.
The HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society point out that housing for rent or small gardens does not mean that people cannot move plants.
Guy Barter, head garden consultant for the RHS said: "Container gardeners, for example, are very popular with tenants because they can take their plants with them when they move."
The HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "golden age" of the garden retail trade due to increasing household ownership figures and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.
He also predicted an improved market situation for this year due to the better weather in unfriendly weather conditions in March and April last year.
The protest movement in Pakistan, led by opposition politician Imran Khan and priest Tahirul Qadri, continues.
In the capital of Islamabad, about 1000 demonstrators have stormed the state television station PTV.
Minister of Information Pervaiz Rashid said that soldiers could have pushed the Protestants back out of PTV buildings.
The transmitter stopped its operation for about 40 minutes, but now sends it back.
At the same time, some 3,000 demonstrators tried to reach the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
Around a kilometer away, they supplied themselves with poles and stones equipped with collisions with security forces.
The police used tear gas.
The demonstrators called for Sharif's resignation, but he refused.
At the same time, the country's army urges a political solution to the conflict, "to waste no time and apply without violence".
After a meeting at the headquarters on Sunday evening, the military said: "The army remains committed to ensuring the security of the state".
The military plays an important role in Pakistan and has already brushed more frequently.
Opposition politician Imran Khan accuses Prime Minister Sharif of cheating in the May elections last year.
The protests were escalated on the weekend after Khan and Qadri had called their supporters to advance to Sharif's residence.
Three people had been killed.
Turkey signs up US diplomat for spy reports
The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs has ordered the country's most senior US diplomats to report on American and British espionage in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bülent said that the US Ambassador and Turkish officials had discussed the report on Monday.
The German magazine Der Spiegel and the online magazine The Intercept reported that the former US analyst of the National Security Agency, Edward Snowden, showed that Turkey was a major field of activity for US and British intelligence.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan played down the importance of the report and said that all important countries were spying on each other.
An earlier report that Germany's main secret service also had Ankara in view caused much worse reactions from the Turkish government.
Warning strike: driver threatens with consequences for commuters
The nationwide warning strike of the drivers on Monday evening could also affect passenger traffic in NRW.
The delay announced for 18 to 21 hours covers all transport companies throughout the country, including long-distance, regional and S-Bahn transport,
The main thrust of the warning strike is freight transport.

said the district president of the German Locomotive Leaders Union (GDL), Sven Schmitte, in Düsseldorf.
We expect significant losses.
There are no regional priorities.
The main thrust of the warning strike was freight transport.
The Deutsche Bahn in NRW announced that it would do everything in its power to keep the impact as low as possible.
However, the GDL did not say where it wanted to strike, so it was difficult to predict the consequences in concrete terms.
Police chief of Magaluf charged with corruption
On Friday, the prosecutors presented evidence of extortion by policemen and employees in the city of Calvià to the Office of the Prosecutor of Mallorca.
The head of the police of Calvià on the holiday island of Mallorca was arrested after corruption by businessmen and barbers in the infamous binge drinking hotspot Magaluf.
Chief Commissioner José Antonio Navarro was arrested after accusations of corruption against him by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the street where most bars and nightclubs of Magaluf are located.
According to the online daily Mallorca Diario, the prosecutors presented evidence of extortion by policemen and employees in the city of Calvià to the Office of the Prosecutor for the Prevention of Corruption on Friday.
Two other local police officers were arrested by the Spanish Guardia Civil in connection with the corruption charges and are questioned by a judge together with Navarro.
The Spanish national daily ABC reported that the annoyed nightclub owners said that the government’s vetting business had a serious impact on their business.
"It's not about making money anymore, it's about survival," said one of the businessmen to the court.
Leave our livelihood out of the question.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf made international headlines this summer due to a viral YouTube video showing an 18-year-old British tourist performing on 24 men during a sweep tour of Fellatio.
Since then, the island authorities have tried to stop the disorderly behaviour of alcoholic holidaymakers in Magaluf by minimising the number of participants in the infamous alcohol-drinked pub tours.
The Playhouse Club, where the Fellatiio incident took place, was forced to close for one year while Playhouse and the pub tour organizer Carnage have to pay a penalty of €55,000 ($73,000).
The tourist resort Magaluf, which is especially popular with young British holidaymakers, is also known for several accidents under the influence of alcohol, including the trend of "balconing", where people jump from one balcony to the other or from a balcony in the hotel pool.
The first spring day with wet and stormy weather conditions affects flights from Adelaide Airport
The FÜHLING has given South Australia a winter surprise, with heavy showers and strong winds that affected flights from Adelaide Airport.
In the evening until 21 o'clock, another 5mm rain fell on the city, after 6.6mm, which had already settled in the night to Sunday.
The last precipitation was the result of a series of short, stormy showers, including a guss that began just before 8 p.m. and caused almost 4mm of precipitation in about 10 minutes.
After the winter last week provided an early dose of spring, temperatures in the city fell back to a maximum of only 15.8°C on Monday.
The poor weather conditions have probably led to the late landing of a flight from Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane should have landed shortly after 7.30 p.m. but was hit by a gust - a sudden change in wind speed or direction over a short distance - and had to start through.
Wind strikes reached about 50 km/h on the ground at Adelaide Airport at that time.
The flight data showed that the aircraft had to be launched on a second approach and finally set up at about 8.40.
The delay resulted in a delay in some other flights, including an Emirates flight from Dubai and a Quantas flight from Sydney.
For Adelaide a maximum temperature of 16°C is predicted on Tuesday, with possible showers.
Matthies means: High time for great networking
In view of the galloping technical progress that threatens to turn our comfortable home into high-tech switchboards, our columnist Bernd Matthies comforts himself with an extremely familiar electronic accessory.
As I write this here, my view falls on the spiral cable that connects the listener to the phone, and I think: Boah, how retro is that?
But there is a thought behind this: if the cable were not, all the listeners would fly around in the house without control in no time, and that would be much more retro.
In any case, it's the ekeltronic one.
No, typing error: electronic) Sector the rule that the world news of today is the electric waste of tomorrow, purchased - outdated.
And for example, anyone who still has a tube television in the living room today simply says that he refuses television in principle.
Why these considerations?
Because ifa's intrusion at the radio tower this week again brings to our attention our absolute incompetence in questions of electronics.
The layman, who once controlled the washing machine and CD player blindly, today does not even understand the purpose of the devices that are spread in front of him with unbelievably keen expert speech: "Connected Home, Wearables, Health Care and Urban Technologies" promises us the press office.
Yeah, you okay?
What should we talk about with people who apparently voluntarily spread such quark?
Basically, for some 20 years now, it has been primarily about the fact that we should be able to network our house.
So that the yogurt can re-order itself, so that the fire detector tells us on holiday on the Maldives that it burns in the working room.
And wouldn't it be wonderful if we air conditioning from the office on our soon arrival ...?
Yes, but that requires air conditioning.
But a dream will soon come true: We lift our wristwatch, tell her loudly "suck!" - and at home the vacuum cleaner leaves.
Irre.
Everything runs on nothing less than a revolution: "The boundaries between white and brown goods are fading," says an industry expert, you can connect the washing machine with a headphone, the steam cooker sends the weather report, and the data goggles show how long the pizza still needs in the oven, which is not useful, because we are in a jam.
We also know from daily practice: If a new-mode device is really needed urgently, the battery is guaranteed to be empty.
What is another reason why the spiral cable will survive the next radio exhibitions on the phone.
Israeli children return to their schools after the war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children from the areas near the Gaza Strip returned to schools on Monday after spending the summer in airspace, while rocket and mortar fires on their communities sank during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas and the schools in Gaza remained closed while the area recovered from the fighting.
The school started with a feeling of joy and expectation for the communities drawn by rocket bullet holes in southern Israel, but the signs of fighting are still fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod, staff of the "Pashosh" Kindergarten, which was hit by a rocket, before the arrival of the students grenade splitter from the walls and sliding walls.
"We're a little scared, but we're excited," said Ronit Bart, a native of Kibbutz Saad and an English teacher there.
Many children from our area urgently need to return to a routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter Shani Bart said it feels "a bit funny" to go back to school suddenly.
"These were difficult times, and we didn't leave the house at all," she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited the Kibbutz near the Gaza border to offer his support.
Until a ceasefire interrupted the war last week, thousands of residents of border communities like Saad stayed in their homes or left their homes to move further away from Gaza in safer areas and escape the rocket and mortar fire.
Many residents of Nahal Oz, a community near the Gaza border, where a 4-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian mortar grenade, still hesitate to return.
The Ministry of Education reported that about a dozen families had not yet returned.
Their children were temporarily accommodated in other schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attended a school in Sderot, a border town in Gaza, which was heavily drawn by the Palestinian bombardment.
He appealed to the children to learn a lot and said, "We will make sure that you acquire knowledge and offer you security."
Israel and Hamas agreed on an indefinite ceasefire last Tuesday.
The ceasefire brought about an immediate end to the fighting; however, important problems remain unresolved, such as the Hamas demand for the lifting of the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the reopening of the air and sea ports in Gaza.
Israel calls for the disarming of Hamas and the surrender of the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the battles.
A new round of indirect talks is expected to begin in Egypt this month.
In the war more than 2,100 Palestinians were killed, three quarters of them civilians, and at least 494 children were estimated by the Palestinians and the UN.
Israel contests this information and estimates that at least half of the killed are fighters, but did not provide concrete evidence of this information.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai worker, were killed.
Hamas and other fighters in Gaza fired 4,591 rockets and mortar grenades during the fighting on Israeli cities, most in the south of the country.
Meanwhile, the Israeli military carried out more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
The Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of houses in the Gaza area and some 250,000 people sought refuge in more than 100 UN schools that were converted into provisional shelters.
While tens of thousands of people continue to live in shelters and fights, the education authorities postponed the beginning of the school year last week.
"I hope that the school will soon be open again so that we can continue to learn as the children in the world and the Jewish children," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who currently lives in a school in Gaza City.
After election in Saxony: CDU-Vize Strobl questions NPD ban proceedings
In view of NPD's loss of vote in Saxony, CDU-Bundesvisze Thomas Strobl has voted in favour of an end to the ongoing NPD ban proceedings before the Federal Constitutional Court.
Berlin - According to CDU-Bundesvisze Thomas Strobl, the ongoing prohibition proceedings against the NPD should be brought to an end before the Federal Constitutional Court.
"The NPD cuts off worse than the last time," said Strobl, who is also head of CDU in Baden-Württemberg, the "Leipziger Volkszeitung".
This is a pleasing development in the right direction and a development that makes me rather conclude that the NPD is being fought politically and not before the Constitutional Court.
In the vote on Sunday, the NPD had just failed at the five-percent hearing.
A first start for a ban on the right-wing party had failed in 2003 because the constitutional protection had informants at the time.
In December 2013, the Federal Council submitted a new application in Karlsruhe after a long preparation.
The Federal Government and the Bundestag did not join.
Harburg: Tents for new refugees
Refugees are now accommodated in tents at Neulander Platz.
The central first shot for refugees in Harburg bursts out of all seams.
Now the Internal Affairs has placed three tents of the Red Cross next door.
District politicians have only been informed shortly before - they are not very enthusiastic.
"These Hauruck actions continue to create people's reservations and give district politicians no opportunity to participate constructively in the humane housing of refugees," says Britta Herrmann, Group Chairman of the Greens in the Harburg District Assembly.
Their party claims that the Harburg district administration currently provides unused houses for accommodation.
96 refugees can be accommodated in the three tents.
Reasons for the overfill in the initial view are the storm of the applicants - and the fact that the authorities cannot provide sufficient places in follow-up facilities.
Many refugees therefore stay longer than the regular three months.
House prices have experienced the strongest increase in winter in seven years, showing a well-observed index.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic Home Value Index for Homes in the Australian capital increased by 1.1 percent in August, according to the RP data of Monday.
As a result of this increase, the overall increase in June, July and August is 4.2 percent, the largest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9 percent, more than twice as high as the increase in the 12 months to August 2013, but the increases were not evenly distributed across the country.
RP Data's head of research, Tim Lawless, announced that Sydney and Melbourne are driving a two-way market.
The figures for FP Data show that house prices in Sydney rose by 16.1 percent last year, while in Melbourne they rose by 11.7 percent.
The following markets are Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices rose by an average of five and six percent.
At the other end of the scale is Canberra, which was hard hit by cuts in government expenditure and where prices rose by only 1.4 percent over the year.
Mr. Lawless further said that with the beginning of spring there would now be an increase in the real estate available for sale, which would be subject to a "real test" market for the next few months.
"If one looks at the constant high rate of auction prices, a generally fast sales rate and the constant low interest rate environment, it is likely that home prices will rise even further in the next three months," he said.
In a statement to the New Press, he contradicts the statements of the Managing Director Peer Medau and attests to him to pose "as a general."
This is not the style of the university, says the Communication.
For example, the Medau family had already been "introduced orally in mid-June about the origins of the university.
The statement that the plans were not announced until July is definitely wrong," said Pötzl.
At the same time, he points out that the plans are not "plannings or even decisions", but there are "preferences".
The extension of the narrow road to the castle, which is necessary for access, is also less dramatic than feared by the Medaus.
It was and is not about a nine-metre-wide street.
According to the current status, it is 5.50 meters, which is one meter wider than before," explains Pötzl.
The Medau operators' argument that their free and school-run parking spaces will only be used by university students in the future does not want Pötzl to apply.
Train parking is not done at all because this can now be solved intelligently as with other public parking spaces.
Remembering the Residents
According to the university president, the children's crib mountain weights, which are located on the grounds and which would lead to the entrance to the park deck at their front door, are not to be "impaired".
Rather, he has to bear in mind that "it is not only about the children's cribs, but also about the residents at the entrance to Friedrich-Streib-Straße and the 800 students of the neighboring real school.
It is therefore much more than about the particular interests of the Men's Medau", says Pötzl.
Whether the criticism of the parent council of the kindergarten, with the expansion of the street, would be justified by a "the few natural spots of Coburg will be lost", "the reader can decide for himself".
At the beginning of October, Pötzl, together with the Staatliche Bauamt Bamberg, wants to inform the city councils about the building development of the university by 2020 "and in this context address the importance of the new development".
Peer Medau had last week informed the parents of the kindergarten about the plans of the university.
Thus, the access to the new park deck is not supposed to take you over the campus and Friedrich-Streib-Straße as before, but to the Medau-Berg.
Thus, the narrow road would have to be extended to about one kilometer in length two lanes.
According to Medau's calculations, traffic in the park of Hohenfels Castle would increase tenfold.
Of about 2000 vehicles per day, this is the case.
From the side of the city so far, they did not want to comment on the project.
Glandorf resigns from handball national team
Holger Glandorf will no longer play for the DHB team.
The 31-year-old from the Bundesligist SG Flensburg-Handewitt pointed out health problems in particular for this decision.
The decision has not been easy for me, it has matured over several months.
It's time for me to listen to my body's signals and end my career in the national team," the 2007 World Champion announced on his Facebook page.
He thus goes to international retirement with a balance sheet of 167 national games and 576 goals for Germany.
Because the giant backroom player for the Champions League winner from Flensburg wants to go to Torejagd for a few years, he is no longer available to the new Bundestrainer Dagur Sigurdsson.
Glandorf had a "long and good conversation" with the Icelander, who announced his cadre for the national games against Switzerland on Tuesday.
His ideas and approaches have inspired me just as they will inspire my longtime co-players and my successors.
But for my club I also want to be healthy in the next few years, for that, longer regenerative breaks are necessary that do not allow the current double load.
After a heel infection, the left-handed man had even had to fear the end of his career in 2012.
Due to Achillessen's problems, he had been treated by team doctors from the German Handball Federation (DHB) with a cortisone syringe, which later caused a severe inflammation.
An emergency operation followed and two further interventions followed.
Then Glandorf had announced a lawsuit against the team doctor, which ended with a comparison.
Twelve years of professional and eleven years of national team career don't go by without a trace.
I have some health construction sites that I can't ignore anymore.
After the three infection-related foot operations that took place in 2012 at short intervals, I never got my blood pressure right.
This is due to some other wear-related complaints.
At the beginning of the year, I noticed that although I control my head, my body cannot be fooled," said Glandorf in the interview to the magazine "Handball Time".
He would only be ready for a comeback in an absolute emergency.
"When all the ropes are torn, I'm always ready to talk," the two-time family father told the trade magazine.
However, I can count on one hand the years in which I can still play handball.
I also have to say that after my long stay in the hospital in 2012, I also became quite humble about my health.
After my career I want to be able to go at least a little bit.
In addition to the 2007 World Cup title and the 2014 Champions League win, he won the EHF Cup in 2008 (HSG Nordhorn) and 2010 (TBV Lemgo).
In 2012, Flensburg secured the European Cup of Cup Winners.
German economy fell by 0.2 percent in spring
The crises around the globe slowed down the German economy in the second quarter.
Gross domestic product fell by 0.2 percent from April to the end of June 2014 compared to the previous quarter.
This was notified by the Federal Statistical Office and thus confirmed provisional calculations.
Consumption alone revived the economy in spring, while investment declined.
The economy was also slowed down by external trade.
Thanks to the strong start of the year, there is a total GDP increase of 0.8 percent for the first half of 2013 compared to the second half of 2013.
Horstmar was the starting point and the goal of the "Münsterland-Mooiste", which led through the Burgmannsstadt for the first time on Sunday.
The castle town of Horstmar experienced on Sunday an invasion of Dutch "Fietzenfahrer".
The largest cycling association of the Netherlands, NTFU, organized the so-called "Münsterlande-Mooiste".
This is about the largest cycling tour across Münsterland, the cycling paradise near the Netherlands.
Over 1000 participants thanked Jos ter Huerne for organizing this tour through Münsterland.
This tour was offered to interested people in various specialist journals.
We come from Den Helder and we drove overnight to participate in this tour.
We also want to get to know Münsterland in this way," the cyclists welcomed the route through Steinfurt, Borken and Coesfeld.
After registration in the association home of the Schützenbrederschaft Sta.
Katharina went on a small "peace trip" through the city over the wall, where the start took place.
The route, which was scheduled for three different categories, led back to Horstmar in the direction of the Schöppinger Berg and via Havixbeck and Billerbeck.
On distances of 95 kilometres with 1175 altitudes, 120 kilometres with 1475 altitudes and 145 kilometres with 1775 altitudes, cyclists proved their good condition.
They were nursed on the way in Havixbeck and Billerbeck.
Main organizer Jos ter Huerne and mayor’s deputy Heinz Lölfing were very pleased about the success of this cycling event.
We are satisfied and it was a beautiful experience for all those involved.
The organization ran without problems and there were no negative events," Heinz Lölfing drew a positive conclusion to this event.
Unfortunately, not so many participants came as the organizer had hoped, which was probably due to the bad weather forecasts and the morning rain.
"We will meet again in 2015 with hopefully beautiful weather on 30 August or during another weekend," but the cyclists promised to return to Münsterland and the organizers are planning a new edition.
Konstantin Weckers ruthlessly honest memoirs
It is actually more philosophical testimony than biography, which Konstantin Wecker, songwriter, pacifist, political-proof activist, ex-prisoner, in "Monch and Warrior" brought to paper on 287 pages.
Not chronologically, but more thoughts for thoughts, the Municher, born on June 1, 1947, wrote down his memoirs, initiated each chapter through a fitting lyrics.
And he is ruthlessly honest about this: from masturbation as a gymnast to shoplifting and drug use, he does not leave out human weakness.
Also, to show how he himself learned tolerance in dealing with his fellow humans.
Wide space also takes in abstract, but all the more important terms: love, soul, ego, being in the now, spirituality - all of this he tries to go to the bottom, in a very philosophical, but also very personal way.
And he also explains his pacifism, his social critique, his political commitment - and also how he influenced not only the music (the opera lover became a soul and rock musician), but also his imprisonment.
The latter also brought the Lebemann Konstantin Wecker closer to the ascetic monk, who arises "by subtraction", as he says, "by omitting everything unnecessary".
Between all the high-spirited views, however, there are also short anecdotes for the earth: for example, over bats in a room frequented by GI's or a crazy car ride where he directed a tree frontally.
Even there he is ruthlessly honest.
Lenny Henry: My father never took me by the arm.
Never said "I love you"
Henry was one of seven children of a family of Jamaican immigrants in Dudley in the Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked in a factory and her relationship was limited.
Henry tried out for a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which was partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and was created from the series on Radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mix of reggae and rap, with lively melodies.
But Henry had to work through some difficult childhood moments.
He attended "many" therapies after his mother died, and Henry is thinking about his relationship with his father.
It was hard to know him.
You never saw his face, only stopped his voice: "Stop the noise.
Leave your sister alone.
Move!
I want to look at Cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - who had grown up when I was a child - went to the pub with him and talked about things like the shape of the beer glass or the beauty of a cricket.
I never had such a conversation with him.
Most of my life, he was this serious guy in the corner who read the paper.
Recently Henry opened a foundry in Dudley, and although the conditions are better than at his father's time, he gained an insight into how life might have been for him.
It's a little brighter now, but they're dark, simmered, deep stylish labyrinths with flames and smoke and lots of soot.
My father used to just lie down in the tub and then one could slowly hear him start singing because he could wash the foundry off of himself.
As I was walking around there, I realized that for years he had done that to bring the food to the table, and my respect for him grew.
Nevertheless, Henry grew up as a child without the testimony of his parents.
My father never hugged me, he never said "I love you."
Only when my mother was in bad shape toward the end of her life did we begin to say, "I love you, I love you, I love you."
Through his own daughter Billie, with Dawn French, he was able to share the love he had missed as a child.
Can you stop with the "I love you"?
Stop hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22!
with Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
He is still friends with French, with whom he was married for 25 years.
Dawn is a good man.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry's own mother was a diabetic.
This contributed to her death.
So when I became very, very overweight and showed symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said, "You have to be radical.
So I went through this exercise and also had to make a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And it's exhausting.
No one likes to eat carrots.
Henry's career change may show up in his elegant, short-cut beard.
Since he was praised by the critics for his Othello, he has been received by the theater.
It followed The Comedy of Mistakes, and then Fences of August Wilson.
This is a different experience than the Sitcoms and Comedies who have filled their busy working life.
He started at only 16 when he was working in a factory.
A DJ discovered him on stage when he imitated people and wrote to New Faces about him.
His television career began in the mid-1970s. "I was the only black imitation/comedian on television for a quite long time."
He learned in the profession.
I had to grow up not only in front of the public, but also from 1975 to 1985, how I could become an efficient joke-telling machine while I was a star through television, and that was really difficult.
Lenny 1975 at New Faces
Since his manager had the right to stage at the Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment program in which the people "blackly painted" Henry performed his comedy there for over five years.
My family was very uncomfortable.
I wish it had never happened, but I don't regret doing it.
It was a strange, unpleasant position for me, but I worked on huge projects and learned how to deal with a large audience.
But this "years of award-winning light column of British television" was also a "great parody of black people."
By introducing characters that mocked and celebrated British black culture, Henry worked on an alternative comedy circle in the 1980s.
The first series of the Lenny Henry Show was broadcast in 1984, and in the 1990s he was known among others as Chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef!
Advertising, documentary films, TV series and film roles shaped his next decade, but after his BBC series LennyHenry.tv 2008 he thought: "What do you do next, Len, because it feels like you're just putting time around or getting a little on the spot."
After that came a documentary series for Radio 4 entitled What's So Great About ...?
The first episode was about Shakespeare.
I was really allergic to Shakespeare.
I had never really learned anything about him in school and thought it was mostly a middle class domain, whites in pantyhose and a cabbagehead in the front.
So I was really scared of it.
Everyone we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench said, "You should try it.
Don't hurt yourself if you don't know what you're talking about.
Take a few of the words in your mouth, and then you'll understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry performed 20 lines from Othello's last speech for the documentary and he was enthusiastic.
I felt like I could do that.
It was almost as if someone had finally put my head right.
"That's what it's about, it's a serious thing, take it seriously, learn your text, search a bit.
The samples were brutal, and I read this piece for months before we did it.
And it was a success.
They seemed to be expecting a car accident, and that just didn't happen.
And soon he appeared in the comedy of error.
Suddenly I was at the National Theatre and I could hardly believe it.
There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you've changed."
There was a technical error and Henry instinctively felt that he had to entertain the audience.
"A little voice told me, "You have to bridge for 10 minutes now while they repair the computer."
Instead, the stage manager announced that the performance continued as soon as the problem was solved.
I left the stage and something inside me said, "Oh, thank God."
I'm not responsible.
I can leave this to someone else.
"You play in a play, so stay in your role."
Henry in Fences am Duchess Theatre
Learning the text for Fences was challenging.
Panic is very good, it strengthens the tendons.
That too was well received, so it is like a large shield of the gods who say to me "This is your destiny."
He says this, of course, with a thunderous voice.
So I'll stay with you.
I really love it.
I love being in a rehearsal room.
But Henry still has the head of a comedian - our conversation has gone through with humorous outbursts, while he repeatedly imitates people.
I have decided not to make a stand-up comedy because I think this kind of instant satisfaction from a room full of strangers is somehow dangerous.
If you're always looking for it, you're driving in front of a wall.
I sometimes perform live in Apollo when I feel like it, but overall I don't have as much as before.
I'll ask him if he'll ever make a stand-up comedy tour again.
The fun that I have in a room with a director who helps to form a beginning, a middle part and the end of a trip - I don't think I ever want to give that up again.
So this is his new incarnation?
I think so.
I like being an actor.
It's fun.
You always tell a story, and that's great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Huthi rebels block streets in Yemen's capital
In the conflict between Shiite Huti rebels and the Yemeni government, the Hutis called for civil disobedience in the capital of Sanaa.
Huthi supporters would have occupied central streets in Sanaa on Monday, a speaker of the Huthi party said "Ansar Allah".
The approach to Parliament has also been blocked.
Yemeni media report a traffic chaos in the capital.
According to the online edition of the newspaper "Yemen Post", Huti leader Abdulmalik al-Huthi called for the measures on Sunday evening.
Huthi, according to the paper, threatened with a further escalation of the conflict, his demands should not be met.
The Shiite Huthis are fighting for more independence from Sunnily ruled Yemen and demanding the resignation of the government.
The population of the Huti has been besieging the Yemeni capital for almost two weeks.
Some 30,000 rebels have built protest camps on the major access roads of Sanaa.
In the surrounding country, there are always bloody battles with the Yemeni army.
Kenya registers officials to contain "spiritual workers"
Kenya has begun to register all state officials biometrically in order to remove "spiritual workers" from government payrolls.
Employees who do not register in the next two weeks would no longer be paid, was a government announcement.
The government suspects that thousands of people will receive pay payments even after they leave the public service.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to fight corruption in the public service at his inauguration in 2013.
In an audit at the beginning of this year it was found that at least 1 million dollars (700,000 pounds) per month were lost in payments for "spiritual workers" and other abusive financial practices.
The government assumes that salaries will continue to be paid on accounts after a person has died or leaves the public service, reports Wanyama Chebusiri for the BBC from the capital city of Nairobi.
All officials now need to appear at identification centres in the next two weeks to ensure that their data on biometric registrations are recorded, has been notified in a government message.
All those who would not do so without a credible apology would be removed from the payroll, the communication continued.
"This approach contributes significantly to the rationalisation of the public service by identifying the actual number of officials and also by correcting the salary list at both levels of government - the "hosts" are eliminated," said Anne Waiguru, Cabinet Secretary at the Ministry of Decentralisation and Planning.
The scandal surrounding the art consultant Helge Achenbach will be held for the first time in court on 11 November.
Five heirs of Berthold Albrecht, son of Aldi founder Theo Albrecht, claim 19.4 million euros in damages from Achenbach and two of his companies in insolvency proceedings in a civil trial at the Düsseldorf district court.
That was announced by a judge on Monday.
The plaintiff claims that Achenbach had betrayed the purchase of works of art and old timers and that Berthold Albrecht had charged higher purchase prices than those actually paid.
As a result, the agreed commission would also have been higher.
Achenbach had purchased valuables for Albrecht for 121 million euros.
Children need roots and wings
He spent 44 years in the school service, 23 of them as headmasters.
From this time Manfred Richter knows many standing Petershausener and Kollbacher from their time as students.
His methods were sometimes unconventional, but always borne by his striving to see people in the student.
The snowhead is the most famous mountain in the Giant Mountains.
Manfred Richter loves the painting with the motif from his home.
Judge was born in Trautenau/Nordböhmen in 1930, today Trutnov.
He was already interested in the teaching profession after four years of high school.
One year later, the Sudeten Germans were expropriated.
Within half an hour, the family had to leave their home.
After a few months in a camp it went to Bavaria in 1946 - in the Güterwaggon.
That's how the judge went to the Upper Franconian Senkendorf.
Teacher training took place in Bamberg.
In addition, Manfred Richter had to walk ten kilometers a week to the next train station, drive by train to Bamberg, go there three kilometres across the whole city to the school and go back in the evening.
After two months, Manfred Richter got a sleeping opportunity in a Red Cross home in Bamberg: together with up to 15 students in a dormitory.
In 1951, he took the first and in 1954, after three years, he took the second state examination.
Since he had no free teaching position for him, he applied to Oberbayern and came to the school in Kollbach on 1 November 1954.
The "Fräulein-Zimmer" was his first "service apartment" in the schoolhouse.
In 1958, he moved to a three-room service apartment in the new teacher's house next to the school.
This house bought Manfred Richter in 1980 after the school was dissolved in Kollbach in 1968.
Until then, there were three classes in Kollbach at the Petershausen-Kollbach School Association and five in Petershausen.
From the 1968/69 school year these were summarized in Petershausen in today's town hall.
When the school association Indersdorf was founded, only the primary school remained in the village.
In order to avoid a classification in the now smaller school, the then rector Georg Sigl moved to Karlsfeld - and Manfred Richter became his successor.
But Petershausen grew, and as of September 1982 the children and their teachers were able to acquire the present building, which was extended after Richter's retirement in 1997.
Manfred Richter praises the uncomplicated generosity of the then mayor Ludwig Götz, who, at the expense of the community, built a workroom and in the course of enlargement in 1997, even though this was not eligible under the guidelines for school buildings.
"Bürgermeister Götz was very school-friendly," Richter remembered gratefully.
In his entire career, Manfred Richter never forgot the speech of a government representative who had responded to a report from a school council on justice and justice: "You should never forget love." Manfred Richter implemented what he had heard there as a young teacher.
"You have to give the children two things: roots and wings," says the 84-year-old today.
And he had to know, "That doesn't always work." Whether he only means his students or just his own six children is not quite clear.
In any case, Judge's actions were sometimes unconventional.
When pupils fought, he did not give them a penalty job, nor did they become a posterity.
At the expense of the community, judges had bought two pairs of boxing gloves and had the two competitors face each other, even if there was to be a dowry.
For the benefit of the school, judges as rector maintained a good relationship with the then mayor Ludwig Götz (CSU).
He moved the partyless judge after his retirement to run at least as the last on the CSU list for the municipal council in 1996.
However, judges were elected to sixth place and joined the CSU.
180 kilometers in three days
HR4-RADTOUR 700 cyclists enter the spa park of Bad Salzhausen and Schotten intermediate stops
If cyclists take a break on their tour in Bad Salzhausen or Schotten, this is nothing special in itself.
On Friday, however, only the number of resting impressions made: The 700 participants of the hr4-radtour and the accompaniment trail enjoyed a break in the lower spa park of Bad Salzhausen and later a party under the open sky in the Schotten Alteburgpark.
The participants met in Bad Vilbel on Thursday and had a concert by Van Baker & Band under the motto "Radels and Celebrate on Newly Discovered Ways between Nidda and Kinzig".
On Friday it became serious: the cyclists took the first stage, the 60 kilometers via Florstadt to Bad Salzhausen and further to Schotten.
In Bad Salzhausen, the athletes were welcomed by Mayor Hans-Peter Seum, who had started his bicycle in Bad Vilbel, and the head of the own company Bad Salzhausen, Petra Schwing-Döring.
To refresh the body and mind, all kinds of good things had been prepared: the landwives from Ranstadt and Nieder-Mockstadt had baked 85 sheets of apple, teaspoon, sprinkler and cheese cakes, which were wonderfully mouthed by the skilled cyclists.
"Such cakes can only bake landwives," praised a participant from Aulendiebach, while ordering another piece.
Cold refreshments could be obtained at the table of the Geiß-Nidda gymnastics club.
The "Duo Bravo" entertained the visitors with well-known melodies from operettas and musicals and received enthusiastic applause.
The beautiful ambience of the park seemed relaxing.
A gentleman also enjoyed a head massage from his partner: "He deserved it, after all he has attached already cut off bicycle chains again today".
At the time, the mayor and the manager still had to work: they were interviewed at the well in front of the Trinkurhaus by Reporter Rainer Janke and took advantage of the opportunity to advertise on the radio for Bad Salzhausen.
Prof. Tobias Hagen, who has been on tour for only a short time since the first hr4-radtour in 2004, was also able to catch up with him, but he had plenty to do with the technology on site.
His pickup truck, in which he communicated via three telephones and a radio with his employees and the 15-member motorcycle squadron of the Hessen Police, wrote Facebook entries and made reports, also needed a check.
"The majority of the participants come from the Rhine-Main area," he said, "but also from casts or Fulda, from Lauterbach or the Taunus and even from numerous cities in Westphalia, cyclists have arrived.
The number of participants depends a bit on the available overnight capacity.
In Category I, the participants are accommodated in hotels, in Category II in collective accommodation.
From the spa, the cyclists had a good impression when, after an hour and a half, they started again: "Bye!"
"It was nice in Bad Salzhausen!" they waved to farewell.
After arriving in Scotland, the group was allowed to take a short break.
But in the evening the cyclists were required in the idyllic Alteburg Park.
Under the direction of the Schotten Society for Tourism and Urban Marketing (GTS), the park had received a beautiful ambience and, of course, it had prepared delicacies, such as flame cakes with a well-cooled spring whitener.
Mayor Susanne Schaab, GTS Managing Director Markus Hoßfeld and MSC Chairman Wolfgang Wagner-Sachs in his role as Executive Director of ADAC Hessen-Thüringen welcomed the visitors.
The three were apparently pleased with the "many operations in Scotland".
DJ Tobias Hagen then released the dance stage.
Despite the sporty activity on the bike, the opportunity for swinging movements under the open sky was used zealously.
Among the guests, citizens were increasingly mixed, who were as motivated by the good mood as the great crowd of cyclists.
On the second day, Birstein, Wächtersbach and Bad Orb stations – including a concert with the Trenkwalders – were on the show for the cyclists.
Yesterday, after 180 kilometres of cycling, the athletes returned to Bad Vilbel.
Dozens of Turkish police officers arrested for "conspiracy" against the government
A total of 33 police officers were arrested in Turkey on suspicion of "conspiracy against the government", reports local media agencies.
The police authorities did not make any direct comments.
Among the arrested are 14 senior police officers, reports Hürriyet Daily News.
Some of them were involved in the corruption investigations against government officials, including four ministers last December.
In July, a number of Turkish police officers were arrested for allegedly establishing an organized criminal association and picking up phone numbers.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who was then Prime Minister) described her action as part of the activities led by the Islamic clergyman Fethulla Güllen against him and other persons in positions of power.
Not all children in Ukraine return to school
Schools almost everywhere in Ukraine opened on Monday (1 September) after the summer holidays.
This day is traditionally an important day for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arsenij Jazenjuk brought his daughter to school.
There he told waiting journalists that not all schools had reopened, but that he was determined to defend the country for future generations:
The September celebrations were not held in every school.
Heaven is not peaceful all over Ukraine.
We must fight for a peaceful sky.
The entire Ukraine, a huge common Ukrainian people's front must fight for a peaceful sky.
Alexan Pasteckhow, head of the school in Slavjansk, who visits Jazenjuk's daughter, spoke in Russian.
We hope that there will be peace here at last and that the children will receive an education that will be useful to them in the future.
The first school day of the new school year is traditionally celebrated, with children wearing embroidered shirts, holding balloons in their hands and giving flowers to their teachers.
With Rona Fairhead, the BBC may have found the great director she needs.
It meets with a proud parade of fame from the banking world, media management and the inner circle of the Tory party.
And she has her own front experience.
Her career began with the global management consulting company Bain and Co., whereupon she moved to Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the media world of Pearsons.
She was Chairman of the Financial Times for seven years and resigned when the top position of Pearson's parent company went to a younger male colleague.
Their compensation was said to be almost £1 million.
Their political ranking is also solid.
She was recommended to David Cameron by Lord Browne, the former president of BP, when he was looking for more private economic knowledge in Whitehall: she became an advisor to the Cabinet.
Her husband is a former Tory Councilman.
As early as May, I described the chairman's task with a poisoned chalice.
Not only is the BBC a huge and complex entity in the heart of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
The trust is in two directions: inwardly, the first guard of its own management hierarchy in the BBC, but also outwardly, as a voice of public concern and unrest, when things are going wrong.
This ensures an almost unsustainable duopoly that requires a complete comprehensive reform.
But which new president would risk starting to tap into everything and break up an institution that is as complex as a Chinese dynasty, while perhaps taking himself to his job.
It is a difficult task.
And as if that wasn't enough, many are also interested in seeing the BBC shrinked - power, money and status overtaken.
While competition is getting closer and new technologies are threatening old, comfortable collateral, the forthcoming negotiation of licence fees for the BBC poses special dangers.
For the modest sum of £ 145.50 a year, the British public is certainly purchasing into the largest media company in the world.
The BBC tells a good story: it says it reaches 96 percent of all households, each of which costs only 40 pence a day.
And apparently, the BBC is going up again on the popularity scale: 53 percent of them support them today, compared to 31 percent 10 years ago.
The vision and usage habits for the BBC have changed: I get message punch lines on my mobile today and see missed programs later on on my iPlayer.
But it remains a very beloved and remarkable institution.
She needs a considerable chairman - I hope she found him.
Perry from Texas says that reducing tweet was not authorized
A tweet from the official user account of the Republican governor of Texas, Rick Perry, on Sunday contained a disparaging remark about the democratic district attorney, who is at the heart of a criminal charge against him for abuse of official authority.
The Tweet was later deleted and replaced by another of Perry's user accounts that denied the previous one.
A tweet has just been sent from my account that was not authorized by me.
"I don't approve of the tweet and have deleted it," it said in the later message.
Perry's employees did not respond immediately to requests for comments.
Although the tweets of Perry's official user account expired, it was not clear who actually serves the feed.
The former Tweet drew an unfavorable picture of Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted of drunkenness in April 2013.
Perry filed a veto against financial support from her office when she refused to resign, leading to an accusation against Perry, who could possibly be a 2016 presidential candidate, before a Grand Jury in Austin this month.
The Tweet's text reads: "I don't always drive drunk with the triple permitted alcohol level ... but when I do, I charge Governor Perry when he talks it out."
I'm the most drunk woman in Texas.
Lehmberg's office was not responsible for the investigation of the Grand Jury against Perry.
This was led by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, who was elected by a Republican judge.
Perry pleads not guilty and called the charge a political trick.
His high-class team of lawyers applied to the judge in charge of the case to reject the charge and argued that the law against the most senior governor in the history of the state of Texas is unconstitutionally diffuse.
Perry stopped $7.5 million of government funds from the State's Public Integrity Unit - which is based in Travis County and in cases of state corruption in Texas - when Lehmberg refused to resign.
This veto provided a public complaint on the part of a left-wing watchdog group.
Perry's official user account is frequently updated - and sometimes famous.
After he finished fifth at the elections in Iowa during his 2012 presidential candidate, Perry began to speculate that he would stop by posting a tweet of a photo about himself jogging near a lake, with the words "South Carolina, we're coming!"
Berkeley explains housing market again for "normal"
One of London's most prominent construction contractors pointed out that the housing market in South East England had returned to normal levels.
Homes in the capital were highly sought after and subject to enormous price increases, which prompted the Bank of England to set limits on mortgage credit in June due to the widespread fear of a loan bubble.
Tony Pidgley, founder and CEO of the high-class construction company Berkeley, said on Monday: "Since the beginning of the current financial year, the market has returned to normal transaction levels since its peak in 2013" and added that this offers a "stable environment of action".
The real estate market in London was well placed during the downturn, as foreign buyers pushed into the capital.
According to information from the disaster department, prices in the urban area alone rose by 18.5 percent last year, much more than the average increase in England and Wales as a whole.
The average sales prices of Berkeley's private, cheap and student offers rose by about one fifth last year and by the end of April amounted to 423,000 pounds.
However, a stronger pound has made property properties in London less attractive for foreign buyers in recent months - some of them have also been deterred by the introduction of new real estate taxes and political rhetoric by a possible "wild tax" before the general elections next May.
The London real estate agent Foxtons warned last week that in the second half of the year, the mortgage market report for April, in which stricter lending arrangements were presented, would also lead to lower market growth both in real estate sales and in prices.
New data from the Bank of England from Monday show a decline in mortgage approval in July, which also indicates that the real estate market is cooling off.
Hamptions International, another real estate agency, corrected its predictions for the rise of property prices in London for 2015 down to 3 percent, based on an already weakening domestic price awareness.
The transaction volume in the most expensive areas of London such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington has now decreased by a quarter year by year, according to the real estate agent WA Ellis.
Nevertheless, the desire for a private home in the capital for Berkeley is a blessing, as the amounts due for forward sales are more than £2.2 billion.
Mr. Pidgley added: "The demand for the right, well-planned product at the best locations remained stable and as a result, future sales also remained stable."
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new homes in the year to the end of April - almost a third more than to the peak in 2007 before the crisis.
Annual pre-tax earnings rose by 40 percent annually to £280 million, sales by 18 percent to £1.6 billion.
In a communication dated Monday before the company's annual meeting, Mr Pidgley said that the revenues for Berkeley would be expected to meet current market expectations in the current year.
The analysts estimate the annual pre-tax profit at £450 million.
Berkeley shares stood at £23.96 in London's trade in the afternoon.
Nude Photos by Jennifer Lawrence posted by Hacker on the Internet
Jennifer Lawrence appearance at the 85th Oscars.
Nude photos of the Oscar Award winner Jennifer Lawrence were published online by a hacker who claimed to have a "master list" of pictures of another 100 starlets.
A representative of the star from "The Tribute of Panem" confirmed that Lawrence's photos were real and accused the hacker of "clatant violation of privacy".
The authorities were notified and will follow all those who posted the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photos that were originally posted on Photo Sharing page 4chan were allegedly obtained through a gap in the online storage system iCloud by Apple. The alleged "master list" of the hacking victims includes the names of dozens of female stars, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen, reported BuzzFeed.
It is not sure how many of the pictures are real, although Winstead, star from "Scott Pilgrim against the rest of the world" on Twitter also condemned the hack.
"To those of you who look at photos that my husband and I took years ago in our home's private environment - I hope you're really happy with yourself," wrote Winstead on Twitter.
Victoria Justice from the Nickolodeon series "iCarly" and "Victorious" argues, however, that the photos are about pictures of her and tweet "These so-called nude pictures of me are FEELING, people.
Let's just start off. *Wortspiel intends*.
Buzzfeed reported on late Sunday that a speaker of the pop star Ariana Grande denied the authenticity of the alleged photos of her.
Exclusive extract from Howard Jacobson's highly acclaimed new novel about love and the letter "J".
They floated, so you could best describe it, they slowly dissolve like a cardboard that you left standing in the rain.
Occasionally, a woman told him that he was too serious, strenuous, intense, distant and perhaps a little scratchy.
Then shook his hand.
He knew a scratch brush.
He was mean, like in hedgehogs, yeah.
The last victim of this indifference was just beginning an affair that had been much more promising for a relief of the lonely boredom of his life than usual, and perhaps even brought him some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a trembling delicate beauty with untamed hair and a fluttering heart from a village on the North Island, which was even more remote and rougher than Port Reuben.
She had come with an older accompaniment to the south, holding Kevern for her aunt, and who had inherited a plot in a damp but paradise valley with the striking name Paradise Valley.
For several years no one had lived in the house.
The pipes were leaky, in the bathrooms were still spiders, nude snails had left their tracks on all the windows and believed that they belonged to all of this, and the garden was overgrown with weeds, which looked like huge cabbage heads.
It was like the house from a children's fairy tale, both threatening and tempting, a garden full of secrets.
Portrait of the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is on the longlist for the 2014 Man Booker Prize.
The shortlist will be announced next week.
With Ailinn, Kevern had sat hand-holding on the broken deck chairs in the high grass and had enjoyed an unusually warm spring afternoon. Both of them had sounded absent in the service console, which provided the country with soothing music and soothing news, when the sight of their crossed brown legs reminded him of an old song by a long-forgotten black entertainer, whom his father had liked to listen at closed shutters in the house.
Your feet are too big.
Because of their original aggressiveness, songs of this kind were no longer played on the console.
Not forbidden - nothing was really forbidden - just not played.
It was successfully obsolesed, as well as obsolesizing the word.
The general taste was what decrees and regulations never could have done, and how people in books choose the From-Television-To-Millionaire-Memoirs, cookbooks and romance novels, so they chose the ballads in the music.
In the euphoria of the day, Kevern began to play an imaginary piano and to sing in a groub-comic serenade Ailinn's big feet.
Ailinn didn't understand.
"That was a well-known song by a jazz pianist named Fats Waller," he explained to her and automatically put two fingers on his lips.
His father had always done that to stop the letter J before he came out of his mouth.
It had begun as a game between him and his father when he was still small.
His father had played it with his own father, so he had told him.
If you start a word with a J without putting two fingers over your lips, it'll cost you a penny.
It wasn't a very funny game at the time, and it wasn't very funny even now.
He knew that this was expected of him, that was all.
It had to explain what jazz was.
Ailinn had never heard of anyone.
Jazz was not played, even if it was not banned directly.
The improvisation was no longer modern.
There was only room for a single "if" in life.
People wanted to be quite sure at the beginning of a melody where it would end.
The same is true of the mind.
His unpredictableness made people nervous.
And jazz was a musically expressed mind.
Although he was 10 years old without having heard from Sammy Davis Junior, Kevern knew something about jazz from his father's half-secret collection of old CDs.
But at least he didn't have to explain to Ailinn that Fats Waller was black.
At her age she probably couldn't remember a time when pop singers weren't black.
Once again, no laws or compulsions.
A consistent society meant that each element of this society gratefully agreed to the principle of group talent - gratefully as those spared from fate.
People of Afro-Caribbean origin were suitable for entertainment and sports through temperament and body construction, so they sang and ran.
People who originally came from the Indian subcontinent were blessed by nature with electronic talent and were cared for with the task of ensuring that no family remained without a functioning service phone.
What was left of the Polish community took care of the sewerage; what was left of the Greeks smashed plates.
Those from the Gulf States and the Levante, whose grandparents had not left the country quickly as WHAT HAPPENED WAS WHEN IT HAPPENED - out of fear of being accused of fires, out of fear that the flames would devour them next - had opened labneh and shisha pipe restaurants, kept in mind and became depressed with the inactivity.
Everyone according to his abilities.
Since she had only heard ballads, it was difficult for Ailinn to understand how the insulting words that Kevern had just sung her could ever be made public.
Music was an expression of love.
"They're not really insulting," said Kevern.
Except maybe for people whose feet are too big.
My father never offended anyone, but he loved this song.
He spoke too much, but the neglected garden gave him the deceptive sense of security.
Nothing could overcome the sound insulation of the huge coal-like leaves.
Ailinn still didn't understand.
Why would your father love such a thing?
He wanted to say it was a jux, but he hesitated to put two fingers on his lips again in her presence.
She already thought he was something strange.
"It seemed funny to him," he said instead.
She shook her head in disbelief and blocked Kever's view.
There was nothing else to see around the world but her uncomplicated raven black hair.
There was nothing else he would have liked to see.
"If you say so," she says without conviction.
But that doesn't explain why you're singing it to me.
She seemed really worried.
Are my feet too big?
He looked back.
Your feet don't look like that.
Maybe your ankles, a little bit...
And you say you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
Hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
That's just the stupid song.
He could have said "I love you," but it was too early for that.
"Your thick ankles are exactly why you like me," he tried instead.
I'm a little perverted.
That didn't sound right.
It was supposed to be weird.
When he tried to be funny, he often got into trouble because, like his father, he did not have the soothing charm needed to cover up the atrocities inherent in jokes.
Maybe his father wanted to be cruel too.
Maybe he wanted to be, Kevern.
Despite his friendly eyes.
Ailinn Solomons turned red and got out of her deck chair, threw the console around and spilled the wine they had drunk.
Holunderblütenwein, so drunkenness was no excuse for him.
In her excitement she seemed to be shaking, like palm wand in the storm.
"And your dickhead is exactly why I feel drawn to you," she said...
Except I'm not.
She was sorry, both for the unnecessary unkindness of his words and for the fear that appeared in her eyes when she opposed him.
Did she think he'd hit her?
She had not told him about life on the cold northern archipelago, where she had grown up, but he had no doubt that it was essentially like here.
The same huge and ice-cold ocean broke here as it did on the shore.
The same bewildered men, with even thicker skin and more tedious according TO WHAT HAPPENED BEING their ancestors as smugglers and beach robbers, always moved from pub to pub, always ready to raise their hands against a woman who refused or laughed at them.
Dickhead?
They would have shown her a big fist if she hadn't been careful!
She first hugged - hugging was the most commonly used word for an erotic attraction between men and women, an antidote to the unspeakable love ballads from the console - first hugging them and then beating them.
According to Kevern's view, this was an unnecessary refinement, as the Knutsch itself was already an act of violence.
Ailinn Solomons gave him a sign to walk through her body.
He got out of the deck chair like an old man.
She also felt pale, but the weight of his grief surprised her.
That wasn't the end of the world.
They hardly knew each other.
She watched him get away - as if from a room on the upper floor her companion looked at him - a man complained about something he had sworn to himself.
Adam leaves the garden, she thought.
She felt a sudden pain for him and men in general, although some had raised their hands against her.
A man turned away from her, bent his back, ashamed, defeated, without a spirit of struggle - why was it a sight she seemed to know well, if she could not remember a single time when she had seen such a thing before today?
When she was back alone, Ailinn looked at Solomon's feet.
Several years before the events just told, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher on behalf of Ofnow, the non-legislative monitoring body for the public mood, was working on a short lecture on the continued violence at a low and medium level in exactly those parts of the country in which their reduction, if not abolition, is best expected, in view of the money and energy invested in the eradication of this violence.
"A lot has been done, and much still needs to be done," she wrote, "to appease the innate aggressiveness of a people who have waged a thousand wars and won most of them, especially in the remote corners and valleys of the country where the sweet breath of human kindness was historically rarely felt despite the high-questioning church towers between the hedges.
But some properties appear to be indelible.
The higher the church tower, it seems, the less passion it continues to arouse.
The people cry when hearing sentimental ballads, are intoxicated by stories about overcome difficulties and claim to believe firmly in the virtues of marriage and family life, but yet not only does the former rawness hold the rural communities as well as our urban structures firmly in hand, but there is also evidence of the emergence of a new and retarded quarrel at home, at work, on the streets and even on the playgrounds.
"They have an unfortunate tendency to exaggerate," said her mentor when he read the entire report.
I suggest you read less novels.
Esme Nut Tree lowered her head.
I also have to ask: are you an atheist?
"I don't think I have to say that," Esme Nut Tree replied.
Are you a lesbian?
Again, Esme appealed to her right to privacy and refuse the statement.
The feminist?
Shut up again.
"I don't ask that," said Luther Rabinowitz, "because I would be against atheism, lesbianism or feminism.
This is a non-prejudicing job.
We serve an unbiased society.
But certain types of hypersensitivity, which in themselves are absolutely acceptable and praiseworthy, may occasionally distort results as you have presented them.
You yourself obviously have prejudices against the Church, and these things that you call "hidden" and "red" could be interpreted by others just as well as an expression of natural strength and vitality.
If you continue to ride around on what is happening, IF IT WAS HAPPENING, as if it had happened yesterday, it means taking its essential vital vitality from the land.
Esme Nut Tree looked around while Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind his head, an LED writing in Flamingorosa repeated the advice that Ofnow had given the country in the last quarter of a century or more.
Smile at your neighbors, appreciate your partner, listen to ballads, visit musicals, use your phone, talk, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
Speaking is better than silence, the sung word is better than the written, but nothing is better than love.
"I absolutely understand what you want to go on," replied Esme Nut Tree with a quiet voice, when she was sure that her boss had spoken to the end, "and I say nothing but that we are not yet as effectively healed as we imagine ourselves.
My concern is that, without warning, we may find ourselves repeating the mistakes that are only at all to THE WHITE HAPPENING WHEN IT IS HAPPENED.
This time, however, it is not the others that we let go of our anger and our mistrust.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with his hands.
To imply an angel's patience.
"They go too far," he said, "if you call actions "errors" that our grandparents may or may not have committed.
They also go too far when you say that these would have left out their "wrath" and their "mistrust" to "others".
It should not really be necessary to remind someone in your position that when we understand the past as when protecting the present, we are not talking about "us" and "others".
There was no "we" and there were no "others".
It was a time of disorder, that's all we know.
"Of that, if we are honest with ourselves," Esme dared to summon, "no part of society can claim to have behaved well.
I'm not accusing anyone.
Whether bad or good has been done, what has happened has happened.
That was back then.
There is nothing more to be said about this - we agree.
And just as no debt has to be assigned, no debt has to be cleared if such a repayment is appropriate and if there is a way to cancel it.
But what does the past serve if we do not learn from it?
The past serves to make us forget them.
If there's anything I can say about it -
Luther Rabinowitz let his pyramid collapse.
"I will consider their report," he said and released them.
The next day, when she went to work as usual, she was overtaken by a motorcyclist who, as passers-by described, had driven on foot in a sort of "brutal rage".
There are coincidences.
Lesotho military member says that no coup d'état is planned; Prime Minister remains in South Africa
Official representatives of the military in Lesotho protested to plan a coup d'état to overthrow the government and said that they were taking action against policemen accused of armed political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country and announced that the army of the country had surrounded its seat and occupied government buildings in the capital of Maseru.
The Prime Minister brought his family to neighboring South Africa after reporting on attempted assassination threats.
Military spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi said that de facto there was no coup d'état, but the military responded to the threat posed by "political fanatics" whose weapons were imminent by the police.
"What happened this morning was that the staff of the defense forces of Lesotho acted after he had received several intelligence reports that within the police were acting some elements that actually wanted to armed some of the political, party-political young fanatics who were about to do devastating damage," he said to Voice of America.
South African government spokesman Clayson Monyela said that the military action made the impression of a overthrow.
"Even if no one has claimed to have torn the government by force, all reports agree that the activities of Lesotho's defence forces have so far shown signs of a coup," he said.
Speakers of the Lesotho military announced on Sunday that the soldiers were retreating into their barracks and the situation in the capital was quiet.
In the meantime, the Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoya Metsing takes the lead during Thabane's absence.
Thabane announced that he believed he had become the target for his attempt to fight corruption in the country.
In Lesotho there has been great tension since June after Thabane postponed parliamentary meetings due to the conflicts in his unitary government.
He said that his actions had not undermined the government, in spite of other accusations.
Production in the euro area at a 13-month low
The increase in production in the eurozone slowed down to the lowest point in the last 13 months in August, thus a closely observed study.
The final Markit purchasing manager index of the manufacturing industry (PMI) fell to 50.7 in August, at a level of 51.8 in July.
An increase of more than 50 indicates an expansion.
New orders went down and factories experienced collapses at a time of increasing tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures are available on Thursday before the European Central Bank (ECB) meeting.
Markets expect the Bank to have a clear plan for dealing with a hesitant recovery of the euro area and for the threat of deflation at an inflation rate of only 0.3%.
There are speculations that the head of the ECB, Mario Draghi, could provide further information over the course of this week on whether he is considering a quantitative facilitation for the euro area, according to those made by the United Kingdom and the United States during the financial crisis.
"Although small growth is better than no growth at all, the braking effects of increasing economic and geopolitical uncertainties have become more pronounced for manufacturers," said Rob Dobson, leading economist at Markit.
The factory PMI for Germany, Russia's largest trading partner in the EU, fell to the lowest level in 11 months with 51.4.
Meanwhile, in the second largest economic nation of the block, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.
France remains a worried child, as well as the descent of Italy from a solid expansion to stagnation.
It is also not reassuring to note that growth incentives in the key industry mechanism are no longer taking place in Germany, Spain and the Netherlands," said Mr. Dobson.
The decline in industry is likely to fuel the fire of analysts who expect further monetary or fiscal incentives.
A positive news came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI rose to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economic expert at IHS Global Insight, said: "The best thing you can say for the shopping manager index of the manufacturing industry in the eurozone of August is that the sector continues to grow after that."
He added: "Producers in the euro area are obviously finding life rather difficult at the moment, as the current increased geopolitical tensions - especially with regard to Russia and Ukraine - are increasing uncertainties in the still difficult conditions in many countries.
These increased uncertainties have clearly affected the economy - in particular, and consumer confidence, and probably lead to some contracts being delayed or even cancelled, in particular large-scale contracts.
He said that it would be "more and more likely" that the ECB would eventually have to introduce some kind of QE, "although we suspect that this will be limited."
The Hell Decade of the Survivors of Beslan: Ten years have passed since the terrible siege of the school, as the children in it still suffer today.
Ten years ago, more than 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen militias in a school in Beslan, South Russia.
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed in the three-day martyrdom that shocked the world.
We returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death from the atrocities in the classroom.
Just a decade after the terrible siege of the school of Beslan, at which 334 people perished, including 186 children, the heroic survivors warned the night before a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When fanatic Islamist terrorists captured and killed children and parents on September 1, 2004, the beginning of a new school year, it seemed like the evil of evil.
The tragedy united West and East in abhorrence, and then, surprisingly, turned into action and hope for the future in the midst of the worst misery.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death from the atrocities in the classroom.
We found surprising young people who have overcome resistance, although the memory of this terrorist hell will pursue it forever.
Your greatest hope?
That the war that now visits Ukraine - and in the children like them die - will now end.
The girl who was photographed trying to climb back to the smashed school sports hall
She was photographed and famous by Russian star photographer Dimitri Beliakov when she only tried to climb back to the smashed school sports hall in her underwear after a mine had exploded.
Confusedly, Aida was looking for her mother Larissa, now 40 years old.
Both were considered dead, but they survived.
"A woman told me to run for my life, but I couldn't," said Aida.
My legs were flooded with blood.
I got up and climbed back in to look for my mother.
A soldier brought her to safety.
After a series of operations, she considered herself completely healed, but said yesterday: "Three months ago, the pain returned.
I'm afraid I'm gonna need surgery again.
Some grenades are still in my knee.
Their goal is now to become a dentist to help people as they were helped by doctors.
"This tragedy changed my life, but it didn't break me," she says.
"That happened to me, and you can't change that.
Once a year I always go to the gym to remember the ones who stayed there.
My friends and I try not to talk about it on other days.
The pain is too great.
My best friend and future classmate Dzera Gapoeva was killed there.
We played together when we were little, dreaming of going to school together.
"I don't want to get married until I finish my studies and start my career.
I think of a family later.
She says that the siege will always remain a part of it, although the memory becomes a little weaker every year.
I am glad that many people in the world still remember our horrors and we are so grateful for the help we received from people in Britain and everywhere.
When I see the photo of me online, as I climb back to school, I think that many people see it for the first time, understand our disaster, and contribute to that not happening again.
The boy who fled through the bullet hail, in the opinion that his mother was dead
It was his first school day (Russians going to school at age 7) and survived the three-day siege in his mother Tamara's arms.
When he was seven, he said, "Mama told me to lie down if there was an explosion and hold her hand."
After an explosion, he thought she was going to die.
She said to him, "Run."
Fearful, she could be dead, he fled and saw on the way a crying toddler, grabbed it by the hand and fled through a bullet.
His father Vladimir, who locked his son out of his arms, said, "Damir told me that his mother had died.
He said, "I couldn't save them."
In fact, Tamara had stumbled outside and had bone injuries in the hospital, for her part, assuming that her son had died.
After her reunion, she said, "I cried for joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
Damir was later flown to London (from the now disbanded News of the World newspaper) to receive the title of Barnardo's Children's Champion from then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie.
"This horror haunts you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering," he said yesterday.
But I can say it's going to fade in my memory.
I remember throwing away all my toy guns right after that.
But now I can play computer games with shooting scenes and that's not a problem for me.
"I'm not afraid to go back to the gym, but I don't think about myself.
I remember those kids I played with in the yard and who didn't make it out there.
We never say they were killed or dead.
We say they stayed in the gym.
I remember my journey to London very well, especially at the toy shop, where I could choose everything I wanted, and the ride in an open car.
But now he is afraid of place like Ukraine, where wars cause the kind of calamity that he and his friends suffered.
This horror haunts you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it.
"I am so sorry for all those who suffer from the horrors," said Damir, who worked as a volunteer in a monastery last week.
I want to help so much.
One day I want to go to the police and hope they'll take me to the training academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, said, "37 children from our neighborhood were killed, can you imagine that?
I remember the terrible silence after the siege, there were simply no children who could call and walk around, and this silence lasted for many months.
She vividly recalls her journey to London with Damir.
The people in London were crying when I told our story.
I then understood how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and show their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the prize and the opportunity to travel to London in the autumn of 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and just tell her myself that 10 years have passed, but I still remember the meeting with her and her husband in London, and how Damir and I helped.
I remember Damir wanting to eat borsch and calling all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember him playing with waitresses in a restaurant. Damir shot her with his water gun and they ran away and played with him.
And that was only a month after the horror.
I was surprised that the British were so willing to share our pain and support us.
She said, "I always think this world hasn't improved in these 10 years.
In Ukraine the war continues now, and every day people die, and I believe that many children have been killed and are still being killed.
These are exactly the same children as ours.
I think for many of the war is part of the news they hear when they are bored or busy with something else.
I just know what these people feel, the whole horror.
And I can't stop feeling that.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other, and that's so sad.
Damir grew up and is a very gentle and quiet boy, he is not aggressive or angry at all.
For example, he is not looking for revenge, he is not overwhelmed by the past horrors.
I know he doesn't like to remember, but he has six close friends from class and they occasionally go to the gym and light candles there.
When he was smaller, he suffered under it - I remember how he sometimes laid down on the sofa, turned his face away from us for hours.
Not sleeping, his eyes were open.
I also remember how he threw away all his weapons and other military toys. Damir is now 17, bigger than I am, good-looking, intelligent and healthy.
I can hardly believe I was so sure for a few hours that he was dead and I would never see him again.
When I recovered after the explosion and came to my feet, I looked around and saw hell around me, with body parts all around.
I was absolutely sure that my little boy could not have survived in this hell.
"I remember calling him, "Damir, run, run away," but I was also so sure he hadn't heard me.
But he heard it and he ran away.
And so life goes on for us, unlike many others.
Georgij Ilyin, 17
The boy whose terrible image after the siege became a symbol of the abominations of Beslan
Comfort: Beslan survivor Georgij Lyin with his mother Fatima after the siege 2004, on the right a picture of Georgij today
His bloody face was scarred when he ran for his life, while Chechen terrorists shot down his classmates.
His image was one of the most shocking symbols for the barbarism of Beslan.
His mother Fatima, 54, a doctor, had dropped him off for his first day at school before she rushed out to take her older son Vladimir to university.
"I left the court about two minutes before the terrorists stormed him, and so my little boy stayed there for three terrible days alone," she recalls.
Not entirely alone, there was an entire family of relatives of us, but they were all killed.
Only my Georgij managed to survive.
The closer this date draws, the harder it is to think about it and talk about it.
There is not a single day in which we do not remember this tragedy.
We don't think it's been a long time, I think it would have happened yesterday, some scenes from these days always follow me.
No one will ever forget that, I promise you.
Intrusive: The image of Georgij (left) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was immortalized as a statue (right).
I remember Georgij so eager to go to school that day, and he said he wanted to hug his teacher.
I only knew he was alive when I saw him on TV.
And now there is even this statue of the crying Georgij in San Marino.
Georgij doesn't like to see the picture, and it's hidden at home in the bookshelf.
I understand that, but I also mean that people all over the world feel our pain thanks to this image.
Georgij says today: "It is important that such a thing can never happen again.
"I doubt that we will ever know the truth.
People keep investigating such tragedies and never learn the truth.
And now they're investigating the crash of this Boeing in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what caused him?
This world is turning into something terrible.
"I can't understand how that's possible, because if you ask people, no one wants a war, so how does that happen?
Ten years are nothing at all in such pain.
We need dozens of years to forget it a little bit.
It attacked my health and I still feel it.
For about three or four years I had some nightmares because of the siege, but then it got better.
I went back to school later in 2004 and was scared every day.
I was thinking about my friends and classmates who had been killed.
That's why I always go to the gym when the 1st of September gets closer.
I want to pay tribute to my old childhood friends.
It's hard for me to go to the gym, but I have to.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is now part of my past.
I won't forget, but I'm not sorry.
My life goes on.
I graduated from school this year and attended a medical school in Wladikawkaz.
I'm going to be a heart surgeon.
My first choice was training in the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but my health didn't allow that.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that won't happen.
Georgij Fanijew, 20
The boy who survived, though he was caught at the feet of a murderous terrorist
A miracle: Georgij Fanijew was caught at the feet of a murderous terrorist during the siege, but he managed to survive.
During the siege he was trapped in the sports hall and sat next to the bomb, which was attached to the foot of a murderous terrorist.
It's really a miracle he wasn't killed.
"We feel like it was yesterday," says Georgij, who wanted to go to the FSB as a secret service agent, but could not do so because of his health damage due to the siege.
It's still with me, it's nothing I left behind.
I am now older and people say that children can easily deal with bad experiences - I have to say that is not true.
"2006 I worked with psychologists and felt a little better after that, but I can't forget it.
And I'd like to forget.
2005 - the year after - was the first and only time I went back to the gym.
I lost consciousness.
I will never return there again and please don't ask me to show you where I sat in this famous picture.
Survivor: Georgij Fanijew today, with a photo of himself in the hospital after the siege on the laptop
My pain is tremendous and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know that I don't like to think about it or talk about it and they never asked me about school.
I'm fine physically.
I should be careful with my injured knee, but I can walk well now.
But because of my health, I could not study at the FSB's secret service academy in St. Petersburg as I wanted.
I sent in my records, including the medical ones, and they replied that it was not possible.
My second passion was the animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.
I've been there two years.
He learns the treatment of all animals "from cats to cows".
He said, "I knew that I would never tell my children about my experiences.
Children should not know anything about this, and of course they should not suffer.
His mother Marina, 42, said, "This pain never leaves me.
He's in my soul, worse when the anniversary gets closer.
I will go to the celebrations to commemorate.
I know Georgij won't go.
It's got to be a lot harder for him because he was there and I wasn't.
I was waiting for him at home and couldn't help.
I am so grateful to God that he was returned to me. Here in Beslan all of them are drawn.
It stays in us.
Georgij is an adult now, but this horror is still in him.
It's hard to accept that when something so unfair happens to you.
He's a boy, he likes sports, but he can't participate because of his knee.
He's been operated on several times, he can walk, but he can't play sports.
I'd say he overcame the horror to 50%, but you can never completely overcome it and forget it.
This terrible experience will always follow us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed during the siege and this only increases my pain.
I lost a lot of people I knew well and who were expensive to me.
My son is with me, and this is the greatest gift that God could make me, but my heart cries for the dead.
I know of families where new children were born, but also of widows who have never remarried.
It's hard to accept that life goes on, even if you don't want it.
I will never forget how my heart leaped into me when I saw him in the hospital.
And now I see what's going on in the world - wars in other regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why do they kill each other?
The war is now very close to our country and I can't believe it.
We used to be a friendly country, how could it be that we were fighting now?
People and children suffer, I am sure that many children have already been killed in Ukraine and many are still being killed.
If only we could take all these rebels and throw them out - as far away as possible.
Aljona Chejewa, 10
The baby that was carried so grippingly by a special operation command in safety
Rescued: Aljona Tskayeva is being secured by a Russian Special Forces (left).
She is now ten (right) and does not remember the atrocities at all
The world stopped breathing in 2004 when the baby Aljona was carried in the arms of a Russian policeman from the siege of Beslan.
The terrorists let her go, but in her cruelty kept her 30-year-old mother, the 10-year-old sister Kristina and her brother Makhar in the school sports hall.
Makhar, then three years old, escaped, but Aljona's mother and sister died in the murderous plague.
Her father Ruslan has since remarried and has a little girl with his new wife Svetlana, whom he named after his lost daughter Kristina.
Aljona, today ten years old, does not remember the siege and has grown into an intelligent and happy girl, say neighbors.
"You are now a big happy family and Aljona and Makhar are both great children," says a close friend.
Ruslan is a fantastic father and wants to spare them all the memories that come up with the tenth anniversary.
You'll understand why.
Man accused of crossing girls on pedestrian crossing in Fife
A 78-year-old man is in court because of the crossing of a three-year-old girl on a pedestrian crossing in Fife.
Gordon Steward is accused of having hit a girl on the transition to Pittenween in East Neuk.
The charges indicate that Mr. Steward controlled his Audi Q3 without the necessary care and attention and injured the girl.
Stewart, 78, from Anstruther, disproved the charge in front of the Dundee Sheriff Court.
Sheriff Charles Macnair QC started the procedure for January.
4 Tips for better underwater photos and videos
If you would like to take photos or videos under water, there is a selection of devices.
The cheapest option is a waterproof point and shot, such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action cam like the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both of which are worth about $300.
I took these photos at a family party with several cameras, all available at a price of less than $350.
Regardless of the equipment, there are a few rules for the best results.
Check your equipment twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the battery compartment and other compartments are tightly closed.
Set your camera to the photos or videos you want to record.
Some cameras and camcorders have scene and recording modes that optimise the exposure time for the foggy underwater conditions.
And before you jump in, check to what depth your equipment is working.
Some cameras are only allowed for up to 5 feet, others up to 50 or 60 feet.
Look in our shopping guide and reviews for digital cameras for conventional and waterproof models.
Make multiple shots - because many won't work.
Point-and-Shoot cameras feature an LCD with which you can compose images, action cams usually do not.
Even if you have an LCD, it is difficult to see this underwater, and the right image setting is a lucky thing.
So you make a lot of shots.
If your camera has a rowing mode with which a series of photos with slightly modified exposure settings are taken, use it.
Stay close to the surface.
The light gets dramatically worse the further you get away from the surface.
If possible, stay close to the surface if you take pictures in a pool, lake or sea.
This allows you to add more color to your photos; the deeper you go, the less color you will see.
Go close to the objects.
This is also a good advice on land, but it is all the more important under water because of the bad light conditions.
It is especially important if you are working with an action cam: These devices often have a fixed wide angle lens, which means that you need to get closer to your objects if they are to fill out the entire frame.
Andrew Lawson was a man of the variety whose character changed things, even in such a gigantic organization as the NHS.
As an anesthesiologist, he devoted his career to saving both the agony of the disease and the pains of the treatment.
Among his patients, his wife recalls, was an MI6 employee who had to live with the devastating effects of torture.
Lawson knew that the diagnosis and diseases are important to the doctors, while the patients are mostly concerned with something quite different: pain.
One day in 2007, however, he was the one whose path of suffering began.
"I didn't feel," he wrote in May of this year.
I had trouble picking up.
As he struggled with the flu-like symptoms, he noticed that he was impatiently accusing his wife Juliet.
"I'd rather do everything right away than later," he remarked.
When Juliet was on a business trip for a week, Lawson felt quite unusual and worried for no reason.
Something was in the air.
He asked a colleague to conduct an X-ray of his chest.
Only two weeks ago he had been skiing in the French Alps.
The results of the X-ray were available.
He suffered from mesothelioma, an incurable cancer that attacks the breast skin, that is, the skin that covers the lungs.
As with most cancers, the exact trigger is usually difficult to determine.
While, for example, some smokers suffer from lung cancer, not all lung cancers have been smokers before.
But mesothelioma is different.
In almost all cases, the trigger is an asbestos load - contact with the fiber builder, which was once considered a "miracle" but has now been identified as fatal.
For most of us, mesothelioma is a disease that can easily be ignored.
Asbestos is finally a product of the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos was no longer used in Britain since the 1960s, when industry voluntarily undertook to stop using it.
Even where he was still employed, only people in certain industries worked directly with the fabric - plumber, construction workers, carpenters, and shipyard workers, for example.
As an industrial hazard from another time, it seems to be hardly worrying today.
But this self-satisfaction is inappropriate.
Britain, it seems, is experiencing today the climax of a mesolthelioma epidemic.
There are more deaths from mesothelioma here than in any other country in the world.
With a total of 2,500 deaths per year, twice as many people die from this disease as in road accidents.
Annual figures of mesothelioma deaths since 1980 and expected future deaths in Great Britain
The reason why we are experiencing the deadly effects now, although asbestos has been illegal for years (in 1999 all asbestos types have been banned), is that a mesothelioma develops only after decades.
And the hostages of the Mesothelioma are not limited to former workers in the construction industry.
Asbestos was, and is often still present in the houses where we live, the offices in which we work, the schools in which we learn and the shops in which we shop.
And therefore Mesotheliom knows no class barriers, financial limits, occupations or age.
The privileged bastions, from the elegant department stores in London to private schools, are not a shelter.
Parliament's buildings are contaminated with asbestos.
Even in the hospitals in which we are supposed to become healthy, this deadly carcinogen has already been declared the source of the disease.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He wasn't a plumber either.
In fact, it was difficult for him to imagine where he might have come into contact with asbestos.
Then he found out.
"It looks as if there was a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at Guy's Hospital, where I completed my education for six years," he wrote.
All - students, nurses, doctors and porters - use the tunnels.
One wonders how many of my peers will suffer from the same illness?
Unfortunately, he was able to answer this question at least in part.
"Of the four doctors who were trained at Guy's Hospital and who have suffered from mesothelioma in the last five years," he wrote in a letter in 2010, "I am the last one who is still alive."
How many of us are still sick?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma at the age of 48.
When he died on February 17th this year, he was 55.
This was an unusually long survival period.
Fifty percent of all mesotheliotic patients die within 8 months of diagnosis.
The disease always ends in death.
We can therefore only repeat Lawson's question: "How many of us are still sick?"
The UK's leading expert on Mesothelioma, Professor Julian Peto, assumes that between 1870 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic in the UK is expected to fall, a total of 90,000 of the disease will have been killed.
Most of them have no idea at the moment that they will die that way.

A brief look at the files of the courts, to which the victims often turn for damages claims, shows how far the scourge of the mesothelioma is already spreading.
In June of this year, for example, Marks & Spencer admitted that Janice Allen had been negligently exposed to asbestos.
She worked for the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987 and was responsible for the clothing department at two locations - one of the flagship stores on Oxford Street.
Mrs. Allen was only 18 years old when she started working at M&S.
Now she has two children in her twenties.
"Before this thing," she says, "I had never heard of mesothelioma, I didn't even really know anything about asbestos.
I never thought this would affect me.
There are only a few people who know a lot about asbestos.
The fact is that the term asbestos does not refer to a substance, but to a group of six minerals.
The name comes from the word "Asbestiform", a description of the fiber structure that makes the fabric resistant and flexible.
Three out of six were used in construction.
Chrysotil, also known as white asbestos, is today by far the most common asbestos found in buildings.
It was used for roof plates, floor plates, pipe insulations, boiler insulations, even for brake linings in cars.
It is less lethal than other forms of asbestos, but is nevertheless considered by the EU and the WHO to be "high health risk" with possible death consequences.
However, the brown asbestos (Amosite) and blue asbestos (Crokydolith) are more dangerous.
Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts assume that "there are clear but indirect indications that this was a major reason for the uniquely high mesothelioma rates."
An employee of Marks & Spencer was exposed to Alamy at the Flagshipstore on Oxford Street, London, Asbestos
Janice Allen may not have seen himself as a typical mesothelioma victim, but Julian Peto's work suggests that her story is by no means unusual.
He presented a study of those affected, showing that "a significant proportion of mesothelioma without known suspension was probably caused by asbestos contact in the environment."
Most of these contacts are based on the "normal use and ageing" of our buildings.
It looks like no one can assume to be safe.
A report by Goddard Consulting, who investigated the Palace of Westminster, shows how people in the heart of the government might have been unwittingly exposed to the material.
In 2009, Goddard reported that the service shafts and pipelines behind Parliament's committee rooms were contaminated with asbestos, whose deadly fibers could be swirled up by something as harmless as "strong air movements".
Members of Parliament are often accused of taking care of their own interests, but here it looks as if the opposite is true.
While the Directorate of the Parliamentary Labour Service insisted that the Westminster Palace had received a "pure health certificate", it is now undisputed that £1 billion of work has to be spent over several years to renovate the parliament, modernise the electrical installations and remove asbestos, and that according to the 2015 general elections, MEPs will probably meet in the nearby QE2 conference centre rather than on the green benches in Westminster.
The Goddard report also pointed out that "the presence of asbestos was not handled in accordance with the respective provisions."
No one can know if this mismanagement will cost lives.
All you can do now is wait.
One person who could never accurately determine the contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general practitioner.
Like Andrew Lawson, 50-year-old Abbott suspects that he was exposed to asbestos during his work in hospitals.
"I have worked in a hospital where asbestos complaints have been positively decided," he says, "but I cannot prove it in my case.
It is so difficult to remember all the places where you have worked and the data.
What he remembers is the day at the beginning of December 2009, when he got such a fever.
He was 45 years old, and he had an operation late in the evening.
All of a sudden, I had chills.
It came all of a sudden.
I felt terrible.
I didn't think I could make the trip home.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that the pain from the breast skin, the skin around his lungs, was causing.
But like Janice Allen, he had no reason to suspect a mesothelioma.
He didn't go to work for a month.
Surprised doctors took X-rays of his chest and started pleuracathether to extract fluid from the lungs and test in the laboratory.
However, his complaints remained undiagnosed.
His health slowly improved, and he returned to his workplace.
From time to time, however, the symptoms returned, often after exercise and heavy breathing.
In 2011, a patient had similar symptoms in his practice and was later diagnosed with mesothelioma.
But even now Abbott did not associate this with his own case.
Finally, his patient was several decades older and had worked directly with asbestos.
The connection in the case was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition deteriorated again and his general practitioner brought his CT scans and X-rays to an expert group.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott felt ill for the first time, a probe equipped with a camera was introduced into the cave between the rib and the chest fur.
I'm an optimist.
I usually just keep going," he says.
To tell you the truth, I hadn't been so worried.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of the biopsy was in the week between Christmas and New Year: "They told me it was mesothelioma."
Graham Abbott: Diagnosis Mesothelioma
Suddenly, Abbott had appointments with Macmillan nurses, one of whom recommended him to take a lawyer.
Only now did he understand the extent of the epidemic.
"It turned out that asbestos was very widespread, especially in large public buildings where pipes were often insulated with asbestos," he says.
The people who were exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now ill.
And so Mesotheliom now meets younger people who have not worked in the typical professions.
The most dangerous pipes with asbestos insulation in hospitals were underground, so patients were probably not exposed to the substance.
But many employees who switched from one building to another in pedestrian tunnels (like Andrew Lawson) or in underground canteens (as Graham Abbott often did), were most likely in contact with the toxic substances.
It turns out that over several decades after the war hospitals were potentially life-saving for the patients, but life-threatening for the treating doctors.
He's still being removed today.
Pupils put their Bunsen burners on asbestos mats.
And it's not just about hospitals.
Due to its fabulous insulating and flame-retardant properties, asbestos was often used in offices, shops, libraries and city halls.
Schools, too.
In fact, many people have probably had the first asbestos contact in the classroom.
Throughout the country, in thousands of chemical hours, students have put their Bunsen burners on asbestos carpets.
The topic of asbestos in schools is now frequently addressed on websites.
And so now innocent objects in our houses as floorboards or shed roofs have by default contained asbestos.
"It is an industrial poison that is contained in much of our real estate," says Andrew Morgan, the lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his trial against Guy's Hospital.
In one case, the only contact that involved a woman affected was the demolition of a garden shed in the 1970s.
So be careful how to rip off your garden shed.
The effects of diagnosis, and the knowledge that the disease is incurable, are immense.
"It takes a while to process that," says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to keep going, but I realized that I couldn't concentrate on what I was doing.
I was in practice for two weeks.
Then I knew I had to go and take care of myself.
Well, I'm not going to have another Christmas.
With the greatest difficulty was the change of perspective from the position of a doctor to that of a patient.
How countless patients before him he remembers how overwhelmed he was by all the information he had to deal with.
"It was very difficult to record all of this," he says.
"I asked my doctor, "How long do I have?"
And they gave me about 12 months.
I remember thinking, "Well, I won't have another Christmas.
That's it."
Mesothelioma is particularly insidious because it is our survival mechanism - the breathing itself - that causes the deadly cancer.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by asbestos contact.
Asbestos consists of the smallest fibers.
If the asbestos is swirled up and the fibers are inhaled, they can be trapped in the breast skin, the skin around the lungs.
Asbestos fibers irritate the breast skin and can trigger cell mutations.
"The problem arises with the inhaled needle-shaped asbestos fibers," says Professor Tom Treasure, a heart-thorax doctor who switched to Guy's Hospital in 2001.
Exactly the hospital that Andrew Lawson suspects has exposed him to asbestos is now ironically a leading center in the treatment of mesothelioma.
Treasure knew Lawson and treated some others who were probably also exposed to asbestos during their training in the hospital.
Once the asbestos needles reach the lung tissue, says Treasure, "they are pushed by the process of breathing to the edge where the skin is.
From nature it is invasive from the beginning.
The usual options in other cancers do not work so well in mesothelioma.
For example, the effectiveness of an operation is highly controversial.
Some people think she's worth a try.
Treasure denies that.
"You can't cut the chest skin out," he says.
They don't come around with the knife.
Meanwhile, the cancer "does not speak very well to chemotherapy," which "shows effect", but does not heal.
"Sometimes there are long-term survivors," says Treasure.
But in the end, they all die.
Fortunately, some patients actually live long, much longer than expected.
The author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after the diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott still fights.
After contacting Mesothelioma, Abbott came into contact with Andrew Lawson, who four years after his diagnosis had become a one-man support and consulting office for co-workers.
"Hello, Cancer Center," he happily introduced himself when he called.
"He was very positive," said Abbott.
He had received his diagnosis 4 years earlier and was still very active.
Originally, Abbott had been offered six chemotherapy cycles that would last for four months and probably extend his life for only one month.
"I was desperate," he says.
I wanted to give up.
Lawson managed, however, "to make things appear in a slightly more positive light."
After consulting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski, heart-thorax specialist at Guy's.
"We had an advantage because I didn't have to be expelled, I just called and got an appointment," Graham admits.
A normal patient would need to receive a transfer and wait for the approval of the treatment.
Money is crucial for mesothelioma patients to be able to perform the best available therapies.
But if these treatments fail inevitably, many people are affected by another financial concern - about the future of the families they leave behind.
And so they turn to the courts in the hope of compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan from Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"It has been known since 1898 that asbestos is extremely dangerous to health," says Morgan.
But what changed in the 1960s was that one realized that a very low burden was also a health risk.
And here the negligentness of the companies began to play a role.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital finally added their case, but it wasn't what Morgan calls a "full compensation" because Lawson couldn't prove with absolute certainty that his mesothelioma was due to an asbestos contact at Guy's.
After the investigation into his death, however, a spokesman for the Guy confirmed that "the asbestos fibres in the affected basement area were removed in the 1990s."
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How asbestos can be removed
In fact, it is a huge problem for mesothelioma sufferers who are trying to compensate, to assign the deadly contact with asbestos to a company or a workplace - usually decades after the incidents.
Many of their former employers have been sold or closed.
Insurance documents can be lost.
And those who resist claims know that the time is for them, but certainly not with the plaintiffs.
In response to this year, there were clear new legislation that makes it easier for mesothelioma victims to file a claim for compensation, even if their former employers are no longer to be found.
The law has set up a £350 million fund supported by the insurance industry for all those diagnosed after July 2012 to establish a contact, but no one can sue.
In these cases, the plaintiffs receive 80 percent of what a court could have said to them in a normal damages trial - about £120,000.
Approximately 300 successful applications for the programme are expected each year.
Andrew Morgan, like so many mesothelioma sufferers, thinks that £350 million was a "very good job" in the insurance industry.
"This is a deal of insurers for insurers," he says, suggesting that this sum is a quarter of what insurers would have had to pay if time had not gone over it and Mesothelioma patients found the companies and could sue them normally.
Mike Penning, then Minister of Labour and Pensions, also admitted that the law was "not perfect".
However, both Penning and Morgan admitted that in the face of seven deaths a quick action was needed every day.
"People suffer so much and need help today," Penning said during the second hearing of the Mesotheliom Act last December.
At that time Graham Abbott had been in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After her first deliberations, Lang-Lazdunski recommended an operation which he expected to have a positive effect in contrast to Tom Treasure.
This was accompanied by radiation therapy and chemotherapy - a triple therapy with which Lang-Lazdunski can present a survival rate of up to 40 percent over five years.
Abbott felt strengthened.
"This is of course the most important thing," says Abbott.
You can see that again and again in patients.
There's something that'll keep you going.
If you give up, you'll get worse very quickly.
Graham Abbott underwent the operation in March 2012.
At the end of August he had the last of the six chemotherapy cycles behind him.
After-care scans showed no signs of disease.
Then I had a scan in March 2014.
There were several cancer stains around my chest.
I just turned 50.
That's not life-threatening.
That's life-threatening.
Abbott once again underwent six chemotherapy cycles.
Now no trace of the tumors is visible.
But the process is physically and psychologically very strenuous.
You have to think about practical things - about the money when I'm not anymore, for example, or my wife shows how the boiler time adjustment works.
If you get bad news, you'll be negative.
You have to look forward.
As father of Ellie, 16, and Tamsin, 14, this is not always easy.
"It's hard for parents," he says.
It's hard to know what to say and how much.
When I got my first diagnosis, I told my girl that I had a disease that I wouldn't get old with.
They reacted quite differently.
Tamsin is very cozy and unscrupulous.
She told her friends and we soon got a lot of calls.
Ellie was more reserved.
She didn't say much.
Such conversations are something that all cancer patients have to go through.
But for mesotheliomists, such conversations have not gone through with hope, not with a trace of hope for survival.
The disease (as well as finally for Stephen Jay Gould) brings a fierce security.
As Andrew Morgan says, "Mesothelioma is not life threatening.

China denies Hong Kong right to government election, demonstrators swear retaliation
On Sunday, despite the increased calls for democratic reforms, the Chinese Parliament decided against the nomination of candidates for the 2017 elections by the Hong Kong electorate.
This action is likely to fuel the long-announced protests in Hong Kong's business district, while activists are leading the planning and mobilization process within a few hours of the announcement.
The decision of the Chinese People's Congress allows the Communist leaders in principle to reject all non-peking candidates.
"This is not unexpected, but it makes us angry," said legal expert Emily Lau, chairman of the Democratic Party.
That's not what Beijing promised.
The people of Hong Kong were lied to.
And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.
In his defense of the Chinese decision, Li Fei, Deputy Secretary General of the Permanent Committee of the National People's Congress, said that the admission of public nominations to the elections for the Hong Kong government would be "chaotic".
Since 1997, when the UK gave back control of Hong Kong to the Chinese, Beijing has promised to have the residents elected the government presidency from 2017.
The Chinese leadership presented the Sunday decision as a democratic breakthrough, because there is a direct right to vote for the Hong Kong citizens, but the decision also makes it clear that the Chinese leadership is firmly in control of the process by a closely controlled nomination committee.
After a new clause, only candidates should be admitted "with love for the country and love for Hong Kong".
The decision follows a summer in which some of the largest and most public protests in Hong Kong have been taking place for several years.
Behind the pro-democratic campaign in Hong Kong is the movement Occupy Central With Love and Peace, whose organizers have threatened to close down the financial district if Beijing does not allow a genuine universal right to vote.
On Sunday evening, within hours of the announcement, hundreds of Occupy-Central supporters gathered in the rain in front of the government headquarters in Hong Kong.
During the demonstration, the organizers said that their movement had reached a new level of civil disobedience and they were planning protest waves in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide any details, apparently in order to avoid problems with the authorities.
In an online announcement, the organizers announced that the movement "considered the occupation of the central district only as a last resort, an action that should only take place if all the dialogue opportunities are exhausted and there is no other choice.
We are sorry to have to say that today all the dialogue opportunities have been exhausted and the occupation of the Central District will definitely take place.
The authorities in Hong Kong have been preparing for Beijing's announcement for days, and on Sunday, in front of the government building, there were intensified security measures including police forces and barricades.
The unrest is heightened by the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they are slowly losing control of their city.
The attraction of people from the mainland strengthens competition for products and services.
In addition, fear is growing that Hong Kong's values such as democracy and freedom of speech are beginning to crumble under the growing pressure of Beijing.
Some criticised the demonstrations of the Occupy Central movement as it jeopardized the business - Hong Kong's life-blood.
"The protests they are talking about could cause great economic damage depending on how many are involved and how long they last," said legal expert Regine Ip, who has long criticized the movement.
We do not want to fret about Hong Kong being out of control.
This impression is bad for investment.
China's state-controlled media also recently reported on the democracy activists in Hong Kong as subversive agents controlled by Western powers.
This summer activists organized an unofficial referendum on the electoral rights in which 780,000 people participated - more than one fifth of the voters in Hong Kong.
Tens of thousands participated in one of the largest demonstrations of democracy in the region's history in July.
The tradition of the school graduation balls in the USA is now being transferred to the universities where Freshmen shows with the private aircraft are offered.
We are pleased to be able to respond to this demand and to offer the UK's first luxurious travel service for students today.
The company also offers transport options such as private aircraft, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Marten and McLaren P1 in order to achieve a particularly impressive presence at the university.
Mr. Stewart also stated that the service had a security section.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who would otherwise have to cuddle their belongings through the country in a dangerously overcharged car.
Together with our new VIF options, we are looking forward this year to ensuring that students reach the university with a minimum of effort and a maximum of luxury.
One company spokesperson said that there were no new bookings yet, as the service had just been introduced, however, added that "students would book the service in the next few weeks".
The company also announced that despite the tuition fees of £9,000 a year, it expected a market for this offer.
Students today are very different in their expectations and demands from students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago - it is more important than ever to make a great first impression, and with VIF you can do just that.
However, the National Student Union criticised the service as being waived.
Megan Dunn, Vice President of the NUS for Higher Education said: "This offer seems completely separate from the lives of the majority of students.
Many students who start their studies this month are facing a crisis of cost of living, as the available grants in the form of loans and scholarships do not keep up with the rapidly rising bills for the simplest basis of life before they can even think of spending thousands of pounds for something as simple as arriving at the student residence.
Feminists criticize racial question and police behavior after Ferguson
The unarmed teenager was killed at the beginning of this month by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo.
The participants raised their hands to the air and sang, "Hands up, don't shoot," while waiting for the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Mo, because of the shooting of unarmed teenager Michael Brown, the blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a change in the online discussions of white feminists.
According to their experience, white feminist commentators put the sex ahead of the race when it comes to addressing reproductive rights and income inequalities.
However, while the tensions in the Middle West rose and received attention throughout the country, Perez saw that the responses of white women turned 100% around the race.
Compared to the answers of black women shortly after the shootings of August 9, the personal essays with titles such as "Thinks about Ferguson of a White Woman" and "feminism is not only about the suppression of women" came relatively late.
But for Perez this meant an important change.
"I don't think that in feminism you find many people who are white and speak privileges in such a high-class way," she said.
People felt compelled to express something about the incidents.
It is characteristic of the crisis in which we are in and because the situation in Ferguson is so ethnic that they have to express it.
For English professor Koritha Mitchell of Ohio State University, Ferguson revealed problems that black Americans are exposed to every day, but that are not considered "women's issues" in cultural space.
"I can publish something funny on Facebook about myself and my partner and get 150 likes from anywhere," said Mitchell.
When I post something about how colored people in their own country are under siege, silence is deafening.
"How can it be safe for women to talk publicly about a relationship, but not about security in public space?" she asked.
For black women like Mitchell, who have studied race, sex and sexuality in the history of the United States, there is no dichotomy between racial and gender problems.
For them, black women have not had the luxury to separate the topics cleanly; they live every day in the combined reality.
While white women now link the issues of race and sex in the feminist mainstream circles, Angela Hattery, Professor of Women and Gender Research at George Mason University, says that their predecessors did the opposite.
"Between 1865 and 1890 at least 10,000 black men were lynched and the reason was almost always the rape of a white woman," said Hattery.
White women had to be involved in history to justify the Lynch murder.
For Hattery, the division between white and black women came to the point where white fighters for women's voting rights like Susan B. Anthony analyzed the country in the late years of the 19th century and found that the struggle for the right to vote could be successful only for one group: women or blacks.
"They made the decision to stand for women's right to vote, and the right to vote for blacks should come later," said Hattery.
When one remembers such things, one becomes aware with power why colored women do not trust white women.
We didn't do our job well.
We never helped black women to protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women were given the right to vote in 1920, it took another decade for white women to organize themselves against the lynching in the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group was formed almost 40 years after the original request for help from black women, says Mitchell.
For Mitchell, the flood of white feminist reactions to the questions raised by Ferguson - police behaviour, racial discrimination - is a mirror of the time when white feminists played "captures" with the problems that black women have been dealing with for generations.
"Wouldn't it be great if the activists who have such traditional feminist platforms took the right to raise a child as seriously as they do with the right to contraception?" Mitchell asked.
Feminists of the second generation, who built their careers on the struggle for reproductive rights and access to contraceptives, are now trying to understand what this means.
The famous white feminist activist Gloria Steinem went two weeks after the shooting of Michael Brown on Facebook and published a pointed article by Rebecca Carroll, columnist of the Guardian, in which she demands more protests from white Americans on the subject of racism.
"I hope that women who have a different but parallel reason for understanding a danger inherent in the body - and opinions about the race that are significantly different in public surveys - will lead to the changes," wrote Steinem.
Although Steinem stands for a rather intersectional feminism in which racial as well as gender themes are addressed, some of her comments on the racial theme in America are still amazing.
Christina Sommers, researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of "Who Stole Feminism?" said to She The People that young men in the United States, especially young colored men, "are far more vulnerable than their sisters," but Steinem's remarks about Ferguson are in contrast to their earlier criticism.
There are now hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
But when the White House recently imposed a small program, My Brother's Keeper, to help vulnerable young black and Hispanic men, there were annoying reactions from many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
The police's relationship with the black community is not the only problem that is pressing into the foreground of mainstream feminism.
After the U.S. border police picked up almost 63,000 unaccompanied minors at the south-west border of the country this year, the topic of immigration reform also comes back to the surface - this time as a women's topic.
Andrea Mercado, co-chairman of We Belong Together, an organisation that mobilises women for immigration reform, said that for a review of the topic as an essential topic of women, they should only publish the stories of immigrant women.
"These speak for themselves," said Mercado.
When the vast majority of work visas go to male immigrants, the women they accompany are in a position where they are susceptible to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories find a reverberation in women's organizations," she said.
"Swine house" in Ipswich is for sale
The picture of a house for sale was removed by real estate agents when it became clear that it showed a large pig who had made it comfortable in the living room.
The detached house has a bedroom, is located on a private street in Ipswich and is offered for 120,000 pounds.
One of the details was a picture of the living room of the house - one of which was also a pig who had been sleeping on a sofa.
Real estate agent Connells said the pig in the photo was the owner's pet.
"The photo, however, was mispublished and has now been removed," said a spokeswoman of the company.
In the exposé of the house, Connells described the former Assembly House as a "unique single-family house with one bedroom."
Although the broker has removed the image from the website, it still appears on advertising material.
Domestic sales were of interest in the social media when some asked if the pig was included in the purchase price.
After winning the lottery, the SW City of Harvey is home to a new millionaire
A lottery player from Harvey is on this month.
The search for a new millionaire in the southwest of Perth continues with a lucky winner who gets almost $1.1 million from the lottery draw on Saturday.
A newspaper kiosk in Harvey moved the jackpot in the drawing of the first division for the second time in five years, after $1 million in November 2009.
However, the lucky winner still has to report.
The store owner Steve Forward said that the profit ensures conversational material in the small town in the southwest of Perth.
The city's talking about nothing else, and everybody's pretty excited.
We thought that such a profit could be made.
Eight WA winners have celebrated winnings in the first division last month, a satisfactory final for a few happy weeks for the players in the state.
Last week a player from Canning Vale became one of the five millionaires in August, after a couple from Belmont had only a few weeks before scored the mega-win of $7.5 million.
The winning couple had been playing for twenty years and said that the win allowed them the possibility of a world trip and the purchase of a new house.
The millionaire from Harvey is the 59th winner of the first division in the WA this year, with a total of almost $85 million.
Leonidas bathed in the Gladiator arena
Not only the gladiators were knee-deep in the mud at the first Römertag in the leisure park.
But the appeal of the event was strong enough to attract well over 1,000 visitors yesterday, who defied the rain showers and the autumn cold and were completely thrilled by the historical spectacle.
There was a colorful array of performances, performances, games, exhibits and information about the time of the Romans and their importance for the Rhineland.
The main attraction of the day was undoubtedly the martial combat force of the Gladiator School "Amor Mortis", which used every rain break to demonstrate their robust martial art in the soft sand-prepared arena.
Gladiator owners "Leonidas" proved to be a humorous and expert performer and sent his men in the ring successively to a heroic two-way struggle in various gladiatorial genres.
First the "provocators" were on the row with rectangle shield and short sword as well as leg rail on the left leg and arm rail on the right arm.
It was followed by the "Essedarii" with breastplate, short sword and wreath flange as well as iron gladiator helmet, leg and arm protection.
The appearance of the "Retiarius" was particularly impressive, which came against the "Secutor" with nets of litter, tridents and daggers and after a short fight hit the boys to the ground.
Because the swords were metallically powerful against each other, the shields were created and the worms were flying surreptitiously through the arena that a fear and fear could become due to the health of the gladiators.
However, the imposing "Summa Rudis", the muscular referee, had an ever-aware eye.
"We wanted to revive the Roman daily life and make the culture of the Roman times more vivid," explained Lorenz Euskirchen, chairman of the organizer "Friendly Roman Canal", the intention behind the spectacle.
After two years of preparation, an Oppidum Romanum, a Roman city, was created from the amusement park for one day, as Vice Mayor Claus Wehage said in his greeting.
Finally, the Romans brought not only war and conquest in our region, but also the Roman culture and numerous buildings that we still admire today.
Remains of this were also to be admired at the Roman Day, for example "Aquädukt-Marmor" from the eleven-meter high and 1400-metre-long Roman Channel bridge, which was once standing at Lüftelberg.
The Frontinus Society faced water and energy supply once and now, and Managing Director Petra Fricke knew: "We still benefit from the knowledge of that time."
This is also confirmed by the diploma surveying engineer Ralph Heiliger of the "Ingenieurteam Zwei" from Rheinbach, who presented Roman instruments of measurement such as chorobat, groma or dioptra.
The Roman villa in Blankenheim presented sketches and models of the excavations anno 1894 as well as bricks from the original hypocaust, the warm air heating that once warmed the Roman villa.
Also impressive are the footprints left by Wolf and Fuchs in the footsteps of clay two millennia ago, before they were burned.
In 2011, the Landesverband Rheinland had excavated the remains of a Roman villa in the commercial park Nord in Rheinbach.
They found walls of an economic building with a darre for drying cereals and for malting.
The building probably belonged to a Villa Rustica, an agricultural property, explained the archaeologist Dr. Jennifer Morscheiser.
A number of finds from these excavations presented them in a glass vitrine, including a large plate, several fine glass jars and parts of a delicate necklace.
The villa probably existed from the first to the fourth century after Christ, until the invasion of the Germans in the then Roman Rhineland, probably Morscheiser.
In addition, the children dealt with the Roman windmill game, similar to today's mill game, or they wrote their names with metal handles on waxboards, as did the Roman disciples.
At the stand of the Römerthermen Zülpich the children were allowed to lay mosaics themselves, at the stand of the glass museum Rheinbach to make glass mosaics and at the stand of the nature centre Eifel Nettersheim to use a heavy wheat mill made of stone to grind the flour for a flat bread or a muesli.
With the original Roman coach that was faithfully copied by two cold flowers, the visitors drove through the leisure park and also passed the impressive state of the city gymnasium, which presented the results of their "Roman Project Weeks".
With a Roman week from 13 to 21 September, the municipality of Wachtberg will also contribute to the Roman Year 2014 that is proclaimed throughout the Rhine, to commemorate the death of Emperor Augustus 2000 years ago.
Together with the Home and History Associations as well as the Wachtberger Wander-Verein, the Partneringsverein and the Laienspielkreis Oberbachem will be offered thematic hikes, a lecture, a cooking evening and guided tours for school classes and the Roman past of Wachtberg.
For example, a Roman Legionnaire is told of his work on the nearby Wachtberg, presenting plants as living monuments of the Roman era and offering a funny lesson in the understanding of peoples between a group of "Germans" and attracted Romans.
The Adendorf Elementary School is dedicated to the Roman theme during a project week.
With the Roman week, the numerous traces of the Romans in Wachtberg, which are often visible at first glance, are to be re-examined.
In the Wachtberger Town Hall, a small presentation will be made at the founding of the Berkumer Matron Shrine in 1879.
Ebola: The Epidemic Burdens West Africa’s Economy
The Ebola epidemic in West Africa is also a major blow to the economy.
Markets are orphaned - and international companies go at a distance.
The devastating Ebola epidemic is a major blow to the West African economy.
The harvest rots on the fields, the mines are abandoned and the markets are lost - the virus has added the region hard.
Some international companies are also already at a distance.
"The Ebola epidemic is not only a medical crisis but also an economic one," says Donald Kaberuka, head of the African Development Bank.
Liberia is most affected
"It's a total disaster, we lose a lot of money," says Alhaji Bamogo, who sells clothes on the second largest market in Liberia's capital Monrovia.
The market only comes up who wants to buy food or something for disinfection against Ebola.
Liberia is the hardest hit by the virus, here alone more than 600 people have fallen victim to the fever.
Recently, the health authorities stated that the disease had progressed in every corner of the country.
The virus has also spread in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria.
In total, more than 1500 people died, thousands more were in contact.
Foreign companies withdraw employees
All over the resource-rich countries, companies are decommissioning their operations.
Foreign companies such as the Arcelor Mittal steel group are withdrawing their employees and several international airlines are no longer flying on the affected regions.
The local merchants and farmers also react: Only a few merchants still leave their homes to get relief.
In some areas of Sierra Leone and Liberia, which are quarantined, the most important cocoa and coffee beans in the fields are rotting.
Farmers do not dare to leave their homes for the harvest.
Food is scarce
"People will travel less and less," says Phillipe De Vreyer, Parisian expert for West Africa's economy.
The man, for example, who normally goes to the market and sells his vegetables, prefers to stay at home.
The population is therefore experiencing the consequences of the epidemic directly and urgently: food is becoming scarce.
On the markets, stocks of basic foods such as rice are disappearing.
At the same time, the region heavily dependent on international companies is at risk of image damage - with far-reaching consequences.
The greatest danger is that international companies will in principle avoid the area for a long time, says Philippe Hugon from French think tank Iris.
It is crucial how far and how long the virus will continue to spread.
Investors could get the impression that "it is dangerous to live in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia and therefore to invest too," warns Hugon.
The disease is also affecting the state budgets of the states
The disease is also affecting the state budgets of the countries concerned.
Moody's credit rating agency fears that their budgets will be severely weakened by the high expenditure on the health system and in addition by the deteriorating economy.
The African Development Bank already promised to help the health systems of the countries concerned with 60 million dollars (45 million euros).
The effects are also detectable in Nigeria, where so far only a few Ebola cases have been diagnosed.
Although the oil-rich region in the southern Niger delta has not yet been affected.
But elsewhere, many people are already left at home for fear of infection.
Reservations in hotels are also significantly reduced.
Protectors celebrate their 50th anniversary
The Schützenverein "Tannenwald" Berngau celebrates its 50th anniversary from 12 to 14 September.
On high tours at the Schützenverein Tannenwald the preparations for the 50-year foundation festival run from 12 to 14 September.
It is planned on Friday, September 12, a big entertainment evening with the group "Dorfrocker".
On Saturday is the big shooting of bulls at 6 p.m.
Then, in the big party tent, the mood evening is with the "Stoapälzer Spitzbuam".
Blaskapelle takes care of the music
Highlights on Sunday are the festivities service and 9.30 a.m. in the parish church and the large festivities at 2 p.m.
In the afternoon is also the price distribution of German and Gau shooting.
A particularly beautiful sight will be the 25 women with their girls.
The party chapel is the Blaskapelle Berngau.
The patronage has taken over Mayor Wolfgang Wild and State Secretary Albert Füracker.
The original name "Schützengesellschaft Tannenwald Berngau" dates back to 1907, when the association was founded on 21 March for "social entertainment by practice in room and small calibre shooting".
In 1937, the Nazi regime led to the dissolution of the club.
Only in 1964 did 19 young men find themselves again, who on April 30 at the Gasthaus Lukas lifted the "new" Schützenverein "Tannenwald" Berngau from baptism.
Karl March and Adolf Ried led the club as a shooter through a difficult start-up period in which it was primarily about finding a club site and installing the shooting company.
Already in the autumn of 1965 the Schützenverein started in the inn "Leniener" with two teams in the round competitions.
In the following years, the sportsmen, who were now organized into seven teams, established themselves in all classes up to the 1st Gauliga.
The club records purpelled every year and the magical border of 380 rings was reached for the first time in 1980 by Rudi Meier.
Just as the performance of the active shooters has increased, so have the members.
After the club's locality "Leniener" has no longer satisfied the demands of a modern gun club, the then board of directors, led by Johann Rinn, decided to create a future home in the basement rooms of the new "Landgasthof Härteis".
After 2700 hours of work, on 8 May 1988 Father Strasser gave the ecclesial blessing for the new shelters.
One of the great highlights in the history of the club was surely the 44th Gaussy, associated with the solemn consecration of the new gun flag in July 1991.
On 23 and 24 April 1994, the Schützenverein celebrated its 30th anniversary.
A Böllergruppe has been established in 1995.
Josef Schmalzl was appointed Böllerreferent.
A major challenge for the "Böllerer" and for the association as a whole was the orientation of the Bayerische Böllermein 2005.
In many hours of volunteer work, the club members modernised the rooms and the shooting facility in the Berngauer Hof last year and thus brought them to the latest state of the art.
Eleven teams in round competitions
The sporting achievements of the Schutzenverein can also be seen.
A total of eleven teams currently compete in the rounds: six air gun teams, one air gun team, one sport pistol KK1, one youth and two AH teams.
The 1st team with Lars Ellrich, Katharina Ellrich, Steffi Grad and Kerstin Kellermann went up to the district league 1 in the 2013/14 round of the Gauoberliga (highest league in the Schützengau ANB).
The 2nd team with Verena Moosburger Alexandra Meier, Eva Schuhmann and Tobias Graml went from the Gauliga North to the Gauoberliga.
In addition to shooting, events such as bocksticks, carnival and royal ball, club excursion and Christmas celebration have tradition.
With it the shooters are also at the festivals in parish and community.
Tony Stewart suffers an accident when returning to the race track
Tony Stewart's return to the racetrack ended about halfway through his race on the Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart went against the wall for the second time after his right front tire broke into round 172 and ended his evening.
Stewart drove his damaged car into the garage and left without talking to journalists.
His team leader Chad Johnston said his 14-member team was disappointed, but now concentrate on the race next weekend in Richmond, Virginia.
"I wish we had a better commitment and a better result for him," said Johnston.
We'll go to Richmond and hope we can do better there.
Stewart used to race on Sunday evening after a collision with Kyle Busch into a wall and had to have the right side of his car repaired.
"I went in today with quite good hopes for a good result," said Johnston, adding, "It just didn't work out."
Not long after the second accident, Stewart's car was loaded into the tow truck and the team had packed and was ready for departure.
Stewart dropped three NASCAR Sprint Cup races after his car hit and killed another driver at an ashtray race in the north of the state of New York.
He decided to return this week and win either in Atlanta or at the next race in Richmond to win a place in the persecution.
He returned to his workplace during an investigation into the tragic incident that led to the death of 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., who had stepped on the road during a race to confront Stewart.
The authorities informed on Friday that investigations into the cause of the accident will continue for at least two weeks.
No decision has yet been made as to whether Stewart should expect an indictment.
The three-time champion was welcomed with great applause when he was presented before the race.
After a start at 12th position, Stewart was already in the first 10 advances shortly afterwards and was temporarily in fourth place.
After a restart in round 122, bush fell
Cars with no. 18 out of control after the exit from curve 2 and collided with Stewart, with both cars going against the wall.
Stewart went on, but fell back to 21nd place.
Looking for a Younger for Dance
Simply try out: Laura, Lena, Lisa, Marie, Bettina, Emma and director Lisa Neitzel (from the left) look forward to fellow fighters.
Like many other clubs, the jazz groups on TV Jahn are making the whole day teaching at the secondary schools.
After the summer holidays, some groups have become strongly decimated.
Now more young people are looking for a sport that is healthy and great fun.
In the two jazz and modern dance groups of Lisa Neitzel, former dancer in the Jazz and Modern Dance Formation "Spirits", there are only nine children.
"Three in the group of eight- to twelve-year-olds, six in the group of twelve- to fifteen-year-olds," says the 20-year-old.
With more active people, the whole thing would be much more fun, "you could dance different choreographies," she says.
If you want to dance, on Thursdays between 5am and 6pm or Fridays between 5pm and 6.30pm in the dance sports room at the former Hotel Meyer, Freistraße 9, you can get into the training session without obligation.
"Training starts regularly with a warm-up program," says the trainer.
After that, different choreographies are practiced.
JazzDance has the feature that there is no fixed form and is therefore open to many styles.
Elements from folklore to classics to sports and acrobatics are processed in Jazz Dance.
Of course, the company is not too short.
"We're also going to eat, watch dance movies and we've also stayed in the dance room once," says Lisa Neitzel.
In the group you can make friendships, share a beautiful hobby and do a lot for your own motor development.
To whom jazz dance is not like that, it can also snap into one of the other offers of TV Jahn.
Children and young people can always get involved in the lessons in the fields of dance/jazz dance, Bambini ballet, video clip dancing and hip-hop in the class.
The dance trainer is Francisco Afonso.
Adult couples are welcome to dance evenings on Monday and Wednesday.
Anyone who likes Discofox, Slow Rollers, Wiener Walzer, Rumba, Cha-Cha-Cha and Tango is allowed to look past and join.
Bulgarian prison guards protest nationwide
Hundreds of prison staff from all over Bulgaria have organised a nationwide protest in front of the Ministry of Justice in the capital Sofia.
In the peaceful demonstration they repeated their demands for the restoration of their old working conditions, which have recently been changed.
Higher salaries are also on a list of demands to be discussed with the Minister of Interior Hristo Ivanov.
Officials have been symbolically protesting against the new working hours for a month and are calling for a return to the former 24-hour shifts.
Despite the meetings between the union of prison staff and representatives of the Ministry of Justice, no agreement was reached, reported the Bulgarian National Ratio (BNR).
The negotiations will continue, the Director-General for the implementation of sanctions, Rosen Zhelyazkov of the BNR.
The protest of the prison staff is expected to be supported by members of the union Association of employees of the Ministry of the Interior.
Ukrainian army has given up Luhansk airport
In eastern Ukraine, the pro-Russian fighters continue to advance.
After heavy fighting, in which Russian tanks were allegedly also involved, the Ukrainian army today, Monday, gave up the airport of the Rebellenhochburg Luhansk.
The army also announced that seven soldiers had been killed in the past 24 hours.
The Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko had already drawn humane consequences from the severe defeats of his army in the fight against the separatists and announced changes in the top military leadership without mentioning details.
Pro-Russian separatists shot down aircraft
In the fight against Ukrainian government troops, pro-Russian separatists once again shot down a fighter aircraft and two military helicopters.
In addition, around 100 soldiers were injured or killed in battles in the Donetsk region, according to the insurgents, Russian agencies announced on Monday.
Coast Guard vessels submerged
The insurgents also claimed to have sunk two boats of the Ukrainian Coast Guard for the first time in the Asowian Sea.
The Ukrainian border guard confirmed that two of his ships were under fire on Sunday near the port city of Mariupol.
Seven border guards had been injured, a spokesman in Kiev told sender 112.ua.
Two crew members were considered missing.
Local media made Russia responsible for the incident.
The separatists also reported that several towns in the Donetsk area were under their control.
Diplomatic offensive in Minsk
Today, the Ukraine Contact Group meets in the Belarusian capital Minsk.
In addition to representatives of Ukraine, Russia and the OSCE, an envoy of the separatists from eastern Ukraine should also participate.
In the run-up to this event, all stakeholders used their appearances to publicise their claim.
NATO does not want to break agreements with Russia
NATO will not break its agreement with Russia due to the planned deployments in Eastern Europe as a result of the Ukraine crisis.
NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said on Monday in Brussels that NATO adhered to the founding agreement of the 1997 NATO Russia Council.
The NATO chief, however, accused Russia of "a severe breach" of the agreement.
"Today we have to face reality that Russia does not regard NATO as a partner," says Rasmussen.
From documents and statements from the Russian side, it emerges that "they regard us as opponents".
Stronger NATO presence
Rasmussen has also announced its intention to strengthen the NATO presence in Eastern Europe.
A "Readiness Action Plan" to be decided at the NATO summit in Wales will ensure that "we will have more visible NATO presence in the East as long as this is necessary," said Rasmussen on Monday in Brussels.
Kiev and Moscow agree on new gas talks
Russia and Ukraine have officially agreed on new talks to settle their gas dispute.
The negotiations were scheduled for next Saturday, said Russian energy minister Alexander Nowak on Monday.
A decision by the European Union was still being taken to see if it would also send a representative to the talks.
Because of the dispute over the gas price, Ukraine has not been getting fuel from Russia for weeks.
Last but not least, EU Energy Commissioner Günther Oettinger had mediated between both sides.
Ukraine had warned that Russia could also interrupt the gas supply for Europe.
Europe draws around one third of its natural gas from Russian sources, much of which flows through Ukraine.
Merkel speaks word of power: Toll will come "all right"
Now the chancellor confesses clearly.
But it's not a free letter for all the complicated details.
The CSU has been appalled by persistent concerns from the CDU about the car toll.
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel spoke a word of power for the introduction of a car toll after persistent resistance from her CDU.
"To put it quite clearly, it is in the coalition treaty and it will come," said the party leader on Monday after meetings of the CDU top committees in Berlin.
But Merkel didn't decide on a detailed model for the moment.
The black and red government program called "certain parameters".
Federal Minister for Transport Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) has made a "proposal and is now being further worked on".
The NRW-CDU, however, insists on its no on a toll on all roads.
Merkel stressed that Minister of Finance Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) also contributed constructively to the deliberations for a draft law.
In addition to the issue, he spoke with Dobrindt about further ways to activate more private capital for investment in infrastructure, for example in broadband expansion.
"There's nothing special about it." Schäuble had left a "mirror" report uncommented on Sunday, his house is testing its own concept to reward highway investors with toll revenues - after the 2017 election.
CSU Chief Horst Seehofer then warned against developing toll concepts against the leading minister in the cabinet.
CDU-Bundesvisze Armin Laschet confirmed his objections.
"The coalition agreement never expected to rob all the district and federal roads," said the North Rhine-Westphalian CDU country president.
In this respect, it was an important signal that Seehofer had now announced to talk again about the subject.
Resistance to the plans also comes from the CDU-Landesverband Baden-Württemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate.
The background is fears that a toll will affect the small border traffic to neighbouring countries.
Seehofer had demanded coalition fidelity because of the toll criticism.
The left sees the plans as a failure in the face of the dispute in the Union.
"The Murks toll is dead," said party leader Bernd Riexinger of the "New Osnabrücker Zeitung" (Monday).
"The Minister fails with the toll." Dobrindt wants to introduce a duty to vignette on all German roads, which will start in 2016.
Domestic car owners, however, are not allowed to be charged in addition under the coalition agreement.
Therefore, they are to receive full compensation for the toll via the car tax.
However, the model must not prejudice foreign drivers because of their nationality under EU law.
Genetic disorder often misdiagnosed
A British woman says that she thought she would die as a result of a misdiagnosis over many years.
Karin Rodgers lived almost all her youth in the belief that she had only a few years to live after being diagnosed with another disease.
She actually suffered from the Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) - a group of inherited disorders that damage the nerves outside the brain and spinal cord.
Charity CMT UK reported that misdiagnosis is a common problem in people with CMT because so little is known about this disease.
Some 23,000 people in the UK are likely to suffer from CMT, which can lead to motor disorders such as muscle weakness, an unsafe passage and curved toes.
Sick people also suffer from numbness or pain. The disease is incurable and progressive, which means that the symptoms get worse over time.
When Rodgers was 13, she believed that she was suffering from Friedreich-Ataxie (FA) - a disease with very bad chances of survival.
Rodgers thought she would sit in the wheelchair before she would be 18 and die before her 30th birthday.
The mother of two children, who is 51 today, said, "As a child, I knew that I could not do the same thing as the others.
I fell all the time and everything lasted longer.
I could never ride with the other kids roller skate or skateboard and was often in school because of my way of walking and walking.
Rodgers said that at the age of 13, after several operations to relieve her Achilles son and stretch her feet, she saw her medical records when her doctor left the room and read that she was suffering from FA.
"I felt guilty because I had been curious, so I didn't tell anyone, but I went home, looked for the disease in the library and wrote to the FA company," she said.
When I received an answer, I was shocked and panicked terribly.
I thought I'd be in the wheelchair at 18 and die at 25, and in between all my abilities would slowly lose.
I did all this alone with me and planned my own funeral.
She said when she turned 17, she realized that her skills had not diminished as much as she had imagined and asked her doctor.
He just got up and hugged me and said, "My love, I don't think you have it, otherwise you'd be in the wheelchair right now."
I think you have something far less life-threatening.
After some genetic tests, CMT was detected.
"When he told me what CMT was, I felt like I was a winner," she said.
Charity CMT UK has launched a CMT awareness month to draw attention to this disease.
Stabsfeldwebel a. D. Berni Diether has been working as a fireman since the closure of the former military training site
For almost ten years, no more shooting has taken place on the former military training site in Münster.
Nevertheless, every month deadly ammunition still appears in the heart of the biosphere area of Swabian Alb.
The grenades are sometimes so dangerous that they have to be blown up on site.
A deafening sound occurs during the explosions over the heart of the biosphere.
In December 2004, the last sharp shot fell on the Münsingen military training site, which was closed after 110 years of military operation at the end of 2005.
Since this time, the 6500-hectare area has been the core of the Schwäbische Alb biosphere area, which is open to hikers and cyclists on 13 designated roads.
Tax burden on businessmen in Washington is increasing with economic recovery
A recovery of the economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State and local tax rulings for companies in the country increased slightly last year, while economic recovery accelerated, so a newly published study last week, and companies in the Washington area made no exception.
Enterprises in District, Maryland and Virginia jointly paid $27.6 billion to government and local agencies in the financial year 2013, an increase of 3.8 percent compared to revenues of $26.6 billion in 2012.
The state and local tax burden of the companies increased by 4.3 percent last year to $671 billion, compared to 3.9 percent a year before, and it was the third consecutive year of growth after the several years of falling notices in 2009 and 2010.
State taxes increased more than local taxes, by 4.3 percent, according to the study carried out by the service agency Ernst & Young with the Centre for State Taxation, a tax policy group.
More than half of the district's tax revenue, 56 percent, comes from corporate taxes, while 36 percent of Maryland's revenue comes from companies.
Virginia earns 28 percent of the smallest tax revenues from companies.
Most of the increase in tax revenue is due to a recovery in the real estate values of companies, the researchers say, which led to an increase in real estate taxes of 3.7 percent this year after the three consecutive years with growth rates of less than 1 percent.
While much of these profits came from large states such as California, New York, and Texas, the process seems to be true for Washington.
Companies in the district, Maryland and Virginia jointly paid over $10 billion in government and local property taxes last year, compared to $9.6 billion in 2012 - an increase of 4.2 percent over a year.
But the apparent recovery in real estate values in Maryland is not so effective in increasing government and local tax revenues, as real estate taxes amount to just over a fifth of corporate tax returns.
Companies in Virginia and D.C. pay almost half of their state and local taxes in the form of real estate taxes.
"In Maryland, much of the property, especially in the D.C. tax area, is owned either by the government or by non-profit organizations that do not pay real estate taxes," said Douglas Lindholm, Managing Director of the Center on State Taxation.
Maryland is therefore forced, for example, to rely much more on income taxes in order to be able to provide the same services offered by other states.
The recent recovery in corporate tax revenue cannot be attributed solely to the recovery of the real estate market
Business revenues also seem to recover, according to the data.
Enterprises in the region reported income taxes at government organizations of $2.3 billion compared to 2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland took $1 billion in corporate income taxes, the highest amount of the region.
While the trend is in the same direction, the local tax burden on companies does not increase evenly in all three places.
The rate of increase in the district was 4.3 percent of the national average, while the increase in Maryland was significantly higher, 4.9 percent.
Only Virginia reported an underaverage tax revenue of 4.1 percent.
Virginia has, with 6 percent in all three areas, the smallest corporate income taxes (in all three there are fixed corporate tax rates).
The corporate tax rate in Maryland is 8.25 percent and in the district is 9.975 percent.
A similar study by the US Chamber of Commerce at the beginning of this year showed that in Virginia lower government and local corporate taxes are required and overall there is a better tax climate than in Maryland.
The study did not examine the district.
Despite the advantages, Virginia is under pressure from its southern neighbours.
North Carolina has adopted laws to reduce its corporate tax rates this year from 6.9 percent to 6 percent, the same rate as Virginia, and the rate will fall to 5 percent next year.
If the state continues to achieve its income targets in the coming year, this law could reduce the corporate income tax rate of the state to 3 percent by 2017.
In the meantime, small businesses in the Washington area seem to be doing better, so they pay more government and local taxes, according to the latest study.
Corporate taxes, which are paid as personal income taxes by small businessmen - a transitional structure according to which most small businesses are organized - in the district, Maryland and Virginia increased by 20 percent to $2.4 billion last year, a significantly faster rate of growth than the corporate tax total.
The researchers say that the trend and the increase in corporate tax across the country will probably continue this year, with an increase of 6.2 percent in the general government and local government surplus tax revenue in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period of the previous year.
Nevertheless, the Washington area could be lagging behind if the Federal Government's reduction in spending affects the labour market in the region.
Partner city: German beer for Guangzhou
Hops and malt - also a popular combination in China.
German beer enjoys an excellent reputation in China.
Frankfurt's partner city in China now wishes a brewery and also hopes for a direct flight between the two cities.
German beer, brewed in Frankfurt's partner city Guangzhou - this is the urgent wish of the officials in China.
"We would be very pleased if a German brewery were to settle in our city," said the vice party secretary of the southern Chinese metropolis, Li Yiwei, this week visiting an SPD delegation in his city.
Over and over again, the Chinese Communist Party’s official came back to this concern of the twelve million metropolises during the discussion.
Guangzhou, also known as Canton in Germany, was one of China's richest cities.
Therefore, people also had the purchasing power to afford German beer.
Hessian SPD Chairman Thorsten Schäfer-Gümbel, who led the German political delegation, told the host that he would rehearse in Germany after a possible partner for the project.
"For beer it doesn't need much: good water, grain and joy of life," he added at lunch with the party superior in Guangzhou.
This joy of life already exudes Mr. Li, he flattered the host.
As a result, the official from Guangzhou met with sheep-gümbel - but with red wine, which was served for the meal.
The Chinese brand Tsingtao is based on German brewing art.
Tsingtao beer is brewed according to the German offer of purity.
More traffic
A second wish of the Chinese hosts would be a direct flight between Frankfurt and Guangzhou, said Vice-President Li.
Lufthansa had previously offered the flight, but in 2012 it was removed for economic reasons.
"It would be worth it again," the local politician was convinced.
"Commercial traffic between our two cities continues to increase."
At present, travelers would have to take the detour over Changsha in the province of Hunan, Li complained.
The administration of Guangdong Province, the capital of which is Guangzhou, also hopes for the flight connection.
The vice governor of the province, Chen Yunxian, put this wish in the foreground in his conversation with the Social Democrats.
"This is a very good idea," answered Schäfer-Gümbel - Chinese Deputy Minister Li Jinjun, an intimate connoisseur of Germany, nodded in agreement.
Maintained Partnership
The ludicrous Vice-President of Guangzhou hopes that he will be able to attend a partnership meeting next year at Frankfurt.
Li Yiwei was already on the Main, but not yet in this function.
He only came into office this year after his predecessor had been transported out of office for corruption charges.
The local party leader Wan Qinglian also had to leave.
The action against the officials from Guangzhou is part of a nationwide campaign against corruption in party and administration, enforced by Head of State Xi Jinping.
The new top politician Li Yiwei had worked for an American company before his party career, which is most unusual in the Chinese Communist Party.
Prior to joining Guangzhou, he worked as a top official in Fujian, where VW builds a large factory.
Frankfurt has officially entered into more than a dozen city partnerships.
The connection to the 9,000 km away Guangzhou is one of those maintained by both sides, for example with a student exchange.
Last year the 25th anniversary of the German-Chinese connection was celebrated.
With its economic power, the southern Chinese metropolis on the Perl River is almost as strong as all of Hessen.
Li reported that she wanted to achieve a gross domestic product of EUR 250 billion next year.
Family of Joan Rivers "presses the thumbs"
Joan Rivers has been unconscious since her delivery to a hospital in New York City three days ago, but her daughter today was hoping that the 81-year-old comedian will recover from her illness.
"Thank you for your constant love and support," said Melissa Rivers today in a message.
We all push our thumbs.
According to her mother, sources were delivered to Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after an emergency due to cardiac arrest in a clinic on the Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopy.
The doctors keep them deliberately sedated and under close observation until they are more satisfied with their condition, which is still described as "serious".
The reactions came from many sides, also in the form of an overwhelming online support from Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Environmentally friendly vacuum cleaners and rising wages
In future, more stringent environmental standards will apply to cars and vacuum cleaners that come into trade from now on.
Similar to refrigerators and washing machines, new vacuum cleaners from September 1st are given a label on which the buyer can see at a glance central data such as the energy efficiency of the device.
For new cars, stricter nitrogen oxide values apply in the pollutant class "Euro 6".
There is also more money for the scaffolding builders: they receive a uniform minimum wage of 10,25 euros nationwide.
Amazon buys Twitch for $1.04 billion
AMAZON just confirmed what information on Monday morning had reported: The online retailer - and video producer, and a variety of other things - buys the Twitch video streaming service for $1.04 billion ($970 million).
The announcement comes as a surprise, not because no one expected a takeover of Twitch, but because it was widely believed that YouTube would acquire the company.
Three months ago it looked as if the sale of Twitch to Google's video service was for a cool billion decided thing, and the collaboration also appeared naturally.
Twitch, which was only founded three years ago as Justin.tv, was launched as a general streaming service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players who wanted to publish their bravour pieces in games, a "YouTube for live games", such an insider.
The Twitch interface.
And "let's play", a video genre in which Besserwisser gives the (mostly older) games a touch of secret science theatre, are already very popular on YouTube.
It's just that YouTube is often called when you want to describe Twitch, so the news that YouTube Twitch wanted to buy was taken up a little bored, a textbook example of an established technology company that buys a potential competitor.
It's a mystery why the deal with YouTube didn't come about, because according to reports, the company was willing to pay as much as Amazon did.
All we know about this at the moment is this statement by Emmet Shear, President of Twitch: "We chose Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term visions and they want to help us get there faster."
Another secret, frankly, is the incredible success of Twitch.
For snobs like me, who say that they prefer sports than watching, it's hard to understand the attraction that is based on watching others play instead of taking the control console into their own hands.
It's one thing to look a friend over his shoulder at 3:00 in the morning, as she sneaks through Resident Evil, and something else to watch a spider shoot him in the head 20 times in a row in Call of Duty.
You could watch all these games right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are ego games, so watching without your own control over the perspective can be a really good recipe for headaches.
I admit that the rapid passages in which Roger Bannisters of our electronic age complete the games in record time are entertaining.
But as long as there is no game or humor virtuoso, his Twitch channel is probably not very interesting.
But what do skeptics like me know?
Twitch is called by 55 million different visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of Internet traffic peaks.
And how exactly does Amazon want to make money out of it?
It's hard to imagine Twitch being integrated as elegantly into Amazon Instant Video as YouTube Twitch could have just swallowed.
But Twitch has something that every company would like: thousands of young men being promoted as advertisers.
As the chairman of Twitch, Shear, said, Amazon and Twitch "believe both in the future of gaming," and the medium shows no signs of shrinkage, not even - swallowing - as spectator sports.
At the Hüpfburg at the Burggartenfest there was a lot going on on Sunday.
The organizers' concept was correct.
Despite the heavy rain on Saturday evening, it is estimated that 1,200 music fans came to the open-air festival in the Burggarten.
Sometimes the inlet had to be stopped.
"That was annoying," said Ron Sem, one of the organizers.
Salt whirlpool l light and fun.
From two Spanish words, Maxim Sachraj and Ron Sem formed the name Amula.
Because the open air in the Salzweder Burggarten is supposed to radiate brightness in the day and in the evening through various shows.
Well, and the fun comes all by itself anyway.
This was already evident on the early Sunday evening when the first visitors opened up to the Open Air.
The organizers had promised a feast for all generations.
And they succeeded.
Around the supply stands on the Burggartenwiese, Salzweder, but also guests from the nearby and further surroundings had made themselves comfortable.
They followed the first live performances, wobbled with their feet in a beat, enjoyed cool drinks - for a short: pure relaxation and enjoyment were trendy.
And that's right across the generations.
While the one on the blankets on the extra-carved white sand lurked at the beach bar, the other on a quarter of the wine in the vinothek, the youth was whining on the Hüpfburg, which was a great attraction for the smaller guests.
But even when making children, the volunteers had to do all their hands in the truest sense of the word to become Lord to the Andrang and to conjure up imaginative creations in the little faces.
The larger ones used the kicker tables or participated in a skateboard workshop, which the Goodfoot crew of salt whales arranged.
Until the great rain came.
Shortly before 5.30 p.m., he rattled the visitors, especially families looking for the wide and dry.
But the attraction of the festival did not break down.
"There were more people than expected," said Ron Sem, who spoke of a "success on the whole line".
That is why there is nothing against a repetition of the big party next year.
Although the content and size of the event still need to be worked on, Sem made it clear in a first balance sheet on Sunday against the popular voice.
He was angry that the intrusion had to be stopped in the meantime.
Obviously, the security firm had been booked with too little force.
As a result, some who had already paid did not come to the site anymore.
The resonance was very good.
In a first careful estimate, the Salzweder co-organizer spoke of some 1,200 visitors who were tumbling in the castle garden.
There were problems with sound technology.
The hip-hop band blocks`n`Rox broke off their appearance.
The technicians were unable to create a semi-reasonable sound.
The planned Shisha lounges could not be built because the tents could not be brought to salt for a tire.
"But next year they'll be there," says the organizer.
The premiere of the Amula Open-Air was more than successful by the number of visitors.
And that in bad weather.
However, the organizers have made some mistakes that will be delayed for the first time, but have to be removed in the second edition.
Also in the social network Facebook the organizers have to criticise.
"Sorry, but for twelve euros you just expected more," says Melanie Meier on the event page.
"Unfortunately, you took over a bit," says Ele Zimmermann in the same place.
Others do not see the initial problems very closely.
I think it is very good that some not only chat, but also really try to put something on their feet.
Take your hat off!", Stephanie Jenß writes about the amula.
Now the organizers will have a year to put an end to these criticisms.
New Radom in Berkum: Wachtberg's landmark shrinks
This is not expected to happen.
Rather, the ready-to-lay component is waiting to be used in the distinctive building.
The action is in the context of a larger measure: almost 50 years after the creation of the space observation radar TIRA, the shell, the so-called radom, is completely renewed.
The new radom will be slightly smaller with a diameter of 47.5 meters than the old one.
But the size remains world record.
The final step towards completing the new shell is the cap exchange
The upper quarter of the old shell is separated and removed with a crane.
After that, the last quarter of the new envelope is set up.
If the weather plays, the action is scheduled to cross the stage at the beginning of this week.
participant at the Ice Bucket-Challenge deflects Kiefer
Isabelle Roberts from Great Britain screamed so much when her ice-cold water was poured over her head that she injured the bone structure of her face.
This Ice Bucket challenge went agonizing next door.
A woman was hospitalized after she screamed so much at the Ice Bucket Challenge that she evicted herself from the jaw.
Isabelle Roberts from Great Britain was so turbulent when her ice-cold water was poured over her head that she injured her facial structure.
"The water was so cold that I screamed, and while I did it, my jaw just stopped," she said to The Mirror.
Ice water is poured over the 20-year-old.
Isabelle Roberts a few seconds before the accident
I wanted to close my mouth, but that didn't work, the jaw was chopped, and then I understood that something was wrong.
My mother and sister saw this too and almost got in my pants in front of laughter, but I had to go to the emergency room.
The 20-year-old from the UK was hospitalized to reincarnate the jaw after participating in the viral trend on Tuesday.
The clip was linked to an Internet sensation and a thousand times to Facebook and Twitter.
Will the castle clubs soon get back to a line?
Finally, there was a constant dispute between the two Wolfratshaus castle clubs.
Now the Boards are thinking about possible cooperation.
As a model for the reconstruction of the Wolfratshaus Castle, the late Richard Dimbath, former chairman of the Wolfratshaus Castle Friends, led the project in the French Guédelon.
A year ago there was no good climate between the Burgverein and the castle friends Wolfratshausen.
The views so far seemed very different, how the history of Wolfratshaus Castle and a possible reconstruction should be dealt with.
Now the two camps are moving towards each other: discussions on a common approach will soon be held.
The Association Boards Torsten Sjöberg (Burgverein) and Herbert Piffl (Burgffreunde) confirm this at the request of our newspaper.
"I called Mr. Piffl and suggested that we could get together once," says Sjöberg.
In his view, all members of both clubs could in future draw on one strand again.
Thus, there are faster visible successes.
While the castle friends had a reconstruction of the castle on the mountain forest in mind around Richard Dimbath, who died suddenly, the castle association around Sjöberg is at the forefront of the "exploration and adventure" of the site.
Herbert Piffl, second chairman of the Burgfreunde, was very pleased, according to his own information about the call.
Since Dimbath's death, he has been standing before the castle friends.
A new chairman is to be found in a meeting of members in mid-September.
According to the 74-year-old, the association currently has some 40 members.
"After the death of my friend Richard Dimbath, we let the club activities rest out of respect." This "thinking phase" was necessary to "think how it could go on".
According to Piffl, the new chairman should then go to the discussion with the Burgverein.
Until then, the castle friends could also take a current view within their group.
There is currently no candidate for the Presidency, says Piffl.
"But I am confident that someone will find himself." He does not want to run for himself because he has his residence in Bad Tölz.
The new chairman should be a Wolfratshauser.
The Tölzer wanted to participate in the project "but very much would like to continue working".
The different points of view in terms of reconstruction will probably remain in Piffl's eyes in the near future.
He honours Dimbath as a "Missionary" who always believed in the reconstruction of the castle.
Two similar, already advanced projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is not an airlock.
By a high proportion of the population and by volunteers from all over the world, they are a tourist magnet.
Piffl: "I was also sceptical at the beginning.
But over time, I have come to believe more and more that it makes sense to push the project forward. A "single-positioning feature" could be created for the Flößerstadt.
There's nothing else here.
In addition, the project would be financed by EU grants, visitor tickets and potential sponsors, Piffl believes.
"I personally do not want to throw the idea of reconstruction overboard." He hopes that the Burgverein will perhaps move somewhat on this point.
Their goal to document the story first is "important and good".
After that, you could keep looking.
Clever ways to save at university textbooks
Since the cost of university textbooks for many students is more than $1,000 a year, the fast-second semester student Matt Schroeder considered a clever sparidee.
He invented a loan system for books by students of higher semester and offered a nominal compensation to delay the resale.
"My math book usually costs $180, but I got it for $10 for a semester and a Chick-fil-A cookie," said Schroeder, 19, who visited the Covenant College in Georgia.
The books needed for the last semester would have cost him $430, he said.
He spent $120.
The college management informed that the student spends on average more than $1,200 a year on textbooks and study material, but that there are different cost-absorbing options for the students.
Online shops and creative approaches such as the Schroeders are increasingly the solution of choice for students.
Renting textbooks becomes more popular, and so students can use a book for a semester, often at a much cheaper price than when buying.
Neebo Inc., which operates more than 250 university bookstores, announced that renting textbooks had doubled since 2011.
Surveys in the industry show that about a quarter of the books in the college bookstores were rented in the last spring semester, Neebo's Vice President Tevor Meyer said.
Less than half of all textbooks are purchased in campus bookstores according to the Trade Association National Association of College Stores.
Here's the one for the best deals.
Buy online
Some new books cost online only one-third of the price for which they are available in the campus bookstore.
The ninth edition of "Calculus" vno Ron Larwon, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs almost $290, but can be purchased from the specialized textbook retailer Chegg.com for $239.99.
Used purchases
If you don't care about other or normal traces of usage, used books are a good option.
"Calculus" is needed on Chegg.com for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, graduate student at Brigham Young University, says he spent 42 cents on Amazon.com for a used issue of "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business."
The book was resold for $48.
Academics such as Ingrid Bracey, head of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst College Without Walls, recommended students to ask their professors if previous expenses were allowed.
Sometimes the updates are not relevant for the seminar work.
In such cases, older expenditure can often be purchased for a fraction of the cost of the latest edition.
Apart from Chegg and Amazon, Half.com by eBay Inc is also a popular alternative for used books.
Renting
Renting textbooks is worth considering if you treat them well, think about giving them back and you don't want to keep the books after completing the course.
You can save more than 80 percent of the cost of a newly purchased book.
For example, a student could rent "Calculus" for a semester for about $20.
Find out about the provisions of the business you are renting, including the penalties that may apply to writing notes, underscores or signs of use.
Tenants taken care of: If you do not return the book, the penalty fees may even exceed the price of a new book.
E-Books
E-books instead of traditional textbooks are also an option.
Sometimes these books are de facto rented by providing an electronic license for a certain period of time by wholesalers such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc..
At Chegg you can rent "Calculus" for 6 months for about $61.
Bracey says that students in literature courses often find the best offers, as many classics can be downloaded for free nowadays, while scientific and engineering textbooks can be very expensive.
At least look around.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon visit the Pepperdine Law School, recommends the ISBN number for determining the price of books, as one can be so sure to find the right textbook.
And before ordering online, you should check, according to Gault, whether the book is actually available.
He learned this lesson on the hard tour.
He bought a book that had four weeks of delivery time and finally paid the full price in the college bookstore.
Why "Guardians of the Galaxy" Was Not a Cash Beater
"The Extendables 3" by Sylvester Stallone recorded less than 30 million dollars of his 90 million dollars budget in the United States, while "Sin City: A Dame to Kill For" recorded only 12 million dollars of his budget of 70 million dollars.
The film "Sex Tape" tailored to Cameron Diaz recorded only 14.6 million dollars on the opening week, while children's films like "Dreak Tämmen" also disappoint the revenue.
An article by telegraph film critic Robbie Collin suggests that the lack of quality in the films could be the reason for the children's films themselves.
Collin described 2014 as "the worst year" for children's films so far and described "drags easily made 2" as a purely "functional" fantasy continuation.
For films for a slightly older audience, however, it seems that the quality of the films is not necessarily the problem.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore and Metacritic rating for every summer film start, which was shown on at least 2000 canvases between the American Memorial Day and July 20, 2013 and the current year.
The results are based on the opinion of cinema visitors and film critics and indicate that this year's film hits are equivalent to those of last year.
Some commentators believe that the development is due to changing visual habits and the growing popularity of web streaming services such as Netflix.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disney's soon-to-be jungle book film, said to the Hollywood Reporter website: "I think the times are changing."
We must accept this and not try to follow up the past.
In contrast to the currently weak cash results of Hollywood productions, Netflix has recently generated revenues with the streaming content of 1.2 billion dollars, almost twice as much as last year's sales of 837 million dollars.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized the film studios for concentrating too much on comics filming and prophesied a "core melt" of Hollywood.
In the light of the current downturn, some commentators argue that his gloomy prophecy could well contain a true core.
However, due to the potential cashmen expected in summer 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Minions and Jurassic World, other representatives of the film industry are more optimistic:
The producer of X-Men, Simon Kinberg, recently described the decline in cash results as simply "cyclical" and said to Hollywood reporter: "The next summer will be the biggest summer at the cinema at all, and no one will worry about the business any more."
A few years ago, when the 2nd table tennis district class was removed for the purpose of tightening the league classification, this has been a step in the right direction.
Now the German Tischtennisbund has taken an additional 3rd Bundesliga into the programme.
As a result, those who have not ascended have descended.
Göttingen's top-class team Torpedo has avoided the descent in the Oberliga delegation, but in the coming season only plays fifth-class.
Fourth-class torpedoes ladies remain in the regional league, despite their magnificent march through.
The boys and girls of Torpedo start in the Niedersachsenliga, as well as the boys of the SC Wende.
The SG Lenglern and the Torpedo Reserve are entering the new Verbandsliga, in the Landesliga there are no more Göttingen clubs represented.
With the ladies, the TTV Geismar plays in the League of Associations, the Torpedo-Two in the Landesliga.
What the composition looks like is a better district class, is now the new district superliga South.
Here, TSV Seulingen, VfB Lödingsen, Torpedo III, Geismar, Einbeck, Hammenstedt, Bovender SV, Langenholtensen, FC Weser and the TTC join.
In the district league play as regional representatives Dransfeld and the SC Weende, in the district class of TTC II, Red-White, the Bovender SV II and the teams of TTV Geismar II and III. The district superliga of the ladies starts at least in Sollstärke.
Güntersen, TTC and TTV Geismar II are part of the game.
Torpedo III and Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen start in the district league.
With every nine teams
The SC Wende sends his girls to the small district league.
Also the district league staff of the SCW boys - there still starts Torpedo II - is not complete.
In a district class, Geismar, Tuspo Weende and the Bovender SV go into the season.
In the first season of the newly founded regional association, the two Göttingen Kreisligen start with nine teams each.
In the West-Staffel are the Red-White II, Bowender SV III, Laubach II, Torpedo IV and V, MTV Grone, Dransfelder SC II, Mielenhausen and SG Lenglern II.
Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen, Nikolausberg and Landolfshausen play in the Eastern Staffel.
The Damen-Kreisliga consists of Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen II, Bilshausen, Hemelen, Seulingen II, Tuspo Weende and the SG Rhume.
This is still better than in the circle of Osterode, where there are no more ladies teams at the circle level.
Remarkably, none of the six 2nd circuit classes achieves the goal strength, here the innovative and turbulent circuit board will have to think.
NATO Summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
On the weekend there were protests by opponents of the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered in the center of Newport for an anti-nato march.
On Sunday, about 150 people gathered in Cardiff in front of the town hall to hold a so-called counter-tip.
Stephen Fairclough has been following developments for us on the weekend and speaking with demonstrators who have travelled from Bridgend to Belgium.
Teenagers flew out of the Blue Mountains
TWO young bush hikers were rescued with the rope wind after they were caught in the Blue Mountains in NSW the night after the night.
THE 16-year-old girl and the 19-year-old man went on their tour in Govett's Leap in Blackheath shortly after Sunday afternoon.
Concerned relatives called the police at about 8 p.m. when the two had not returned home.
An addiction squad from local police and rescue services broke up and the couple was found near Bridal Veil waterfalls at about 23 o'clock.
The girl had injured her knee and the man had fallen and hit his head.
Rescue forces stayed overnight with the couple, and they were flown out on Monday morning.
They were delivered to the Blue Mountains Hospital in a stable condition with an ambulance.
Anti-Government Protests Escalating in Pakistan
The approximately 1,000 demonstrators were expelled from the PTV building by soldiers, said Minister of Information Pervaiz Rashid.
After about half an hour, the transmitter resumed the radiation.
PTV director Athar Farooq said that the demonstrators equipped with sticks had damaged equipment in the editorial department.
No reports of deaths or injuries have been made.
The demonstrators call for the resignation of the head of government, whom they accuse of fraud.
The police reported that about a kilometre from the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, there had been another clash of some 3,000 protesters with security forces on Monday.
After hospital records, a police officer was injured.
On the weekend, at least three people were killed and more than 500 injured when demonstrators tried to penetrate Sharif's residence.
They call for the resignation of the Prime Minister.
On Sunday evening after a meeting in the Army headquarters, the powerful military called for a political solution to the conflict, "to waste no time and apply without violence".
The communication further stated: "The army remains committed to ensuring the security of the state".
The escalating violence has caused concern for military intervention, which has already brushed more frequently in the past.
The protests led by opposition politician Imran Khan and preacher Tahirul Qadri have continued since the day of independence on 14 August.
Sharif refuses to resign.
Khan and Qadri had called their followers on Sunday to persevere.
"We will not go back without having forced Sharif to resign," said Khan.
Qadri spoke similarly.
Khan accuses Sharif of winning the parliamentary election last May by fraud.
Qadri calls for the resignation of central and provincial governments.
Then a transitional government should reform the electoral system and call for new elections.
More than 40 000 security forces are in use to protect the government district.
The demonstrators had at first held out peacefully before Parliament until Khan and Qadri called on them to advance to Sharif's residence on the weekend.
Hütteldorfer after second season victory in third place of the table.
With the 2:0 over Grödig, a bitter week on Sunday has come to an end for Rapid.
"The victory is very liberating," said Trainer Zoran Barisic, whose team had reached an intermediate depth on Thursday with the Out in the Europe League.
"The success experience was extremely important," confirmed Captain and goalkeeper Steffen Hofmann, who pushed green-white to third place.
Schrammel Dreamtor brings Rapid on winner road Rapid has shown the right reaction to the disappointment against Helsinki with the second season win and goes to the national game break with a success experience.
"We wanted to show a positive reaction," said foreign defender Thomas Schrammel, who set the course for victory with his magnificent leadership volley from the sixteenth corner in the 14th minute.
"I thought I'd get all the frustration out of Thursday and slap him under the bar," said the 26-year-old smiling.
When Schrammel met for the last time in a Bundesliga party on November 13th, 2010, this was still for Ried.
The first racer in the Rapid-Dress will therefore remain in special memory.
"For me, that's something very special, I'm out of the Rapid Junior," said Schrammel.
Due to Mario Pavelic's short-term pelvis, Schrammel moved from the left to the right defensive side and made his thing very good there.
He has enough experience that he can also perform this position incorrectly.
He earned the gate, he's already done some assists this year," praised Barisic.
Team shows character Schrammel also delivered the flank to the 2:0 by Hofmann after a good hour, which finally made the decision.
Because before that, the guests could have written about it.
"Thank God we've had some luck today," said Schrammel, who thus pointed to the disintegration of performance and results in recent weeks: "The results have not been correct, but the playful was always good compared to last year".
Barisic even found that one had been "better in many games than today" - against "the strongest team that played in this stadium this season".
The first three points since July 26 have therefore proved that the team structure is in spite of the setbacks: "Today my team has shown that it has a character".
No less pleasing to him: "That we finally played again to zero".
A lot of work during the Landespielpuse Also the fact that with Brian Behrendt, Mario Pavelic, Christopher Dibon, Deni Ala and Michael Schimpelsberger there are several failures to complain about, and Srdjan Grahovac, Stefan Stangl and Philipp Schobesberger gave their startel debuts, make the victory even more valuable.
"Don't forget that," warned Barisic, who lost with Behrendt and Pavelic players in the past three days, "who have been very stable lately."
The national game break must therefore be used in order to "taste wounds and add a little to the physical area", said Barisic, who has five U21 selection players in his ranks.
Captain Hofmann is one of those who is likely to find a special place to take the break.
He's tearing himself apart for the team, going over pain.
Especially in this difficult phase, he has shown that he is a very important player for us," Barisic observed.
Hofmann not only gave the game Rapids before his change in the 68th minute, but also scored the second goal.
For the 33-year-old who completed his 350th Bundesliga game, it was the first hit out of the game since November 2, 2013 (4:2 on the admira).
Hofmann: "Don't believe that everything is good now" "We have certainly also had a bit of luck, but at some point luck has to come back to us too.
It was high time now," said Hofmann.
He warned, of course, to continue to work concentratedly: "You can't always see this black and white.
We haven't played as badly in the last few weeks as it was shown.
But we must not believe that everything is good now.
He could not deny the importance of his role for the team.
It's a very young team that I can help very much at the moment.
They still stick to me at certain stages," said Hofmann.
Grödig-Coach Michael Baur had little to blame for himself and his team.
He regretted the quick counter-receiver "from the category of magic gate", as well as the regular gate of utility in the 40th minute, which had been unfairly dismissed by Arbitrator Collegger.
The only accusation I can make to the team is that we were not concrete enough towards the goal in some phases.
We've had too few degrees.
Internal defender Maximilian Karner saw it similarly: "It started as bad, but then we found it pure and even made a gate.
By and large, there would have been more inside.
There's peace under this dome
We showed a mighty tribe during our tour of the summer series "My piece of the Rhöner Glück" last Friday.
Several of these tree giants are still present in the district, the pictured copy is the "gittle calm" above the underwhite well.
A bumpy footpath leads up to the about 600-year-old oak.
It passes by clusters, basalt stone heaps and basalt stone lakes.
A little below the quarry of Bauersberg, one kilometer north of the road to Weisbach, there it stands.
Vital looks the natural monument, it extends beyond the other trees of the surrounding area and reminds with a circumference of more than eight meters of an American mammoth tree.
A small Buddha on a tree stump indicates that it is a spiritual or mystical place.
But despite intensive research, there was only evidence of the origin of the name.
Dr. Wolfgang Schneider has consulted the Bischofsheimer Archiv and asked older people from Unterweißenbrunn to find out what kind of work it has with the gypsies.
The result of his research remained the rather sober explanation of the name.
Thus, until about 80 years ago, the shepherds of goats were supposed to have driven their animals from underwhite brown to the hardy redded and stone-free meadows.
At the foot of the tree the animal keepers, exhausted from the ascent, must have rested.
In the meantime, the area has regained its importance, because in the meadows, goat herds actually graze again.
The area has also been declared the core zone of the biosphere reserve, Schneider has further found out.
However, when entering the stone collections, caution should be exercised, for the basalt heated by the sun is also a popular place to stay for Crusoes.
A hiking trail leads from Unterweißenbrunn to the tree, but it is a little hidden.
Further paths are signposted, the direction of Hochrhön rises and invites you to an extensive hike.
Where's the Wasserburg?
However, a water castle, which is sought for in our next task, is rather rare to find in height.
The mirroring in the trench gives a good impression of the building, but we have some historical buildings in the district, to which the building counterfei could fit.
Where's our piece of Rhöner luck?

After a week's thaw, Italy's Prime Minister and EU President Matteo Renzi, against strong conservative opposition at the EU Special Summit last week, has enforced the nomination of his Foreign Minister Federica Mogherini as Head of EU Foreign Policy, who will succeed British Catherine Ashton.
Renzi considers, as the government-oriented daily La Repubblica reflects, the appointment of his favourite Mogherini in the government team as a strengthening of the position of the Social Democrats and his own in the EU.
He also expects a boost for his "reform package" in Italy.
Last but not least, Renzi hopes to calm down the left-wing party base that is constantly against him, for Mogherini is assigned to it - albeit in a more moderate way.
Faced with the conservative representatives of the Commission, President Jean-Claude Juncker and the President-in-Office of the Council, Donald Tusk, said the prevailing opinion in Rome to achieve political balance.
The EU's chief diplomat will also be replaced by Commission President Juncker.
The pending consent of the European Parliament is considered safe.
Otherwise, President Giorgio Napolitano would hardly have mentioned the nomination of the 41-year-old politician of the ruling Democratic Party (PD) as "important recognition" of Italy's role in the EU.
La Repubblica spreads optimism that Mogherini, proven in leading party offices for almost two decades and known for her ambition, will show itself to be the "enormous challenges".
The native Roman is married and has two daughters.
Her party career began with her doctorate in 1996 in the youth organization of the then Democratici di Sinistra (left Democrats), which joined the Catholic Center Party Margherita in 2008 to today's Social Democratic PD.
In 1999, Mogherini became Vice-President of the European Community Organisation of Socialist Youth for three years.
With the election in 2001 to the Party Council of Left Democrats, she joined the high party politics, worked in the Department of Foreign Policy, whose leader she soon became.
She occupied traditional priorities of Italian foreign policy such as the Middle East, became known through studies on NATO use in Afghanistan, in which Italy is involved with a force quota, maintained contacts with the Social Democrats in Europe and with the Democrats in the USA.
Since 2008, she has been a member of the Chamber of Deputies, where she is an expert in defence and European and international affairs.
When Renzi became Prime Minister in February 2014, he called Mogherini to his foreign minister.
If today the PD has a better relationship with the strong peace movement in the country, which contributed to the party's more than 40 percent vote in the EU elections in May, then, as PD circles say, Federica Mogherini has a share in it.
The provisions in Brussels, which the new EU external representative has too little diplomatic experience, so if there is no substance, is addressed in the PD.
In Brussels, especially by Poland and the Baltic members, Mogherini's skeptical accents on the crisis in Ukraine are being persecuted and deflated as a "Russia-friendly course".
It supports the pipeline South Stream operated by the Russian company Gasprom, which is intended to be transported directly to southern Europe through Russian natural gas bypassing Ukraine, which is also used to secure Italy's energy.
After Renzi took up his term of office as EU President in July, Mogherini went to Moscow for her first state visit.
Photos they showed with Putin at the shake-hands were taken in Brussels with outrage, as well as that they invited the Kremlin chief for October to a Milan economic summit.
A total of nine young people started their education at emz-Hanauer in Nabburg on Monday.
Among these is an Azubi who has already completed a different training course in the company.
The new employees will be active in four training professions in the future: electronics (three trainees), mechatronics (two), tool mechanics (two) and process mechanics (two).
All Azubis come from the district of Schwandorf: Tobias Braun and Thomas Bücherl from Schwarzach, Stefan Brickl and Florian Rewitzer from Schmidtaden, Johannes Beer from Neunburg form Wald, Felix Domaier from Oberviechtach, Daniel Ansorgnfrei und Sebastian Zahner from Pfremd and Ferdinand Strebl from Tunz.
The new trainees had previously attended primary and secondary schools and real schools.
From Wednesday to Friday, the trainees of all vintages and the trainers will go to Oberammergau for a team training event, where, among other things, a full-day hike and rafting on the Inn are on the programme.
The company has 435 employees throughout Germany and 950 employees worldwide.
The number of trainees in all years is 27.
The socialists in France should "keep their mouths shut and fix France," said the most important ally of Francois Hollande.
Mr. Valls called on the deeply divided left to show "their love" for the controversial socialist president whose cabinet conversion has met with disapproval from the vast majority of French.
The President deserves everyone's respect, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It is our duty to stay with him," he said with great applause.
As a sobering gesture, the Prime Minister insisted that his government would not question the controversial 35-hour week in France despite strong demands for a relaxation of the rules of Emmanuel Macron, the new economic ministers.
On Saturday, Mr. Hollande had urged his fellow socialists to show themselves "united" with the government.
But Christiane Taubira, the Minister of Justice, scattered sand into the gear of a meeting of apostate socialist MPs and criticised the Socialist Party for taking the French "the faith in their future".
Marine Le Pen, the far-right leader of the National Front, mocked the constant digging of the socialists and said that they could not imagine that the new Valls government would last longer than a few months.
Francois Hollande is the emperor without clothes, but Prince Manuel Valls has no one either, they are forced to form a new government if the old one has not even survived a summer.
"And the new one will also not survive autumn or winter," said Ms. Le Pen to supporters.
She repeated the call of her party after the dissolution of Parliament and said that she was confident that she would be a winner in previous elections and was willing to go to government.
The ruling party of France suffered a defeat in the municipal elections in March, and the right-wing national front was at the front of the EU elections in May.
A survey in the Sunday newspaper Journal du Dimanche found that 76 percent of French people believe that the Socialist Party is at risk of falling into several rival factions before the end of Holland's term of office in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at Sciences Po University, warned that the French would quickly lose patience if the new socialist government did not improve the economy and record unemployment figures.
"There is a small window of opportunity, but public opinion must quickly feel that things are changing," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could continue to deteriorate.
Norwegian Cruise just before a deal with Prestige Cruises of $3 billion
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the third largest cruise provider in the world, is conducting advanced negotiations to acquire the competitor Prestige Cruises International Inc for about $3 billion, according to industry experts.
A deal would give Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of $6.8 billion, access to the luxury cruise ships of Prestige Cruises and to its wealthy clientele, while competing with larger rivals such as Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
An agreement could already be announced this week, the sources said on Sunday and warned that the talks could also end without results.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, the private equity company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns a 20 percent share in Norwegian Cruise.
The sources asked to be able to remain anonymous because the negotiations were not public.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comments, while a speaker for Apollo rejected a comment.
The company based in Miami operates 13 cruise ships on routes between North America, the Mediterranean Sea, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
His revenues in 2013 were $2.57 billion, an increase of 13 percent compared to 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also based in Miami, operates under the brand names Oceania and Regent, who jointly operate eight cruise ships on routes to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
It reported revenues for 2013 of $1.2 billion, an increase of 6 percent compared to the previous year.
The cruise industry totals about $29 billion and in the next few years is expected for it due to the strengthening of the middle class in emerging economies such as China and India.
The companies try to position themselves for these new customers as the best choice among cruise providers.
Prestige Cruises applied to the US regulators in January 2014.
Apollo is the majority shareholder in the company since an $850 million deal in 2007.
Norwegian Cruise was created in its current form in 2000 by a merger with a cruise provider owned by Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a leisure and casino group controlled by Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise went to the stock exchange in January 2013.
At the end of June, according to approval authorities, 28 percent of the shares, Apollo 20 percent of the shares and the private equity company TPG Capital LP held an 8 percent share in the company.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise jointly have over 82 percent of the passenger capacity of American cruise ships, according to the original application documents for the Prestige Cruises stock exchange.
Pro-Hongkong activists condemn China the day after the election decision.
A Peking faithful group swung the Chinese flag nearby.
On Sunday, the Permanent Committee of the National People's Congress passed a framework law that only allows two or three candidates for the leadership election in Hong Kong in 2017.
All candidates must first obtain the majority support of a nomination committee, which is expected to be chaired by peking-like members.
This decision will make it almost impossible for opposition democrats to be admitted to elections and induce pro-democracy activists to face their threat and with "Occupy Central" protests to paralyze Hong Kong's financial center.
Political reforms have long been a controversial issue in Hong Kong; and China's party leadership fears that the calls for democracy are spreading to other cities.
After the publication of a Beijing White Paper, which presented China's domination of Hong Kong in June, democracy activists held an unofficial referendum on the electoral process in the special administrative region, where hundreds of thousands marched into the city's business district and organized a sit-in there.
Li's survey is organised by the Hong Kong government and the Chinese liaison office in Hong Kong.
The Vice-Chairman of the Legal Commission of the Standing Committee, Zhang Rongshun, as well as the Deputy Director of the Hong Kong and Macaus Office of the Council of State, Feng Wei, should be interviewed during the day.
Student activists announced to gather in front of the Hong Kong leadership office in the afternoon.
Until the end of the 150-year-old colonial government in Hong Kong, Britain did not foresee any democratic elements.
Putin requires Kiev to take up "state talks" with the eastern Ukraine
According to Russian President Vladimir Putin, on Sunday Russian media reports demanded that the Ukrainian government stop fighting the separatists in the east of the country and start negotiations directly with the "state" of the abject region.
His spokesperson Dimitri Peskow later made it clear that Putin did not mean that the area of eastern Ukraine under the control of the separatists would become a part of Russia, but that his status vis-à-vis Ukraine had to be redefined in order to give the Russian-speaking region the power to represent its rights and interests.
Putin's call to the Kiev government to open negotiations with the pro-Russian insurgents, however, fits in with the strategy he has been following since the start of the riots five months ago: help for the separatists in taking territories and pressure on the Ukrainian government to allow the newly proclaimed Novorossija region factual independence for an alliance with Russia instead of with the West.
In an interview with the state television channel One, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to reconquer the separatists-held areas in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, which were taken in March and April after Moscow annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea on March 18.
The Kremlin and the separatists have recently referred to the occupied area as "Novorossija" or "Neurussia", a term reminiscent of the pre-revolutionary glare of the Russian Empire.
Putin pointed out that all those who, during the campaign of Ukrainian politicians for the elections on Oct. 26 and while government groups are attacking civilian communities in the areas held by separatists, hope to be "captured in their illusions," said Itar-Tass.
"We need to start extensive discussions immediately, not only on technical issues, but also on the political organisation of society and the state status of South-East Ukraine, in order to safeguard the interests of the people living there," he said.
Pekkov said that Putin's reference to statehood must be seen in the context of greater autonomy, which has been discussed by the Kiev leadership for months to dispel fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights are at risk.
Only the Ukrainian government can grant the eastern territories the necessary autonomy, said Peskow.
It's not about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, said Peskow, "because it's not about a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, it's about an internal conflict in Ukraine."
The clarification of the Kremlin speaker in correcting Putin's "fail interpretation" underlined Russia's leadership in dealing with the separatist rebellion in the East in contrast to the direct annexation of Crimea, on which the majority of the 2 million inhabitants are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would be much more difficult to annex the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine, since most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians and surveys from the pre-conflict period produced a broad majority for the stay in Ukraine.
The autonomy addressed by Russian diplomats on international forums would give regional governments in Ukraine the power to negotiate their own trade agreements and external relations, thus de facto giving the Kremlin control over an area that connects the Russian territory with the Crimea.
The Black Sea peninsula, annexed five months ago, is the home port for most of the Russian Navy, as well as an important trading port and historic coastal region.
The regions between the Rostov region in Russia and Crimea are also rich in mines, factories and foundries that produce important components for the Russian military.
On 7 June, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed that Ukrainian legislation - following new elections - be subject to constitutional addenda to give the respective territories greater control over their finances and the status of languages.
But his idea of autonomy seems to stand in stark contrast to those of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels whose arms and incitement Moscow is accused of.
Putin's last call to Kiev to negotiate with the separatists at eye level followed a further advance of the rebels last week after Russian troops and tanks invaded the eastern Ukraine over the previously peaceful region along the Asov Sea.
The separatists supported by Russia took over in a handshake, which according to the fears of Ukrainian security officers is the first step of a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region to Crimea, the control of Novoasovsk.
For this reason, massive civilian and military preparations have begun to secure Mariupol, a steel industrial port with 500,000 inhabitants, located between Novoasovsk and narrow access to the Crimea peninsula.
Poroshenko spoke on Saturday at a meeting of the EU leadership in Brussels and urgently asked for action to prevent another Russian aggression against Ukraine, an earlier Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years.
"We are just in front of a point where there is no return," said Poroshenko.
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now in the territory of Ukraine.
The EU Summit did not decide on concrete actions, the leadership called for the draft further sanctions against Russia to come into force in the event of an unspecified escalation of the Ukraine crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilovajsk after two Russian tanks columns and 1,000 soldiers joined the Donetsk region last week to support the besieged separatists, said Colonel Andrij Lysenko, spokesperson of the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council, reporting on Saturday in Kiev.
On Sunday, the first, probably 63 Ukrainian soldiers, who were enlisted by the Russian invasion of Ilovajsk, were exchanged for 10 Russian paratroopers who had been captured in Ukrainian territory a week ago, told Lysenko on Sunday.
Nude photo scandal around Australian celebrities and Gabi Grecko
Geoffrey Noblest didn't make any trouble with hackers who probably stole nude pictures from his fiancé Gabi Grecko and a who is who of the A-promises from Hollywood.
The film city is intrigued after a series of unique photos of a naked Jennifer Lawrence appeared in a hacking scandal for celebrities on the Internet.
The hacker responsible for this will probably have 60 nude photos of Lawrence, star from "the Tribute of Panem" and superstars, including the models Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, singers Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle, as well as actress Kirsten Dunst.
Among the Australian actresses Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski, and Gregko from Melbourne were allegedly also private photos due to an iCloud gap.
The list includes 101 celebrities.
The noblest who were engaged to Grecco last month said to Confidential, "It's disgusting."
All private letters and pictures should remain private.
It is a disgrace that private information can be stolen and passed on to others.
Grecco, currently in New York, reports that a news website said that the hack was "disgusting" and that the affected people felt "injured".
The hacker probably has 30 pictures of Palmer with her ex-boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two shots in which she lies above without in a pool.
Palmer's film works include "Love Is Invincible" with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck-Star Strahovski and the actress Browning from Sucker Punch were not available yesterday for comments on the hacked pictures.
A representative of Lawrence' said to TMZ: "It's a horrible violation of privacy."
actor Seth Rogen condemned the hacker in his tweet: "Posting hacked pictures from a mobile phone is nothing but the sale of Hehlerware."
From a legal point of view, the dissemination of stolen images should not be tolerated.
Radler, Jogger and Wanderer were present yesterday at the 8th cycling on the Großen Feldberg and thus supported the association "Help for children with cancer".
The tour, which was for one torturing, was an easy training for the other.
In one, however, everyone agreed: It was fun.
Thomas Studanski probably slept well last night.
For the first time in his life, the head of the Oberurseler Brauhaus took the wheel to the Feldberg yesterday.
For the good.
He can easily put away the small muscle catheter, especially since the participation on the 8th wheel on the Großen Feldberg in favour of the association "Help for cancer-sick children" (Frankfurt) has also personally brought a valuable realization.
It's a great thing.
"I know now that I can do it - fine!"
Little break on the way in the applause basket?
No, if I had stopped once, it would have been...
Like Thomas Studanski, who sits for the CDU in the Oberurseler Stadtparlament, many of the 718 participants were tormented yesterday in the early tau to the mountains and came close to exhaustion, but happy on the plateau.
Others, on the other hand, found it easier to overcome the well 11 km long line between Hohemark and Feldberg.
Norman Dietzner, for example.
The green-politician from the day of the circle - red dress, red bike - who appeared in red - did something about understatement at the start ("Every number of professionals, there is an arrival the goal!"), but then turned out to be half a professional on the mountain and went through the goal after 45 minutes without breathlessness.
He also went through the route in a slide, as did Nina Kuhn, press spokesperson of the city of Oberursel, who had joined Frank Grüneisen.
For the two triathletes, the "Feldberg-Radeln" was not necessarily a sporty challenge: "This is about Charity, we like to be with it - we would have made an exit today anyway," Kuhn said.
On the way, they met Paul Wenzel from Oberreifenberg.
The boy (12) had come down to Oberursel in the morning to strangle again to the height immediately afterwards.
The Frankfurter Florian Zierz had swung into the saddle at 9 a.m. in the morning, "made" the Feldberg twice, then to roll home with fun.
Fun had "Fritten-Toni" too.
For the head of the Oberurseler Kultkiosk cycling tours over the Feldberg are simply part of this.
He had pointed his 6.5-kilo race bike for 40 minutes.
It's a crazy event.
For this purpose - I am happy to be there," said Andreas Balzke.
The trained Mainzer says he's an "ambitious racing cyclist".
He has to be, because he was on the "Fixie-Rad", but that's also racing bikes, but without a circuit...
The fact that it went up easily without a bike proved not only the 20 hikers who went up the White Wall and the Fuchstanz to the summit, but also a jogger who pulled a car tire with weights behind him on a cord.
Bergwacht doctor Professor Volker Lischke, who with his team, equipped with Allrad-Bully and Quad, took care of safety, said: "I know that" from Frankfurt, who trains for a special sled trail, only that he pulls the sled himself." So the man is in a way his own sled dog.
The 718 participants - and thus as many as never before - had been sent to groups in the morning.
The hikers first at 9.30 a.m.
The first cyclists and runners followed at 10 a.m.
Five minutes later, the first mountain bikers set off.
Bent Hansen, chairman of the association "Radeln auf den Großen Feldberg", gave the start commands and wished the participants a nice trip.
For next year, he hopes that he will succeed in blocking the route up to the Feldberg to the safety of the participants.
