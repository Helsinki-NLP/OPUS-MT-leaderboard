I'll be here when you get back.
When does Tom eat breakfast?
You have wine.
I forgot him clean.
The horse is in the woods.
Another coffee, please.
Who is that woman?

Do you understand what he is saying?
My wife is a vegetarian.
Where does Tom eat breakfast?
We carried out that plan.
You must have attended the meeting.
Can you read my letter and correct the mistakes, if there is.
My conscience bothers me.
Many houses were washed away with the flood.
Why should I care about them?
Does Your Friend Like Tea?
I had to rent a car.
What should I do about her?
If a sick thousand paper cranes fold, her wish will come true.
Tom left them clean.
Do not be late for the train.
If you find something with which you are good and which you enjoy, it's a wonderful thing.

If the idiots were to compete, you'd come second, because you're too dull to come first.
I wouldn’t be surprised if Tom hadn’t come.
I don't want to remember.
Flashy!
They're in the library.
Tom better not.
She's very pretty.
I don't want to meet her.
I don't know where we'll end up.
Tom got up early.
It's life.
I couldn't stop Tom.
He did not feel sorry for me.
What is your favorite winter sports?
The girl in the blue coat is my daughter.
Our teacher began to sing a song well.
We're not going to be able to eat everything.
But you know well that these negative effects would result.

I'm not going to be able to visit for a while.

Why would I lie?
Go inside.
I'm going back to my office.
I don't speak Japanese.
I too am unemployed.
Can I get over it later?
Tom was very tolerant.
I have to go.
Tom wouldn't care.
Sami fixed it last week.
What should we do about him?
The food is right.
I put my socks on in a jap.
Tom kept trying.

Do not waste your money buying things you do not need.
Congratulations!

It's the last straw.
We know each other quite well.
Thank you very much!
She looked beautiful.
We're all going.
Open your mouth!
It depends on the weather.
Not only does he speak French but he also speaks Spanish.
I went back to my seat.
Close the door behind you if you leave the room.
There's always something to do.
I'll be on the next bus.
Money cannot buy happiness.
Who said that?
Your name is first on the list.
Is it necessary?
Can you wait that long?
Were you busy yesterday?
Sami hates talking about money.
My sister is beautiful.
With the sun setting, they left their work.
Who knows where Tom was born?
She's running.

I'll have to come back to you.
Tom will stay for three days.
I would not be surprised.

In the past, the boys were taught to defend themselves while they were very young.
Tom would never have done that.
There's a bird here.

I am no longer afraid.
I was hoping we could become friends.

His music is well - known.
It's all yours.
He belongs to the Catholic faith.
I don't want to go home.
I don't want to see you.
Tom was disturbed by the direction of his thoughts.
I'm not going to change my choice. I don't care what you say.
That is quite normal.
I love your son.
Tom will not appear at all.
I should have imagined myself.
Let's practice.
It was difficult for him to hide his pride, which he felt after his success .
I want to know who broke this window.
Tom said that he had not kissed Mary.
The bell is ringing.
I'm not going to be able to get out of this cell.
I have no time for you.
They said that they had always done so.

Is Tom going to die?
A dog ran after the cat.
I also kissed Tom.
Why don’t you join us for dinner tonight?

Santa Claus lives in the Arctic.
I was born and trained in Tokyo.

You're not a dog.
What would you have done if you had been in my place?
I'll be right behind you.

I think I might be out of a job.
I told Tom I'd be right now.
My son still believes in Father Christmas.
I hate driving.
Sami has to wait a bit.
Are they friends?
Tom knows all about them.
Entering that area on your own is dangerous.
Sami did not notice.
Do you wear gloves?
Can I shake your hand?
You don't know my father, do you?
I'm now-now back with refreshments.
That's why I'm here.
He's my neighbor.
Tom thought it was unfair.
The hotel looks out on the lake.
Tom’s hands were cold.
She is indeed able to read.
It appears that he knows the secret.
Do you have a cell phone?
Mr. Mitchel suggested that I overpay the rest of the money before the end of the week.
She murdered herself.
You're not a doctor.
I know how you felt about us.
She's younger than he is.
I put it back where it belonged.
I'll take a book.
Tom left his phone in the car.
I wouldn’t be so sure.
I constantly dream about her.
Tom did not wear socks.
Tom would say no.
I'm a fireman.
There are islands in the sea.
Where is it now?
We are not very hungry yet.
There is probably an easy solution to your problem.

We need to start doing so.
Living in Japan is expensive.
I know how you feel about her.

I forgot her clean.

Fighting lasted a week.
When was the last time you laughed?
Tom's not going to give a speech today.
Why did you join the army?
I wouldn't blame you.
Flowers and trees need clean air and fresh water.
You're too late.
What we know about health has been learned through the study of diseases.
Tom sits at the window reading a book.
We're not going to be here after 2:30.
I like to eat meat.
I thought we could make it by 2:30.
He was jealous of my success.
Does Tom know how to dance?
Did you call him?
He kicks me!
She reads the paper every morning.
The bakery is slowly the slaughterhouse.
Please forgive me.
"Thank you." "You're welcome."
The food did not taste so bad at all.
I eat rice.
Can I open a window?
This wall is higher than that one.
It's raining.
Tom will be late.
I dare you to bridge that area.
I only bought a new pair of shoes.
We want it back.
The game begins tomorrow.
They can overcome their fear.
This can't be a real diamond.
Tom moved away.
Was Tom there?
Father recently returned to Japan.
This is my friend.
I know how you feel about him.
Please share my umbrella.
Tom will win you.
Can you open this door?
Her story brings back memories of my parents.
Tom is no longer going to get help from Mary.
I am saving so that I can go to Australia.
I know all about her.
I'm falling in love with you.
Tom and Mary are very busy.
It doesn’t matter what he says, don’t trust him.
You should have visited Kyoto.
I got up when it was still dark.
Find out all you can about her.
I came to talk to you.
I wonder what happened to Paul.
If God did not exist, we should have thought of him.
Can you help me with this?
We met in 2008. A year later, we got married.
She's not here.
He asked my mother.
Late in the fall, when the weather was rough, windy and wet, and the cold could penetrate the thickest garment, especially at sea, a poor boat with only two men sailed into the sea.
At night, all cats are rough.
Quiet!
This is my home now.
A bird flies.
He arrived late for 30 minutes.
He reaches out to an English-Japanese dictionary on the desk.
Whatever a man sows, that he will also reap.
I wish you had said that before.
I love my mother.
Tom would not object.
I'm much bigger than you are.
Tom looked closer.
I'm your father.
You will pay for it.
I have a place to keep looking.
Tom had a lot on his plate.
Do you choose red or white wine?
This is the next one!
I want to see your boss.
He was very tired.
How do you feel about them now?
We forgot her clean.
Japan is full of beautiful cities. Kyoto and Nara, for example.
I'll make it back for dinner.
I never thought it would be so easy.
Whose books are these?
Welcome to Australia.
He found his parents.
You can eat whatever you want.
It's really good!
The river that flows through Parrys is called the Seine.
I'm glad you finally came back.
