Gutach: Even more safety for pedestrians
They are not 100 meters from each other: On Tuesday, the new B 33-foot ramp at the village parking lot was put into operation - in sight of the older town hall lamp.
Two installations so close to each other: intention or tortoise?
This question was clearly answered yesterday by Gutach's mayor.
"The town hall lamp was installed at the time because it secures the school path," Eckert explained yesterday.
The Kluser traffic lights secure both cyclists and bus passengers and the Bergle residents.
The plant officially put into operation yesterday was important for the intersection area Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße.
We have the museum, two churches, spa park, bus stop, a doctor and a bank as well as the traffic flow from the residential area ›Grub‹.
"In the case of the high traffic and pedestrian rises, another traffic light had to come to their safety," says Eckert.
This is also confirmed by Peter Arnold of the Offenburg Regional Council.
"According to current measurements, on the B 33, about 12,000 vehicles per day drive the municipality of Gutach, of which about ten percent are heavy goods traffic," said Arnold.
Therefore, the construction of another traffic light is more than necessary: "Safety is just going on here," says Arnold.
A total of four traffic shows had been carried out and a roundabout was also envisaged, but due to the narrowness in the intersection area Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße was again rejected.
According to Arnold, everything was tested in the location selection of the traffic lights: "With an extra for us with particularly long wooden trunks of loaded transporters, we tested whether these vehicles can go out of the Sulzbach road to the B 33 without reversing the traffic lights".
The approximately 15 000 euro commercial plant itself is the "most modern of what is currently on the market", explained Arnold.
The system is equipped with coloured LEDs that are so bright that the lights can be clearly seen by the car drivers, for example, even in the case of deep sun.
And it is also economical: The older lighting systems consume about 100 watts, the new just eight watts.
There are three lighting systems per direction of travel.
Arnold explained the technology of the new system: It is equipped with two radar sensors.
If the pedestrian pushes the traffic light button, the upper radar sensor tests the traffic situation.
If the road is clear, comes immediately green for the pedestrian, if not, it takes about 15 seconds.
Another radar sensor checks whether the green phase can be completed for the pedestrian.
"If a group or disabled people cross the road, the green phase will be extended, so everyone will safely cross the road," said Arnold.
Of course, the driver had to think as a partner here and watch the road.
This was not the case yesterday: barely showed the traffic lights for pedestrians green, went through a top-class vehicle - in the case of bright red.
Josef Winkler has been writing about the needs of his childhood and youth for more than 30 years.
The catastrophes of his Catholic village childhood - the speechlessness, the hang of raw violence and blunt sexuality, the closeness and joylessness - have often described the Carinthian poet.
The Büchner award winner is known primarily as a prose author, theatre texts are rare in his work.
Collage from Prosatexten Gerhard Fresacher presents for his performance "weather lights on the tip of the tongue", which can now be seen in the Garage X at Petersplatz, a collage of prosatexten.
The theatre maker combines elements from the autobiographical novel "Der Leibeigene" (1987) with prosaminatures from "Leichnam, his family belauerend" (2003).
On the largely empty stage - important prop: a crumpled sofa, on which is supposedly copulated and masturbated - the eight-member ensemble hangs through the text material.
Director Fresacher seems to have little confidence in the text.
The 70-minute performance fills the template with a wealth of directing influences, known from the repertoire of post-dramatic forms.
The actresses in particular come up with the sometimes somewhat questionable scenesic implementations.
They are touched hard, dipped with their heads under water, with their evening robberies tucked to the wall.
Forced into cellophane or bodice, they stick to dangerously high sticks through the production, either monologue them loudly or lie completely muted on the stage floor.
However, the text hardly conveys itself in this strenuous way.
The best moments have the evening when sung - the bandwidth ranges from Deep Purple to popular song stuff.
Only towards the end comes the overly distorted performance a little to rest, and Winkler's absurd humor just flashes.
A blackbox in the car?
US road planners are looking for a source of money to repair the decaying highway system, and believe to have found the solution in a small black box that can be found in the dashboard of each car.
The devices that record every kilometre of traffic and report the information to the authorities are at the heart of a controversial attempt by Washington and the planning offices of the States to revise the outdated system of financing American roads.
The usually rather boring area of road planning has suddenly sparked an intense debate with colorful alliances.
Libertarians have allied themselves with environmental groups and are in favour of the government being able to use the small boxes to record the kilometres travelled – and possibly also where they were driven – and then use the information to calculate tax cuts.
The tea party is horrified.
The American Civil Rights Association (ACLU) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of concerns about data protection.
However, while Congress cannot agree on a course of action, several states no longer wait.
They are currently examining how they can change over the next ten years to a system in which drivers pay per mile.
Thousands of drivers have already tested the tachographs, some of which are equipped with GPS monitoring.
This is really a must for our country.
"It's nothing that we'll only possibly use," said Hasan Ikhrata, Managing Director of Southern California Assn. of Governments, who plans to record the miles travelled with all Californian drivers in the state from 2025.
The way we pay these taxes will change.
The technology for this is here.
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund, which is financed from the taxes paid by the US Americans at the stake, is shattered.
In America, however, more is done than in the past.
Cars consume less gasoline.
The state mineral oil tax of 18.4 cents per gallon (less than 4 cents per liter) has not increased for 20 years.
Politicians do not dare to raise the tax even for one cent at high prices.
"The petrol tax is simply not sustainable," says Lee Munnich, an expert in transport legislation at the University of Minnesota.
His state has recently equipped 500 cars with tachographs to test a mile-based payment system.
"This is the most useful alternative in the long term," he said.
Bureaucrats call it a miles-based user fee.
It is not surprising that the idea appeals to urban liberals, for example, because the tax could be used to influence driving behaviour in such a way that congestion and climate-damaging exhaust gases are reduced.
The Californian planners rely on the system to develop strategies to achieve the ambitious, legally anchored objectives of the state on climate change.
However, the Republican Bill Shuster from Pennsylvania, Chairman of the House Transportation Committee, has also stated that he sees in it the most valid long-term alternative.
The free marketers of the Reason Foundation are also inspired by the idea of having drivers pay after a distance travelled.
"This is not a tax that disappears in a black hole," says Adrian Moore, Vice-President of Reason's Guidelines.
People pay directly for what they get.
The movement is also supported by two former American transport ministers who, in a 2011 report, called on Congress to move towards miles-based settlement.
Last year, the U.S. Senate approved a $90 million pilot project that would have included 10,000 cars.
However, the majority in the House of Representatives prevented the intrusion and responded to the concerns of representatives from rural areas who often have to spend many miles on their way to work or to the city in their daily lives.
Several states and major cities are moving in this direction on their own.
The most committed is Oregon, which currently employs 5,000 drivers for the largest experiment in the country.
These drivers will soon pay the miles instead of the mineral oil tax to the state.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City is also considering such a thing.
Illinois tests it to a limited extent with trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes the transport ministries of 17 states on the east coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is currently investigating how the change could be introduced.
The concept is not a universal hit.
In Nevada, where 50 volunteers were recently equipped with the equipment, motorists were sceptical about the idea that the government could pursue each of their movements.
"Threats against Big Brother and such things were a major problem," explains Alauddin Khan, Head of Strategy and Result Management at the Nevada Ministry of Transport.
People didn't want it.
When the test started, the Nevada ACLU warned: "It would be relatively easy to turn the tachographs into adult monitors."
There is no need to build a gigantic, bulky technological infrastructure which would inevitably be used to collect data on the daily movements of individuals.
Nevada is one of a number of states that are now looking forward to affordable technology, with which the state can record the kilometers travelled, but not exactly when and where.
That, according to Khan, would also calm the public.
The pursuit of this technology has led some authorities to a small startup company called True Mileage in California.
The company was originally not involved in helping states to tax drivers.
Rather, it was their goal to take a foothold in an emerging market for car insurance, where drivers are to pay on the basis of the miles driven.
But the devices tested by them are also interesting for the road planners, because they do not work with GPS and only provide limited information that is regularly uploaded via modem.
"People are more willing to participate if their speed and locations are not recorded," said Ryan Morrison, Managing Director of True Mileage.
Some of these public pilot programmes have made great mistakes.
There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways of implementing this.
In Oregon, the planners experiment with giving drivers a number of options.
You can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or they do not choose any equipment at all and instead pay a flat-rate fee on the basis of the average miles driven by all the inhabitants of the state.
Others hope to be able to sell the concept of a suspicious public by equipping the devices with more functions than with fewer.
In New York City, traffic officials want to develop a system of taxation that also pays parking fees, pays insurance only for mileage driven and collect speed data from other vehicles in real time, which allows drivers to avoid congestion.
"Car drivers would be motivated to participate by the added value of the benefits offered by the system," says a city planning document.
However, some traffic planners wonder if the whole talk about paying per mile is not just a huge diversion.
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the area of San Francisco Bay, officials declared that Congress could easily solve the problem of the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund by increasing fuel tax.
An additional one-off fee or an annual fee could be imposed on drivers with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that consume little petrol, so that they too pay a fair share.
"There is no reason for an operation if an aspirin is sufficient," explains Randy Rentschler, Head of Legislation and Public Affairs of the Commission.
When we do that, hundreds of millions of drivers worry about their privacy and many other things.
Königsfeld: Small team beats waker
The volunteer fire brigade passed its autumn main test despite staff shortages with Bravour.
Only eleven men participated in the exercise.
Department Commander Hans Kammerer had chosen the property Feder on Burgberger Straße in his acceptance of the exercise.
There was said to have been a short circuit when sawing.
Two people were injured by the resulting fire and smoke, but one of them was able to send an emergency call.
After the first review of the situation by Hans Kammerer, two shielders of the Wehr made themselves ready to enter the building.
After a short time it was possible to find the first person and lead him to the open.
The second person had to be worn.
This was not so easy, as a narrow staircase was to be overcome.
The building, a workshop with integrated stable for two horses, was not easy to secure.
It stored a lot of wood and also straw balls in it.
Furthermore, there were electrical machines for woodworking.
The first fire attack occurred over the tank in the vehicle.
Another line was made via an overfloor hydrant at a distance of about 100 meters.
Now three erasures could be designed.
A hollow beam pipe was also used in the building.
Hans Kammerer also went about the exercise to show what to do with little available personnel.
In the serious case, support is given via the Königsfeld daily operation group.
The commander was satisfied with the course of the exercise.
Networking of universities and companies important
On his visit to the Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald district, Landtag President Guido Wolf was also informed in Titisee-Neustadt about where the workers of tomorrow came from.
At the Hochschwarzwald Funding Centre, he studied this important issue together with the headmasters of the vocational schools as well as the district school and the chairmen of the parent council.
"Education is an important location factor," emphasized Claudia Stehle, director of the Hans Thomas School, who presented the networked school project Hochschwarzwald.
Wolf was impressed by the model projects for training.
Since 2011, there has been a successful cooperation between the Funding Centre, the Kreisgymnasium and the Vocational School Centre.
He also praised family kindness in the district.
"It is important not only to have a view of the family phase, but also the phase of caring for family members due to demographic change," Wolf explained.
He also pointed out that more and more employees were caring for the care and care of their relatives.
"Without the support of employers, the resulting burden on employees can lead to the termination of the employment relationship," said Wolf.
But no one could afford to lose qualified workers, he continued.
Another particularly important factor was the networking of universities and businesses.
"For those who have already learned the benefits of the region during their studies often retain their acquired knowledge and skills in the regional economy, which contributes to the strengthening of the region," was the country's president's conviction.
For only if sufficient training places were offered could the need for skilled workers be met.
In his opinion, the location advantage of the district is its advantageous location in the south-west of Germany, close to France and Switzerland.
He also experienced the efforts already made to expand public passenger transport on his train journey from Titisee-Neustadt to Freiburg.
"Stand firm and ensure that public transport is improved," he said to the local politicians present.
Experienced with music an entertaining afternoon
For 15 years, the Kaul family has been inviting the Dieting seniors to coffee, cake and then to a Vesper.
In the past, older citizens were hosted in the rest area.
In the meantime, this afternoon will take place in the nursing home of St. Josef.
The locals were looking forward to the delicious cakes and cakes.
Later, there was sausage salad.
Silvia Kimmich-Bantle and her father Karl Kimmich were entertained with regular melodies.
The over 100-year-old natural stone wall as the leading boundary of the old schoolyard to Kirchstraße, which is before the renovation, is to be re-set on the renovation plan of the city of Bräunlingen.
In the days prior to the Kilbig, a small corner wall was installed during the first works of the renovation of the front school yard, for stabilising and static relief of the over one hundred years old natural stone wall with balustrade.
Alexander Misok of the Bräunlinger Stadtbauamt, says that the Landesdenkmalamt is involved in the planning process and to create a refurbishment concept for the old wall.
A cost calculation will then be carried out by experts, which will then be placed on the table by the municipal council to decide and determine the further course of action.
A decision on this is expected to be taken in the coming year.
After the renovation, paving and tree planting of the old school courtyard within the two side wings of the school built in 1912, it is necessary, in the foreseeable future, as a follow-up measure, to refurbish the necessary boundary walls from ground to ground and to put them on new ground.
The historic, one hundred-year-old barrier of the old schoolyard to the church street, is mainly due to water damage and frost damage, as there is no drainage, need to be refurbished and has a bow inclination forward.
Deep cracks in individual stones are evidence of weather damage, but the wall is currently not at risk of collapse.
A stable wall is a prerequisite for a schoolyard used by students, which has been done by the current fortifications.
Originally, schoolyard renovation was planned even in 2008/2009, but high unplanned expenditures led to a shift.
An important word in the historical school wall renovation, which has even been used for film shots, will be shared by the Landesdenkmalamt.
If there are regulations from this side, then the city of Bräunlingen hopes for grants from the monumentists.
The students of the Bräunlinger Elementary School, who are now being taught again in a well-refurbished old school building with new aula, can soon use the old schoolyard.
Özdemir wants to receive jazz education in Stuttgart
In the ongoing discussions about the future of the music universities in Baden-Württemberg, Cem Özdemir, Federal Chairman of the Greens, has now joined in.
"I think it is wrong to give up holistic training at the Stuttgart University of Music," Özdemir said the "Stuttgarten News".
Jazz and classics belong together at the jazz location Stuttgart.
Özdemir, who in Stuttgart is a favourite for a direct mandate in the Bundestag election on 22 September, contradicts the Green-Red State Government.
On the basis of an expert study, it forces a reorganization of the five music universities in Baden-Württemberg.
Afterwards, the Jazz and Pop course is to be transferred from the Musikhochschule Stuttgart to the Musikhochschule Mannheim.
U.S. border: Super Tunnel for Drug Trafficking Discovered
At the border between Mexico and the USA, investigators have discovered and shut down a super tunnel for drug trafficking.
As announced by the US customs authorities, the more than 500-metre long tube between Tijuana and San Diego was equipped with electricity, rails and a ventilation system.
Three suspects were thus arrested, eight tons of marijuana and almost 150 kilograms of cocaine were confiscated.
According to the information, the tunnel had not yet been put into service.
"These cartels are stupid if they think they could dig under the radar," said the U.S. Attorney General of Southern California, Laura Duffy, at a press conference in front of a warehouse in San Diego, where one end of the tunnel had been discovered.
Faced with the drug gangs, Duffy assured: "If you continue to build such tunnels and try to use them, we are determined to make this a huge waste of your dirty money."
Both the US authorities and the Mexican security forces are in a long-term fight against the drug cartel.
Since 2006, more than 77,000 people have been killed in Mexico in connection with drug crime.
Designed by experts
Due to the extensive equipment of the tunnel, the investigators assume that it was designed by architects and engineers and that the construction took about a year.
The track system was so equipped that electric cars could be used there.
On the Mexican side, the entrance is located in a building 80 meters from the border.
According to the authorities, a ladder leads 20 meters into the depth to the actual tunnel entrance.
The tunnel has a cross section of 1.20 meters in height and 90 centimeters in width.
He would also have been able to promote illegal immigration towards the United States.
Two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the Cocaine Fund.
The third, a Mexican, was captured for the confiscated marijuana.
All three are threatened as a maximum sentence of lifelong deprivation, as officials said.
Since 2006 eight such tunnels have been discovered, it continued at the press conference in San Diego.
But it was the first time that cocaine was found in such a tunnel.
Cocaine is usually smuggled in smaller quantities and not through tunnels.
This shows the "desperation" of the drug gangs, whose traditional routes have now been cut off, said Bill Sherman of the DEA drug hunt in San Diego.
They'd do anything to get to the United States.
No details were given to the arrested, at least one of them being Mexicans, it was said.
You have to expect imprisonment for up to ten years.
2014 will be Geisinger's festival year
The anniversary of the city of Geisingen on the occasion of the 1250.
The return of the first documentary mention is getting closer and closer.
If the year ends in good eight weeks, the anniversary year is on.
Geisingen and Kirchen-Hausen were first mentioned in document 794 together.
In churches, a document was made mentioning both places.
On March 15th, there will be an official start to the anniversary year, and since Geisingen currently has no hall, this opening event will take place in the place where both were first mentioned 1250 years ago, in Kirchen-Hausen.
During the anniversary, several events are planned in Geisingen as well as in church-houses.
Church Houses will be the 1250 in July on a holiday weekend from 18 to 20 July.
Celebrate again.
On Friday with a celebration, on Saturday and Sunday with a festival around the Kirchtalhalle.
On this weekend there is also the Church House feast.
Urban Music Director Rudolf Barth has written an order composition for the city on the occasion of the anniversary, which is listed on three dates.
On 21 June together with the Sonnwendfeier des Schwarzwaldverein, on 12 July in the Arena with fireworks and on 13 December as the first concert of city music in the new Festhalle.
This will be completed and inaugurated in the anniversary year, the official date will be the last week of September, on 27 and 28 September.
On the occasion of the Geisinger City Jubilee, a new chronicle will also be published.
"It should become a chronicle not only of Geisingen itself, but a printed work on today's Geisingen, church-houses, Leipferdingen, Aufingen and Gutmadingen," said Mayor Walter Hengstler.
And also today's Geisingen celebrates 2014 birthday, in 1974 the present-day community was completed with the incorporations.
The new chronicle will then be presented on 21 or 22 November in the new Festhalle in Geisingen.
2014 is also another year with many jubilees.
The Narrenzunnft Strohglonki starts on February 8th with a customs evening on the occasion of its 60th anniversary, the Harmony Gutmadingen will be 90 years old and will have the banquet on March 29th and then celebrates the district music festival from May 1st to 4th.
The Altenwerk Leipferdingen is 40 years old, the Geisinger School has been at the new location for 50 years and celebrates this on 10 May, the Musikverein Polyhymnia Leipferdingen is 150 years old and celebrates this in the framework of the Fountain Festival from 4 to 7 July.
The city of Geisingen was first mentioned in a certificate of donation, which is owned by the monastery of St. Gallen, in 764.
The document was made in churches (houses), which was a court of law at the time.
Both municipalities are therefore mentioned in the same document.
Reason to celebrate this 1250-year-old accordingly in 2014, in addition, the municipal reform is also 40 years behind.
Advice Takes Tracklings in View
Should the railway crossing "Am Hirschen" be extensively converted to increase road safety?
Yes, the councils decided.
Schiltach must take control of EUR 220 000.
Deutsche Bahn wants to improve the Kinzigtal railway in the coming year.
In particular, the safety of railway crossings is to be increased - there are frequent collisions of trains with other vehicles nationwide.
If the municipalities agree to the restructuring measures, they must participate with one third in the costs, the rest share the railway and the federal government.
Schiltach's mayor Roland Gleißhaber explained to the municipal council the special features of the Bah transition "Am Hirschen".
There the city plans to build a bay at the height of the tunnel mouth west of the railway tracks.
Larger vehicles, such as those transporting longwood, could also be on the other side without having to block the tracks.
Therefore, Greßeber proposed to construct a necessary supporting wall in such a way that the city could widen the subsequent road in due course to ensure a smooth traffic flow.
This was discussed controversially in the municipal council, as some councils doubted the need for road transport: Thomas Kipp brought the critics' mood to the point: "Do we have to take so much money because of so few vehicles?"
Mayor Thomas Haas contradicted: The railway crossing "Hirschen" was regularly used for longwood transports.
Even wood from the area "Kuhbach" was partly transported over this route, because the vehicles up to 20 meters long could not use the route on the Häberlesbrücke, because they could not turn to the main road there.
In addition, the route serves as a diversion for those vehicles that are not allowed to use the tunnel when the main road is blocked, Haas argued.
Since Kirchberg and Schlossberg tunnels need to be rebuilt and refurbished, as is currently the case in Wolfach, the railway crossing "Am "Hirschen" could also have an important transport significance for a longer period of time.
The councils agreed to investigate the costs of the planned road expansion.
Notwithstanding this, it was agreed by a majority that the necessary supporting wall should be built in such a way that the city could extend the subsequent road towards "Bahnhofstraße" to around 5.5 metres for the transport of passengers.
On the other hand, the conversion of the rail crossing at the Gerberei Trautwein could lead to a very different problem, which concerns access to the rising "Geroltzhäuserweg".
The administration had had the railway conversion plans examined by the engineering office Breinlinger, as she had doubts as to whether the planned connection of the Geroltzhäuser Weg was then possible without further delay.
The investigation concluded that it could not be excluded that the road inclination conditions could lead to longer vehicles.
In turn, the city is responsible for this as a road freight carrier.
The conversion could therefore lead to liability disputes.
Since both the timber exit and the bending function worked in the current state of expansion, Haas argued that it should not be agreed to the conversion of the railway crossing.
At this point, too, the risk of collision of the train with a vehicle in transition is significantly lower than that of the other crossings, because there is directly next to the centre of the stop where a good visual connection exists.
Even trains from the main train station would have to be braked at this point so that no collision is threatened.
The majority refused to accept the conversion of this railway crossing, as the town of Schiltach had to "baden out" the problem with on-site vehicles, the councils said, since the railway could withdraw from the responsibility after completion of the construction work.
The body considers the conversions to the railway crossings "Vor Heubach" and "Vor Kuhbach", for which already cross-agreements with the railway have been made.
Esa decides on large space missions: missions for billions
Remote planets, gravity waves or black holes - experts from the European Space Agency now have to agree on two major projects that they want to start in the next few years.
30 suggestions were available, five are still in the race.
Far worlds.
Astronomers have already found more than 1000 planets in other stars.
Whether there are at least some of them alive, nobody knows.
The selection is difficult: Should you search for gravity waves?
Or would you rather explore the origin of the cosmos?
Or, after earthlike planets, can they find and thus perhaps discover extraterrestrial life?
These questions are precisely the responsibility of the European Space Agency, Esa.
For their program "Cosmic Vision", they are looking for ideas for two major space projects that are to make a decisive contribution to research.
The budget for such "L-missions" is about one billion euros each.
The start is expected to be 2028 and 2034.
At the beginning of September, the elite of European space research met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions.
30 ideas were debated, five of which have now become the narrower choice.
Numerous bodies examine the proposals, check the researchers.
In the next few days, a final decision will be taken by the Scientific Programme Committee.
A total of four major questions have been selected by the Esa, to which the missions of the "Cosmic Vision" programme initiated in 2007 should find answers.
What are the conditions for the creation of planets and life?
The exact processes of the formation of stars from large gas clouds - and thus also the formation of planets orbiting these stars - are still in the proverbial darkness.
A large infrared telescope in space could penetrate this darkness.
And if a star has planets, under what circumstances can life arise there?
In order to address this question, the Space Telescope "Cheops" will be launched in 2017, with 500 already known planetary systems being studied in our nearer environment.
But the possibilities are limited, Cheops is a small mission with a budget of 150 million euros.
With larger instruments, astronomers could depict earth-like planets and even analyze the composition of their atmospheres and thus search for "biomarkers": gases that are considered an indicator of biological activity.
How does the solar system work?
This question, too, should ultimately provide an explanation of the conditions for the emergence of life.
An important role is played by the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field as well as the particle irradiation from it with the planetary system.
In our solar system, these processes can be examined for example.
With the "Solar Orbiter", the Esa has already approved an M-Class mission (where the budget is about half a billion euros) for this issue.
The probe is to start in 2017 and closely observe the surface and activity of the sun.
Of great interest to the researchers are Jupiter and his moons.
They want to find out what role the giant planet has played in the development of the solar system.
The Esa provides for the first of the three L-missions of the Cosmic Vision program.
The Juice (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer) probe is expected to begin its journey in 2022.
Eight years later, it reaches Jupiter and aims to investigate the atmosphere of the planet as well as the icy moons of Europe, Kallisto and Ganymede.
What are the fundamental physical laws of the universe?
The universe offers many ways to study matter under extreme conditions and thus to investigate whether the natural laws we know are still valid there.
Perhaps there are also deviations that could lead the physicists to a new theory under which all known laws of nature can be united.
How did the universe originate and what does it consist of?
13.7 billion years ago, our cosmos was created by the big bang.
In addition to the ordinary matter of stars, planets and living beings as we exist, there is dark matter, whose gravity holds galaxies and clusters of galaxies together, and dark energy, through which the expansion of the universe accelerates.
So far, the researchers do not know which physical laws were valid in the first seconds of the big bang, nor what dark matter and dark energy consist of.
With "Euclid", the Esa has already approved an M-mission here, which is scheduled to start in 2020.
With a special telescope, the probe is intended to investigate the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time in the entire sky, enabling conclusions to be drawn about the nature of dark matter and dark energy.
Who could make the race
Of the 30 proposals, only two will remain at the end of the selection procedure.
According to many experts, "E-Lisa", a sophisticated concept for detecting gravitational waves, has the best chances of being granted an L-mission.
These include physicists who understood changes in the structure of space time, which Albert Einstein had predicted nearly 100 years ago.
They have not been proven to this day.
Elisa could do that, the scientists hope behind the project.
The mission provides for a two- or three-probe detector stationed in space.
Unlike plants on earth, it could also detect waves of gravitation that occurred at the time of the big bang, thus providing new insights into the formation of the cosmos.
Four other proposals are still competing for the second L-mission: a large X-ray telescope called "Athena", which is to explore black holes, "Icy Planets", another mission to the outer planets of the solar system, "Prism", a mission to measure the cosmic background radiation, and the "Exoplanet Finder", which is to detect and investigate earth-like planets.
There are already proposals for sample transport from Mars, for the exploration of moon, Venus and asteroids and for solar physics.
Snowden willing to "cooperate" with Germany in terms of US surveillance
Edward Snowden, the Whistleblower of the U.S. Secret Service, has declared that he is ready to travel to Berlin and proclaim before the German Bundestag if the American National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander do not give any answers about their activities.
The German MP Hans-Christian Ströbele met Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he received asylum to discuss the statement in Germany.
In a letter by Snowden, which was presented to the media in Berlin on Friday by Ströbele, he writes: "Even if the result of my efforts was demonstrably positive, my government continues to treat a dissenting opinion as a betrayal and tries to criminalise political expression with a threat of punishment, in which no defence is possible."
To tell the truth is not a crime.
In the letter Snowden writes that he is convinced that the support of the international community could convince the American government to drop the charge against him.
The US Department of Justice charges include espionage and theft of state property.
German Minister of the Interior Hans-Peter Friedrich said to him about time online: "If Mr. Snowden is ready to speak with German representatives, we will find ways to make this possible."
Relations between the USA and Germany are strained by the allegations that the NSA has heard the phone from Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Thomas Oppermann, the Member who heads the Parliamentary Committee responsible for the secret service, said that the opportunity should be taken to listen to Snowden as a witness, if possible, "without jeopardizing him and ruining relations with the United States completely".
Ströbele, a member of the Greens, published a picture of himself and Snowden in his Twitter feed.
He was accompanied by two German journalists during his visit to Russia.
Ströbele explained that according to the lawyer of former NSA employee Snowden could not return to Russia if he left the country.
If Snowden said so in Germany, he needed a guarantee that he would be safe there, the honourable Member said.
Snowden explains in his letter that he was exposed to a "serious and ongoing" persecution campaign that had driven him out of his home.
However, he was affected by the global reaction to 'my act of political expression'.
Citizens around the world as well as high-level politicians – including in the United States – have described the revelations of an uncontrolled system of comprehensive surveillance as a merit to the general public.
In his letter Snowden makes an offer of cooperation to the German authorities, "when the difficulties surrounding the humanitarian situation have been solved".
Frontier Airlines charges for hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to $100 for passengers who want to stow their hand luggage on their flight.
Frontier Airlines intends to charge up to $100 for a piece of hand luggage and $2 for coffee or lemonade, even if the announcement on Wednesday announced that passengers would keep the whole can.
The new fee applies to hand luggage in the luggage compartment above the seat, small bags under the seat are still free of charge.
Frontier explained that 25 US dollars were calculated if the fee was paid in advance, and 100 US dollars for travellers who first paid on the plane.
Frontier spokesperson Kate O'Malley said that the fee of $100 was aimed at moving travellers, in advance to take care of the payment.
"We don't want to charge this sum," she said.
In 2008, airlines started charging fees for the first and second parcels of luggage.
Passengers who tried to bypass them have therefore stuffed as much as possible into their hand luggage, which means that the luggage compartments above the seat are often crowded.
Fees are a way of moving passengers to take less on board.
O'Malley said that with the new fee it's not really about making money.
It's about the most loyal clients of Frontier who would have clearly expressed that it's getting harder and harder to find space in the compartment above the seat.
Passengers who buy your tickets on the airline’s website do not have to pay.
This means that a passenger may be allowed to carry a luggage free of charge on the flight path of Frontier, but the next person will have to pay 100 dollars for a comparable luggage.
O'Malley explained that Frontier's website and check-in procedures would be changed so that passengers would be informed of the fee before coming to the flight stage.
Frontier's new hand luggage fee only comes into force in summer, there is no exact date yet.
Passengers often scoff at luggage surcharges and other charges, but airlines like to resort to them.
They argue that the carriage of luggage costs money and passengers should pay this service if they wish it.
Many on Wall Street regard the new baggage charges as a sign that airlines are taking enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of loss.
Most, however, leave the fingers of charges for hand luggage so far.
Spirit Airlines Inc. claimed first fees for hand luggage three years ago and later Allegiant Air followed, also a cheap flyer.
The only other airline with such a fee was the Hungarian Wizz Air, explained the airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who is paying attention to the additional charges.
He estimated in a report of December 2011 that the hand luggage fee Spirit would bring in $50 million annually.
Sorensen, who previously held a senior position at Midwest Airlines, recently flew with spirit and was curious about what he would expect if passengers were faced with the company's unusual hand luggage charge.
"The boarding process was one of the most successful things I've experienced in aviation in my career," he said.
I was expecting to see teethnails and hand-held discussions on the flight ladder.
"The plane was full," he said, "and the boarding ran like lubricated."
Frontier also follows Spirit with the 2 dollars required for coffee, tea, lemonade or juice.
The company stated that passengers who bought lemonade or juice should keep the whole can and be refilled free of charge.
Water is still free.
US Airways had briefly tried to demand money for refreshment drinks in 2008, but did so seven months later after passengers complained and no other large company had moved.
Frontier's step to collect charges for hand luggage if passengers do not buy directly from the airline is the latest initiative with which customers should be directed to their own website.
Airlines pay online travel agencies such as Orbitz 10 to 25 US dollars per ticket sold.
This provides an incentive for all companies to move passengers to buy directly from them instead of via an online travel agency.
Frontiers have, however, gone the farthest in this area.
In September, the company began to grant only half as many frequent flyer miles when booking via an online travel agency.
On Wednesday the miles were reduced to 25 percent of the flight distance.
Therefore, a third-party flight with Frontier over 1000 miles will only bring in 250 miles.
Passengers can also reserve places only when buying directly on Frontier's website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base at its headquarters in Denver, but the business shrinks and the company loses money.
The revenue decreased by 9 percent and the air capacity decreased by almost 13 percent in the first quarter, as can be read in the financial report published by the parent company Republic Airways Holdings Inc. on Wednesday.
Republic has tried to get control of Frontier's finances as part of the sale of the company.
Proverbs From the Bible
Some 40 women visited the last women's breakfast this year in the Evangelical church of Bisingen.
The theme of the day in the parish house were "Punishments From the Bible" and "Meditions From the Middle Ages".
After breakfast, Cita Köhler, the chairman of the church council, addressed the Bible proverbs in a talk.
"Words contain life wisdom, regulations or warnings," she explained.
She compared several proverbs with the corresponding Bible passages and explained the meaning.
She called proverbs such as: Wooden eyes be watchful, as scales fall from the eyes, cast an eye upon someone, the Lord gives him sleep, wash his hands in innocence.
Several times the speaker also advised their listeners about the proverb.
The mediaeval speeches accepted the church councilwoman Christel Dehner: All good things are three, blue, a bit of a mess.
She explained the meaning and origin of the sayings she called "bringing to the past".
At the end, a tombola was delivered.
The prizes were covered on a table and were humorously described before they were handed over to the winners.
Among the visitors to the breakfast round, Mayor Roman Waizenegger also mixed.
Learning instead of unemployed: pilot project for unskilled people in tourism
Today, a pilot project for the tourism industry is being launched at the Mecklenburg Lake Plate.
Under the leadership of the Federal Employment Agency, 49 women and men who already work as unskilled workers in the industry are to be qualified for three winters to professionals for hotels and restaurants.
"The new thing is that the six-month courses end with degrees," said Carmen Wiechert of the Neubrandenburg Labour Agency.
The benefits are diverse: the participants would not be unemployed, the companies would get trained professionals who were increasingly lacking in hotels and restaurants, and the Agency would not have to finance unemployment.
The Chamber of Industry and Commerce in Neubrandenburg as well as the Deutsche Hotel- und Gaststättenverband (Dehoga) Mecklenburg-Vorpommern are also involved in the project.
NSA states that an "internal error" and not hacker is due to the crash of the website
The shadowy National Security Agency stated on late Friday that a mistake had paralyzed its public website for a few hours and not hackers, as was claimed online.
"NSA.gov was not accessible for several hours this night because an internal error occurred during a planned update," explained the spy agency in an e-mail message.
The problem will be fixed this evening.
The claim that the failure was caused by a distributed Denial of Service attack (DDoS) was not true.
In the early evenings, online server trackers had noticed that the NSA website was not accessible for at least six hours and this is still not available to some users.
Prior to that, a spokesman from the NSA had explained to ABC News that the sensitive internal network of the Authority was "in no way" compromised.
Secret information is not in danger, says the speaker.
At least one group of hacktivists claimed to have paralyzed the NSA website with a DDoS attack.
In such attacks, the target website is flooded with page calls until the servers are overloaded and the website collapses.
Cybertactics is relatively simple and the attacks do not serve to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
The former super secret NSA, whose nickname was once No Search Agency (no such authority), is now in the light of the public and looks at the revelations made in recent months about its extensive surveillance programme in both the home and abroad – a result of the secret NSA data stolen and published by disillusioned former NSA employee Edward Snowden.
The growing controversy about the secret service sparked initial speculation that the incident today was the result of a targeted cyber operation.
The number of people without a job fell slightly in October by 22 to 1,307.
Although the rate was 3.1 percent better than last year and also better than in September, "we would have hoped for more," says Monika Felder-Bauer, Deputy Managing Director of the Agency for Work in Sonthofen.
Many companies have reacted so far to attitudes.
According to Felder-Bauer, one reason for this is: "We do not have any specialists in crafts, health care and care for the elderly".
Since September, there have also been new job opportunities for staff in the hotel and restaurant industry.
The winter season begins in mid-December.

Loss of profit in Bombardier after drop in delivery quantities and orders
Canadian aircraft and railway manufacturer Bombardier Inc reported a 15 percent decrease in net profit on Thursday after it was put under pressure by falling orders and deliveries to aircraft in the third quarter as well as contract problems in the railway sector.
Bombardier, based in Montreal, also did not publish flight test data for his brand new CSeries aircraft and did not provide any new information as to whether the aircraft could go to commercial use in accordance with the ambitious schedule next September.
Up to now, only three additional take-offs have followed the pilot flight of the test aircraft, which makes it appear questionable whether the test phase is as planned.
The results remained behind the forecasts and led to a decline of more than eight percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, analyst at National Bank Financial, reduced his assessment from "outperform" to "sector performance" on Thursday in view of the limited price potential of the stock in the next one to two quarters.
"Weaker delivery numbers were expected for aircraft, but we are clearly disappointed by the development of margins in the transport sector," said Doerksen in a customer letter.
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries as the aircraft test program progresses.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more sceptical about the programme.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries aircraft series will be able to catapult the company into the lower market segment, which is currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was introduced to the public in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delays.
However, binding orders for the CSeries with 177 are so far moderate, as potential buyers are waiting for the results of the flight tests and want to see if the company's claims regarding fuel efficiency and cost-saving potential of the new jet aircraft are true.
There are currently a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies.
Chairman Pierre Beaudoin is confident that Bombardier will achieve its goal of 300 binding orders at the beginning of the commercial use of the jet.
On Thursday, management also assured analysts and media that the program was on schedule.
"The test aircraft was no longer on the ground than expected," said Beaudoin at a telephone conference and added that ground tests and software updates had been started during the aircraft's service.
Each manufacturer plans differently.
We have decided to take a first flight and then add a review period, which we have also done.
This is happening throughout the entire flight programme.
The second out of five test aircraft is expected to start in the next few weeks, the rest shortly after, it was called by company.
Nevertheless, analysts remain sceptical whether 12 months after the maiden flight the first customer can take on a CSeries aircraft.
Bombardier stated that it was reviewing the planning for commissioning (EIS) and would update it in the next few months.
"The slow progress of the flight test – even if it is obviously in line with Bombardier's internal planning – strengthens our view that commissioning is moving to the first quarter of 2015," said Doerksen.
In the third quarter, with the end of September 30, Bombardier's net profit fell to 147 million dollars or 8 cents per share of 172 million dollars or 9 cents per share a year earlier.
The adjusted earnings per share are unchanged at 9 cents.
Sales fell slightly from 4.2 billion to 4.1 billion dollars.
Analysts expected a profit of 10 cents per share and sales of $4.56 billion, says Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world's fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer states that it delivered 45 aircraft this quarter, a decrease of 57 last year.
Net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26.
The order stock in the aerospace sector was 32.9 billion dollars on September 30, and was therefore unchanged compared to December 31.
"In the field of aviation and space, the results were in line with our specifications, but the low order intake and market conditions as a whole were disappointing," said Beaudoin.
Sales in the aerospace sector fell by 13 percent to two billion dollars.
Bombardier, the world's largest railway manufacturer, announced that sales in this sector had risen by almost 11 percent to 2.1 billion dollars.
The order stock in the transport sector was 32.6 billion dollars on 30 September and was slightly increased compared with 31 December.
The profit margin in the transport sector has been affected by settlement problems in some major contracts.
According to company management, there will be new requirements for the fourth quarter.
In the afternoon trade on Thursday, the bombardier share dropped by 8.5 percent and was $4.83 in Canada, after it was also announced that the Google Financial Director Patrick Pichette will change to the Board of Directors.
Brazilian Embraer SA, the world's third-largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and bombardier's tightest rival, reported a ten percent decline in quarterly profits on Thursday.
USA: Shooting at Los Angeles Airport
An unknown person fired shots at LAX Airport on Friday morning (local time).
While the air traffic controller informed Twitter that the shooter was in custody, the Los Angeles Times reported that the man was dead.
A security officer had also been killed.
Media also reported several casualties.
US President Barack Obama was constantly informed about the situation, said White House spokesman Jay Carney.
The incident occurred in Terminal 3. Eyewitnesses reported having seen a shooter with a gun in one of the departure halls, as several media reported.
A traveler told the transmitter CNN that many people sought protection in panic.
Travelers would have yelled and cried out to children.
A panic broke out among the waiting, many would have been hiding behind chairs for fear.
He heard two shots, says a traveler from the Los Angeles Times.
An employee of the TSA security authority had suffered a gunshot injury at the foot.
The scene had been "like in a movie".
After that he himself had been taken to a security area, the man reported.
The shots are supposed to have fallen close to a security control area.
Airport building evacuated
On television, there were numerous ambulances and police cars in front of a terminal.
Hundreds of people were rescued from the building.
Users published photos on Twitter of a special operation command and a gun lying on the ground.
The incident began at 9.30 a.m. (local time) as the airport management announced via Twitter.
The access roads were blocked, which, according to CNN, resulted in long backstamps.
Apart from landings, air traffic had been temporarily suspended.
However, on CNN several planes were also observed at the start.
Terminal 3 is operated mainly by smaller US airlines.
Los Angeles LAX Airport is one of the largest airports in the United States.
Cocaine-dependent lawyer warning drug lords against police investigation has to go to jail.
Basharat Ditta, 42, passed on information to underworld size Neil Scarborough
The lawyer was afraid his secret drug addiction might come to light.
He was sentenced to three years in prison by Liverpool Crown Court
A well-known criminal defender who warned a drug baron against a major police investigation because he was afraid his secret drug addiction could be exposed was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, provided the underworld size Neil Scarborough with sensitive information on his drug trafficking activities after being compromised by his own cocaine addiction.
The "first-class" lawyer named "Bash" was arrested in his house in 2011 after the police monitored Scarborough, which he had represented in an earlier drug trial.
Officials observed Scarborough (32) delivering three bags of cocaine at the lawyer's house in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was with colleagues at a meal at the barroom.
The investigation revealed that Ditta regularly consumed Class A drugs after tests found traces of cocaine in his hair, wallet and credit cards.
Over a period of eight months between January and August 2011, he attempted to obtain unauthorized information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his partners.
All four suspects were monitored by the police during a major investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
Together with 32 other people, they were later arrested after the police secured £1.5 million in a series of house searches and £200,000 in cash for heroin and cocaine.
Ditta, 42, passed information on to the criminals because he feared that his drug addiction could become public.
Today, Ditta, who works for the Forbes Solicitors law firm in Blackburn, was found guilty and convicted on Liverpool Crown Court after a three-week trial in two counts for obstructing justice.
He admitted to cocaine possession at an earlier survey.
The lawyer was transferred after the police found out in their investigations against Scarborough that he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspect and saw him go to Ditta's house and put the drugs there with a purity of 60 percent in a black golf glove under the lawyer's garbage can.
Shortly after he delivered the drugs, Scarborough made regular calls to Ditta, who was at the Blackburn Rovers football stadium in Ewood Park.
The lawyer returned home, picked up the drugs, and then nine messages were exchanged between the two.
In court it was known that Ditta was a "regular consumer" of cocaine after testing drugs of Class A had been discovered in his hair, wallet and credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested, but refused to take cocaine and said that he had spoken to the suspected dealer because he was his client and claimed that her discussion was subject to the "lawyer's secret".
During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards, but they were secured and a hair sample was taken.
At the police interrogation he stated that he was running an office under his private address as well as at the workplace and that clients would call him at home for legal matters.
It was announced in court that he had called important actors in drug trafficking, some of whom he had previously represented, after significant arrests and informed about what the investigators knew about them.
Public prosecutor Anne Whyte said, "A criminal lawyer should know better than anyone else that you don't break the law."
Ditta is accused of abuse of his position as a criminal defender because he has committed too much with certain clients.
The relationship in question is not simply that of a drug trafficker, but of a drug trafficker who supplies his lawyer with drugs.
Part of his communications were undoubtedly legitimate, for he was the lawyer of these persons.
But this went far beyond the limits of a normal relationship between lawyer and client.
He countered the police investigation as far as possible so that they could continue to pursue their criminal activities.
Mr Ditta thus brought his profession into disrepute.
He was too close to certain clients, especially Scarborough, and he allowed his independence to be compromised.
Ditta pointed out every misbehavior and claimed: "If I were a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and wanted to pass on information to Scarborough, then I would not wait 15 hours but do so immediately."
But after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead of the Lancashire Police said: "Mr. Ditta has made the step of a criminal from a criminal when he started to buy drugs from organized criminals."
His cocaine dependence led to a hopeless compromise and made him receptive to the motives of leading members of organized crime who instructed him to obtain valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and ensure public confidence and confidence.
Ditta has lost this trust and tried to hide behind the facade of his profession.
The Serious and Organized Crime Unit of Lancashire led the investigation against Ditta, which also led to a conviction in three cases for possession of cocaine and legal disability, which underscores our determination to bring criminals to justice.
This case should be a warning to criminals and shows that no one can escape the arm of the law.
We'll find you and bring you to court.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after he declared himself guilty of the conspiracy to deal with heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty-five more people involved in drug trafficking were sentenced to total sentences of 153 years for drug offences.
On his website Ditta published an area of questions and answers about himself in which he stated that his dream job was to represent as lawyer clients in the death cell in America, his ultimate guest at dinner was Mohammed Ali and opportunity inequality was the motivation for his work.
Revolutionary work of church music
At the end of the celebrations on the occasion of his 160th anniversary, the Song Crane Dunningen will reframe two services with the "German Fair" by Franz Schubert.
After the great success of the musical "Rock my Life", which impressed the audience in the spring of this year, the song wreath will enrich at the end of the anniversary year two services with the performance of the German fair by Franz Schubert.
On Saturday, October 26th, this extraordinary exhibition will be held at the St. Martinus Church Dunningen and on Sunday, October 27th, from 10:15 a.m. at the church of St. John Baptist in Lackendorf.
The so-called Deutsche Messe with the original title "Singings for the Celebration of the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass", D 872, is a spiritual music work by composer Franz Schubert from 1826 and was almost considered revolutionary at the time of its formation.
The trade fair is held within the framework of the services of God, as the client Johann Philipp Neumann had in mind.
Under the direction of Hermann Schneider, the choir is accompanied by the brass group of the Musikverein Frohsinn Tennenbronn and Noemi Lokodi at the organ.
Haslach: skepticism is a loss of confidence
For example, with the elections to the parish in 2015, the Haslach (SE) Seeing Care Unit will change fundamentally.
There is only one parish church in common for all six parishes.
On Saturday, the bodies from Haslach, Hofstetten, Mühlenbach, Fischerbach, Steinach and Welschensteinach prepared for the changes.
It is no longer necessary to change the basic decisions of the Diocese, and it is up to the parish councils to implement them as satisfactorily as possible.
Over the course of the day, it became particularly clear that the skepticism of the New one is hesitant but hesitant to look forward to confidence.
From the conceptions and expectations of the 2015 innovations to concrete proposals on the future composition and size of the parish church, the extremely constructive discussions of the six bodies with the main officials of the Seelsorgtete team were enough.
Regional Dean Georg Schmitt presented the new guidelines for care units in the Archdiocese of Freiburg on the basis of a presentation.
Thereafter, the SE Haslach, as a church community, will form a public law body which will enter into the rights and obligations of the six individual churches.
There will only be a common parish council and a foundation council in which the parish priest is represented.
At least two elected members are to be represented from each parish, in which six parishes are formed so-called community teams on site.
Their task will be to promote church life in the place in the future.
The question of the finances of the individual parishes then showed considerable need for discussion.
The innovations provide that accumulated credits are retained in the parishes for purpose.
The liabilities, on the other hand, are transferred to the whole community.
Especially with regard to the large planned investments, whose commitment then meets all parishes, there was great concern.
"Even in the past, only projects that could be managed by the individual parishes alone were invested," relativized Haslach's parish chairman Bruno Prinzbach.
Practical experience with a joint body for five parishes described Barbar Ritter, the chairman of the board in the Seelsorgeunit Schutterwald-Neuried.
They had in 2006 made themselves the task of "Being One, Stay Five" and had to find that this is not so easy at all.
The bodies of the Haslacher Seelsorgeunit then worked to answer the questions about the future composition and size of the joint parish as well as the practical work of the parish teams.
The preparations will be concreteized at further meetings and decided at a further joint meeting of all six bodies next spring.
In the end, parish priest Michael Schöner from Steinach presented the new logo of the care unit, which was approved by a clear majority.
In Pfullendorf the electricity becomes more expensive
The citizens of Pfullendorf have to adjust to higher electricity costs.
As the managing director of the Stadtwerke, Jörg-Arne Bias, confirmed in relation to the SÜDKURIER, a four-member Pfullendorfer family incurs 70 to 90 euros of additional costs per year.
The main reason for the forthcoming price increase is the increase in the so-called EEC contribution from 5.277 to 6.3 cents per kilowatt hour.
This amount is re-established each year in October by the four operators of the large electricity stations.
These figure the additional costs they incur from the energy transition, which they can collect through a charge above the electricity price.
The municipal works Pfullendorf form the last link in this chain.
In its forecasts, the Supervisory Board of the Energy Company had even assumed a higher yield, as Jörg-Arne Bias reports.
Now the concrete payments would have to be calculated before the municipal works could inform their customers about the exact price increase next week.
"We're assuming an increase of 1 cent plus x," says Bias, where the number would be closer to the 2 cents.
Light on permanent red: watch out for waiting time
Sometimes a traffic light just doesn't turn green.
The contact loop in the road does not respond, or the light sign is defective.
Then what to do - drive at Red?
If a person has waited long enough for a red light and the crossing is free, he can continue, explains Stuttgart lawyer Ralf Becker in the magazine "Motorrad".
However, the waiting time had to be "adequate", which could be interpreted on a case-by-case basis.
Becker advises to persist for at least five minutes before a malfunction of the traffic light is expected.
However, anyone who continues the journey despite red light must be aware that he is fully responsible for an accident caused by it.
Anyone who tolerates less than five minutes may not wait long enough, warns Becker and refers to a decision of the Supreme Court of Hamm.
In the negotiated case, a driver had ignored the traffic lights after about three minutes of continuous red and had to be responsible for a negligent red light violation.
The traffic light was not defective, but it fell on green a little later.
A driving ban was spared him because of the special situation - but not the fine.
Municipal Council is looking forward to a solid household
Whenever it comes to the budget at municipal council meetings, Mayor Ralph Gerster laughs well.
The municipality säckl in Herdwangen-Schönach is well filled and debt has not been known to the administration since 2005.
The 2012 financial year can also be booked as a full success in this sense.
This was made clear in the presentation of the annual accounts for 2012.
As Andrea Rothmund explained, the administrative budget of around EUR 7.6 million over EUR 1 million would have been higher than planned.
The surplus of the administrative budget was also around EUR 1.8 million above the approach.
The surplus was mainly due to higher business tax revenue and the municipal share of income tax.
The asset budget was again well above the planned values.
Instead of the planned EUR 1.5 million, it was EUR 2.5 million last year.
"This is essentially due to the higher input from the administrative budget," says Rothmund.
As less investment has been made than planned in the financial year 2012, the provision of reserves has also been higher.
Overall, the overall reserve of around EUR 2.1 million could be increased to a total of EUR 4.9 million.
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and her team for the good work.
"You don't just shake a work like that out of your sleeve," Gerster praised with a view to the annual accounts.
He and the councils were obviously pleased with the good figures.
It may sound paradoxical, but these very good figures could soon cost citizens dearly.
Due to the good financial situation, the municipality in the past was able to dispense with high lifting rates.
In turn, however, according to Gerster, subsidies have often been curtailed by the country.
There are conditions for these subsidies from various balancing poles.
Among other things, cities and municipalities applying for grants must have certain lifting rates.
"We need to look at the issue of lifting rates, because in the coming years there will be investments for which we would like to receive subsidies," Gerster announced.
Nagold: Hugo Wermter in the choir for 60 years
At the age of 60, Hubert Wermer's history at the Cecilia Men's Song Association is almost twice as long as that of the Autumn Festival, in which he was celebrated.
Hubert Wermter was on stage as usual in the colours of his male singing club.
Even after 60 years he still enjoys singing with the choir that is probably more than loved.
Wermter was also active in the association, including for 28 years as a member of the committee.
For his commitment and his commitment to the association, he received several awards: Jörg Kohr, Pastoral Adviser on behalf of the Cäcilienverband Rottenburg-Stuttgart, handed him - since the choir is also a church choir - a certificate of the association and an honorary letter signed by Bishop Gebhard Fürst.
His singer colleagues handed him the certificate of the German choir association as well as a engraved tin plate.
In addition to the honor, the 31st autumn festival took place in usual tracks: With the MGV Betra, the Song Crane Salzstetten, the singing department Baisingen and the local music club, the Vollmaringer had loaded a colorful mix of different choirs and singing styles, which entertained around 400 visitors.
The MGV Vollmaringen opened with moody songs such as "In the Wine Paradise" and "Lustig, her Brothers".
In honor of her honorary singer Hubert Wermter they prepared a small stall - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's "Bundeslied".
The men's song club Beta also sang classical choral songs such as "Jägerwerben" by Julius Wengert, "Weit, far away" by Hubert Goisern and the folk song "When You Walk Through the Valley".
With his mixed choir and his group of women - the "impulsor" - the Song Crane Salzstetten provided the women's quota of the festival.
The mixed choir abducted with the neo-political folklore "Santa Lucia" and "Eviva Espana" by Antos Gus in foreign countries, while the "impulshor" also resorted to foreign languages: "Liberatio" and "Hey Jude" were among their programs.
The singing department of the Baisinger Sportverein came back with "What Is the Schwob?" by Hans Süssmuth and Robert Pappert's "Bierlied" back to the local community, where the Vollmaringer Musikverein offered the crowning musical graduation.
For the children there was a small secondary program - "Grandma Hanne" a.k.a. Hannelore Stollsteimer performed a casper theatre and read a few stories that the children were busy at lunchtime.
Children's Dreams Come True
The kindergartens and daycare centres in the Zollernalbkreis receive post these days.
The Black Forest messenger, in cooperation with Bauhaus and Sparkasse Zollernalb, wants to support the facilities in the realization of their building and beauticating wishes.
Does the kindergarten need a new sandbox?
All kindergartens, daycare centres and crèches from all over the Zollernalbkreis can participate in the action.
If you have a building or decoration request for your facility, you can apply with it to the Black Forest messenger.
Be creative with your children and surprise the jury of the Kindergarten site action.
A jury, consisting of representatives of Black Forest Bote, Bauhaus and Sparkasse Zollernalb, selects three wishes from all submissions.
What are the conditions for participation?
The wish should be realized with construction material of a maximum value of 2000 euros and on a (action) day.
In addition, the winner himself must provide many hardworking construction workers.
What about the day of action and the helpers?
Bauhaus provides the material with the support of Sparkasse Zollernalb.
It will be delivered to the kindergarten on the agreed day and will then be processed directly by the helpers.
Helpers can be parents, grandparents, friends, clubs and, of course, educators and children themselves.
Kenyan press outraged by controversial media law
'We are in a terrifying situation and one may ask: what does Parliament think about simply abolishing the independence of the judiciary tomorrow?' was read in the newspaper, which considers the draft law not to be constitutional.
"The law is draconian and very punishable and we reject it," said Cyrus Kamau, Managing Director of the Capital Group, including CapitalFM, one of Kenya's most respected independent radio stations and news sites.
He said that the new media tribunal "will always be prejudiced because it is an extended arm of government" and restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya's position in the global economy.
'I hope the President will listen to us and we urge him to reject this draft law and send it back to Parliament,' he said.
According to the newspaper The Star, the government took the new law 'media effectively in a stranglehold', whereas The Standard, Democracy and Freedom of Speech in Kenya had suffered 'a severe blow' and called the design 'draconian'.
The adoption of the law is one of a number of measures aimed at strengthening national security in the wake of the attacks by armed Islamists on the Westgate shopping centre in September.
The Kenyan media brought on the anger of the authorities because they published photographs of security cameras on which to see how the units sent to the crime scene supposedly robbed the luxurious shopping center.
Police chief David Kimaiyo responded by ordering two journalists and a leading media representative to be interrogated, even if the summons was withdrawn after a media outburst.
Under the new law, media houses can be filled with a penalty of up to 20 million Kenyan schillings and individual journalists with up to a million and the further risk of losing their professional recognition or being excluded from official press accreditation.
The Tribunal also has the right to confiscate the property of the persons concerned if a penalty is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, "even a single penalty can push most radio stations into bankruptcy".
In addition, the newspaper believes that these measures could have a devastating effect on Kenya's 'living blogosphere'.
If they silence the media, politicians could do whatever they want.
"No one will ever know," wrote Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist of the nation who calls Kenyan media a crucial control factor in public life.
"If politicians are left to themselves, they lead the country into bankruptcy and us back to the time of hunters and collectors," he commented.
In the past, the Kenyan legislators have brought on public trouble.
In May, they voted to reverse the cuts made by the National Compensation Commission and put back into force their generous salaries of about 532,000 Schilling tax-free per month – they are among the world's highest.
Bad-Dürrheim: A dream comes true for FC
The official inauguration ceremony for the artificial grass sports field was not bad for the importance for the city and the football club despite the cold weather and the rain.
Perhaps everyone wished for a more pleasant celebration last Saturday, but Peter did not want to play with it.
Thus all those who came without umbrella or could not keep one for any reason.
This went for the musicians who framed the ceremony, just as some speakers did.
So wet became the FC chairman Albrecht Schlenker, who spoke of the fulfillment of a dream.
His thanks were first and foremost to Mayor Walter Klumpp, who had made a strong commitment to the implementation of the project, the municipal council, the companies involved and the club members who contributed.
Especially here is Lothar Hero, Paul Weizenegger, Heiner Gail and Peter Graf.
The restless pensioners moved 400 square meters of paving stones for the new roads.
This remarkable voluntary commitment was also honoured by the parliamentarian Karl Rombach.
Other greetings were given to the city sports committee Hubert Baier, the district chairman of the Southbad football association, Kuno Kayan, and Friedrich Knorr from the planning office, who announced a donation for the youth department of the club.
Mayor Klump recalled that recurring weather-related influences in spring and autumn added to the original lawn site so that it could not be played.
Already 15 years ago, there were the first considerations on the solution of the problem when the construction of a third place was planned at the site of the football club or at the real school at the Salinensee.
Both were rejected again.
Six years ago, thoughts arose about the construction of an artificial grass sports field, which was generally seen as the ultimate solution.
Concrete plans were taken up two years ago when the FC took over the Schabelstube in Erbpacht, promised a cost stake of EUR 100 000 for the construction of the site and approved the country funding of EUR 104 000.
The municipal council decided in October 2012 to take over the remaining 356,000 euros at the total cost of 560 000 euros, Klump.
The construction of the 68-by-108-metre artificial lawn site took place on 4 June.
During the three-month construction phase, 3000 cubic metres of earth were removed, half of which was used for the construction of a dirt-bike track.
Union and SPD have continued their coalition negotiations on internal and judicial issues.
In addition, the responsible working group met in Berlin in the morning.
Among other things, it is about direct democracy, parliamentarian occupation and the federal police.
In the morning, the Working Group on Migration and Integration also wanted to continue its discussions.
This should include the issue of dual citizenship, where both sides have conflicting ideas.
The SPD wants to end the coercion for immigrant children born in Germany to choose one - the Union refuses a double pass.
On the subject of transport, which is not on the agenda for this Friday, the SPD supported its 'no' vote on a car toll requested by the CSU.
A vignette was a "flatrate for frequent driving and thus ecologically counterproductive," said the SPD negotiator on transport, Florian Pronold, in a letter to his group.
There were threats of diversions on rural roads, which were already the focus of accidents.
In addition, the introduction of a toll for all cars would be only a first step from Pronold's point of view.
"There is a risk that the compensation for Germans will be removed at a later date," he said.
Dieter Thomas Kuhn in Stuttgart: The singing sound wave on the open-air stage
Stuttgart - "When will it be summer again?" was not really the question on Friday evening on the open-air stage Killesberg.
It was truly a tropical night in Stuttgart.
So the best conditions for Schlagerstar Dieter Thomas Kuhn and his band.
Click through the picture gallery to create the "singing sound wave".
Motorists in case of accident seriously injured
In the event of an accident on Thursday evening, a 37-year-old passenger car driver from Aachen was severely injured.
According to the police, a 41-year-old from Müsch was on his way towards Grefrath at 9:15 p.m. with her car on the Kempen outer ring.
When they wanted to turn left onto St. Töniser Street, they overlooked the approaching car of the 37-year-old.
The rope collided.
The Aachener suffered severe injuries and had to be taken to the hospital for treatment.
Constance: Blocking after an accident at the skirmish circle
The accident had occurred according to the police when a 51-year-old driver of a Swiss seat Ibiza was driving out of town on Thursday evening, around 8:00 p.m., on the left lane of the two-track Reichenaustraße.
Shortly before the roundabout at Schänzle, he noticed that he was on the left-hand side in the direction of Stromeyersdorfstraße and switched to the right-hand lane.
There was a clash with the BMW of a 23-year-old constanzer.
Also damaged was the VW Passat of a 19-year-old behind the BMW.
A total of about 15,000 material damage occurred, the police reported it.
The road had to be blocked during the accident, it continued.
Vienna Airport eliminates passenger calls
Mr. Max Maier, please come to Gate 24.
Telling how this will happen in the future there will be no more airport Vienna-Schwechat.
A large part of the loudspeaker transmissions fall away - the noise level should be reduced so clearly.
Creating a more relaxed atmosphere is the goal of this innovation.
As Peter Kleemann announced to Radio Wien, the Vienna Airport follows an international trend with the cancellation of announcements relating to individuals.
For example, airports in Copenhagen, Frankfurt or Dubai already refrain from the noisy calls.
By the disappearance of these announcements - on average, around 200 personal calls are made by the loudspeakers on one day - it is expected to be quieter at the airport in the future.
"It has also been shown in experience that these individual tell-tales have been perceived relatively little, but at the same time all the other information about changed flight paths or departure times is a bit lost here," said Kleemann in conversation with the radio station.
Highlander-Games on the Kaltenhof
In addition to braking with tractors, there is a second competition at the agricultural autumn festival at the Kaltenhof from 6 to 8 September.
On Saturday, September 7, the Highlander-Games will start at 1.30 p.m.
Although they have a Scottish tradition, they are swooned on the cold farm.
Teams and single fighters measure themselves in the disciplines of tree trunks, hoof iron throwings and water buckets.
The tree trunk is four and a half metres long and 25 to 30 kilograms heavy.
"It doesn't go far," explains organizer Peter Saile.
The trunk has to be thrown out vertically, should skip once and then come straight to the bed.
This is evaluated with most points.
When throwing hoof iron, it depends on the target accuracy.
From eight meters away is thrown onto a pflock.
Skill and strength must be demonstrated by the participants in the water bucket carrying over 50 meters.
Time and quantity of water in a bottle are measured at the end.
From each "Clan" or team, two can then participate in the individual competition.
The winners of the team and individual competition receive prizes.
Training can start at 10 a.m.
A suitable clothing is desired, for example, the contestants can join in the broom skirt.
But Swabian dress is also allowed.
For the "Outfit", the jury awards a few bonus points.
You can register up to an hour before the start of the contest.
With the Scottish-Swiss Highlander-Games and the tractor-pulling, which starts half an hour earlier, there is already a lot of action on Saturday on the grounds.
In the evening, the band's friends get to their expense.
At 7 p.m., the birabo brass music from Schömberg creates the big entertainment evening.
The chapel plays great Polkas and fairy tales.
Their repertoire also includes emotional rollers and a rich big band sound.
With it will be Heinz Koch, known as singing host and black sausage baron, from a few moments under the reins.
In Dornhan he has already appeared at the Christmas market and at the Narrenzuft.
On Sunday, the Musikverein Leinstetten entertains for the early morning meal, from 2 p.m. the Farmer's Chapel Boffingen is a guest, and the "Oldies" then let the festival end.
The stop paint party with DJ Ralf is already open on Friday.
Other program items include the Oldtimer and Towing Meetings, exhibitions by companies on agriculture and forestry.
Other attractions on Sunday are the corn labyrinth, the craftsman's market and sheep shearing.
Especially for children there is a stroke zoo, Strohhüpfburg, tractor driving (under instructions) and tractor surfing.
The organisers are the Förderverein Multipurpose Halle, the ski club and the tractor friends "Zündkäpsele".
Milk and egg alternatives at a glance
Vegan diet requires herbal alternatives to eggs, milk and dairy products.
Purified tofu with plant seeds, for example, is a quartz set.
The Federation of Vegetarians is also called World Vegan Day on 1 November.
On the occasion of the World Vegetarian Day on 1 November, the German Vegetarian Federation proposes a number of vegan alternatives:
Pure plant margarine is a good alternative to butter, yogurt replace by soy yogurt.
Instead of milk, soy, oat, almond or rice milk could be used.
Foldable plant seed replaces traditional whipped cream.
There are also plant alternatives to eggs.
For example, half a crushed, ripe banana can replace an egg as a binder in a cake.
Also 50 grams of apple or a tablespoon of ground linseed plus three tablespoons of water are suitable for this purpose.
Loose dough instead of egg, for example with a mixture of a teaspoon of baking powder, a tablespoon of food strength and three tablespoons of mineral water.
But also 50 grams of soya yogurt or silkentofu can fulfil this purpose.
According to Vebu, about 800 000 people in Germany are currently feeding vegan, i.e. purely vegetable.
Sleepless in New York City
On the way to her host families in Weymouth, Massachusetts, the students of the Black Forest Gymnasium met the American city of New York.
After eight hours of flight, it went straight to Brooklyn Bridge, over which the heart of the city, Manhattan, was reached on foot.
Here was already a fascinating view of the world-renowned skyline, which in the evening light is a special attraction.
Due to the shift in time, the students were on their feet for almost 24 hours, but true to the motto "The City doesn't sleep" was decided the day at Times Square.
Despite the shutdown, on the second day the Statue of Liberty could be reached by ferry and climbed on foot.
Then we went over the financial center to the Wall Street Memorial on September 11th.
On the third day, the students were able to gain an overview of the fascinating large city from the 373-metre-high viewing platform of the Empire State Building.
After that, it was through the hectic drive of the New York streets via the Rockefeller Center to the Central Park, which provided an ideal opportunity for short stays in the autumn sun.
After a short flight from New York to Boston, the students have now arrived in their host families and experience school life at Weymouth High School.
This year, too, a Hubertus Mass is celebrated on the name day of Saint Hubertus in the parish church of St. Marien on Hülsbergstraße.
St. Hubertus was the legend of a rather reckless hunter, who was converted by a vision and later appointed Bishop of Liège.
The Jagdhorn wind group of the Jagdreiter Westphalia under the direction of Brigitte Kluth plays on Parforcehorns (natural horns in the mood Es) for old, originally French melodies.
The bladders wear riding clothes because they mainly accompany riders, horses and dogs on tow hunts musically.
The festive fair takes place on Sunday, November 3rd, at 11.30 a.m.
The newly designed look shines with a new cafe.
One that invites you to stay and come back.
One that wants to make the name of the program.
According to Lexikon, the name Déjà Vu is called a psychological phenomenon that expresses itself in the feeling of having experienced or seen a new situation before.
In the case of a visit to the café of the same name at the Opschlag in the district town of Kleve in view of the Rhein-Waal University, it does not have to stay with the pure feel of Déjà Vu.
Finally, the café with the beautiful name has exactly the goal: to make an actual stay not only thoughtful, but always experience it again and again.
Because it's fun and it's just beautiful.
A look into the interior of Opschlag 8 gives the viewer a good feeling.
The state-of-the-art, but not cool cafe-ambient looks like a place to feel good.
Here the team with the founders Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Büttner at the top spoils the guest with various coffee or cocktail variants.
There are delicious cakes or individually coated fresh baguettes.
The owners, both 33 years old, made a name for themselves before the opening of the beautiful café at the opschlag as a gastronomist: in Kranenburg they led the "Art Lounge".
From the move to Kleve at the Opschlag, the sympathetic café lovers hope for more audiences.
Not least through the university.
"Where we don't have a specific target group," says Daniel Büttner.
Rather, the two here want to address young students as well as seniors and all ages between them.
Speaking of Café-Liebhaber.
The sympathetic owner couple are behind the coffee enjoyment.
Enjoys the fragrant hot brew in various variations themselves.
Expressophane
Daniel Büttner is rather the expresso fan and Mirjam van der Stelt the cappuccino drinker.
"That's a baguette - that's my thing," she tells the NRZ.
There were two events in the bright café.
Better put it one way.
Because the harbour festival took place outside - the Café Déjà Vu did not benefit from it.
But there was also the Ringelnatz evening.
"Beautiful, successful and funny", the two 33-year-olds found.
But not everyone's business.
Maybe Daniel Büttner is not a very popular fan of event evenings either: "You can't do it all right now."
And with an event I always only speak to those who are also interested in the special event.
That's why events will be the exception with us.
"We want to disturb the normal operation as little as possible."
Should be called: Déjà Vu also stands for reliability.
With regard to the quality of the products offered here, as well as to the team and the beautiful environment at the notice in Kleve.
The road, which is becoming more and more a gastronomy mile.
To the delight of many Clever, the guests from close up and far away and the students who discover the Gastromeile and thus also the Café Déjà Vu for themselves.

A day of thanks at the MGV in Dinker
It was the 165th foundation festival to which the MGV "Friedrich Wilhelm Dinker" had invited this year and 52 guests, active singers and their wives, had gladly come.
In the club's restaurant "Witteborg" in Dinker, all enjoyed harmonious cooperation in the sign of music.
Traditionally, the Stiftungfestival is always the right festivity to make honors.
The special award "Singer of the Year" this time made Rolf Wagener happy.
"You have not only written down a lot for us, but also made some laps for us, for our warm thanks," said the chairman of the choir Erich Schlotmann.
This year the awards for participation in the performances and choir rehearsals through activity tours went to the choir director Dieter Schulze with 44 participations, followed by honorary chairman Horst Pier-Ribbert, the chairman himself, and last year's "Singer of the Year" Friedrich Winkler with 42 participations each.
==References====External links==
A special thank you was directed by the board of directors to the team of club economist Ange Pier-Ribbert, who had once again conjured up an extra-class menu and to Gerda Pier-Ribbert for the table decoration.
The MGV "Friedrich-Wilhelm" meets on his regular choir rehearsals on Tuesdays at 7:45 p.m. in the club's room.
"New singing voices are welcome to us at any time," says Schlotmann.
UN announces new targets in poverty reduction
The United Nations is now preparing a series of new targets to replace the Millennium Development Goals announced twelve years ago to combat poverty.
In the run-up to the UN Summit on Sustainable Development, which began in Rio de Janeiro in the evening, Australian diplomats played a key role in the run-up to "sustainable development goals", which are to replace the Millennium Goals that expire in 2015.
They were included in the final draft of the document, which will be adopted by world leaders, including Mrs Gillard, at the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said in the evening at the summit that the time had come to 'think beyond national interests'.
"I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to start a process with which universal, sustainable development goals should be agreed," he said.
“These objectives will build on our progress from the Millennium Development Goals and form an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will not hesitate to implement this mandate given to me by the Member States in order to achieve our vision of sustainable development goals that build on the success of the Millennium Goals."
Even though the SG Achim/Baden has been without victory for four days, there is still a good mood for the handball overligist.
There's no doubt about that, Coach Tomasz Malmon.
Everyone is still fully motivated in the matter.
Nevertheless, I hope that we will finally win again.
"Because I don't know how such a victory tastes," Malmon expects a success experience from his team at VfL Fredenbeck II.
Even though the third-liga reserve from Fredenbeck has currently not torn out trees, Malmon raises the index finger in advance warning.
I have trained many players myself in the A-Youth.
Hence, they will certainly be particularly motivated against their ex-coach.
"It is also necessary to wait to see if there is any reinforcement from the first," explains the SG-Coach.
To finally return to the track of success, the Malmon team must definitely increase compared to the previous performances.
Above all things in the cover work and in the switching game it finally seemed huge.
It is also necessary to definitely improve the use of opportunities.
That's why I hope my players finally got their heads free during the short break.
Security concerns in Mozambique are growing in the face of clashes between influential personalities
Thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maputo under the watchful eyes of the statue of Samora Machel, the founder of the state and first president of Mozambique to vote for peace calls at a rare public demonstration.
"We want peace again, we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, Managing Director of an investment company.
For fear of the future of the country, she exchanged her business clothes against a T-shirt with the words "We demand security" in Portuguese and joined the crowd on Thursday on the independence square of the capital.
For two weeks, there have been almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo, which have been among the worst battles since the peace agreement over 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement which was initially supported by the White rule of Rhodes and later by the apartheid government of South Africa in an effort to destabilize the independent government of the country.
After the 1992 peace treaty, she became an opposition party.
Analysts believe it is unlikely that the country will return to an adult conflict, but recent events have alarmed foreign investors and locals.
For the fast growing economy, there is a lot at stake, as the discovery of huge gas deposits off the coast and coal deposits in the northwest could bring investment of over $50 billion from companies like Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the USA in the next few years.
The ruling Frelimo party, since 1975 the dominant force, and Renamo blame each other for the tensions.
Renamo claims that the government had provoked the recent clashes by attacking its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional high castle of Renamos on 17 October.
The attacks on the former rebels escalated when government troops attacked Renamo bases and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the leader of the group, stated Renamo's spokesman to the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for the clashes and accuses the organization of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has tried to put down concerns about instability.
On Wednesday, he said to AFP, the French news agency, that Dhlakama considered himself to be a "loser" who wants to use "all his remaining forces to prove that he can impose his decisions on the government".
Both Frelimo and Renamo stress that they want to avoid war.
However, concerns have increased since Mazanga was quoted with the words, Renamo is giving up the 1992 peace agreement.
In contrast to the FT, he stated that he meant that Frelimo no longer respected the agreement.
"Our vision is to resume negotiations and seriously," said Mazanga.
Previous discussions between the parties have contributed little to the resolution of tensions that have been fueled by a series of clashes this year.
"We have two adult men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who come across the heads," says Joseph Hanlon, lecturer at Open University and Mozambique expert.
None of them are good at negotiation and none are willing to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, who insists on electoral reforms, has already declared that she will boycott the municipal elections in November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of violence as an attempt by a motivating movement to obtain concessions and financial benefits from the government.
Renamo's electoral success has been shrinking since 1992, while a newer party, the Movimento Democratico de Mozambique (MDM), founded by a former member of the Renamo, is likely to improve in the elections.
Mazanga claims that Guebuza – whose resignation is due when his second term ends next year – wants to destroy the democracy of the country.
"He doesn't want multi-party democracy, he doesn't want transparent elections, he doesn't want peace because he doesn't want to give up the presidential office," says Mazanga.
It is unclear what capacity Renamo has, but she has made tumultuous attacks on police stations and vehicles on an important North-South connections.
Most battles took place in the province of Sofala, which is located some hundreds of kilometers north of Maputo, but in which Beira is located, using the port, mining companies such as Rio Tinto and Vale for export of coal.
In June Rio interrupted the use of the railway for a month after Renamo announced an attack on the route.
Mazanga reluctantly replied to the question whether Renamo would repeat this threat.
Renamo wanted to "warn the international community that things are not good in Mozambique," said Mazanga.
According to Fernando Lima, Head of Mediacoop, an independent media company, instability has increased the frustration of the government, for many people have already been worried about corruption, slow progress in development and a recent abduction wave.
"People think that the government and the president are responsible for the future of the country and that he should be the one who finds solutions to the problems," he explains.
Omar Sultane, a protester, said that people just wanted stability.
"Renamo and Frelimo are not interested, they just want peace and useful roads again," he said.
Children should be taught myths and legends as "models of life", says one author.
The stories of Thor showed that "brutal power has no chance against clever tricks", and the artus legends demonstrate how important it is to have a dream.
Many of the myths, however, are "by far too wild, too offensive and in some cases too dirty to be taught at schools", which is why Crossley-Holland advocated a "careful selection" of age-right works.
"I find it wonderful that myths and folklore are already part of education in America," he said.
I have been proposing this as a plan for twenty years.
He added that to authors and teachers who were "excessively didactic" children would be "completely shutting down" because in entertaining stories the messages would be "understood".
Crossley-Holland, who has translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon and is the author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myths and the British Folk Tales, said: "You can pursue certain intentions, but you should keep them in the background as much as possible."
Perhaps the greatest difference between an adult author who writes for adults and an author who writes for children is the need to convey hope.
Not everything has to be simplified or lead to the happy end, but there is an immense sense of good and evil.
This must be portrayed sublimely, revealed by history and not explained.
This is the old story of showing instead of telling.
Hansjakob once again moves to the open court
100 years ago Heinrich Hansjakob took his retirement seat in Haslach, on Sunday his last years became alive in the "Freihof".
The many spectators were thrilled by the very short-lived stage game.
From the arrival to the award of honorary citizenship until his death, screenwriter and Hansjakobsteller Alois Kraftzcyk had designed an entertaining piece that received much approval under the direction of Cornelia Volk.
Marcus Zagermann took the audience as a speaker through the ten different scenes, explained connections and bridged time jumps from youth to near retirement.
On October 22, 1913, Hansjakob arrives home in his children's sky, in his courtyard.
And then the stage game began in which Alois Krafczyk once again shined in his parade role as the great son of the city.
Stilecht led by Erich Becherer from Mühlenbach with the two-panner and "Schwarzwälder Füchsen".
He was not only received by the audience with a lot of applause, but also his sister Philippines welcomed him.
Billy Sum-Hermann understood it incredibly well to get into the role of the sister and gave her enormous life in Mimik and Gestik.
The Mühlenbacher Bauernkapelle played selected pieces between the individual game scenes and finished the performance.
For the award of honorary citizenship, Haslach's mayor Heinz Winkler was honoured, who, together with a part of the city council, made his appearance in representation of the then official Hattich.
Her expectation then made the trio singers, who led Hansjakob to the exclamation: "Oh, how beautiful, there are memories of young people of my own trio.
With their song "O Jesúslein" they enjoyed the audience in the open court as well as the storchenday children with their loud "Out, Out".
His criticism of the Amtskirche had been expressed by Hansjakob at the time as well as his concerns about the growth of agriculture, the consequences of industrialization or the effects of the war.
In the homeland, behind his tomb on the fire at Hofstetten, he found his resting place.
"A troubled spirit had finally found its peace and had gone home forever," said it at the end of the stage game.
There was a lot of applause and a lot of praise from the audience for the performance.
Basketball: The Hope of Neckar Giants Grows
The chances of the league remaining of the sports-decreased Ludwigsburg Bundesliga basketball players have increased.
If there is a wildcard procedure, then there is now a competitor less for the Neckar giants.
The Hamburg Towers Basketball Project does not apply for a possible follow-up site.
"We will not participate in the Wildcard procedure," said former national player Pascal Roller, who has been setting up the concept for a professional club in the Hanseatic City since 2012.
However, a first breath could not be heard from Ludwigsburg.
"We did not deal with the Wildcard procedure, so long as it is not clear that Düsseldorf does not receive a license," said Neckar-Riesen-Boss Alexander Reil of our newspaper.
Until 23 May, Aufsteiger Düsseldorf Baskets can still submit documents to the Arbitration Court and prove its economic Bundesliga suitability.
Up to now, however, the license has been denied twice to the Rhine countries.
The Arbitration Court is the last instance.
Haigerloch: Evening Meal Church takes a look
As a contribution of the city to the 150th anniversary of the Evangelical Church in Haigerloch, the city's cultural and tourism office devotes the last of its public guided tours on Sunday, October 27th, to the Evening Meal Church.
After the visit of the Atomic Cellar Museum, Haigerlocher was to be considered after 1850 when Haigerloch came under Prussian rule.
The crowning end point is a visit to the church.
There the leaders get the story of the building of the church and gain insight into the development of the evangelical community in a thoroughly Catholic area.
Last but not least, the church also overlooks the evening paintings created by Friedrich Schüz with the support of Walter Kröll and Georg Halbritter.
It is an original reproduction of the famous Milan model of Leonardo da Vinci.
The meeting point for the second half-hour tour is at 3 p.m. at the Atomic Cellar Museum.
There are maps at the box of the Atomic Cellar Museum.
For questions and information, the Tourist Office of the city of Haigerloch is available.
Snowden could also announce in Russia
The former U.S. intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in the US spy business in his Russian asylum.
Representatives of the Federal Attorney General could either ask written questions or meet the 30-year-old in Russia personally.
This was notified by the agency Interfax, calling on non-described circles familiar with the situation.
Such a question could be resolved in an intergovernmental way, it was said.
An exit of Snowdens from Russia is practically excluded.
"In this case, he loses his refugee status," the agency quoted her source.
Because Germany is an ally of the USA, snowden threatens delivery there, it continued
Long breath pays off
Six men's teams fought for the winning title at the club's tennis tournament.
In the end, the endurance of the Maier/Bronner team decided the last match.
A dream weather had won the tennis department of the sports friends Rohrdorf to the tournament of local clubs and friends.
The fun of playing tennis was in the foreground of the tournament.

Played in double mode with a long set of up to nine points or a maximum of 45 minutes duration.
Anja Schlichter leads the tournament
The tournament management was in the proven hands of Anja Schlichter, supported by Carmen Müller and Inga Kronemeyer.
After the first three games and a lunch break with Pasta, the tournament went into the decisive phase.
The favorites Andre Maier/Matthias Bronner were at the same time Michael Klippel and Sadmin Osmicic (both teams of the SG Rohrweiler), so that the last two matches had to make the decision.
At the time of the victory, Carmen Müller was finally able to hand over the hiking trophy to Andre Maier/Matthias Bronner, who had the longest breath on the finish line.
The second place was the double Michael Klippel/Sadmin Osmicic.
The bronze staircase reached Rainer and Bernd Maier of the team asphalt smoker.
The successful conclusion of the tournament took place in the late afternoon sun and coffee and cake.
On the last weekend of August, the Black Forest open-air museum Vogtsbauernhof in Gutach near Hornberg is again firmly in the hands of children.

Until the end of the summer holidays in Baden-Württemberg, visitors to the open-air museum expect a varied holiday program.
In a small town in New Zealand, Burt Muro is considered to be an adorable piece of cake, because he has undertaken to take part in a race in America with his motorcycle, built in 1920.
Burt, despite a heart defect, is not to be rid of his dream.
With his savings, single donations and a mortgage on his old workshop shed, he transfers to Los Angeles by ship.
After the film there is coffee, tea and cake.
Schrilles Peepsen disturbs residents
Rhenus Midgard has also invested heavily on land.
They distribute the coal coming from the ships to the Halde.
The company has several irons in the fire at the site.
In addition to coal imports, Rhenus Midgard relies on wind turbines logistics.
Black shimmers the coal in the campground in front of the dike.
Two huge blue holding shakers and rechargers distribute or charge the coal here as required.
In every movement of the transducers, a shrill warning sound sounds over the terrain.
"The signals serve security and are required by law," says Matthias Schrell, Managing Director of the Rhine Midgard in Wilhelmshaven.
Unfortunately, in the event of unfavorable wind, this is far from being heard - and so there were already some complaints from people from the city north.
He takes the complaints very seriously and has therefore contacted those affected, says the 40-year-old.
In close consultation with the authorities, the warning signals were now being kept quiet with technical measures.
In the future, he will continue to engage in open dialogue with his neighbours.
Because Matthias Schrell still has a lot to do at the site.
With the expansion of the Lower Saxony Bridge, Rhenus Midgard continues to rely on coal imports for power plants and is one of the largest in Europe in this sector.
Thanks to the 18.5 meter-deeper sunbathing basin form terminal, Capesize bullcarrier can also be delivered here.
"This year we want to crack the 3-million-tonne mark when we wrap it up," Schrell says.
In addition to the local Eon power plant, the import coal goes to domestic power plants.
If the GDF-Suez power plant is still on the grid, a good 5 million tonnes of coal imports per year are realistic.
The three ship loaders on the bridge as well as the second conveyor belt could create up to 10 million.
Bayern Basketballer despite first defeat optimistic
Even the first defeat in the Euro League could not minimize the enormous optimism of the basketball players at FC Bayern Munich.
"No one can forbid us to believe in winning even the best team in Europe in the last two years," explained Bayern-Coach Svetislav Pesic after the unfortunate 83:88 (39:47) on Thursday evening with the title defender Olympiakos Piraeus.
We sent the message: Basketball also exists in Munich!
At their first third appearance in the European royal class, the Munichers sold themselves very well for a long time, but were simply not clear enough in the decisive phases.
The guests first managed to turn the piece into a guide 13 minutes before the end of the game, before Piraeus gave the game a turn again.
"We have fought back incredibly against the two-time Euro League champion, but then again made reckless mistakes," said Bayern-Profi Yassin Idbihi.
We are proud of our performance, but we want to win every game.
Malcolm Delaney and Nihad Djedovic were the most successful pitchers of the Munichers, who had celebrated clear victories in the first two games against the Italian serial champion Montepaschi Siena and the Polish title holder Zielona Góra.
Ben Greenman: Ten years New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
It could be said that New York City is the birthplace of Stand-up Comedy in America: almost a hundred years ago, varietal artist Frank Fay, who worked as a conferencier at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began to tell the crowd of direct jokes in the form of a conversation.
Over the years, Fay's innovation has been expanded, as was the latest at the New York Comedy Festival.
Launched and led by Caroline Hirsch, founder of the stand-up institution of Carolines, this year the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary with over sixty shows in small clubs and large theaters.
"Most of these headliners started with Carolines and then became more and more successful until they were known to play in a club at some point," said Hirsch.
We have designed this festival so that we can continue to work with them.
At this year's event, there are performances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as by "Stand Up for Heroes", an annual music and comedy benefic event for army veterans in Madison Square Garden, which includes Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
With the festival the world of comedy has also grown.
A number of comedians who participate in the festival this year have become known through rather unconventional ways, such as broadcasts on smaller TV channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll became known with a sitcom on cable television (the ironic-slow fantasy football series "The League" on FXX) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was part of the lineup both at Saturday Night Live and at Parks and Recreation, although she is best known for her viral video series "Marcel the Shell with Shoes On".
Both Krull and Slate and other young comedians with characteristic voices (the surreal pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic, racially focused W. Kaumau Bell) are products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the biggest visitors to the festival is an interview: David Steinberg talks to Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian, but has become a respected television and film director and an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he hosted a television show entitled "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg" at TV Land.
The meeting takes place in the Town Hall in the middle of Manhattan.
"The city is definitely in the comedy DNA of Larry's entire work," said Steinberg.
He told me, when he's here, sometimes he goes through the street between two buildings and thinks, hey, if I lose all my money, then maybe I'll live here.
Iran satisfied with the process of nuclear negotiations
Iran will be satisfied with the negotiation process one week before the next nuclear meeting with the five U.N.V. and Germany.
"After years, we now have an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency to eliminate the differences of the last years," said Foreign Minister Mohammed Jawad Sarif on his Facebook page.
It would be a long way to go, but the nuclear negotiator was satisfied with the negotiation process and also optimistic that both sides would find a solution in the end.
Drama in Uruguay: Boys Kill Game Cage Wheels with Macchete
Two children committed the murder of an 11-year-old in Uruguay.
The two 14 - and 12 - year - old boys had invited their victims to go hunting birds with them.
Armed with Macheten and Knifes, they beat the 11-year-olds on Tuesday and threw the body into a well, the newspaper "El País" reported on Thursday.
Then they would have played football in front of their homes in a working district.
The body was found the following night in the village of Cerro Pelado, 15 kilometres north of the exclusive beach town of Punta del Este.
As an alibi, a five-year-old half-sister of the disciple they had taken with them was to say that she had been sexually attacked by the boy.
But when the girl described the tantrum in front of the police without mentioning an attack on her, the two boys admitted the intentional killing of the 11-year-old.

He was transferred to a psychiatric youth centre for the time being.
She's got to go to jail.
The Konstanz District Court sentenced a 33-year-old man from St. Georgen to three and a half years in prison for exploitive trafficking, detention, threat, insult and dangerous bodily injury.
The former Bundeswehr soldier, who worked as a doorman after two operations in Afghanistan, made a confession in the context of a trial agreement.
He then met women in five cases via Internet or telephone contacts, which he sent to the street after a few weeks against their will.
He used to break resistance with violence and threats.
He retained the income of the women who partly purchased for him for years.
By confiscating mobile phones and SIM cards, he undermined women's contacts with the outside world.
Together with a colleague who mediated the women, he brought them to various brothels in the southwest.
There he had them partially monitored to control their revenues.
The defendant first claimed that he was suffering from a severe trauma after colleagues in Afghanistan had died in an explosion next to him.
After a psychiatric expert expressed serious doubts about the mental limitations and thus a limited debt, the 33-year-old made a comprehensive confession.
The court no longer had to hear from any of the injured women.
As one Kripo official reported, at least four further cases of exploitative trafficking in human beings could be identified after a first call by telephone surveillance.
The conversations heard had been marked by a high level of aggression.
In later hearings, the injured would have confirmed their martyrdom.
Another Witness, who had discovered blue spots all over the body, had not made a statement to this day.
It is about "a completely broken personality", which considers violence and exploitation in this metier to be normal.
The defendant regretted his behavior yesterday.
"He has separated himself from these circles and wanted to lead a normal life after imprisonment," he said.
Oil price continues to reach USD 96 per barrel
The oil price continued to fall on Friday after concerns about a high supply overshadowed a report that the energy-hungry manufacturing sector in China is growing.
The December reference crude oil variety for deliveries fell in Europe in the late morning in electronic commerce at the New York Mercantile Exchange by 14 cents to USD 96.24 per barrel.
The contract fell by 39 cents on Thursday, which meant a price decline of 5.8 percent in October.
The large supply of crude oil has burdened prices in recent weeks.
The US Department of Energy stated on Wednesday that the US offer had increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over the course of five weeks, the offer had increased by 25 million barrels.
On Friday, however, there was evidence of increased demand through two reports of an increase in activity in Chinese production.
This suggests a continued recovery in China's economy, whose growth had increased to 7.8 percent in the third quarter after it had reached its lowest level for two decades in the previous quarter.
Crude oil of the Brent variety, a reference value for international crude oil, which is also used by US refineries, fell at the ICE Exchange in London by 26 cents to USD 108.58 per barrel.
Court blocks decision on the NYPD's stop-and-frisk directive
On Thursday, a Federal Court of Appeal in the United States blocked the appointment of a judge who had requested changes to the stop-and-frisk program ("Anhalt and Search") of the New York Police Department, and dismissed the judge from the case.
The Second U.S. Court of Appeal stated that the decisions of Judge Shira Scheindlin would be suspended until a decision was taken on the appeal of the city.
The judge had ruled in August that the city was in violation of the Constitution with the way in which the program for arresting and questioning persons was implemented.
The city appealed against its assessment and the remedial measures put in place, including the decision to set up a monitoring body to assist the police in amending their directive and the relevant training programme.
On Tuesday, the appeal court heard the arguments on the request for suspension.
The appeal report stated that the judge had to be removed from the case because she had violated the Code of Conduct for U.S. judges by stating that a judge should avoid the appearance of partiality; this was partly based on a series of media interviews and public statements in which she had responded publicly to the criticism of the court.
The judge had ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people, because they deliberately target black and Latin American men with the stop-and-frisk program.
It appointed an external body to monitor the implementation of significant changes, including reforms in guidelines, training and service supervision, and arranged a pilot program with cameras on the body in quarters where most of the controls were carried out.
In August, the city of New York declared itself ready to end the practice of storing names and addresses of persons who were released after police control.
An oral hearing on the appointment of the city is scheduled after 14 March 2014.
The stop-and-frisk tactics have been criticised by a number of civil rights defenders.
Checks of this kind have been in various forms for decades, but the number of checks recorded during the term of office of the partyless mayor Michael Bloomberg rose to an all-time high of 684.330 in 2011, most of which were black and Latin American men.
In 2004, four men who belonged to all the minorities filed a lawsuit that turned into a collective lawsuit.
Supporters of changes to the NYPD's stop-and-frisk programme say that the changes will end unfair practices and create a more trustworthy and effective police force and influence the way other police bureaux use the regulation.
Opponents are of the opinion that the changes would dampen the morals of the police, but not the crime; nor would money be wasted and the wider problem of a police officer who after the loss of thousands of jobs in the last decade are under pressure.
The judge pointed out that it did not end the stop-and-frisk practice, which was constitutional, but merely reformed the way the controls were carried out by the NYPD.
The happiness of the dreaming camels
Lucky is an oasis that manages to reach only dreaming camels
With this Bedouin wisdom, the first chairman Wolfgang Henne described the history and fascination of the association "Helping Hands".
On Saturday afternoon the tenth anniversary of the club was celebrated, which can already have significant successes.
The first chairman, Henne, reported in detail on the work of the association.
He himself was the first time in Mauritania in 2004 at the Cheijk-Zajed Hospital in Nouakchott.
As a result, another cooperation developed, and Gynecologist Henne carried out numerous operations on site on several trips.
During the talks, images of the stakes were shown on a large canvas so that the guests of the anniversary event could take a picture of the above-mentioned actions.
The desert vehicle of the club was also shown.
It is a former German border guard vehicle.
Rainer Prewo, the former O.B. of Nagold, had made the proposal to equip this vehicle with a photovoltaic system and is now planning, according to Henne, to act as a consultant at the association.
In 2008, Zimmerei Schleeh from Baiersbronn created the hospital in Socogim, a wretched neighborhood on the outskirts of the capital, in the record period of just under a week.
She also mentioned a new mother-child hospital in Nouakchott
Especially interesting in times when the birth clinic is to be rationalized in Nagold.
You learn a lot in Africa as a doctor, says Henne, for example, acceleration against burn-out.
Because of the political unrest in the country, one could not make as many trips as planned, but for this many doctors came to Germany to hospitate here in various areas.
In addition, containers with materials are regularly sent to Africa, such as medical devices, medications, bandages, hospital beds and glasses in March this year.
Co-initiator Hans-Joachim Fuchtel himself delivered plenty of local color by telling from Mauritania about Mercedes vehicles converted to the mobile goat stable and the experiences of the Stammheim musicians, who traditionally support the association, on their Mauritanian journey.
As his personal motivation, he named his work in the field of auditing as a young Member of Parliament.
When he realized how much money was lost on the road, he decided to help the Africans control a budget by the people.
In addition, Fuchtel stressed that global economy also demands global human love.
Nor should it be forgotten that Africa is closer than some think.
From Gran Canaria it was not far to Africa.
Coulson used phone hacking to check a tip
The former news of the Word editor Andy Coulson allegedly used "telephone hacking, surveillance and confrontation" in an attempt to confirm a wrong tip about an affair of the then Interior Minister Charles Clarke.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told the court in Old Bailey, News of the World had heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with his "attractive special advisor" Hannah Pawlby.
The newspaper instructed private detective Glenn Mulcaire to hack Pawlby's voicemails and prosecuted them, but Coulson also called them and left messages as the court learned.
"In the opinion of the Public Prosecutor's Office, Coulson, who is now the editor of the Emergency Service, is no one standing in front of people's homes hoping to catch them in fresh action, but one who likes to confront people with a story to see their reaction," said Edis.
He said NotW used three procedures to investigate stories investigatively: phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation.
The publisher is personally involved in the third method.
Obviously he knows about the second, the monitoring, otherwise it can't be.
What about the first one?
Does he know about the phone hacking?
He fights it off, but we say, "And whether he knew about it."
Rumors about Clarke's affair were first taken up by the feature editor of NotW when a source who was sexually interested in Pawlby was said: "Don't waste your time, she's with Charles."
A band with voicemails from their phone of at least three occasions was secured in August 2006 in Mulcaire's apartment.
The investigators also found entries on the detective's computer on which Pawlby and her sister were stored as "projects".
In the course of the research, Pawlby’s grandparents received anonymous calls asking for information about them, Edis explained.
Meanwhile, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup supervised the monitoring of Pawlby's movements.
On June 18, 2005, Coulson left her a voicemail with the following content: "I have a story that we want to bring out tomorrow, about which I would like to talk to Charles."
Edis explained that Coulson's activities in this story followed the same pattern as those of other important personalities, such as former interior minister David Blunkett.
The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson Blunkett had had an affair with a married woman when he himself suffered with the co-accused Rebekah Brooks, who had been married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks object to having sworn to hacking phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have admitted the phone hacking.
From protest against the planned rich tax, the French football will actually go through the first strike since 1972.
A conciliation meeting ends without results.
In the conflict over the rich tax, the government and the professional football in France have maneuvered into a dead end after a failed conciliation meeting.
Although President François Hollande received representatives of associations and associations at the Paris Élysée Palace on Thursday, he also listened to their complaints.
However, he refused to save the football from the planned 75-percent tax on income of more than one million euros per year, which is to be paid by all the country's companies for two years from 2014.
The other side also remained hard.
The strike announced for the end of November will now also be carried out, the head of the Association of Professional Clubs (UCPF), Jean-Pierre Louvel, announced.
The playing days in the Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 between 29 November and 2 December are therefore excluded.
Gechingen: No absolute protection possible
"We want to involve the inhabitants in planning early," Mayor Jens Häussler opened the citizens' information event on the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
Some 80 participants had come to the municipal hall to explain the measures planned, to ask questions, to express concerns and to bring ideas.
Häussler made it clear: "The final decisions are taken by the members of the municipal council".
The flood that struck Gechingen unprepared on 15 May 2009 had been a major event that raised the question of protective measures for the future, says Häussler.
A river basin survey had been commissioned with the neighbouring community Aidlingen, which is now the basis for the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
"The aim is to protect as many buildings as possible," says Häußler.
The planning of the protection against a flood that can be expected every 100 years, according to the German Weather Service, is laid down.
Climate change is taken into account by a 15% surcharge.
In specialist circles this is called "HQ 100aKlima".
The water masses that caused considerable damage in Gehingen in 2009 corresponded to a 1000-year flood.
"There is no absolute protection, but we can achieve a relative improvement," says Häußler.
In order to achieve the protection of HQ 100aKlima, around four million euros will have to be invested in Gechingen, with the municipality accounting for around 70 percent of national grants.
Höussler pointed out, however, that there is only support if an overall approach is implemented.
The community is dependent on the participation of its citizens.
An elaborate planning and authorisation procedure had to be completed.
In the best case, the implementation could start in 2016.
Among other things, the protection concept, which was already presented in the municipal council last week (we reported), provides for local measures in the inflow of the river Irm from the Stammheim valley.
Following the presentation of the flood protection concept, the participants took advantage of the opportunity to submit their concerns.
Among other things, it was questioned why no more dams and reservoirs were planned to protect the place.
Gregor Kühn, specialist planner of the responsible engineering office Wald and Corbe from Höelsheim, who presented the concept, stressed that it requires the interaction of all the measures presented to achieve the desired goal in total.
In addition, one would have to find the most economical solution, says Joachim Wald von Wald und Corbe.
Disbelief prevailed when the old town was laid down, which, even in the case of normal thunderstorms, suffers from an overload of the channel network.
The problem is known in the administration and the first measures have already been taken.
However, Mr Häussler pointed out that the guidelines for channel systems should be different from those for flood protection and should not be mixed.
The municipality was obliged to interpret the channel network in such a way that two to three years of rain events could be overcome.
To dimension the sewer canals more would devour millions.
Severely injured after impact
On the early Friday afternoon, two drivers were seriously injured in a frontal collision on Landesstraße 44 near Revensdorf.
The police immediately blocked the road completely, but at first could say little about the accident.
However, there are several testimonies that should first be evaluated.
It is certain that the 19-year-old driver of a VW Golf drove towards Revensdorf and the 38-year-old man from Gettorf met her with his Hyundai.
Both vehicles clashed, the woman being so trapped that the fire department needed almost half an hour to free her from the wreckage of the vehicle.
At first, the real cause of the accident remained unexplained.
Both accidents occurred in nearby hospitals.
The route was closed for about two hours.
He could be called the Dostoyevsky of the United States.
Philip K. Dick was a God-seeker, a metaphysicist, his novels and stories also have something serial.
Surprisingly the relationship in the exterior: the piercing eyes, the beard, the high forehead.
And just as Fjodor M. Dostoyevski can be understood with his massive oeuvre as the founder and apologist of the Russian soul, Philip K. Dick is read as an American prophet, which is quite valid in his own country.
Some titles have appeared in the Heyne publishing house, the Haffmans cassette with the 118 stories distributes two thousand.
Dick explains America - the realm of breathtaking technical progress, paired with paranoia, security madness and faith, to be chosen.
Dick had God's experiences, his late books read like a mixture of the revelation of John and a computer manual.
Maybe he was crazy, drugged his brain.
He understood, early on, that the computers are divinities.
He wrote a computer theology and asked what distinguishes a person from a machine, the Creator from his creature.
That's the "Blade Runner" problem.
The killing.
A master of science fiction.
A fantastic writer.
His stories inspired film directors such as Ridley Scott, Paul Verhoeven and Steven Spielberg.
This story is now particularly significant.
The "Minerheiten-Report" dates back to 1956, it exudes the smell of the Cold War and the McCarthy Tribute.
Here the principle of "pre-crime" is developed, "pre-crime", that is, what is now more or less official doctrine of the White House.
In Dick's world, which is like ours, mutants look to the future - and the police come to grips.
"We record individuals who have not violated any law," says the head of the authority.
"We'll catch them before they can commit a violent crime."
And: "In our society there are no serious criminals, for that we have a penal camp full of Pesudo criminals."
They assume that evil is happening, and prevent the criminal thought from being put into practice.
Dick's story acts like the blue break for the anti-terrorist laws and the NSA's hearing noise.
Anticipation of the attack: Obama's drone philosophy and practice also work.
But Dick's story isn't over yet.
The chief of police complains that there is no more division of violence, the military controls everyday life - and what is left of the state.
Then the monitor himself is monitored and transferred to a future criminal.
The system's going through.
It's perfect, but it's a lie.
It invents its own requirements.
Take error and sacrifice not only in purchase, but build on it.
The system creates the danger it fights.
Philip K. Dick's reading means getting closer to the truth over and over again.
Exploration of Merkel in Russia
Former U.S. intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in his Russian asylum in the U.S. spying business of Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Representatives of the German Federal Procuratorate could either ask written questions or meet the 30-year-old in Russia personally, the agency reported Interfax.
Previously, as the first German politician Snowden in Moscow, Hans-Christian Ströbele had met yesterday to talk to him about the affair.
NSA disclosures reinforce company paranoia due to state surveillance
On a mild day at the end of August, a German police helicopter flew deep over the US Consulate in Frankfurt am Main, Germany's capital of finance.
At the direction of the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection and Counter-Terrorism (BVT), the German Home Office, he should photograph the roof of the U.S. Foreign Office, which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
According to German media, the BVT wanted to prove the presence of surveillance antennas and the action led to a change of words between the US and the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Berlin.
James Clapper, U.S. Director of National Intelligence, once again insisted in September that the United States did not make use of foreign espionage opportunities "to steal the operating secrets of foreign companies on behalf of U.S. companies in order to increase their international competitiveness or profits."
But since Edward Snowden, who became a former Whistleblower, began publishing his full horn to US surveillance secrets, European governments and business leaders are no longer sure if they can speak to the Director.
Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency has been spying on the Brazilian oil company Petrobas and obtaining data from US cloud providers including Google and Yahoo have brought the company paranoia to a new peak due to state surveillance.
The barrel to overflow revealed that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone had been wired, possibly for ten years.
If the most powerful person in Europe can come into view, then management is certainly also potential targets.
Snowden has made the intensive cooperation between US secret services and companies transparent.
I think it is conceivable that this data will be used for mutual benefit.
"Germany must wake up," explains Oliver Grün, President of BITMi, who represents small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
German companies believe that the US was now almost as risky as China when it came to industrial espionage and data theft, so a survey published in July by the consultant company EY.
However, there was no evidence in the documents leaked by Snowden to date that the US has passed on the operating secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians have expressed concern that the EU lacked certain IT and Internet opportunities and should reduce its dependence on the US.
The companies are sceptical about this.
In the Bundestag it was suggested that we should build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly reopen them ...
"That's not how it works," says Hasso Plattner, chairman of the German software manufacturer SAP.
If you wanted a strong European IT industry, you shouldn't have let it die 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidised, from coal to cars to agriculture.
Everything except the IT industry.
Nevertheless, the reach and technical refinement of the U.S. spy authorities revealed by the snowden revelations shocked companies that had previously seen the greatest spying risk in China.
Cloud computing is undergoing a major change because European business leaders are now more aware that data stored in the US are subject to the case law of the US and are therefore potentially at risk.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a trading institution, some ten percent of US non-US members were planning to use an American provider after the disclosures about US data mining activities with Prism.
Jim Snabe, Deputy Managing Director of SAP, says: "We see a new question from customers who did not exist a year ago – it says: Where are my data stored and can you guarantee that these remain physically in this legal space?"
Many German business leaders believe that the recent reports simply confirm what they already knew, namely that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and therefore have to be guarded at all costs.
The fact that economic espionage is taking place is not a surprise.
It's always been like that.
"It has been a topic for many years and has not fundamentally changed as a result of the current discussion," says Kurt Bock, Chairman of the chemical company BASF.
The Americans are spying on us at a commercial and industrial level, just as we are, because it is in the national interest to defend our companies.
Company management usually does not boast about the countermeasures taken, as this brings benefits to attackers.
In large companies, employees have long been impressed that taking a free USB stick at a trade fair or the unguarded laying of a laptop in the hotel room is not advisable, to say the least.
Ulrich Hackenberk, a member of the board of directors at Audi car manufacturer, says that it has been a standard practice for years to collect mobile phones before a board meeting so that they cannot be used as hearing aids.
The German BVT advises managers to use simple prepaid phones when travelling abroad because smartphones may be compromised.
The prepaid phones are thrown away afterwards.
However, there is concern that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, many of these companies are world market leaders in the respective niches.
"Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack the experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect business secrets from unauthorised access," warns BAT in a report.
The US warns its own companies against economic espionage by other countries.
According to Washington Post, in February, France, Russia and Israel were ranked two of the countries that used to obtain economic data from hacking.
A member of the board of a German blue chip company agreed when it came to economic espionage, then "the French are the worst".
Bernard Squarcini, former head of the French Home Secretary DCRL, was quoted this month in an interview with the following words: "The secret services know very well that all countries, even if they work together in the fight against terror, spy on their allies."
Hechingen: fair answers wedding questions
"Marriage is the most important journey of discovery that man can make," said the philosopher Sören Kierkegaard.
Tips, how at least the wedding celebration succeeded, now gave a special fair in the domain in Hechingen.
Representatives were important providers around a wedding.
A trend: The retro look has kept in motion again.
This starts with wedding dresses.
White is must, best covered or in cream.
At the front are the many lined and embroidered clothes, often with a veil, but at the back they go down their backs and often end up in a tow.
Since, however, the spirits differ, as Stefanie Koch emphasizes from the fashion house Kleidermüller.
In men the suit dominates with vest and plastic, but also cream-coloured or brown combinations can be chosen.
Important is the selection of the venue, has been explained.
Jewelleryless side rooms are not optimal, the ambience should be special.
Here the domain drew attention to its own offer in the show.
If you want to drive with the carriage, Uwe Link has an offer for it.
"Cuts are also popular for boys' goodbyes," he says.
Romanticism is also needed for invitation cards, flower arrangements and also for wedding pictures.
More and more in fashion comes the "after-wedding photo" - i.e. recording series in special places, preferably waterfalls, a few days after the feast, but in wedding clothing, Elisabeth Keidel explained.
Many more details of a successful wedding were presented on Sunday in the domain.
Flower arrangement, rings, wedding table, cake and also a magician, such as Marko Ripperger, who can entertain guests stylishly.
Not to forget the right cosmetics and nail care.
Everything for an unforgettable feast.
Dog Friends Successful
For the time being, the athletes of the dog-friends Bitz were successful on a rally-obedience tournament.
Achim Scherrenbacher started in Candel with two dogs; with his female Sandy he scored 94 points in the beginner class and secured fifth place, and with the 15-month-old Marley he took it with 87 points at 12th place.
Susi Höpp took a critical look at the performance judge with her Woody in class 1.
Parents of a teenager from Georgia who died in a tragic accident believe in murder
The parents of the teenager, whose body was found in a rolled ringer mat in the gymnasium of his high school, are convinced that her son was murdered, said the family lawyer on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson from Valdosta in the U.S. state of Georgia was found on January 11 in an upright mat standing behind the stage in the school gym.
The investigators of the Sheriff of Lowndes County concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident, but the family of the 17-year-old doubted.
"They are convinced that their son has been murdered," said Benjamin Crump, the lawyer of Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, to FoxNews.com.
You would never have believed he died as the sheriff concluded.
"They believe that there is no logic, neither the laws of physics nor the common sense," says Crump.
Rather, they are convinced that the truth is hidden in order to protect the person or persons responsible for the death of their son.
"Your son went to school to study and came back in the body bag," he comments.
US Attorney Michael Moore said on Thursday that there would be a formal investigation into Johnson's death, as a number of important questions were still unsolved.
What was the cause of death?
Is his death due to a crime?
Moore explained that at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I follow the facts in whatever direction they lead.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I believe that there is a sufficient basis for formal investigation," he said.
Moore explained to reporters that the initial autopsy indicated that Johnson had died as a result of a "positional suffocation".
According to Moore, a second autopsy resulted in a different cause of death.
"There are a number of questions that need to be answered or confirmed," he said.
Moore added that if there was sufficient evidence to prove a criminal or civil investigation into Johnson's death, he would commission the FBI to conduct the investigation.
A representative of the County Sheriff's Office was not immediately prepared to comment on our request on Thursday.
A court in southern Georgia ordered on Wednesday that the authorities should release all surveillance videos that the investigators have reviewed.
The teen’s parents said they hoped that the video records contained evidence of how he died.
CDC publish Allergy Guidelines for Schools
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a series of guidelines for dealing with food allergies from children in schools.
These are the first such guidelines issued by the U.S. government, as the number of children subject to compulsory schooling increases with food allergies.
One out of 20 children in the United States now have a food allergy.
According to CDC, the spread of food allergies among children increased by 18 percent between 1997 and 2007.
The guidelines contain information for schools that should raise awareness of food allergies in the teaching body and staff and how to deal with children that show allergic reactions.
It is also recommended that schools have Epinephrine in stock – the most commonly used auto-injection of the EpiPen brand – in order to meet a potentially fatal hypersensitivity reaction.
Lawmakers in the states have recently changed the rules so that schools can keep Epinephrin more readily in stock.
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms mentioned by children who have an allergic reaction.
Children may say, "It feels like something's pushing on my tongue", "My tongue feels like a hair's on it" or "my tongue is pinching".
Parents of intersexual children can choose 'sexually indeterminate'
Germany is the first European nation in which a third sex is recognized for children born with indistinct genitals.
Newborns are no longer allocated rigidly to male or female.
Under the new law, parents no longer have to declare sex for such children, but can state "undetermined" or "undetermined" on the birth certificate.
The aim of the law is to take the pressure of parents so that they do not have to make hasty decisions regarding surgery for sexual orientation in newborns and combat discrimination against intersexuals.
According to the BBC years later, an intersexual person said, "I am neither a man nor a woman."
I remain mutilated and full of scars.
It is estimated that one out of 2,000 children comes to the world each year neither as a boy nor as a girl.
They belong to intersexuals, a group that are diagnosed with "sexual differentiation disorder" (DSD), a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, germ glands (ovulation sticks or testicles) or unusually developed genitals.
Wallis Simpson may have been intersexual.
The understanding of gender identification is still not very well developed, but most experts in the United States advise that you should use the best available information on gender allocation if a determination is not possible and not wait for the psychological and physical development of the child before deciding – if at all – for an operation.
New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr., who specializes in the problem of gender identification, said the new German law "sounds to a good thing".
Intersexual children are an ethical dilemma.
"Some people have life-threatening diseases that require surgical intervention, but this does not apply to most children," he said.
You can make a sex assignment without surgery and then wait for the identity to develop.
The scientific data on how a child develops its sexual identity at all are not very precise.
No one knows why it happens.
It's like the secret why people are gay.
A 2011 report to the European Commission states that intersexual people are to be distinguished from transsexual or transgender people, because their status is not gender-related, but is based on their biological constitution, which is not exclusively male or female, but typically both at the same time or not clearly defined as one of them.
These properties were reflected in secondary sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hair, breasts and stature, priority sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals, or in chromosome structures and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender people in their professional lives, as well as the extent of harassment, violence and prejudice.
Not with the gender image boys now have a special camp.
In the meantime, it is possible for adults in Australia and Nepal to indicate on official documents male, female or 'third sex'.
In June, Australian Norrie May-Welby (52) was recognized as the world's first "sexless" person after a court granted lifelong maintenance of an "undetermined" sex status.
In addition to M and W, German ID cards will have a third allocation, X for intersexual, according to the Ministry of the Interior.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a news release on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of French members of the strictly Catholic country signed a petition that the "gender theory" should be removed from school books.
The U.S. Catholic Online website has also objected to the German law, stating: "If the world is torn into a new state, where the sex is a decision, but not sexual activity, then we turn two more pillars of civilization."
The mother of a newborn from Maryland explained to the baby zone that it would be better if babies were given a sex at birth.
"The parenthood is stressful enough without further restrictions, especially if you don't know your own child's sex," she said on the parental website.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children born with both male and female sexes were called Hermaphrodites, according to the attractive Greek god who had both sexes.
Ten years ago, medicine viewed the sex as something that could be wiped out and then rebuilt.
But in the meantime, the ethical foundations of an operation are being called into question, since now it is known how complex the sexual identity is, and that doctors can also be wrong, because they do not know how the child feels when growing up with the gender assigned by them.
“In the middle of the 20th century it was called a ‘psychiatric emergency’,” Drescher said.
When such a child was born, the psychiatrist was not called, but the surgeon.
The prevailing theory of the treatment of children with indistinguishable genitals goes back to Dr. John Money from Johns Hopkins University, who believed that the sex was moldable.
He coined the term "sexual identity" and argued, social and environmental insults – as parents raise a child – interacted with the genes and hormones of a child and thus shaped whether a person considered himself male or female.
But in a 1966 case known as "John/Joan", his theories became controversial.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been separated from the child in a broken circumcision, to castrate the child completely and also remove his testicles and then raise him as a girl.
"Money presented this case as a successful example of a transformation, but it was not," Drescher said.
When the boy was about 15, he moved back to the male sex and married a woman.
At 38 he committed suicide.
According to Drescher, there are still doctors who would practice this model.
But in the 1990s, with the introduction of the Internet, survivors of these sex operations came to the public, who are "not happy with the result".
For example, Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, was born with XY-male chromosomes, but with ambiguous genitals.
The doctors were not aware whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never lead a "satisfying life" as a man.
So his external organ and testicles were surgically removed shortly after the birth of 1976 and he was raised as a girl.
At the age of 12, he received female hormones.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," he told ABCNews.com
I was unhappy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he should receive a vaginal plastic.
But since he was depressed and knew something was wrong, he demanded his medical records.
What he found out was shocking.
I was sterilized at birth – and no one ever told me that.
Bruce was born with a DSD through which his body could not produce enough testosterone to develop the genitals.
After learning the truth, he returned to his male identity, received testosterone injections, and had his breasts removed.
The operation made him infertile.
Today he fights for others in an organization called Interface Project for intersexual people to be perceived as normal.
However, Anne Tamar-Mattis, Managing Director of the California-based legal group Advocates for Informed Choice, is concerned that the German law could "encourage stamping and stigmatization".
"Many activists are concerned that the German decision could encourage parents to make quick decisions and to ‘not be determined’ to the child," she said.
We fear that this will favour intervention.
We think it would be better to assign the male or female sex and then wait.
But we still do not know how the law will work, so we can only speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said that her organization supports the Australian law because "it allows adults to be recognized as third sex".
"Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal gender," she said.
The German law is about the allocation at birth.
This is not a fight to force young children to do so.
When they grow up, they can decide their own body.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a breast radiologist from Pittsburg, who has a daughter with a sexual differentiation disorder and supports hundreds of others in a self-help group, says that the German law "authorises" both parents and children.
Katie, the daughter of Baratz, was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD called complete androgenic resistance.
Because of the recipe order of the target cells for testosterone, Katie developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus and no ovaries.
Today, Katie is 29 and married; she works at the University of Pennsylvania as an assistant in child psychiatry.
Although it is infertile, it hopes to be able to have a child through adoption or a leash.
"The law gives parents room, so that they do not have to make decisions in a crash," Baratz said.
It gives them the time to do different tests and to clarify things and thus gives them time before they write "male" or "female".
In this way everything is fine – you raise the child and love it.
You have a wonderful baby and enjoy parent happiness.
And you don't have to do an urgent operation that can't be undone anymore.
"This includes the children in the decision and eliminates the fear that drives parents because they think they would not do the right thing," she explained.
In the end, the child decides about the sex that suits him better – and that's wonderful.
This enables children to make their own decision.
Unknown hurt girl by shooting from car
Unknowns have injured a twelve-year-old in Saxony-Anhalt in shots from a car.
The perpetrators probably fired an air pressure weapon on a group of children in Genthin on Thursday evening.
That's what the police in Burg told me.
The girl was slightly injured on the left bank.
Rescue forces took the girl to the hospital.
The shot came from a small car that had driven past a group of six children and had stopped suddenly.
Witnesses saw two people sitting in the car.
The perpetrators also shot at a bus stop.
A disk broke.
Then they drove away.
The crime police found out it was called on Friday.
Until now, the police inspection Kempten can look back on a quiet Halloween night.
Officials were called only twice to throw eggs at children who threw them against house facades.
Since the homeowners recognized this in time and removed the Eierreste immediately, no material damage was likely to occur.
In addition, some Sylvesterböller were probably also lit in the city area, but there was no material damage either.
A resident of the Bischof-Freundorfer-Weg reported that his car was wrapped in toilet paper and his radical blinds were removed.
Until the police arrived, however, the man found his radial blinds in the immediate vicinity again, which is why the police did not have to continue working.
Living with a future perspective
Actually, Waltraud Ries lives in a dream.
Her house is located in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with plenty of greenery, an old tree stock, nice neighbours and also not too much traffic.
In the city it is only a few minutes by public transport.
"You are hopefully not afraid of spiders?" Waltraud Ries asks and points to a fat spider on the door frame.
I've been looking for a new apartment for my husband and me for some time.
But you know how difficult this is in Stuttgart.
The reason, however, is not spider phobia, but the concern about not being able to cope with the many steps to the house and the apartment at an age, she explains.
In addition, since a Meniscus operation, the mid-fifty woman has had to learn on her own body what it means to move from floor to floor with handicap.
Recently, a book of hers appeared on the subject of 'Happy living at age - Which type of living is the best for me?'.
'Our apartment is the best example of what isn't going at all', she begins to tell.
When she moved with her husband to the maisonette apartment more than 20 years ago, it was just a nice apartment in the middle of the green.
Today with mid-fifty Waltraud Ries thinks differently about it.
But she also knows that she is one of the few people who even deal with the subject of 'living in old age'.
Most of them will displace it as long as they can.
Always getting old just the others', she says smiling.
Only when the pressure of suffering is really great can you think.
'Then it can be too late, too,' says Ries.
In her book, the interior architect presents 17 living models for a self-determined living age.
'What form of living you choose, however, is always an individual decision', she explains.
The solution should not be given for age.
Even those who could afford the retirement seat in Tuscany or Brittany should always consider that he could also get sick.
And: 'Without good knowledge of the national language, one also unites in the Dolce Vita,' says the professional book author of emigration volunteers.
Among their models are classic care models, alternative living arrangements or the often quoted pensioner WG.
At the age everyone has his ticks and Macken
'For me such a community would be nothing,' she says with an eye wink.
Not at all like in a student toilet with a shared bathroom and a kitchen.
'At age, you just need your retirement rooms, too,' says Ries.
However, the author does not want to exclude the fact that a community of seniors can still work.
But this had to go differently than in the classic student WG.
And sometimes you just want his rest, too,' she thinks.
With this opinion, at least she is not alone in the state capital.
'Most old people in Stuttgart want to stay in their own apartment for as long as it takes,' is also the experience of Theresa Rütten, the head of the civil service Life at the age of the state capital.
Your service advises people on the topic of 'becoming older'.
Therefore, older people would often also take inconvenientities and restrictions to stay in their usual environment, that is also the experience of the Warentest Foundation.
Today there are many ways to make the house or apartment accessible.
Ries recommends that all those concerned with the alteration of their home or their home, be thoroughly informed first and not commissioned by the first craftsman.
Today there are also specialists for the age-appropriate conversion.
Even in the apartment you can realize something, and if it is only the toilet seat increase, the interior architect clears up.
But it is not always possible to remodel the existing apartment according to age and thus barrier-free, even if it is still so beautiful.
This experience had to make Waltraud Ries.
Although you could install a staircase lift inside the apartment, which would also pave the way up to the apartment door with stairs, but would be the far greater obstacle.
She will continue searching until she has found the ideal object for herself and her husband.
Before the move, it is more to her than to the spider at her apartment door.
US Snowden wants to continue to pursue criminal law
The U.S. has not changed its attitude towards former U.S. intelligence officer Edward Snowden.
He will continue to be accused of having passed on any secret information.
So he had to file a criminal trial in the United States, said the U.S. Secretary of State, Jennifer Psaki, in Washington.
The recent statements by Snowden would not change that either.
Previously, German Green Politician Hans-Christian Ströbele had appealed to the United States after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow to stop threatening him with punishment.
Psaki stressed that it was about a parliamentarian and not about a German member of government.
Secret Service Coverer Edward Snowden is in principle ready for a conversation with the German authorities.
First, however, he wants to know his situation clearly.
This was made clear by the former NSA member of staff sought by the USA in an unaddressed letter published by the Green Politician Hans-Christian Ströbele on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and forwarded it to the Federal Government, the Bundestag and the Federal Attorney General.
According to a translation distributed by Ströbele, the letter reads as follows:
To the competent authorities
I was asked to write to you about your mass surveillance investigation.
My name is Edward Joseph Snowden, and I used to be a contractual and direct expert at the National Security Agency (NSA), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) of the United States.
In the course of my employment in these institutions, I witnessed systematic violations of the law of my government, which prompted me to act out of moral duty.
As a result of the publication of these concerns, I was exposed to a serious and persistent rage that forced me to leave my family and my home.
I am currently living in exile and enjoying temporary asylum granted to me by the Russian Federation under international law.
I am encouraged by the response to my political action, both in the United States and elsewhere.
Citizens around the world and also senior officials - including the United States - have assessed the revelations of a system of universal surveillance, which is not accountable to anyone, as a service to the public.
These espionage revelations led to many proposals for new laws and directives aimed at the previously hidden misuse of public confidence.
The benefits to society from these insights are becoming increasingly clear, while at the same time the risks purchased have been visibly reduced.
Although the result of my efforts has been demonstrably positive, my government continues to treat Dissens as a betrayal of loyalty and strives to criminalise and accuse political opinion.
Yet: Proclaiming the truth is not a crime.
I am confident that the United States Government, with the support of the international community, will take this downward stance.
I hope that, if the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved, I will be able to participate in the responsible clarification of the facts concerning the statements made in the media, in particular with regard to the truth and authenticity of the reports, properly and legally.
I look forward to a conversation with you in your country as soon as the situation has been clarified and thank you for your efforts to safeguard the international law that protects us all.

Kindergarten has found a private buyer
"The building is in good hands," says Michael Maier, Mayor of Winterlingen.
The municipality sold the former kindergarten on the Gartenstraße to a private person.
The municipal council agreed to the sale in its most recent meeting in the non-public part.
The building changed its owner at an "adequate" price.
"The community is satisfied," says Maier.
The budget was set at EUR 100 000.
It is not yet clear how the new owner wants to use the former kindergarten.
The mayor is right that Winterlingen handed over the responsibility for the building to someone else before the winter and thus no longer has to stand up for the entertainment of the house, such as heating, looking at the garden and clearing the walkway.
"This effort is now gone," says Maier.
Space concert at high summer temperatures
The Musikverein Hammereisenbach gives a concert on the terrace of the Gasthaus Hammer.
When conductor Bianca Willmann lifts the bar at 7.30 p.m., the thermometer still shows 25 degrees.
About 50 listeners enjoy the sounds of the Hammrich musicians.
The chairman Manuela Honeck explains the music pieces.
In this context, Honeck thanked all those who had helped to successfully cope with the first musical shock.
Report: Obama campaign considered replacing Biden with Hillary Clinton
The closest consultants from President Barack Obama have secretly considered replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton in the 2012 election campaign, according to the New York Times.
The revelation is the most remarkable surprise of Mark Halperin's long-awaited work and John Heilemann's 2012 campaign, "Double Down: Game Change 2012".
The Times has a copy of the soon-to-be-published book and reported on Thursday evening that the president's top consultants had conducted "extensive group meetings and surveys at the end of 2011" to find out if Obama's hope of re-election would be better if he dropped his bid.
According to Jonathan Martin, the Times' National Political Correspondent, the book thoroughly records the history of the efforts of leading campaign and White House staff, including the former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, to measure the effect on the survey values of exchanging the former foreign minister Clinton for the vice-president.
The potential change was a strictly guarded secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen of the president's closest advisers – including Daley, former campaign leader Obama's, Jim Messina, and former White House chief adviser David Axelrod and David Plouffe – knew about the planned change.
In 'Double Down' it is claimed that Daley was at the forefront of efforts to exchange Biden despite her 'narrow personal relationship' before finally deciding against such a move, after the data showed that Clinton's candidature would 'not significantly improve Obama's chances'.
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the government had actually considered replacing Biden with Clinton.
"I said a whole series of things to consider, and that was one of them," said Daley to the magazine.
It must be remembered that the President had terrible survey values at the time, so we thought, "For God's sake, what do we do?"
While Daley referred to the investigations as 'careful care', Martin told Anderson Cooper of CNN that during the campaign for re-election, considerable effort had been made to find out whether such a move would pay off with regard to the ballot boxes.
"In campaigns, not so much money is spent on surveys and focus groups if you don't think seriously about something," said Martin at AC360.
However, it is not clear whether Obama knew that his team was thinking about an exchange.
Martin told CNN that he had asked Daley if his then boss had known about the potential change.
Although Daley explained that he did not believe that the president of the possible change was "conscious," the former chief of staff admitted that it was "possible" that Obama knew about it.
Martin added that "Double Down" did not provide a definitive answer to the question of whether the political probes had reached Obama's desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought that Obama knew nothing about whether to drop Biden in the elections.
"Possible," Martin replied.
What happens to my e-mail?
E-mail is actually an electronic letter.
Was the letter secret technically implemented in the design of the Internet service e-mail similar to that of the conventional post?
The design of early Internet services focused on enabling communication.
Therefore, the basic technical protocols did not take care to create a stable foundation for a safe exchange of letters.
Therefore, a conventional email corresponds to an open postcard rather than a sealed letter.
If the user sends "Anna" an email to "Benni", are the two computers directly connected?
In the first step, the email program or the browser of Anna sends the mail to the mail server of her service provider.
For example, if she has a GMail account, it would be Google.
This mail server sends the content to the provider that Benni uses.
On the route, the mail can run over several other servers on the Internet.
Bennie can then call his provider.
Will conventional emails be read on their way through the web?
Most emails are read several times by software robots on the way.
With the provider of the sender, it is usually checked whether the mail carries a malicious program as an attachment.
A virus check is also carried out on the recipient systems.
In addition, providers will check whether this is an annoying and unwanted spam mail that is immediately deleted or at least sorted out in a spam folder.
Do the robots have another task?
For systems like GMail, the robot also determines the information that Google needs to place context advertising.
When Anna and Benni communicate via GMail about their upcoming holiday trip, Google can display links to holiday offers.
Do unknown people also read the emails with?
The likelihood of unauthorized persons reading an email is extremely low.
Theoretically, however, this is possible.
In companies, administrators often have the possibility to read electronic mail.
The law enforcement authorities and secret services also have legal possibilities to intercept or take notice of emails.
In addition, possible illegal spying actions.
Is it possible to protect e-mails from peer reading?
Encryption to the OpenPGP standard allows an e-mail to be encrypted effectively against peer-to-peer encryption.
With high technical effort it is also possible to disguise the metadata of an e-mail communication, so that it is not even possible to recognize who has communicated with who.
How important are Yahoo and Google on the email market in Germany?
Yahoo and Google play only a subordinate role in the mainly privately used mailboxes, according to a survey by Consvios Consulting of August 2013.
While the shares of Yahoo mail had fallen last, GMail was able to increase significantly by Google.
Mother stuck in the forest and pension collected
When his old mother died, a man from Wolfsburg made a plan.
He buried the dead in a forest - and continued to collect their pension and allowance.
In order to continue to collect pensions and care allowance, a 67-year-old Wolfsburger buried his dead mother after investigation by the police in the forest.
First, he covered up the death of the 89-year-olds, then he dropped the money for more than a year and a half.
Now the 67-year-old has to answer for fraud, as a speaker said on Friday.
The man then hid the woman in a forest near Helmstedt.
The man was suspected as early as May: At that time it was noticed that no more medication was needed for the needy mother.
The pensioner told the investigator that his mother had travelled to Spain.
Because this was strange to the officials, they continued to determine.
It turned out that the two had lived in a common apartment for more than 15 years and he had last cared for them.
The 67-year-old finally admitted the death of his mother.
According to the police, an autopsy revealed no evidence of a capital crime.
Do you like ice cream that glows in the dark?
A British entrepreneur has developed the first ice in the dark – with the help of jellyfish.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of marine animals and created a luminous leak.
The idea came to him after he had read a research work on qualls and convinced Chinese scientists to artificially produce the glowing protein.
The ice cream reacts when consumed with the tongue, increasing the pH in the protein and triggering the light.
Chris explains that the ice cream reacts to the heat in the mouth and lights – the more you lick, the brighter it gets.
Charlie, founder of the ice cream company "Lick Me I'm Delicious", says: "The product is incredible, but still in a very early production phase, and so you get two grams of it for 200 pounds."
The protein used in the ice cream reacts with the tongue at a neutral pH value.
When the mouth warms the protein, the pH rises and the ice shines.
We've been testing it over the last few months and it seemed ideal to bring it to the market at Halloween because it has this wonderful lighting effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever made, because the jelly lamp is four times more expensive than gold.
Each bullet costs me about 140 pounds.
But it tastes delicious.
Charlie's experimental company based in Bristol is famous for its unusual flavors, including beer, cheese, beef and leaf gold.
But his newest creation is to become even more ambitious.
He says: "I would like to develop an invisible ice cream."
This is on and on itself impossible because of the light cracking caused by the ice crystals that make up ice cream; but I guess we find a way to create it.
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a jelly that are artificially produced by Chinese scientists
After six days of play, the TSV Morsum is still without any point in the handball league.
For the team of Ingo Ehlers, it will be the Derby against the TSV Daverden, who celebrated his first victory last weekend.
With this game the season starts new for us.
"I hope we finally have our head free," says Ehler's behavior optimistically.
He finally has his complete cadre at his disposal, with the exception of the permanently injured Hendrik Blohme.
Daverden, like us, also sets the pace.
That is why we need to keep our error rate low.
First of all, however, it is important to increase in the coverage, which last but not least has left anything but a secure impression.
Daverden's coach Thomas Panitz is much more relaxed after the first season victory against Nordhorn.
Of course, the game was a house number.
But that's why we're not the favorite for a long time, because everything can always happen in Derby.
However, Panitz now wants to deposit in Morsum to start a series.
Jan-Malte Jodat will be missing.
For this, the A-Jugliche Joost Windschuß, who is active with double play rights at the A-Jugend-Bundesligist HC Bremen, celebrates his season debut.
Whoever's not hot in a game like that should stay at home.
Halloween 2013: In figures
When I was little, Halloween had something magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, stay late and dress up for the neighborhood.
Today, I'm more like a Halloween muffel.
In the last two years, I have not declared myself willing to distribute sweets from my home and will probably not do so this year.
But according to statistics, I'm a black sheep in Halloween.
The majority of Americans – 158 million to be exact – celebrate Halloween this year and spend a total of 6.9 billion US dollars on sweets, costumes and decorations, according to the American Association of Retailers (NRF).
One thing that I look forward to every Halloween then again is the trend values.
The costumes will amount to about 1.2 billion of the $6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.
This year exciting unlived objects are the last scream.
Women no longer have to wear sexy clothes, they can now also embody seductive food such as pizza, hamburger or carrots.
As for men, I expect a lot of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead, and I bet the daft punk space men will make it into the Instagram feeds this year.
According to Google, the most sought after costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I guess there's nothing wrong with tradition.
Last year we dressed our dogs and were not alone to my amazement.
Indeed, Americans spend 330 million dollars this year on costumes of their pets, according to the NRF.
These are a lot of hot dogs.
As far as sweets are concerned, we are not naive.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion this year, says The Nielsen Company.
That's about 270 million kilograms of chocolate bars, lucerne, sweets and rubber bears.
So good news for the 41 million people, according to the US Department of Commerce, who pass through the neighborhoods by saying 'sweet or sour'.
In fact, we will buy over 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and – we don't have anything to do with it – eat.
The only thing we don't want to consume is the sweet Candy Corn; nevertheless, 15 million kilograms of it are sold around Halloween, according to the National Association of confectionery manufacturers.
These are about nine billion corn grains.
It's a mystery I haven't been able to solve yet.
Nothing belongs more to Halloween than houses where it spits.
They have great names such as 'Terror Behind the Walls', 'Howl-O-Scream' and 'The House of Shock'.
In fact, there are 1,200 officially recognized ghost houses in the United States that earn $500 million in revenue, says America Haunts, and that includes the wonderful photos on which you just pee in your pants and then the friends put on Facebook where you won't get rid of them again, and then the guy you're standing on leaves a comment like 'next facial expression'.
But finally we come to the pumpkins.
Charlie Brown familiarized us with the Great Pumpkin when we were children, and the carving of a pumpkin lantern is like the decoration of the Christmas tree – something we have made up of small ones.
Fortunately, the baby in pumpkin's trend only started last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up to carve the pumpkin and not to sit in it.
This year Americans will spend about 106 million dollars on pumpkins, according to the US Census Bureau.
The pumpkin lantern, which slowly rots in the courtyard, probably comes from Illinois, where 245 million kilograms of pumpkin were harvested this year.
If you want to score correctly, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California and cut something nice out of their 921 kilos of pumpkin.
Housing fire in Helmbrechts: Rescue forces mountains charred body
The fire department had to move out in Helmbrecht on the late Thursday evening.
A three-family house in the district of Hof catches fire in the night for Friday.
The rescue forces are storing a charred corpse from the house.
Rescue forces found a charred body in a three-family house in a fire in Helmbrechts.
Whether it was a resident was still unclear, as a police spokesperson in Bayreuth said.
On the late Thursday evening it had burned on the ground floor of the house.
When the fire brigade arrived, the flames were already beating out of a window.
The campers went to the apartment and found the body in a room.
This and another room burned out completely.
The entire ground floor was damaged.
All other residents had not been home during the fire, the police spokesperson continued.
The building is no longer habitable for the time being.
The exact cause of the fire was not clear at first.
Germany's largest state church has launched an offensive to advertise for the pastor's profession.
The background is a possible shortage of pastors: The Evangelical Lutheran State Church of Hanover expects the number of its pastors to halve by 2030, after the current situation.
For young people today, the profession is very attractive and offers good prospects for the future, said Pastor Mathis Burfien (43) in conversation with the Evangelical Press Service.
It is attractive to be able to determine the course of work and the day itself.
With Burfien for the first time, the Landeskirche commissioned a pastor in a full place to inspire young people to study theology.
At the moment, fewer and fewer young people decide to study theology after graduation.
Burfien takes this back to the process of ecclesialization: "God's voice is silent, the world is loud".
The profession was characterised by great freedom and diversity.
I am the Lord of my appointment calendar and can set my priorities where it is important to me.
Pastors could be very close to the people as a pastor.
They earned as much as teachers and could live well on it.
Certainly more is paid in the free economy, but theologians would have a safe employer for that.
This is true of young people today, who are not just about careers, but about work that is full of sense.
According to the Landeskirche, which covers three quarters of Lower Saxony, about 60 pastors are currently retired each year.
At the same time, about 40 graduates of a theology study begin their vicariate.
In sparsely populated peripheral areas such as the resin, Emsland or Wendland, it could become difficult to occupy places in the future.
Burfien wants to organise study days for young people and also invite celebrities who have studied theology.
Theology studies offer a broad range of training.
You can even become President of the Federal Republic of Germany.
Land Rover Rally Series announced
In the interior there are race seats and six-point belts as well as a freephone system.
The options range from reinforced brakes, a service package with support from bowler workers mechanics and logistical support to vehicle storage between events.
Drew Bowler, Managing Director of Bowler Motorsport, explains: "The Rally customers who come to Bowler have changed."
They are not all experienced racers, but people who are looking for excitement and adventure as well as for an accessible way to world-class events.
We are pleased to be able to open this way in partnership with Land Rover and MSA and believe that the format opens up new opportunities to experience the different rally disciplines in Great Britain and abroad and prepare newcomers for the rigors and reality of Rally Raid.
We really enjoyed developing the Defender Challenge cars – this will be an entertaining championship.
In addition, there is a training and testing day in February at the Defender Challenge as well as the option to participate in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
Firearm called for the rescue of a little dog trapped 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous rock lead in a quarry
Cockerpaniel-Hundin Ruby had run away after a minor traffic accident
Three days later she was discovered by a walker in the quarry in her disreputable position
Firefighters sailed off the rock face and rescued the dog from safe death
The fire department managed to get a dog to safety, which was trapped on a 15 - meter - high promenade in a rock wall.
After a traffic accident on Sunday afternoon, the nine-month-old Cockerspaniel-Hündin Ruby ran away and survived three days alone before being rescued from a quarry on Wednesday.
Scott Alderson, 25, and his friend Becky Hall, 20 of whom the dog belongs, came to the quarry Flappit in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to welcome Ruby back and thank the firefighters of the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They had desperately sought her missing bitch and had published cries for help in social networks when she had escaped into the quarry after the small traffic accident.
Around 14:15 a.m. on Wednesday, a walker who executed his dog saw the stranded Ruby on the 15 meter high heel in the quarry.
The Cleckheaton Fire Station technical rescue team rushed to the scene and sailed off to rescue Rubys, who was then transported up in a dog box.
Andy Clayton, a technical rescue team specialist, said: “She was in a dangerous situation.
It was located in the middle of the rock wall – 15 meters from the top and the ground.
She did not move muscle during her rescue – she was like frozen.
But now she's fine.
She then ate a couple of dog chicks.
That was a pretty unusual effort.
The fact that the dog has been discovered is incredible.
Peter Lau, specialist in the technical rescue team, said: "Ruby had a huge fortune."
There was the possibility that she was severely injured or worse.
Ruby was brought to the vet, but he found nothing except exhaustion and dehydration.
Becky Hall from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: "Seeing salvation was frightening."
I couldn't believe she was really up there.
It was wonderful to keep her in her arms again.
The veterinarian explained that if the exhaustion had become too great and it had collapsed, it would probably have crashed.
The firemen have done great.
It was really brave what they did.
We are just so grateful and each of them was absolutely incredible.
Scott Alderson from Keighley added: "We were afraid that she would fall down, but she stayed up."
The firefighters were great.
I can't believe where she was.
Mick Jagger explains that he never hit Katy Perry when she was 18.
During an interview with an Australian radio station this week, the pop star said that she was a background singer at Jagger's song "Old Habits Die Hard" from 2004.
Perry explained that she ate dinner with the old rocker and that "he dredged me when I was 18".
She added: "It's been a long time and he was very nice to me."
In a statement, a representative of Jaggers, 70, said on Thursday that he "denies categorically that he has ever attempted to approach Katy Perry".
The representative added: "Maybe she confused him with someone else."
Perry was one of the singers who had a guest appearance on the Rolling-Stones tour this year.
Her new album "Prism" landed on 1st this week.
George Kerevan: European unbundling gives the Scots the choice
A new day, a new horror story of independence.
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland is needed to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership.
This provides the keyword for stories about passport controls in Berwick and a border secured with barbed wire along the Hadrian wall.
In fact, the Strathclyde template pointed to the potential economic benefits that would bring more freedom of movement in the rest of Europe, but this – as expected – did not matter in the headlines.
Nor has anyone mentioned that EU Member States often comply with their strict rules if it is more favourable to them.
Since Scotland is currently not part of the Schengen area, the continued disregard for Brussels would be only a small concession in return for what one really wants from the Scots.
So, actually, no story.
And one that has come so far that it already resembles a fossil: the first time I heard the "independence means passport controls" ducks at least 40 years ago.
An interesting point is lost in the constant repetition of this ancient story.
Why should an independent Scotland be expected to dance after the European pipe?
Why exchange the London yoke for that from Brussels, especially now?
These are the real European news: the great plan for the unification of Europe, drawn up after the war, has come to an end.
With the euro crisis, the project Europe has officially died.
All over the EU, parties who are hostile to the EU or want to throw the euro overboard as a Community currency are gaining ground.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic party was able to hold almost five million votes for Germany – only founded this year – in the Bundestag elections in September and thus effectively expel the Free Democrats (the equivalent of the British Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag.
There has always been domestic opposition to the plan to create a federalist Europe.
However, the current economic crisis turns out to be a turning point.
Because of the strict austerity policies imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank in connection with the compulsory jacket, in which the respective national economy is forced to hold on to the single currency, many people believe that the project Europe has gone too far.
The crisis of the euro has little to do with national governments causing excessive budget deficits – that was only the case in Greece.
Instead, the Eurosystem has fixed its members at exchange rates, which are beneficial to German exporters – and German politicians would like to leave that.
Without the possibility of a devaluation of the local currency, Southern Europe can be found with a built-in productivity disadvantage compared to Germany.
The only option is to reduce wages and public expenditure – stimulated by Berlin.
There is a deeper European productivity problem behind the current budgetary and monetary problems.
As a result of the "green" energy directives prescribed by Brussels – a code for subsidising French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers – European industry pays double for electricity and four times for gas compared to the United States.
This is a paralysing cost disadvantage, as we have already seen in Grangemouth.
All the world's wage-fixing regulations do not protect the European petrochemical industry from being pushed into the corner by cheap American shale gas.
As a result, a revolt is taking place, especially in France, the former cheerleader of the EU.
After the war, the French political elite saw the EU as a vehicle with which to keep Germany in check and to raise Paris at eye level with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a gateway to political legitimacy, and Europe has repressed its own economic policy, with which the French economy has to fight.
The result: Marine Le Pen's right-wing, EU-enemy Front National has just won a decisive re-election and has thus referred the ruling socialists to third place.
The Front National is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of voters' votes – a timely warning for the British Labour Party that it cannot assume a division in the right spectrum would automatically mean benefits for the left.
What does Le Pen do with its newly gained popularity among the working class's white Frenchmen?
It wants to use the EU elections next year to forge an anti-EU, anti-Community currency block in the European Parliament.
If the anti-EU parties do well in these elections – and that is very possible – then for the first time such a block could dominate the European Parliament.
This is the point I want to make: in the not too distant future, the growing resentment against the EU and the single currency will come together to abolish the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will become more like the 'Europe of the (sovereign) Nations', the General de Gaulle favored.
Germany and some of its satellite economies may hold onto the euro, but France and southern Europe will return to their own currencies.
I expect Britain to distance itself from this project in the hope of flattering itself in the US.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will stand alone in the Atlantic rain.
Where does Scotland stay with all this?
We can decide to be a region of (in the last consequence) Klein-England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – which includes telling Berlin and Brussels what they can do.
I suspect that Scotland could drive quite well in a relaxed European alliance, provided we keep our own currency.
Cooperation with other similar countries is easier in an unfederated Europe of the nations.
Otherwise, we should consider doing so equally to Norway and maintaining our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is – remarkably – the most successful political movement against austerity in Europe and has won a spectacular majority in 2011 due to the rejection of the proposed (and implemented) cuts that the Labour Finance Minister Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory-Lib Dem coalition had to answer.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland now to opt for independence only to be forced by Berlin and Brussels to have austerity policies.
Early puberty: Growing up faster
African American and Hispanic girls tend to achieve puberty rather than their white peers, as studies show.
Physical changes do not mean puberty directly
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe that epidemic obesity is a trigger of early puberty
The trend towards early puberty is less pronounced in boys
The former CNN correspondent Pat Etherridge is a journalist who specializes in child health and family topics.
Should a mother be concerned if her daughter grows breasts and pubic hair at the age of seven or eight?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics Children's Association in Orlando, Florida, this week, paediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz stated that these early physical changes were relatively normal among American girls and were a new standard.
"I spend a lot of time calming down parents – this is usually not a sign that puberty is now rapidly taking place," Kaplowitz explained.
Clear indications of development, such as growing breasts, pubic and shoulder hairs, and body odors, show up in girls earlier.
Nevertheless, there was only a slight shift at the age of the menarche (occurrence of the first rule bleeding) in the last 40 years.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, slightly less than 12.75 years in 1970.
"When breast development begins, it takes at least two to three years to reach the menarche," said Kaplowitz, also author of the book "Early Puberty in Girls: The Essential Counsellor for Dealing With This Common Problem".
Time is the most accurate test as puberty progresses.
It is controversial, which is actually the beginning of puberty, but it is true that the breast enlargement is accompanied by a growth boost before the age of eight.
In most cases, the process slows down or stagnates – something that a pediatrician can closely monitor.
If progress is made faster, tests may be indicated by an endicronologist so that serious problems such as tumours or cysts can be excluded.
There are treatment methods to delay an early menstruation and prevent another episode: the premature aging of the bones, which can ultimately lead to growth inhibition and thus small body growth in adults.
The recommendations for medication or hormonal therapy are based on the age of the child, the rate of development, the rate of growth and the emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is hesitant about drugs, but he admits: "Repressing puberty can alleviate behavioral problems and feelings of girls, unlike being their peers."
The other big problem is understandable: parents just don't want their very young daughters to have the period.
"They worry about the risk of pregnancy or how they handle the hygiene side," said Kaplowitz.
"It was a shock," recalls a woman whose daughter had her ten days.
Even if there were first signs and we had talked about menstruation, she was not emotionally prepared.
She came home scared and excited from school because she was the first in her circle of friends.
There are many comprehensively published theories on the causes of early puberty.
But there is no conclusive evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media would be the cause.
Boys come to puberty like girls in the past.
Kaplowitz believes that the most convincing premise is the epidemic of obesity.
He supported the implementation of a 2001 study on girls aged six to nine years who establish a link between body fat and entry into puberty.
Other studies support this conclusion, but there are many other factors that played a role.
In this country, African American and Hispanic girls tend to achieve puberty rather than their white peers.
There are different explanations for this.
Globally, an early puberty seems to be influenced by all sorts of things, from economic conditions to climate to genes.
Another riddle: Although boys grow facial and puberty earlier, the trend towards a full-blown past puberty is not as pronounced as for girls.
Other doctors at the AAP conference underlined the complexity of the issue.
The emergence of acne and pubic hair is common even in babies and toddlers.
"We need to be careful about how we identify the true beginning of puberty," said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a paediatric endocrinologist at Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to be advised by their pediatrician on how to talk to their child.
"This may mean having a conversation earlier than expected," Kaplowitz advised.
If you stay calm, the child usually reacts well.
Girls who bloom early need the insurance that the process is a normal part of life, even if it enters earlier than thought.
Jumbo manufacturers argue in the face of large orders over seat width
Between leading aircraft manufacturers there has been an argument about the width of seats in the tourist class on long-haul flights, indicating the tone for a bitter collision at the Dubai Airshow this month.
The dispute revolves around the seat width offered to passengers on long flights in the tourist class – not always those who are most concerned with airlines, but this designated space represents the key to the efficiency claims of the latest Airbus SAS and Boeing Co. aircraft.
Airbus called for an industry standard this week, which requires a seat width of at least 46 cm (18 inches) in the tourist class, but the U.S. archrival Boeing says that the airlines should decide.
The dispute comes at a time when the aircraft builders are competing to sell even larger versions of their two-engined long-distance flyers, and expect record orders at the event from 17 to 21 November.
The design of the rear part of the aircraft, in particular whether there are nine or ten rows, is crucial for the economic results indicated for the new mini-jumbo design.
Boeing claims that its modernized "777X" is 406 people with seats in the tourist class, which are more than 17 inches wide and thus allow ten per row.
Airbus explains that the competing version of the A350 carries 350 people in 18 inches wide seats in the tourist class, with nine per row.
Aircraft giants often hand out hiebe about technical details by means of advertising in the specialist press.
Airbus now appeals directly to the public in front of the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X is expected to make the race with over 100 orders.
Recently, the company presented an ad that could be the start of a new ad war and showed investors an image in which three people would sit in a restaurant together, and the title: "Would you accept that?"
"Boeing proposes long-haul flights in seats that are closer than regional turbo-props," says Airbus sales manager John Leahy.
In view of changing dietary habits, people are getting thicker, but aircraft seats have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 defined the modern long-distance journey, and at the end of the century, the weight of the male average American has increased by ten percent between 40 and 49 years, according to the U.S. Ministry of Health.
The waist size of the male average American in the 21st century is 100.8 cm according to US health statistics.
Airbus says that his rival adhered to a seat concept from the 1950s when the average body size of the newly baptized "Jet Set" was narrower.
According to Airbus, investigations have shown that an additional inch (2.54 cm) per seat increases sleep quality by 53 percent.
Boeing contests Airbus’ seat dimensions figures and says that it is not up to manufacturers to decide how airlines design the balance between fares and equipment.
The company also explains that according to investigations the experience in the aircraft depends on more than the seat width.
"It is really about giving airlines flexibility so that they can do what they think they need to do in order to be successful," explains aircraft cabin expert Kent Craver of Boeing.
They don't want us to dictate to them what makes them profitable.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers it is about more elbow freedom, but for manufacturers it is increasingly a topic that can affect sales.
Behind the dispute is a race for aircraft orders with an estimated volume of at least $700 billion according to list prices in the coming decades, which could have a lasting impact on the export balance of the US or Europe.
As Reuters reported for the first time in July, the seat layout is the driving force behind the dispute over the new jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim 20 percent more efficiency per seat in their latest two-engine long-distance designs than the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 77-300ER.
In part, Boeing's statements on the results depend on the fact that the 777X is compared with its ten seats per row with the original design of nine seats in the 777.
The increase in the cost per unit is still lower than for currently used machines with ten seats per row.
"Boeing therefore squeezes more seats into its aircraft to make it more competitive for our products," says Kevin Keniston, Head of Passenger Comfort at European Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts say that full cabins with ten seats per row at existing 777s indicated that many passengers opted for the narrower arrangement, which could be associated with cheaper fares.
"The 18-inch seat width would be great for passengers, but the reality is that from an economic point of view, the Airbus offer is controlled by the 777 threat," says Mary Kirby, expert on cabin facility, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not offer seats, but a catalogue of suppliers from which airlines can choose.
The world-traveling jet salesmen even carry band measures to measure the equipment at the competition.
Even if they praise the comfort, all manufacturers also offer high-density jets for low-cost airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers an A350 with ten-seater rows, but has not sold yet according to its own statement.
Until recently, Airbus has stressed the importance of more adaptability of the cabins and offered wide seats at the corridors for some jets.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets, experts say that the reputation for a new industry standard is likely to blow but could divert from the wave of 777X sales.
New anti-nicotin vaccine could make the Garus the pleasure of smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotin vaccine that could ruin the fun of smoking.
A single dose of the vaccine could protect mice from nicotine addiction for a lifetime.
Before human testing, further tests are needed, which may take a few years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the first results are good.
“We are very hopeful that this type of vaccination strategy can help millions of smokers who have tried to stop and have tried all the methods available on the market, but have had to experience that their nicotine craving is stronger than these approaches,” says Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified to contain the genetic information for the production of nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then produce a constant flow of antibodies.
The antibodies hunt the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain, which means that a smoker does not experience a nicotine high.
In trials, vaccinated mice administered nicotine maintained their normal activity level.
On the other hand, mice without vaccination would have taken a "time off", the researchers said, a sign that the nicotine had reached its brain.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
The vaccinations had to be given so frequently to maintain antibody levels that they were expensive and impractical.
However, the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be significantly lower, as it transforms liver cells into antibody factories.
As Professor Crystal said, a future vaccine for humans, if sure, could be given to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette, thus preventing nicotine addiction.
But it's more likely that smokers would use him to stop.
"They then know that when they start smoking again, they are not satisfied with the nicotine vaccine, and this helps them to put down the habit," he explains.
British scientists said that the results were interesting, but at the same time warned that further research was needed.
Tripodi denies having been influenced by Obeid
Against the former minister of the Joe Tripodi laboratory party from New South Wales, an investigation is initiated by the state corruption commission.
The former NSW Minister denies having amended the provisions on maritime leases at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who held covert holdings in three plots on state-controlled land.
The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC Independent Commission against Corruption) has extended its investigations on Friday on whether Obeid has influenced various ministers to extend leases at Circular Quay, where the Obeids run two restaurants and a café without tendering after their expiry in August 2005.
Now it is determined for the accusation that Tripodi had known Obeid's hidden interest in the properties after Tripodi's former deputy chief of staff had declared Lynne Ashpole on Thursday accordingly.
In years of talks that began in 2005, the government had pressed for public tenders for the leases.
The tenants were against it and also wanted longer running times.
In 2009, the leases for the companies at Circular Quay, which brought the Obeids annually $2.5 million, were renewed without a public tender.
Tripodi, who was Minister of Port from February 2006 to November 2009, had originally voted for public tenders.
However, he refused to make the changes at Obeid's request, which, as Tripodi confirmed, had forced the reform of the government's lease arrangements.
One of the ICAC's telephone records showed talks from August and September 2007 between Obeid, Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had moved to the Port Ministry after working under Obeid in the Fisheries Authority.
'Where the subject discussed in this telephone conversation was the preparation of commercial leasing arrangements?' asked Deputy Commissioner Anthony Wheely Tripodi.
'No', Tripodi replied.
I can't remember what was discussed, but it definitely wasn't.
Definitely not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli fighter aircraft attack target in Syria, according to official sources
Israeli fighters had attacked a target in the Syrian port of Latakia on Thursday night, confirmed a senior government official against Fox News.
The official did not explain what the goal was, but said that it had been at least one.
According to the Associated Press, the target was Russian SA-125 missiles.
At least twice this year Israel has already carried out air strikes on missile deliveries in Syria.
Foreign workers with 457 visas could be subjected to a 'trueness test'
In the context of extended measures, the government is thinking about a "trueness test" for foreign workers with 457 visas.
If the test were to be introduced, he would use a criterion to prevent the 457 from being used to fill unqualified jobs or as a back door for family and friends to Australia.
Today, a government discussion proposal was published after the former member of the Labor Party, Maxine McKew, had condemned the government's comments on foreign workers because they could be taken as an insult by the neighbours of Australia.
"Loud declarations such as 'foreigners are to hire themselves in the back' and 'Australian first' are a very unpleasant relapse in times when trade unions called for a protected labour market," she said to the Australia India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that white workers should be protected – and if some in the region embellished an echo of this historical artifact, I would not be surprised.
The proposal for a debate outlines twelve measures that were once envisaged by former Minister for Immigration Chris Bowen.
Minister for Immigration Brendan O'Connor, who stayed yesterday for talks on human trafficking in Sri Lanka, has implemented five of the recommended changes and the others are still being considered.
If the 'criterion of authenticity' is taken over, a person applying for a visa could be checked to see whether 'the application is genuine in cases where the applicant is related to the holder or a relevant person of the supporting undertaking.'
Companies could also be obliged to account for the number of 457 visa holders, after hundreds of companies in the past, who initially wanted to support only a small number of workers, eventually ceased.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylumist probably died of a heart attack after arriving on the Christmas Island on a refugee boat this week.
The disturbed nine-year-old son of the man who came with him to Australia has been cared for by an adult cousin who was also on the boat since his father died on Wednesday.
Australian authorities took the man to the Christmas Island Hospital where he died.
The British government announced a study aimed at increasing the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland.
In the work of HS2 Ltd, it is proposed that high-speed connections between Scotland and the north of England be established as early as phase 1 in 2026.
Minister of Transport Baroness Kramer said that the project "will bring Britain closer together".
Scottish transport minister Keith Brown said he was very pleased to work with the British government on this plan.
Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed rail connection between London and the West Midlands.
After completion of phase 2, there will be connections to Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government corrected the estimated cost of building the high-speed road between London and northern England from £32.7 billion to £42.6 billion.
The UK Government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, has commissioned HS2 Ltd to seek further route capacity and travel time improvements for Northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of a trip time of ultimately three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
Baroness Kramer said: "Our target for HS2 is a truly national network that brings Britain and its cities closer together."
We are moving ahead with HS2 because it brings enormous benefits.
Without it, we are facing a capacity crisis in our rail network.
But it is also about the connection between 18 British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which is improved thanks to HS2.
Scottish State Secretary Alistair Carmichael commented: "Today's announcement is a good news for Scotland."
On behalf of the Scottish Government, Keith Brown Carmichael called for "unmistakable" support for the Scottish integration into the HS2 network.
Brown said: "The high-speed rail link represents the potential of enormous economic advantages for Scotland, but also the economic power of Scotland provides an argument for fast rail connections throughout the UK."
That is why we are pleased to work as partners of the British Government and to examine the options for a high-speed rail link in Scotland, which creates benefits for all and complements the Glasgow-Edinburgh link, which the Scottish Government is already planning.
I am looking forward to examining the study report with the British ministers next year and taking the next steps together.
Regulations on electronic equipment in aircraft remain in force in Australia for the time being
Australian air passengers must continue to switch off tablets and smartphones at take-off and landing, despite efforts in the US to loosen the rules for such devices.
The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) allows US airlines to change their specifications so that passengers can read, view or play e-books on their devices during critical flight phases, provided they are in "flight mode".
During most of the flight, passengers are already allowed to do so, but many people find it annoying that they are not allowed to read their e-books when they take off and land.
However, Australian companies do not follow the decision on which the US airlines have to carry out a lot of work, but do not follow any direct plans to amend their regulations.
The CASA Air Traffic Management Authority also stated that the announcement would be considered, but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic equipment in critical flight phases continue to apply in Australia.
"CASA does not currently have specific rules on the use of electronic equipment in aircraft", has been explained.
The subject is subject to provisions requiring airlines to maintain safety at all times and passengers to comply with the safety instructions given by cabin crew.
Virgin has already conducted talks with CASA about extending its Wi-Fi entertainment system to flights and explains that it is open to changes, but these should be initiated by the legislator.
"We would welcome a review of the authorisation of electronic devices by CASA, because we are convinced that this would improve the customer experience after we now offer (wireless entertainment) during the flight," said one speaker.
Qantas explained that the current regulations will remain with us until further notice.
"Our current guidelines provide that electronic devices should not be used during take-off and landing, and we currently have no plans to change that," said the company.
The FAA rules apply to US airlines.
However, we are always interested in developments in regulations from which passengers can benefit, and will certainly take a close look at the FAA decision and the reasons behind it.
The decision has a different impact on US companies depending on the age of the fleet.
They must demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate the radio interference caused by mobile devices, and modify manuals, training materials, hand luggage programs and customer instruction.
"After confirming the tolerance of its fleet, an airline can allow passengers to use portable, lighter electronic devices such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones at all levels," the FAA announced.
In rare cases with poor visibility, the crew will instruct passengers to turn off the equipment while landing.
The group also recommended that heavier devices be safely stowed under the seat or in the compartments above the seats when starting and landing.
In front of the Revierderby against Schalke, BVB riders with light rockets had provided ugly scenes in the Veltins arena.
Borussia Dortmund then announced serious consequences.
Before the Friday game of the football league against the VfB Stuttgart, the ultras reacted with a silence - first.
It was an unusual, almost spooky acoustic, which was offered to the viewer until shortly before the start of the Bundesliga game between the German vice-master Borussia Dortmund and the VfB Stuttgart in the signal Iduna Park.
Most of the guest fans with their songs were to be heard.
The Southern Tribune, on the other hand, where the most faithful - and loud - BVB fans stand, initially presented themselves exceptionally silently: no songs, no battle calls.
The podium of the Capo, which otherwise coordinates the common impetus, remained unoccupied.
And at the front of the stage, a big flag with the inscription "Steading Ban Section" blew.
Only as a goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller as always entered the place as the first BVB player, sparked short-term jubilee.
When his teammates followed, there was loud singing and wailing scarves - but not everywhere.
In the central blocks 12 and 13 of the South Tribune nothing went wrong.
Also that stadium speaker Norbert Dickel once again listed the positive experiences of the last days - Derby victory, victory over Arsenal, contract extension by coach Jürgen Klopp - did not cause celebration.
Only five minutes before the tap, the capo climbed its podium - and the tensions that could be handled by hands then unraveled in a loud scream, when Dickel, as usual, questioned the mood on the ranks in the stadium.
As the last was as always the South Tribune on the row - and finally here was again as usual the loudest place in the stadium.
And at the latest when the loud call "Derby victor stands up" came from the South Tribune with an apparition, it was all as always again.
The silence before was probably a reaction to the events of the past days.
Immediately in front of Revierderby at FC Schalke 04, some of the BVB's riders had light rockets fired into the audience and into the square - and almost hit Gatekeeper Roman Weidenfeller.
The game was played late because of the chaotic scenes.
BVB-Boss Hans-Joachim Watzke had then received the tops of Dortmund Ultras in his office - and it is believed that Watzke's words were a rather untiring appointment for fans.
"There will be massive cuts for the entire ultramovement," announced the BVB boss at a panel discussion in Frankfurt on Thursday evening.
As an immediate measure, Watzke prohibited the ultras from choreography for the home game against the VfB Stuttgart.
"I've forbidden that," he explained.
We cannot give up the zero-tolerance policy on pyrotechnics.
In addition, the ultras were shown various ways of punishment - until Tuesday they now have time to decide for one.
Otherwise, says Watzke, the BVB will impose a penalty by the end of next week.
"It's going to be cutting in," Watzke assured.
You can be excited about how the reactions on the southern stage will turn out.
Pfandhäuser boom in Singapore, as the crisis in the middle class has arrived
Janani Amirthelana exchanges a golden bracelet, a ring, and a pair of earrings at the Bendemeer shopping centre in Singapore to pay the school fees of her daughters.
"My husband and I just bought a house, and there's all my money in it," says Amirthelana.
Although she earns 3,000 Singapore dollars each month (about 1,730 euros) as an administrator and also works for her husband, she explains that the monthly family income is not sufficient.
Indeed, the demand in parts of South-East Asia – where the debt of households is increasing – is so high that ValueMax, where it has exchanged, became the third house listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
The promise of jewellery is not only a quick way to get money – 1,300 Singapore dollars in the case of Janani Amirthelinga – but also almost as cheap as an unsecured bank loan.
Typically, mortgages in Singapore require an effective annual interest rate of 17 percent, which is just above the 15.4 percent required by the United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same shopping centre.
However, mortgages offer the advantage that there is no need for a review of creditworthiness or income proof, which is why loans are faster than banks.
For this reason, millions of people in the region are turning to mortgages after families feel pressure from rising cost of living and increasing household and consumer debt.
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap loans due to a relaxed financial policy in the developed economies, families with lower and medium incomes are looking for houses to compensate for the difference in stuttering economy.
This week, the rating agency Standard & Poor's growing household debt, mainly through increasing mortgages, identified as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have, in the Agency's opinion, the highest household debt in Asia in relation to gross domestic product.
Malaysia is at the top of the list with 80 percent of GDP, an increase of 60 percent in 2008.
Economicists are also concerned about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which this week has come out of a technical recession.
On Thursday, the data showed a continuing export weakness and a decrease in consumer demand.
"In the end, this means that in the face of rising costs, people in the middle to lower segment (the income scale) will try to supplement their income wherever possible," says Song Seng Wun, economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historical peaks in gold prices over the past two years have reinforced the trend towards the pledge of personal property, as people take advantage of the opportunity to turn the family's jewelry into cash.
In Singapore, about 70 percent of the pledged items are in the 200 warehouses of the city state of Gold.
People say: "The gold price looks good, let's make a pledge of Grandmother's gold chain and get back next month."
The largest Thai warehouse operator, EasyMoney, has experienced 20 percent customer growth in its branches in recent months.
The growth in the mortgage business is so strong that ValueMax, operator of the Bendemeer branch and 15 others in Singapore, wants to expand not only into neighboring Malaysia – where the company operates four houses – but also outside Asia, says Yeah Lee Ching, Managing Director of ValueMax.
The company finances this with 60 percent of the 66 million Singapore dollars that it took this week with the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some lenders had fallen into the crossfire because of high interest rates, Yeah explains that mortgages not only offered lower interest rates than other lenders, but also did not directly increase debt.
"Customers borrow items they already own and the liquidation of personal valuables does not increase household training," she explains.
The mortgage business is increasingly accepted as short-term, secured financing.
Nor are not all people using mortgages in financial difficulties.
Rich people from Singapore also come to the ValueMax branches to pledge gold bars and Rolex watches, for which they receive up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash.
Customers come to us from every social layer.
"These include wealthy people who borrow something for a business or investment in the short term, or small companies who need to bridge bottlenecks in cash flow," says Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
NSA absorbs data from Google and Yahoo - Snowden wants to help
The secret service explorer Edward Snowden has a fundamental interest in helping Germany to clarify the increasingly fragile NSA spying business.
After presenting the Green Federal Assembly member Hans-Christian Ströbele, his surprising meeting with Snowden in Russia was about the conditions under which ex-secretary staff would testify to a German prosecutor's office or a committee of inquiry.
Snowden pointed to his complicated legal situation, said Ströbele to the ARD magazine "Panorama".
Rescue package over 325 million Australian dollars for Tasmanian health care
The Australian government is under the harsh conditions associated with the bailout package of over 325 million Australian dollars for Tasmanian health to ensure that the government of the state cannot waste the money.
Federal Minister for Health Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth will take 'immature measures' to avert a crisis caused by an ageing population of the island state, a higher rate of chronic diseases and system restrictions.
The funding for a period of four years was decided after government consultations with independent Tasmanian MEP Andrew Wilkie.
"The government has prepared an emergency rescue package that we believe addresses the unique challenges facing the state," said Plibersek today.
The 325-million-dollar package includes 31 million dollars of emergency aid for election services.
A further 2600 operations, including orthopaedic surgery and treatment for gray star, are intended to eliminate residues.
In addition, there is money for day clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better after-care after hospital stays, specialist training, mental health services and the introduction of a system for the electronic recording of health data in local hospitals.
"These investments are in line with the ideas that hospital staff affected me have said they are the best way to improve the Tasmanian health system," said Tanya Plibersek.
The Minister insisted on strict reporting and accountability by the Tasmanian government.
The state had to maintain the current level of funding in order to obtain money from the Commonwealth and report monthly on where the additional funds were spent.
A three-member Commission will be set up to ensure that the state provides health services as effectively and efficiently as possible.
As Wilkie said today, the 325 million dollars would be of little use if "they are not accompanied by real reforms that bring the public Tasmanian health system on a more sustainable path."
Despite this, he praised the government for responding to his request for urgent help, which he first expressed to the Prime Minister in early May.
"I am confident that the federal aid will make a major contribution to removing the public health system of the state from the list of concerns," said Wilkie.
According to the government of the state, these elections will largely compensate for the recent cuts.
But the health spokesperson of the opposition at the federal level, Peter Dutton, believes that today's announcement is only a 'patch solution'.
"We are therefore in a position today because the laboratory government has deducted 430 million dollars from the health system," he said to ABC TV.
It can't be that a state government pulls almost half a billion dollars out of the system and puts the Commonwealth 300 million in and then pretends to be the good news.
Dutton asked Plibersek to guarantee that not a single dollar of the rescue package will be spent on additional bureaucracy.
Guillaume Nicloux' adaptation of the novel by Denis Diderot convinces with exceptional production equipment and contemporary details, but is also heavier than necessary.
The action in France of the 1760s tells the gripping story of Suzanne, a young nobleman sent by her family to the monastery.
When she rebels, she is confronted with the extreme cruelty of an extremely sadistic superior and becomes the object of erotic fascination of another.
The film never slips into lust or lust for sensation – and this is his problem.
The solemn seriousness with which the film is told also makes it a painful penitence shirt for the audience.
Syria has destroyed its ability to manufacture chemical weapons, according to a monitoring group
Syria has destroyed important chemical weapons and gas munitions production facilities, declared the Global Chemical Weapons Monitoring Group on Thursday, while heavy collisions occurred in the north of the country near one of the sites where toxic substances are believed to be stored.
Also on Thursday, a Syrian group of activists announced that more than 120,000 people had already been killed three years ago since the beginning of the Civil War.
The announcement of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) came one day before the date on
1 November, set up in The Hague by the Damascus organization to destroy or "make inoperable" all chemical weapons manufacturing facilities, including all machinery for mixing chemicals into toxic gases and for filling ammunition.
The conclusion of this process, which is essentially the first stage of destruction, is an important milestone in an ambitious timetable aimed at the destruction of all Syria's chemical weapons by mid-2014.
The destruction of the facilities means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus still needs to start destroying existing weapons and supplies.
According to assumptions, there are about 1,000 tons of chemicals and weapons in the country, including mustard gas and the nerve gas sarin.
The announcement came at a time when on Thursday fighting took place in the city of Sapphira, from the experts say that there is a production facility for chemical weapons and deposits as reported by the United Kingdom Syrian Human Rights Observatory.
On Thursday, 120,296 people died, the group of activists following the death of a network of activists in Syria.
Of these, 61,067 are civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the side of the government 29,954 of them belonged to the army of President Bashar Assad that 18,678 were government-friendly fighters and 187 Lebanese Hezbollah militias.
Also among the dead are 2,202 deserted army soldiers and 5,375 fighters of the opposition, many of them foreigners.
On July 25, the UN estimated the number of deaths in this conflict to be 100,000 since March 2011.
This number has not been updated yet.
The conflict forced about two million people to flee the country.
Assad's troops have been fighting in Sapphira for weeks against the rebels, many of whom have connections to al-Qaida groups.
The observatory said that there had been losses on both sides on Thursday, but did not mention any details.
The fighting underscores the danger that chemical weapons inspectors are exposed to, because their mission to free Syria from its poisonous arsenal is a race against the time of a raging civil war.
According to the OPCW, which works closely with the United Nations, the team "is now convinced that it has seen and witnessed the destruction of all the major production and mixing/filling facilities mentioned by Syria."
Therefore, "no further inspection activities are currently planned."
At the beginning of the week, the inspectors had declared that they had completed the first round of inspections and visited 21 of the 23 sites indicated by Damascus.
Because of safety concerns, the inspectors said that the visit of two institutions was not possible.
On Thursday, the OPWC stated that the two sites had been “refused ... and the objects of the chemical weapons program that existed there had been transferred to other mentioned facilities that had been inspected.”
It was not immediately clear whether the site in Safira was one of the two facilities that the OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has presented a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons to be approved by the OPWC Executive Committee next month.
"I take a look at the bravery and courage you have all shown in fulfilling the most challenging mission ever carried out by this organization," said Ahmed Uzumcu, the Director-General of the Monitoring Organisation, in a comment published by OPCW.
For three years now, the main Sunni Muslim rebels in this civil war have been fighting against Assad's government and its security forces, which belong to many members of the Alavites, a division of Shiite Islam.
In view of further developments, the head of the observation group, Rami Abdurrahman, said that on Wednesday there was a strong explosion in an air defense facility in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion was unknown, he explained.
Anger of judgment against bombers from Bali
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people killed in 2002 in the bombing in Bali reacted in anger at the verdict of the last one of the instigators who was brought to trial, as Umar Patek was to be killed in a stand-by manner.
Patek, who was on the run for nearly ten years as one of the most wanted people in Southeast Asia, was sentenced to 20 years in prison for his role in building bombers.
He could be released after 15 years of imprisonment.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of the mass murder because of the attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, where 202 people died, including 88 Australians, and many more were injured.
In a series of terrorist-related charges, including a wave of bombings on churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000, there was also an indictment.
The prosecution had called for a life sentence, even if it was for the man who, because of his reputation as a master bomber, was also called a 'Demolition Man', who could have applied for the death penalty.
The decision has aroused painful memories at June Corteen, a mother from Perth who lost her 39-year-old twin daughter Jane and Jenny in the destruction executed by Patek and his co-conspirators nearly ten years ago.
With tears she said Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really mean, he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys.
"You should put him in front of a firing squad," Corteen told AAP.
I have to live every day with the fact that I won't have any more grandchildren and I'll never see my daughters again.
The Sari Club was leveled to the ground, when on October 12, 2002, a huge bomb exploded in a small truck parked in front of the nightclub shortly after 23:00.
Peter Hughes was in Paddy's bar, where only 20 seconds earlier a suicide bomber had a bomb-filled backpack exploded.
He fell to the coma and "dead" three times after the attack, while he was on a life support system.
Hughes said that Patek deserved the same fate as the three other members of the Terrorist cell Jemaah Islamiah – Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra – who were responsible for the massacre and were executed four years ago.
Really, this guy should get the death penalty in front of everyone else.
Letting him live – no, there is no reason to let him live.
To get 20 years after he killed 202 people and injured many hundreds is not much.
Patek is the last of the Bali bombers to face trial.
In January 2011, he was arrested in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where U.S. forces killed the former al-Qaida chief Osama bin Laden just four months later.
During the trial, an FBI agent said that intelligence reports had provided evidence that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden with the aim of rebuilding the link between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda.
"He didn't stand up," said Corteen.
Until recently, he has shown no remorse for how much suffering he has caused to other people.
The verdict was made before the 10th anniversary of the attack this year, which is celebrated with commemoratives in Bali and Australia.
"There will be many tears this year," said Corteen.
Patek can still appeal against his judgment.
FAA: Passengers can now use electronic devices in aircraft (but do not have mobile calls)
Passengers can now listen to their electronic devices for reading, working, playing, music and viewing movies from departure to landing, but not with their mobile phones, according to the new guidelines issued on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the United States.
However, passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately.
As soon as they were implemented, depending on the respective airline, FAA employee Michael Huerta explained at a press conference.
Air carriers must demonstrate to the FAA that aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they have updated the flight crew training manuals and equipment stowage regulations in accordance with the new rules.
The FAA stated that it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic equipment in aircraft.
Among these airlines were Delta and JetBlue.
"Depending on the state of the plan, we could approve the extended use of electronic devices very soon," the FAA announced in a statement.
Passengers currently need to switch off smartphones, tablets and other devices when the aircraft doors are closed.
They may not start them again until the plane has reached an altitude of three kilometres and the captain gives green light.
When entering the landing flight, passengers must turn them off again and not be allowed to start them again until the plane has landed.
According to the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are secured against electronic interference could allow their passengers to use the equipment also in the take-off, landing and rolling field, said the FAA.
Most new transport aircraft and other aircraft converted to higher altitudes for the use of Wi-Fi should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the professional airline association, welcomed the changes.
"If the new regulation is implemented safely – and we work closely with the airline in this respect – both sides will benefit from it," said Glading.
To be honest, we are sorry to have to feel like guardians on this issue.
However, Internet connections for surfing, exchanging e-mails, text messages or downloading data under three kilometres were still prohibited, the Authority explained.
Passengers are asked to put smartphones, tablets and other devices in flight mode.
So still no “Words With Friends”, the Scrabble-like online game played by the actor Alec Baldwin in 2011 on his smartphone when he had to leave an American Airlines jet in public because he refused to switch off the device while the plane was parked on the flight platform.
And heavier devices like laptops still need to be stowed, as there is a risk of injury here if they fly through the cabin.
Mobile phone calls during the flight will also continue to be prohibited.
The regulatory competence for telephone calls lies with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), not the FAA.
FAA may prohibit certain electronic devices from taking off and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker said from the National Transport Safety Board, security expert on national traffic issues on CBS News, mobile phones would still be considered a risk.
"Handy is really a problem, not only because it could cause potential interference with navigational devices, but because we know from the FCC that transmission from the air can also interfere with transmitters," says Rosenker.
A industry advisory committee set up by the FAA to investigate this issue recommended last month that the government allow a wider use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, pressure on the FAA has increased to ease restrictions on use.
Critics such as Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill from Missouri believe that there are no valid security grounds for the ban.
The restrictions are also increasingly difficult to enforce because the use of the devices has become ubiquitous.
In some studies, this is what up to a third of the passengers forgets or ignores to switch off the device.
The FAA began in 1966 to restrict the use of electronic equipment by air travellers after reports of interference with navigation and communication equipment had become known by passenger-carried VHF radios, which were the latest technological trend at that time.
New aircraft are far more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA that they do not constitute electronic interference.
Airlines have been offering passengers Wi-Fi for several years when the altitude has been reached.
The flyers adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also more insensitive to interferences.
The vast majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for the greater use of electronic equipment under the new directives, said Huerta.
Today's electronic devices generally emit much less radio radiation than previous generations.
E-reader, for example, only emit minimal radiation when you flip over.
But when downloading or sending data, the transmission values are stronger.
Amazon.com is one of the champions of the relaxation of restrictions on the use of devices by passengers.
In 2011, company employees invited a passenger plane full of Kindle E-Reader and made a test flight to identify problems but could not find out.
Members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings about the risk of using devices.
Douglas Kidd of the Passenger Association National Association of Airline Passengers said that he felt that the interference with the devices was real, even if the risk was minimal.
Other committee members said that there were only isolated reports from pilots who spoke through the devices to disrupt aircraft systems, and most of them were very old.
However, the FAA recommended that pilots be allowed to arrange for the decommissioning of the devices by passengers in the event of an instrument landing under poor visual conditions.
A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes and described them as reasonable adaptations for travellers who today would be extensively equipped with technology.
"We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience does not conflict with safety," said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.
Released by Air Rescue Service of North Sea Drill Island Rescued Bird
A bird flown to the coast by air rescue service, which had been found exhausted on a North Sea drilling island, was released into the wild again.
The water raider was flown last month with a helicopter to Aberdeen, where it was spotted by the Scottish animal welfare organization SPCA at their rescue center in Alloa.
Colin Seddon, head of the centre, said: "This watercourse was probably a winter migratory bird from northern Europe, which was held by the strong winds above the North Sea."
Apparently, the exhausted bird sought refuge on the drill island.
He added: 'He could no longer fly, so we were contacted with the request for help.'
When she was released, the water ralle was again fit and healthy.
Is Europe's elite ready to do business with Britain?
Business for Britain was launched in April with the intention of bringing the economy to a table and defining what those in Britain want to change our relations with the EU.
To this end, we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey among British business leaders and asked them what they thought about Britain, the economy and the EU.
YouGov surveyed more than 1,000 business leaders representing approximately the UK business sizes, sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will surprise many.
We have found that the vast majority of companies are now exporting outside Europe and focusing on countries that are modernising and growing while the EU states are stagnating.
They wish that new trade relations with countries such as China, India and Brazil will be favoured by the government rather than with the long and strenuous process of reforming the obscure EU institutions.
The majority of business leaders believe that control over these key competences should be taken back to Westminster, according to their opinion on certain regulated issues – from antitrust law to product legislation.
There was general dissatisfaction with the internal market, as according to the companies, the costs of Brussels rules would outweigh the benefits of being part of Europe's trade zone – even 40 percent of large companies agreed with what is traditionally the most Europe-friendly.
Finally, and this is probably the most said, our survey of business leaders showed that a clear majority of Britain wants a direction towards change in the agreement and a relationship with the EU based on trade, not on politics.
This insight, which is found in companies of all sizes and leading groups, shows that the economy is pressing for a "senseful change" that brings the book of action back to Britain.
It is a matter of much – a change to the agreement and better conditions for the UK would lead to a change of opinion in favour of staying in the EU in a referendum at 16%.
The Prime Minister should have no doubt: this survey shows that the British economy is behind his plan for the renegotiation of the British conditions for EU membership.
It also shows that companies expect a clear shift in power relations back to the UK from a renegotiation.
A better deal for the British economy is possible and increasingly necessary as the eurozone now moves towards a closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be jobs and growth in the UK, as the result of our survey shows what a stronger focus for companies on trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels approach to regulation means.
Alexei Miller von Gazprom describes pipeline in Bulgaria as the beginning of a new gas era
The start of the construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria represented the start of one of the largest European energy projects, said the Gazprom Executive Board.
"Today's event is a milestone: the construction work on the Bulgarian section of the South Stream Gapipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, has begun," said Alexei Miller, Chairman of the Board of Gazprom, in a statement on Thursday.
The project is a key element for the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream aims to increase diversity in Russia's export routes across Europe.
A dispute between Gazprom and his counterparts in Ukraine, in which most of the Russian gas is stored for Europe, creates an increased risk in conventional routes, as can be heard officially.
Miller said that the direct link to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries have been eliminated forever.
Bulgarian consumers receive gas from South Stream at preferential rates when the entire project is in operation in 2015.
According to Gazprom, construction works in other subordinate countries are to begin on the planned route at the end of the year.
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic metres of natural gas.
For national and international investors, there is no way past the real estate location of Germany.
The economic framework data are correct and the financing possibilities are excellent.
This has been the tenor of the 9th Real Estate Day of the Stock Exchange newspaper.
The German real estate markets benefit from the economic strength and good economic conditions in the country in Europe.
Christian Ulbrich, CEO of Europe, Middle East and Africa of Jones Lang LaSalle, pointed to this on the 9th Real Estate Day of the Stock Exchange newspaper.
According to Ulbrich, how sought were German commercial properties to show the view of the volume of transactions.
In the first three quarters of this year, it increased by 31% compared to the previous year's period.
In the UK, the increase was only 6%, in France 19%.
"Immobilieninvestments offer attractive interest rates," said Ulbrich.
The yield gap between real estate and federal bonds is historically high.

Hearing before the Royal Commission: Two YMCA staff accused of charges against Jonathan Lord for sexual crimes
Two YMCA staff from New South Wales (NSW) had been charged with sexual crimes related to children before accusations were filed against the child nurse Jonathan Lord from Caringbah in 2011, as the Royal Commission on Sexual Abuse of Children.
However, in the opening statement before the Commission, the YMCA stated that "in the organization, there had never been an incident of sexual abuse of children".
Director Phillip Hare was questioned about a case in which a YMCA employee had been accused of child pornography offences, and another in which a sports teacher at YMCA Caringbah Hall was sentenced to abuse by trusted children in 1991.
Hare said that Gail Furness, one of the Commission's assistant lawyers, had known about the first case but had not known the second.
He acknowledged that the YMCA's opening statement to the Commission was also inaccurate in the assertion that "there had been external verifications of the YMCA, in which the YMCA was recognised as the leading front in the field of child safety".
On the contrary, evidence before the Commission shows that the YMCA was informed that it received the second lowest possible assessment of four in a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communities in August of the year.
Hare, who started at YMCA at 21, admitted that the management had failed "from me to down" at Lord's appointment and did not ensure that employees were aware of their obligations to report violations of the child safety guidelines.
At the beginning of the year, Lord had been convicted of sexual offense against twelve boys during his two-year work for the YMCA.
He was sentenced to at least six years in prison.
Hare argues, however, that the YMCA has a cultural problem that has prevented employees from reporting Lord's violations regarding the safety of children.
The employees said that they had observed violations, including that Lord was alone with children, that she was privately cared for as a babysitter, had her sit on his lap, said to one that he loved it, and had children play with his cell phone.
Danielle Ockwell, whose boss was Lord and who had asked for a child protection training because she was concerned about his behavior, said that the child service director Jacqui Barnat, who was the Chief Lords in the YMCA Caringbah, was "very intimidating and most of the time very impeccable".
The Managing Director stated that he would not accept statements from employees that they would not have dared to report to their superior.
Instead, he said, their friendship with the Lord affected their judgment, so they did not report it.
Hare stated that he had communicated his view to the board of directors of YMCA NSW that the lesson the organization had to draw from the "Jonathan-Lord case" was "not to report" by employees, and the board agreed with him.
Hare said that the decision to force the employees to sign confidentiality obligations shortly after the allegations occurred had been made by the director of the children's services of YMCA, Liam Whitley.
He said that this would prevent contamination of the evidence, but this would have been 'excessive' and badly implemented.
The YMCA NSW was not a safe organization for children when Jonathan Lord worked there between 2009 and 2011, said Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University, expert on sexual child abuse, told the Commission.
He explained that there had been "serious problems" in the recruitment, review, integration, training and supervision of employees.
The hearing was postponed until 20 December.
Tony Blair explained that he would take the opportunity to return as British Prime Minister – but admits that a comeback is unlikely.
In an interview tonight on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his resignation from office, the 59-year-old announced his views on various issues of domestic policy.
Since his resignation in June 2007 after a decade as Head of State, Blair has largely avoided commenting on British politics, and his comments are mostly limited to foreign policy and his role as an envoy of the Middle East Peacemakers' Quartet.
On the question of whether he would like to return to the Prime Minister's office, Blair was quoted by the Evening Standard from London as saying: 'Yes, sure, but it is unlikely that this will happen, so ...'
When the horse show experts found themselves in crowds in Cardiff to drive the horse of the year, they were aware that a fierce competition was imminent.
But no one was prepared for the three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
The Knirps, who is not even in kindergarten yet and only a few months ago took his first steps, and his Shetland-Pony Toffee trot loosely through the three rounds and won the first prize – leaving behind 30 adult opponents.
The inseparable couple, both equal in size, were praised for their appearance, behaviour and style at the annual competition organized by the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff.
At his appearance in competition against men and women with elegant melons, he had put his plate cap in a cheeky angle and led the two-year-old toffee through the ring.
Fenton was praised by the jurors for his natural abilities in dealing with the pony that were far beyond his age.
And Toffee got the best notes for his appearance and personality.
Fenton had received Toffee last March as a gift for his third birthday and since then practiced with the Shetland Pony every day.
His mother, Donna, 30, said: "Fenton and Toffee are a great thrill."
They had to fight the entire field and went out of the square with gold trophy and rosette.
It was only the second time he had competed with Toffee, and we were all thrilled when he won.
Perfect strangers in the arena thought he was so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
The little boy from Nantyglo village near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howell, who has been performing horses for over ten years.
Howells said: "The whole audience was like electrified and everyone fired and clattered him."
He ran on sand the entire length of the arena and although he looked so tiny, he did fantastic work.
Fenton is crazy about animals – he loves horses, tractors and farms and has two chickens he cares for.
Just as he started, it won't take long for him to be on the horse of the year – and I'm sure he'll cut well.
One speaker of the annual horse show said: "Fenton is only three, but he knows how to deal with his pony."
Together they're a great team.
The jurors evaluated Fenton and Toffee after how well they had beaten themselves and presented themselves in the lead ring.
They pay attention to good cooperation between Pony and leaders – and there Fenton and Toffee were the best in the ring.
I'm sure Fenton's sweet clothes contributed their part, that really fit perfectly for the occasion.
Chinese newspaper is to be reformed after the call
A Chinese newspaper, which had requested the release of a reporter accused of defamation on the front page, said a press regulator was to be reformed.
The New Express, based in Guangzhou, had a rare public call for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
However, Chen later admitted on television that he had taken bribery money to falsify reports about a state-owned company.
The new term is now subject to "comprehensive rectification", the regulatory authority said.
The "Recognition Order" was issued by the Agency for Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television in Guangdong.
Preliminary investigations revealed that the New Express, which belongs to the Yangcheng Evening News Group, had published several inaccurate reports on the listed company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
"The editorial management of the New Express was disorderly," the regulatory authority announced in a statement.
She said that it had been decided to impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou and to withdraw his reporter's license.
In addition, "Yangcheng Evening News Group had been instructed to undertake a complete re-rectification of the New Express and recommended that the relevant responsible parties be identified at the New Express and immediately checked the management team of the New Express."
Chen had written several articles for the New Express in which he reported alleged financial irregularities in a manufacturer of construction machines called Zoomlion.
After he was arrested, the newspaper published two calls for his release on the front page and stood behind his journalistic work.
But then Chen appeared on state television and admitted that he had published false reports against payment.
"In this case, I have damaged Zoomlion as well as the entire news industry and their ability to gain public confidence," he said to CCTV.
I did it primarily because I was looking for money and fame.
I realized I was wrong.
Following Chen's apology, the New Express published an apology on the cover page and explained that it had failed to check the reports correctly.
Various known suspects have recently made confessions on television.
Experts say that confessions are still routinely forced, despite a change in the law at the beginning of the year in which the authorities were forbidden to force someone to accuse themselves.
Drug tunnel with its own railway between the USA and Mexico discovered
One of the most sophisticated tunnels for drug trafficking between the USA and Mexico, which was fully equipped with lighting, ventilation and electric railway operation, has now been discovered.
The U.S. authorities described the 120-by-90-cm measuring tunnel as one of the most sophisticated passages they have ever found.
The tunnel, which runs in the zigzag pattern over a length of almost six football fields, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
In the area there are countless inconspicuous warehouses, making it easier to hide loaded trucks with drugs.
The tunnel had been closed before drugs could be transported undetected, the authorities explained.
The discovery of the tunnel ensured eight and a half tons of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine, according to the court's records.
Three men who, according to the authorities, worked as drivers were charged with the possession and intended sale of marijuana and cocaine.
In a conviction, they threaten prison sentences between ten years and lifelong.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers rely on an extensive underground network of drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth major passage discovered since 2006 in San Diego.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered after the marijuana harvest in Central Mexico in October, which presents the challenge to the drug cartels of how they can quickly bring their product to consumers.
In 2010, authorities found a nearly 640-metre-long passage with rails that went from a kitchen in a residential building in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr still love themselves
Actor Orlando Bloom and Model Miranda Kerr want to go separate ways in the future.
In an interview, however, Bloom said that he and Kerr still love each other.
Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom are the parents of the two-year-old Flynn.
Actress Orlando Bloom has spoken to separate himself from his wife, top model Miranda Kerr.
In an interview with US journalist Katie Couric, who was supposed to be broadcast on Friday (local time), Bloom said, "Life sometimes doesn't go exactly as we plan or hope.
Kerr and he still loved himself, emphasized the 36-year-old.
"We will support each other and love each other as Flynn's parents."
Kerr and Bloom have been married since 2010, and in 2011 their son Flynn was born.
According to Lexika, veganism is subject to vegetarianism, but it differs considerably from that.
For while vegetarians allow themselves to eat cream cakes, ice cream or a powerful edam, these jellies are not on the menu of a vegan.
Milk, cheese, egg, in addition to the absence of meat and fish, the vegan leaves all the consumption of animal products - honey is also denied.
What remains, one might wonder, but the vegan food world is characterized by considerable ingenuity.
"Bread spreads are very popular," explains Ute Henkelmann, the owner of the local reform house, who has a variety of special products available for vegans.
Reuben Proctor is also happy to visit the store in Domgasse.
For 13 years, the native New Zealander vegan lives, in Lampertheim he (almost) finds everything he needs to live. "I changed my diet in 1997 and became a vegetarian."
At the turn of the century the next step took place and I became vegan.
"The conviction came not only because of the diet, but because of the choice of shoes," says Proctor, who prefers artificial leather to normal leather.
He realized that it is also possible in other everyday matters without animal products.
First of all, vegan is an ethics.
"I don't want animals to die for me," says Proctor, the vegan maxim, which extends to the entire consumption behaviour.
Instead of grieving for burgers, stirrers or rubber bears, the Veganer quickly discovered new products that increased enthusiasm.
"It's a double bonus," says Proctor today, "in fact, vegan does not act as an excuse, not an ascetic, but as an enrichment." The assumption that with the conversion of food, the selection of food options is reduced, Proctor is more likely to revert to the power of habit.
And these very conditions also failed some well-meaning attempts.
"The addiction factor is a crucial factor that allows many to give up quickly, similar to smoking," Proctor makes a comparison.
And turn on: "Some tastes are not to be attached to the animal."
Often it is the spices or the type of preparation that make up the taste.
"You can also create the same effect in other ways," explains the Veganer.
For example, Proctor brings eggplants, mushrooms and a few vegan sausages to a barbecue.
He pays attention to a balanced, varied diet, in which it is intended to taste thoroughly once and for all.
Of course you want to have something between your teeth, that's legitimate.
"It's supposed to taste, but it's not just about reducing animal food," says Proctor.
Health damage up to eating disorders, another widespread assumption, he had not suffered.
For me, the change had a positive aspect.
I don't take any foreign cholesterol and I have an increased vitamin content.
There are high-performance athletes who only feed on vegan.
"My blood counts are good, I often get checked," Proctor tells me.
In particular, many vegansimus critics warn about the lack of vitamin B12.
"Since animals are fed with feed instead of grazing on the pasture, it is questionable whether the vitamin B12 content is high in the meat you buy in the refrigerator," says Proctor.
For vegans there is also the possibility to take the coenzyme in the form of tablets.
"My B12 values are fine," he explains.
Proctor should not go far away for food procurement.
Finally, there are basic foods everywhere and every supermarket now has soy milk and other products.
I'll find everything I need on the spot.
I only buy something special from time to time.
"Many people ignore the fact that only the finished products are expensive, but it is known to be true of "ordinary" finished products."
In any case, the preparation of vegan dishes would be much more favourable and less time consuming than generally accepted.
"There is a lot to discover in the kitchen, with a few small knives you can achieve good, if not partly better results," says Proctor.
Margarine instead of butter, a little more baking powder and carbonic acid instead of egg, with its vegan cheesecakes, Proctor was also able to amaze his parents-in-law.
Family celebrations give the Vegan a new spice.
This has momentum when you cook together, it has a new value.
"The situations that can arise are as different as the people themselves," says Proctor.
Of course, he was already skeptical.
Don't you like my food anymore?
"Should I feel bad now because I drink milk?" - in such questions, you have to act as a vegan with a sense of fingertips.
"I don't deny people, I'm part of this society," Proctor doesn't want to be enclaved.
And more precisely, the everyday world does not appear to be as vegan as suspected - and the vegan does not seem as restricted in everyday life as generally accepted.
Fast Food is also allowed.
There are fries everywhere!
"Many donner shops offer falafel, or a vegetarian yufka," says Proctor.
In a pizzeria he deviates from pasta dishes, or just ordered a pizza without cheese, all a matter of habit.
The restaurants are so slow about it.
"When I started feeding myself vegan 13 years ago, everything was even more difficult," the New Zealanders can find a development: "You have to talk to people, make them aware of it."
"If enough demand comes, they may be inclined to supplement the menu," he hopes.
Vegan restaurants develop, such as the kitchen in Mannheim or the Café Vogelfrei.
Proctor hopes that other restaurants at least have a vegan dish on the menu.
Basically, vegan dishes are there for everyone.
Everyone can eat them, so they are exactly the opposite of exclusive.
"Fresh dishes, on the other hand, are exclusive, in the truest sense of the word, because they exclude others," says Proctor.
"If you want to avoid food scandals, then veganism is a safe way to make the most important part impossible from the outset," says Proctor.
However, the purchase of vegan products could be a little difficult at first.
In particular, if one learns to understand that it can also contain animal additives in peanuts as a colouring agent, one seems to quickly leave the courage with the adherence to ethics at so many hurdles and traps.
Not only because of this, Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen have written a book: "Veganissimo - Animal ingredients and their alternatives" explains the many ingredients that are buried in food and also detergents.
"Sometimes you develop a scanner view and know what signs and logos you have to pay attention to "It is sometimes better to do small steps than to stop or trip," says Proctor.
Veganism, it is an important moral fingertip that strikes the consciousness.
He may not quite manage to abandon his habits, but at least he can teach consumers to question his habits critically.
The stock exchange operator Nasdaq OMX keeps its customers breathing.
Trade on the Nasdaq Options Market was interrupted on Friday afternoon of German time.
In a communication, the operator was responsible for technical problems.
The other eleven US option markets, including two of the Nasdaq OMX, continued their business unhindered.
The recent incident continues a whole series of smaller and larger breakdowns at the stock exchange operator.
Only on Tuesday, the Nasdaq indices had not been calculated for an hour due to errors in data transport.
In August of this year alone there had been two breakdowns in a week.
First, the US investment bank Goldman Sachs had sent a lot of faulty purchase orders to the option markets due to technical problems.
As a result, the stock exchange operators needed almost a whole day to look through and delete the orders.
Two days later, half of the entire stock trade in the United States came to rest on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange for several hours due to a computer breakdown.
In addition, last year Facebook's stock exchange went on.
The Nasdaq systems had not grown the flood of purchase and sales orders, later the stock exchange supervisor SEC noted and darkened the company to a record penalty of 10 million dollars.
Constance: cyclists drive 63-year-olds around
The accident had been reported by the police when a 26-year-old man on Thursday evening, about 22 o'clock, was driving a lady's bicycle irregularly on the left side of the walk from the train station to the market place.
When a 63-year-old man suddenly stepped on the walk from a local, the police said the cyclist could no longer slow down in time.
At the next collision, the pedestrian was pressed against the wall of the house, went to the ground in the further course and drew a space wound about 15 centimetres long on the head.
A rescue car team took the injured person to the clinic for medical treatment.
British police send Assange an extradition notice
The British police have today handed over an extradition notice to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who sought refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and applied for asylum.
Scotland Yard stated that the 40-year-old Australian had been given a "call to stand up" that asked him to appear in a police station, and added that he should not comply with it, threatening to arrest him.
Assange threatens to extradite to Sweden for the charge of sexual crime after its possibilities have been exhausted under British law since the Supreme Court rejected its objection to extradition at the beginning of the month.
Fearing that Stockholm would deliver him to the United States, he sought refuge at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on June 19 and asked the South American country for political asylum.
Scotland Yard had "a 40-year-old man asked himself to be present at a police station at a time we had chosen," said one speaker.
He continues to violate the terms of his bail release.
The message did not comment on the delivery of the police call.
Assange fears that he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States and charged there with possible espionage charges after publishing more than 250,000 diplomatic messages on the WikiLeaks disclosure website.
Driver who had dropped at 210 km/h and hot drink between his legs gets £1,000 penalty
A driver was imposed a penalty of £1,000 because he had driven up to 210 km/h and a hot drink between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptree, Essex, was stopped on May 27 with his Mercedes Benz on the A120 near Braintree.
After the police stopped him, they discovered the drinking cup between his legs.
Before Colchester's court, Howie confessed guilty without having driven the necessary care and attention.
He received seven points and a six-month driving ban.
Howie was also sentenced to pay a cost of £90 and a sacrifice supplement of £100.
Tax for foreign real estate owners against London’s speculation bubble
The Ministry of Finance has provisionally calculated the CGT measure, but is still awaiting the final decision of Chancellor George Osborne, who in 2012 imposed a stamp tax of 7% on dwellings costing over two million pounds and annual fees for buyers who hold apartments as a company and not as individuals.
Already now the revenue from the stamp tax on residential property in the districts of Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea, which in the fiscal year 2012/13 amounted to 708 million pounds, combined with revenues for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the North East, North West, Yorkshire and the region of Humber.
Cook said: "After the increases in stamp taxes on high-priced dwellings and the introduction of the associated legislation against handling, it is difficult to claim that high-quality properties are too lowly taxed, regardless of the effects of the outdated municipal tax system."
"However, this step could make some foreign investors more reluctant about buying properties in London, or stop owners from selling them," he added.
First-class properties – the top five to ten percent of the housing market by price – in the prosperous London South West Belt, which extends from Fulham to Wimbledon, have reached a record of 11.8% last year.
The prices in Central London showed a steady annual growth of 5.6%, but were overestimated by an emerging domestic market in which the south-west part of the city, the north (7.4%) and the east (6.5%) experienced an upward trend, according to a Savills study.
Scientists have been able to shed more light on the connection between the swinging of a dog's tail and its mood.
Previous research had shown that happy dogs with their tail moved more to the right (from the dog's point of view), while in nervous dogs it was the left side.
But now scientists say that other dogs can perceive these subtle differences and respond to them.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trent, said: "In humans it is well known that the left and right brain halves react differently to stimuli that cause positive or negative emotions."
Here we have tried to look at this in other species.
He also noted that in dogs, just like in humans, the right half of the brain is responsible for the movement of the left side and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played different roles in the emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to the side swinging of their fellow species, the researchers monitored the animals while these films looked at other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of the four legs and analyzed the behavior.
Probably we'll soon understand why the cock moves into the one, sometimes in the other direction.
Professor Vallortigara said: "We have shown the dogs movies with dogs – either a true version or a silhouette to eliminate distracting other aspects, and we have been able to control the movement of the tail more to the left or the right."
When the animals saw how an otherwise expressive dog moved the tail to the right (seen from the perspective of the wading dog), they remained completely relaxed.
But if the tail inclination was primarily left (again from the dog's perspective, who is betting), their heart rate increased and they looked restless.
According to Professor Vallortigara, the dogs do not deliberately communicate with each other through these movements.
Rather, he is convinced that the dogs have learned from experience what movements they should worry about and when not.
He said: "If you have different encounters with other dogs and you are connected with your tail in one direction with friendly behavior and the right side rather produces a less friendly behavior, then you react on the basis of these experiences."
The researchers say that the findings could help dog owners, veterinarians and trainers to better understand their animal's emotions.
John Bradshaw, an expert on dog behavior and visiting scholarship at the Faculty of Animal Medicine at the University of Bristol, explained that this was not the first study to examine whether left and right is important for dogs.
Last year, a team from the University of Lincoln found out that dogs turn their heads to the left when looking at an aggressive dog, and to the right when it's a satisfied dog.
Another research at the University of Victoria in Canada said: "Dogs are more likely to go to a robot dog when his 'swim' is waving left and not right, instead of getting restless – just the other way around than in the Italian study."
According to his statement, the differences could therefore affect that the dogs in the various studies did not interpret the animals in the films or the robot dogs as dogs.
A study of how dogs react to real dogs could help, he explained.
"Although there is considerable evidence for many different mammals that the two brain halves are used for different purposes, many of the details still need to be determined – and dogs are no exception," says Bradshaw.
But since their behavior can be easily recorded, it will probably not take long until we understand why the tail sometimes moves into the one, sometimes in the other direction.
Arctic Monkeys postpone appearance in Glasgow due to the disease Alex Turners
The Rockband Arctic Monkeys has postponed a performance in Glasgow after her lead singer has contracted keel inflammation.
The band from Sheffield was supposed to play in the hydro on Friday.

The band's announcement came after she had to postpone an appearance at the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on their official website the Arctic Monkeys announced: "After the decision to cancel the show at the LG Arena in Birmingham tonight and on medical advice, the Arctic Monkeys must also cancel the show at the Hydro in Glasgow on Friday, November 1.
"Alex Turner has been diagnosed with a pharyngitis, which is why he cannot occur."
The show at the LG Arena in Birmingham is now taking place on November 20th, which was held at the Hydro in Glasgow on November 21st.

Pope Francis appoints first cardinals in February
Pope Francis was first appointed new cardinals of the Catholic Church on February 22, as the Vatican announced on Thursday.
Cardinals are the high-ranking clerics in the Catholic Church after the Pope and they are also the ones who elect a Pope, so that Francis will appoint the first group of men who will ultimately participate in the election of his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, a cardinal who has reached the age of 80 can no longer participate in the Pope's election – this is true of a group of 120 "electoral cardinals".
In a statement announcing the news, Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman, said that there would be a meeting of all the cardinals before the ceremony was held to appoint the new cardinals, also known as Consistorium.
" Pope Francis has decided to announce in advance his decision to convene the Consistory in February so that other meetings that require the participation of cardinals from all over the world can be planned," said Lombardi.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that the number of eligible cardinals would probably have fallen by February.
He explained that a pope usually appoints as many cardinals as necessary so that the number of eligible cardinals is 120 again, and as many cardinals over 80 as he wants.
The Consistorium next year is important because it has been the first since Francis was elected in March of this year, according to Valero.
There is currently a certain overhang on the side of Europe and, in particular, Italy.
"It will be interesting to see whether the new Pope will appoint Cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance," he said.
Forty percent of the Catholics live in South America, but they only have a tiny number of cardinals.
The cardinals will also be the first to be called since the formation of the Council of Cardinals founded by Francis, a group of eight cardinals from all over the world who have the task of finding opportunities to reform the Church.
In the past, the Pope decided everything on his own.
"Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him," said Valero.
He explained that it was "well possible" that Francis asked the Cardinals for advice.
But so far we have not been in this position – that is all new.
Valero said that typically the bishops from large places would be called cardinals, but Francis was "full of surprises – so we do not know who he appoints".
GM calls back new pickup trucks in the USA to repair the seat back
General Motors calls back almost 19,000 of its brand new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks with built in 2014 to fix a problem with the manually adjustable seatrest, according to a communication from the US vehicle safety regulatory authority on Friday.
For some of the cars there may be a defect in the mechanism for resetting the front seat.
For this reason, they do not comply with the federal vehicle safety guidelines for head restraints.
"If the vehicle is driven up from behind, it is possible that the head restraints do not properly protect the occupants, so that there is an increased risk of injury," was read in the message on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) website.
The recalled models were manufactured between 1 August and 10 September.
The supply of GM trucks began in June and represents the main start of the leading US car manufacturer since the insolvency restructuring in 2009.
GM informed the vehicle owners in the first half of October about the defect.
The NHTSA was unable to check the notification letter because of the 16-day government shutdown, which had a negative impact on car sales in October.
Sales of the Silverado and Sierra trucks, which were newly developed for the 2014 model year, increased by 20 percent in the first ten months of the year, said GM on Friday.
In October GM sold 42,660 Silverado and 16,503 Sierra pickup trucks.
The GM share increased by 1.4 percent on the New York Stock Exchange to 37.47 US dollars on Friday afternoon.
Desperation screams of an Obama elector
I have elected President Obama twice in the hope that change will be possible
He said that Obama had made praiseworthy efforts that had been thwarted by the Republican blockade tactics
The blockade policy did not excuse the website problems of Obamacare, the drone attacks
Obama's memoirs on the 2008 election campaign were a sad reminder of what would have been possible
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second year student at Harvard Medical School.
I'm currently reading a terribly sad book.
It's a book I thought it would cheer me up during the tedious second year of my medical study and give me hope again.
It is called "The Audacity to Win" and describes the memoirs of Barack Obama for the 2008 presidential election.
When I finish my patient writings in the evening and go to bed, the book takes me back to a time when politics inspired millions and gave me a speech to breathe.
The election became a landslide victory, and newsmen held back to show the historical significance of this hour.
My classmates were crying for joy, and my parents were collecting all the newspapers they could find.
A young team of visionaries was on their way to the White House and the nation was ready for change.
When Obama moved to office in 2008, he had 82% approval.
And then I'll close the book.
Switching back to the present is an evil awakening, as if one were torn out of a dream.
It is hard to remember these optimistic times – they seem to be a vague memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
In the years since I first cast my vote, something has actually changed.
But it's just nothing I could have imagined.
I recognise the great and versatile things that Obama has achieved, from the adoption of the Affordable Care Act for health insurance to the military withdrawal from Iraq, the end of the forced concealment of homosexuality in the army and the killing of Osama bin Laden.
I also believe that party political blockade tactics have tilted too many efforts to bring our nation forward: immigration reform, a public option for health insurance and the closure of Guantanamo Bay, to name just a few.
But after I have defended the Obama government against colleagues and acquaintances countless times, I have reached the end with my attempts at declaration.
I have reached a point of political despair.
Republican blockade policy cannot explain why we allow foreign heads of state to be heard or the killing of innocent children by drones overseas.
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data on the private lives of Americans and why whistleblowers are punished that reveal state misconduct.
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, was murdered without trial, nor why the public funding and spending limits are being circumvented during the presidential elections.
It does not justify the results of a report which says that the White House's efforts to calm the media are the 'most aggressive ... since the Nixon government'.
And recently, it cannot excuse the inability to design a simple website over three years since the adoption of the Affordable Care Act.
I don't know if that's what I should have expected.
Whether I should have understood by 18 that government work could contradict its previous political campaigns.
Obviously, the MP's office is not a predictable course, as an opposition party and random events such as the Newtown massacre shape the public debate.
But if I look at the above examples, they seem to be largely elected by the government itself.
And that bothers me the most.
I chose Obama again in 2012, not because I was excited about his candidacy.
In the midst of Romney, a confusing and unexplained alternative seemed unable to determine his direction and positions.
I had the impression that a second term for Obama, free from the pressure of future elections, would fulfill the hope that we had heard for so long.
But with the decline of Obama's approval values to less than 45% this week, this book has made the return to 2008.
It arouses in me the longing for the many promises that have dissolved in the air.
This week I read a section in the book that describes how Obama had to put a heavy loss against Clinton in the pre-elections in Pennsylvania.
In a meeting with the election helpers after the decision he told his employees that they would have to come back on course and follow the purpose of their case.
"I want us to find our magic again," he said.
We need to remember who we are.
It's five years later, Mr. President, and I couldn't more agree with you.
The views expressed in this comment are exclusively those of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claims that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest in parental leave
The billionaire and MP Clive Palmer says that Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in a conflict of interest in his plans for parental leave because his daughters become pregnant and could therefore benefit from it.
The mining magnate, who is in a legal dispute over the payment of $6 million in CO2 tax, made the claim when he wanted to wipe questions from the table as to whether he was in a conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which is important for deciding whether the CO2 and mining taxes will be deleted or reduced.
But Palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest and the daughters of Abbott would personally benefit from the laws.
"He is in a big conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave, because when one of his daughters becomes pregnant, he has a direct interest in whether or not she is on leave," said Palmer.
Two months after the election, the Palmer Electoral Commission officially declared the winner of the Sunshine Coast seat of Fairfax with 53 votes in favour after the re-counting.
Palmer called for a revision of the voice counting process so that it could be done more quickly.
Tony Abbott's daughters Frances and Bridget.
Should these elections be decided two months after the end of the vote?
"We need a better system," he said.
Why shouldn't we have a system where you move in, enter data into a computer, immediately select it and then have the result at 6:30 in the evening?
Palmer also criticized the use of pencils when marking the ballot.
Is it used because you can erase the results if you don't like them?
Today, it is incredible to vote with pencils.
The Electoral Commission has examined the options for an electronic election and recently published a joint legislative proposal with New Zealand.
Palmer, 59, said that his politics include an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he will take his new office "very seriously".
A public office is about the service to the public.
"We are striving for no reward except that of history, that we can serve in a critical time of this community," he said.
RBS suspends two foreign exchange dealers
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign exchange department, two people who are familiar with the situation; this is another indication that the worldwide administrative investigation into the alleged manipulations on the currency market is rapidly taking place.
Some of the largest banks in the world, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, confirmed that they cooperate with the authorities in investigations in the world's largest financial market, on which 5.3 billion dollars a day change the owner.
The two dealers were the first RBS employees to be suspended in the expanding investigation that led to the scandal of the Libor Interbank business.
The bank, which did not comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it had received information requests from authorities.
"Our investigations on this issue continue and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and other regulators," said the Bank two weeks ago.
Last month, persons related to the situation reported that the RBS had forwarded the records of emails and instant messages sent by and to an earlier trader to the UK Supervisory Authority, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This dealer, Richard Usher, had left the RBS in 2010 and is now said to have been retired from his current position as European leader of the Forex Spot trade at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, Head of European Spot Trading at Citi, was retired this week and Matt Gardiner, formerly leading currency dealer at Barclays and UBS, was suspended this week at Standard Chartered.
None of these traders were accused of any misconduct.
Bankers were part of Usher's Instant Message Group at Barclays and the Citigroup, said the situation was close.
UBS announced this week that it had taken steps against some of its employees after the Swiss regulator Finma had declared that it was investigating a suspected manipulation of the foreign exchange market in a number of Swiss banks.
At least six authorities worldwide – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss Competition Authority Weko, the FCA, the US Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are currently dealing with allegations that Banker should have agreed on transactions on the currency market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse also initiated internal investigations or received information requests from authorities, said people familiar with the situation.
Banks are going through instant messages and emails from several years looking for cases of misconduct.
The news of these investigations has upset traders in an area that has been one of the most profitable trading units of investment banks in recent years, but has been under pressure this year because low volatility in currencies limits the chances of speculators.
Some bankers have tried to downplay the affair and said that it is almost impossible to manipulate the extensive and highly liquid foreign exchange market, but leading dealers believe that this is not necessarily true.
A leading trader noted that despite the enormous daily volume of foreign exchange trading, the fragmentation of liquidity between the various trading platforms and the increasing use of own internal platforms by banks led to "the market being affected by very low ticket prices".
The message came out the same day when Credit Suisse announced that this week she had announced to a dealer of her London Exchange Traded Funds offices after he had caused a loss of almost six million dollars at the end of last year.
The bank promptly informed and cooperated with the competent authorities.
"We are sure that the dealer has acted alone and that the matter is blocked," said Credit Suisse.
Painted the building fence on the Bechtle property
A group of citizens' initiative "Schweizer Wiese" has embellished the building fence on the Bechtle grounds on the Kurpromenade in Bad Herrenalb.
In addition, she cleaned and broadened the footpath, says a press release.
The planned cover of the demolishing house in the rear part of the property was not allowed for security reasons, because the site is threatened to slip.
Alfred Abel, who currently manages the property, had agreed to the beauties with his colleague Reinhard Domke from the BI.
Before the action of the BI, a transparent with the message "We are for it" had been applied.
However, this did not bother the approximately 20 members of the citizens' initiative much in their actions.
Her motto on the large poster was "We are against Bauruinen".
In this way she wanted to point out the danger of even bigger ruins on the Swiss meadow - should one day the giant project fail.
In conversation with many passers-by in front of the "building site" it became clear that some citizens believe that it would be much better with the realization of the project of the city, although not a few have the same questions about the dimension of the project presented as the BI.
But they start to resign because the city is further delaying these answers, it's called from the side of the BI.
As was to be heard, the mayor's public statements also have an effect.
In May, at the municipal council meeting, he said that he feared the outing for the thermal bath, the population should vote against the plans for a swimming and wellness complex on the Swiss meadow.
Some of them seem just too frightened, while others feel that they are "pumple extortion attempts" at the population, says the BI press release.
The BI thanked the donors for the color and all the helpers.
Rangnick shields for Schiris: Mane no swallow king
As satisfied as Ralf Rangnick is with the current high form of the Bundesliga table leader Red Bull Salzburg, so the sports director of the "Bulls" was disappointed by the referees.
"There is currently a dangerous tendency for Mane and Alan to be forced into the category of swallow kings," he protected the two offensive swirlers on Thursday at a press conference in Salzburg.
The latest reason for Rangnick's criticism was Yellow for Mane at 3:0 against Grödig last Sunday, where Senegalese became a alleged actress - which was certainly not what the TV pictures showed.
"A grave misjudgment," said Rangnick, who called Arbitration Judge Harkam "fully overreacting".
Harkam had also contributed "his part" to the escalation between Salzburg-Coach Roger Schmidt and Grödig-Trainer Adi Hütter after the game.
He defended his German compatriot: "I would have behaved the same as Roger Schmidt in every situation."
Schmidt himself does not want to have had contact with his colleague after the Schmützel with Hütter.
I don't know why.
"For I am the one who was offended," stressed the 46-year-old.
However, in view of the success of the race, Rangnick voted in favour of a Lobeshymne.
"There are only two words for that: really good," he observed.
There's not much to put out.
Especially the way the team plays is impressive.
It's supposed to go on like this.
There will hardly be any changes in the winter transfer period.
There are no great reasons to change anything.
"Aside from a player, he wishes to leave the club," Rangnick made it clear.
Supreme Court confirms Obama's Health Act
It is a great victory for the Obama government: the U.S. Supreme Court decided today that the health law closely associated with Barack Obama is constitutional.
By five to four votes, the judges ruled that the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – forcing US citizens to take out health insurance or pay a penalty by 2014 – is constitutional within the State's tax authority.
The chief judge John Roberts struck the side of the four more liberal members of the Chamber, while the judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy decided against it.
The Court also confirmed the remaining sections of the 2700-page law and also held that the health law stipulated that states would either have to extend the access requirements for Medicaid or otherwise remove all state medical promotions would not be constitutionally restrictive.
The lawsuit against the law had been tried by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The law was firmly rejected by all leading Republican presidential candidates, including the final challenger Mitt Romney, in the 2012 preliminary election.
Norway: Norwegian place lights up with giant mirrors
With huge mirrors, the inhabitants of a Norwegian village brought light into their dark valley.
Because of the low level of sunset, the Rjukan, located in the Vestfjord valley, usually sinks from autumn to spring in the shadow of the surrounding mountains.
With three gigantic reflectors at 45 meters altitude, a century dream came true on Wednesday.
"Finally!", Mayor Steinar Bergsland swore at the launch ceremony on TV2.
Some of the valley dwellers were able to recover sun loungers, while others were wearing sunglasses for safety reasons.
So far, sunhungry had to travel by cable car to a nearby summit in winter.
Ten years ago, local artist Martin Andersen presented the proposal to direct the rays to the valley with mirrors.
However, this basic idea has been in place since 1913.
After several years of debate, the City Council finally adopted the 5 million crowns (about 615 000 euros) of expensive project.
A similar construction has been creating winter sunshine for several years in the Italian alpine town of Viganella.
Mail is barely empty yet on Sundays
"Many citizens will not have noticed it yet, the red points for Sunday learning are still on different mailboxes of the core city and the districts, but if you read the small printed on the yellow containers of Post AG, you will soon find out that the emptying on Sundays and holidays is no longer taking place," the FDP informs.
A request from the FDP confirmed this.
On Sundays and public holidays, only in front of the post office building in Ernst-Ludwig-Straße 36 and in Jakob-Müller-Straße 1 in Hüttenfeld will be emptied.
Whether Sunday is also empty in Hofheim and Rosengarten, the answer to the FDP's request is not answered.
The social and youth spokesperson of the FDP, Fritz Röhrenbeck, wants to pick up here.
Sunday learning is an important postal service right at the appointment post.
"This company, despite the increase in the price of letters on January 2013, is radically and unbelievably thinning out."
Thomas Bittner, chairman of the Liberal Group and the Liberals' Association, supports his group colleagues: "What annoys me is the fact that here the emptying times are changed or also deleted.
The post office is miles away from the city centre.
"At least the mailboxes in the districts of Neuschloß and Rosengarten must be emptied again on Sundays," says Bittner and Rohrenbeck unisono.
Also valid for the core city, especially non-mobile fellow citizens would also have to be able to reach a mailbox with Sunday learning.
Rohrenbeck asked the city parliament if the city administration was planning conversations with the post office about this matter.
Mayor Erich Maier replied that the post did not communicate with Lampertheim.
His knowledge, however, also gives a Sunday lesson in Hofheim.
Your party has voted in favour of privatization.
"Then decisions are taken elsewhere," said Maier.
Frankfurt car park fees are expected to rise sharply
Parking in Frankfurt could soon become more sensitively expensive.
This morning, the city's magistrate advises on a presentation by transport dean Stefan Majer (Green).
Thus, parking charges are to be increased by 50 percent.
However, prices should not be increased, but the time interval between parking watches and parking ticket machines should be shortened from 30 to 20 minutes.
Then, in December, the city council has to decide.
The Retail Committee of the IHK Frankfurt considers this "not a good idea".
The parking possibility immediately before the business was "an advantage not to be underestimated for smaller retailers".
The German Transport Club believes that an increase after two decades is "quite appropriate and actually long overdue".
Public transport is also becoming more expensive.
Freudenstadt: Fast actions overrun host
With a narrow cadre, the men I of the TSV Freudenstadt had to stand against the TG Gönningen of the Swabian Alb in the Schiller school hall in Reutlingen.
The Älbler stood with an experienced team on the other side of the web.
Soon, however, it turned out that they could not fully support the rapid actions of the cities of joy, also due to age.
With the hard and placed additions, the Tonningians were extremely difficult.
Repeatedly they missed the passes and attacks played by Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz cleanly over the center of the net and were not in place in block defense.
Two high first movement gains clearly expressed the superiority of the cities of joy in all matters.
In view of this depressing and game-determining performance, the third movement was then won slightly late and lustlessly to the 3:0 end (25:13, 25:14, 25:22).
There will be a much more powerful opponent in the field on November 2 with the TV Baiersbronn, which was able to stand out clearly in Nagold.
TSV Freudenstadt I: Dominik Bäuerle, Yannik Büchle, Sebastian Dölker, Felix Pälchen, Stefan Räller, Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz.
In the B-Class, the second teams from Baiersbronn and Freudenstadt were faced in the Murgtalhalle in Baiersbronn.
They delivered a hard-fought two-hour match.
Nervosity on both sides caused errors and score gifts, especially when it came to balling; even in the passes the precision was sometimes a lack of goods and in some critical game scenes the over-eifer prevented the sight of possible score wins.
In this highly balanced encounter, however, the TSV team of Marcus Blasutto consistently agreed on the great physical commitment and a joyful commitment of both teams.
Care day at the small English cottage
For the fifth day of care in the wake of the Natura 2000 project above Hotzenwald, a group of dedicated participants met at the small English hut in Ibach.
Based on popular suggestions, this day in the area of the hut the view into the valley was to be freed, said Mayor Helmut Kaiser.
Many hikers, says Kaiser, described this area as the highlight of the gorge, on which the landscape offers the ideal setting for magnificent views.
He thanked the present for their willingness to cooperate and stressed that the day of care was a suitable instrument to strengthen the link between man and nature.
It offers every citizen the opportunity to set their own accents in nature.
At the same time as the tourist aspect, ecological considerations could also be taken into account.
Friederike Tribukait explained this ecological aspect by the Department of Nature Conservation of the government bureau of Freiburg following the welcome by Landrat Tilman Bollacher, who had taken over the patronage and wished the action a good success.
According to Tribukait, the touristic goal of the view covers itself with the aim of maintaining the now growing old common meadow with its specific protected habitat types by opening and connecting to the remaining pastures.
Certain species, such as rare butterflies and grass hoppers, cannot overcome barriers in the form of forest areas.
They need these free connections for species conservation.
Tribukait said she didn't want to fail to break a lance for the planned biosphere.
The current measure does not only fit seamlessly into this plan.
A biosphere area also offers the opportunity for sustainable economic and ecological development based on the internationally recognised UNESCO status and thus a continuous addition to the life project as well as the past care days for the future.
After these various presentations, Head of Division Christoph Wehle and Life Project Manager Cornelia Bischoff divided the helpers into groups.
The larger trees had already been beaten in advance, the forest tower is ready to call.
A group of helpers should take care of the release of juniper bushes and care for the maintenance of a dry stone bar.
The goal was the open view at the vantage point.
Löffingen: Köffler still the only candidate
Information on the Internet: Although the Baarstädtchen Löffingen can be described as an attractive city with its 7514 inhabitants, an intact infrastructure, a forward-looking school, children's, youth and senior citizens' policy, as well as its own urban works, no second mayor candidate has yet joined.
As the only candidate to succeed the mayor Norbert Brugger, who is no longer running for his age, the 46-year-old banker and business economist Dieter Köffinger from Löffingen has so far stood firm.
The application deadline expires on Monday 11 November at 6 p.m.
Google, Samsung, Huawei sued for Nortel patents
The group, which owns thousands of former Nortel patents, imposed on Thursday an avalanche of claims for patent infringement against mobile manufacturers, including Google, the company that was oversold by him in the insolvency auction of Nortel.
Rockstar, the consortium that bought Nortel patents for $4.5 billion, sued Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringement in the U.S. District Court in Texas.
Rockstar is owned jointly by Apple, Microsoft, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of patent infringement in seven cases.
The patents concern technology that matches search terms on the Internet with relevant advertising, according to the complaint that thus hits the core of Google's search engine business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not immediately accessible.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC produce mobile phones that work with Google's Android operating system, which are in fierce competition with Apple and Microsoft's mobile products.
In 2011, Google issued an initial bid of over $900 million for Nortel patents.
Google increased its offer several times and recently offered $4.4 billion.
After it was outsourced to Rockstar's Nortel patents, Google Motorola acquired mobility for $12.5 billion, a business that was also motivated in part by Motorola's library of patents.
"Although Google has failed with its attempt to acquire the patent at the auction, Google has violated the patents and continues to do so," says the letter of appeal.
Rockstar demands a high damages from Google, as it claims that Google's patent infringement was intentional, the accusation says.
Egypt Is Devoting First Freely Appointed Presidents
Mohammed Mursi resigns from office, but his day of triumph should not mean the end of political strife in Egypt.
Islamist Mohammed Mursi promised a “new Egypt” when he was sworn as the first freely elected president of the country and thus took on the successor of Husni Mubarak, who had been expelled from office 16 months earlier.
With his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Mursi also became the first freely elected Islamic president of the Arab world and Egypt's fifth head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy about 60 years ago.
He made the oath before the 18 judges of the court dressed in black robes, who are based on the Nile and imitated an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We are looking for a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic," said Mursi at the solemn ceremony, which was broadcast live on state television.
"Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom, genuine democracy and stability," said the 60-year-old Mursi, an engineer trained in the USA and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group, who had been taken seriously since its founding 84 years ago as a banned organization by the respective government.
Hundreds of soldiers and police guarded the building, when Mursi arrived in a small car convoy shortly after eleven o'clock local time.
Only a few hundred supporters had gathered in front of the court to cheer the new president, and in contrast to the presidential prank from the Mubarak era, the traffic was stopped for a short time so that the autoconvoy could cross the usually lively road that connects the city centre to the southern suburbs.
As an uncharismatic "replacer" of the Brotherhood, his personal prestige has increased since his victory and a Friday speech, in which he not only presented himself as a candidate of the Islamists, but all those who wanted to bring the efforts of the 2011 uprising to the goal of authoritarian Mubarak.
"Egypt is today a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," said Mursi, dressed in a blue suit with a red tie, to the judges in the wooden chamber, in which he placed the title.
Later, Mursi went to the University of Cairo where he was supposed to give his opening speech.
He was officially welcomed by an army chapel that played the national anthem that he listened to in hatefulness.
The military leader Feldmarschall Hussein Tantawi was present.
Upon his arrival, he was welcomed by hundreds of people present in the university's largest auditorium with speeches from 'The army and the people are a hand'.
The University of Cairo, established as the bastion of secular education in 1908, became a high castle of Islamic student groups in the 1970s.
Mursi took a symbolic oath on Friday at Tahir Square, the birthplace of the insurrection that led to the end of the authoritarian rule of Mubarak, and he promised to demand back the presidential power that the military council had assumed from the head of state who had been hunted out of office.
But with the taking of the official oath before the court and not as usual before the parliament, he bows to the military's will, indicating that the power struggle will continue.
Mursis' speech on Tahir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
Falkenberger Discotheque provides two great evenings
The new season in the Falkenberg discotheque "Blue Velvet" has begun.
On Friday evening it is called "Pump this party", on the morning of Saturday evening it continues with an Ü 25 party.
Fat beats and cool sounds are promised by the organizers of course on both days.
Workers fell down by ladder: severely injured
When a defective external sensor was replaced, a 51-year-old worker in Eggelsberg fell off a ladder on Thursday and was seriously injured.
The man from Lamprechtshausen wanted to replace a defective heater at the outside façade of a inn.
As he climbed onto the ladder attached to the canyon, he slipped away and the man fell on the concrete floor.
He suffered serious injuries and was taken to the Salzburg State Hospital with the rescue helicopter "Christophorus 6".
Rapist in South Africa: Twice life imprisonment
Nine months after the brutal rape and mutilation of a 17-year-old girl in South Africa, the perpetrator was sentenced to two life sentences on Friday.
This was reported by the broadcaster SABC.
The victim had later died from the consequences of serious injuries.
John Kana had already been found guilty of the crime at the beginning of the week.
The act had caused horror throughout the country.
The 21-year-old had raped Anene Booysen in February at an industrial site in Bredasdorp near Cape Town.
14 hours the doctors fought for the survival of the victim, but in vain.
The sight of the young was so horrific that the nurses and sisters needed psychological assistance.
Kana had admitted to being in a bar on the night of the night with Boysen.
He also confessed to have beaten them and raped them, but he disputed that he was responsible for the death of the girl.
The police had first been charged with several perpetrators, but two suspects were released from prison because the evidence against them was not sufficient.
The prosecution also stressed during the trial that she was convinced that Kana was alone at the time of the attack.
Rape is almost everyday in South Africa: every year there are about 64 000 ads for sexual violence.
That is almost ten times as much as in Germany, but with 82 million people it has significantly more inhabitants than in South Africa (50 million).
Police and women's associations in South Africa, however, value the dark figures in the case of sexual violence from 10 to 25 times.
Jumbo visits the Black Forest ham
Jumbo looking for the "best ham in the world": For the TV broadcast "Galileo" visited the Pro7-Star Bonndorf.
The speaker makes it clear right at the beginning: the most important thing for the ham is the pig bullets, Turbomast is not a good condition.
So can ham you get in every supermarket be a quality product?
Uli as head of the large ham factory in the Black Forest, Jumbo explains the workings of the company "Adler" in Bonndorf.
"Germany's favorite ham", as Jumbo announces the Black Forest ham.
Only with hair protection and kittel does he come into the factory.
Jumbo also needs to disinfect his hands before he can reach the micro.
Jumbo for strengthening fast food in Waldshut
"I'm working on huge quantities here," the TV makers, black forest ham as a mass product, amaze me.
16,000 bullets a week speak for themselves.
Weight, fat content, color: Uli explains what it depends on the quality.
Most pigs are slaughtered at six months.
TV with level?
Details such as the Ph-value of the meat also play a role.
The darker the flesh, the higher the ph-value.
"I'm excited when you measure Roberto Blanco what happens then," Jumbo says cynically.
Here the level of private television is presented in pure culture.
But it's worth watching anyway.
The spectator sees that the separation of the balls is still handicraft.
Because: Black Forest ham is traditionally found without bones on the shelf.
The secret of ham is the spicy mixture with salt.
Smoke tower and smoke fire remind Jumbo visually of a "subboat".
The trick: Tooth branches provide here in the smoke the special taste of the black forest ham.
20 days in smoke finally make the ham almost black.
"Now the disc disappears in the jumbo," he announces the test feed.
"It's really delicious," says the conclusion of the TV star.
This will allow all those involved to live.
You thought travel agencies were part of the past thanks to the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to resist the trend.
The company has increased its profit prospects for the whole year and expects record revenues from holidaymakers in Australia and the UK.
The travel company now expects an adjusted annual profit before taxes between 325 and 340 million dollars, compared to 305 to 315 million dollars in its previous forecast.
When the current target values are reached, this means a growth of 12 to 17 percent compared to the record profit of 290.4 million dollars in the 2011/12 period.
As CEO Graham Turner announced, Flight Centre achieved eight percent profit in the first half of the year and booked a strong start to the second half of the year, especially in the Australian and British private business.
"Since the beginning of the year, our ten countries have been profitable, and some of them are well on track towards record income before interest and taxes," he said.
These include Australia and Great Britain, which are typically among our strongest producers of results.
In Australia, the leisure industry recovered in the second half of the year, which amounted to a slightly weaker market for business travel.
Similarly, it was good for the leisure business of Flight Centre in the UK, while business customers also spent less.
The US business recovered from the weaker first half of the season, so that a profit is expected for the whole year for the third consecutive year.
The shares of Flight Centre increased yesterday by 3 cents to 38.20 dollars.
Schools are being held to a greater focus on mathematics, spelling and grammar
In English literature courses, students will have to deal with at least one piece of Shakespeare, a 19th-century novel, romantic poetry and contemporary British novels from 1914 onward.
The examination also includes 'unseen texts' to stimulate wider reading.
The combined course of English literature and language is abolished.
From 2015 onwards, students will have to pass an independent GCSE examination for language, with strong incentives to choose English literature as a separate qualification.
The Ministry of Education will publish tomorrow the new curricula for English and mathematics – the first subjects that have been radically transformed.
Other core subjects will be changed next year.
In a separate initiative, Ofqual, the Audit Authority, will announce a reorganisation of the GCSE structures, including a new listing system and less training.
In a speech in summer, Minister of Education Michael Gove said that there is a "wide consensus that we need to reform our audit system in order to restore public confidence", stressing that the GCSEs would become "challenger, more ambitious and stricter".
Studies show that in English schools, less time is spent on mathematics – 116 hours a year or three hours a week per school year – than in most other countries.
On the other hand, Australian schools teach an average of 143 hours a year and students in Singapore receive 138 hours.
Although there will be no formal requirement to provide more time for mathematics in the timetable, from coalition circles it is said that the comprehensive math exam – combined with a stronger weighting of the subject in ranking lists – will probably encourage schools to start more hours.
The curriculum focuses more on 'problems from the right life', including financial mathematics.
Beautiful animals and delicious cakes attract
The most beautiful rabbits of different breeds and color sets will be presenting the Kreisverband performance show at this weekend in the Bürgerhaus.
The reviews were already carried out on Thursday
Again, the Ortsverein W514 arranges this large exhibition.
Breeders of the Soest County clubs show here their best animals as well as young Wickeder hobbyists their rabbits.
On Thursday, six prize judges conducted the evaluation of the numerous rabbits and were able to distinguish outstanding animals.
Visitors to the show are well informed as the evaluation of all animals is attached to the cages.
The official opening of the exhibition takes place on Saturday at 2.30 p.m. by Mayor Hermann Arndt.
The Rabbit Show is open to all visitors on Saturday from 10 a.m. and on Sunday from 10 a.m. to 15.30 p.m., where the award ceremony is held.
Guests are also invited to a well-stocked tombola and a deliciously stocked cafeteria.

Salem: Johanna Rahner at the Ecumenical Forum
The next Ecumenical Forum on Monday, 21 October, in the New Museum of the Castle is about the topic "To Hell with Hell - Theological considerations about today's handling of the last things".
Speaker is Professor Johanna Rahner.
The Ecumenical Forum is an initiative of the Catholic and Evangelical churches of Salem, Salem Castle and the Bodenseekreis Cultural Office.
Johanna Rahner wants to examine the question in the forum, how people today classify the "last things" after death.
If people had known too much about it in the past centuries and had placed them on those images of heaven and hell, "that shape our ideas to this day", the contemporary prophetic doctrine of hope of perfection is more marked by a certain embarrassment or even speechlessness.
"The greater hope has been properly driven out of Christians by the religious criticism," says the speaker.
She has "supplied us with so many question marks that the exclamation marks seem to have gotten away from us".
Johanna Rahner continues: "But the crucial challenge remains the trouble of death".
This is linked to the question of that longing, "who dreams that in the end everything may be good".
Johanna Rahner, born in 1962 in Baden-Baden, studied Catholic theology and biology at the Albert-Ludwigs-Universität Freiburg from 1982 to 1989.
She received her doctorate in 1997 at Dr. theol., also in Freiburg.
The Habilitation for Fundamental Theology and Ecumenical Theology followed in 2003 at Wilhelms-Universität Westphalia.
Since 2010, Johanna Rahner has held a Chair of Systematic Theology at the Institute of Catholic Theology of the University of Kassel.
Geislingen: More than 100 young Catholics from Kleinen Heuberg confirm their creed at the firmation
In two divine services 101 15- and 16-year-old youths of the Seelsorgeunit Am Kleinen Heuberg have been confirmed.
In the morning, the Laudato-Si group accompanied the divine service, on the afternoon of the Youth Choir The Spirit.
With the reception of the sacrament, the young people said yes to their baptism and requested the power of the Holy Spirit.
The firmlings had been preparing for the big festival in recent months, under the direction of Diakon Reiner Dehner and the help of numerous parishioners.
In different projects, they learned about various tasks of Christian community life and experienced the Youth Day in Untermachtal together.
Illmensee: Second Mountain Bike Race Enthusiast Participants
In beautiful weather 214 cyclists came to Illmensee to manage the round course over the hill chains around the lake.
Ulrich Knobel tells about this from the sporting club Illmensee.
Among the participants, especially at the short distance over 15 kilometers and 300 meters of altitude, were also numerous everyone's cyclists who once wanted to practice their hobby in the competitive atmosphere.
Two junior riders of the German top class were also at the start in this competition: Felix Bader from Bad Waldsee and Pascal Treubel from Aachen-Linz came with the recommendation good rankings at the German Championships.
These two could be expected to dissipate from the field.
As in the previous year, Felix Bader was able to save a small time lead to the goal and defended his title as the overall winner of the short distance.
In second place, Pascal Treubel was able to place himself again.
With the ladies, it was Theresa Duelli from the team nightmare that made it on top of the winning staircase.
Anne Adel from Illmensee and Leonie Treiber from Owingen came in second and third place.
An encouraging development is the increasing number of drivers who live or work in the municipality.
Not only in terms of performance, the entire range of athletes was represented.
The age structure ranged from ten years for the youngest to over 70 years for the oldest starters.
In the main race this year there were even more absolute Toppaths at the start.
Four drivers were able to stand down from the top regional drivers.
Including Philipp Pangerl, a mountain bike semi-professional from the Black Tusk Racing team.
Pangerl, together with a teammate, was already twice the world champion in the twelve-hour ride.
This year he became European champion in this special discipline.
With Roland Ballerstedt, who already calls two German championship titles in the duathlon his own.
After 45 kilometers and 900 meters of altitude, a eyelash was made in the finish line in front of the three-seat hall.
Pangerl was the first to crash across the finish line.
Only a second later, the Routineer Ballerstedt was able to secure second place in the overall ranking.
At the same time, Hermann and Warthmann came into the goal as a third of the overall score.
Christiane Cohsmann was the fastest time in the main race.
==History==Areane Blersch from Binzwangen secured second place in front of Natascha Werner from Stuttgart.
Sportsmen and helpers were very satisfied with the smooth and well-organized course of the event.
On the way through mud, rivers and jungles for free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle brings free medical assistance to remote villages in Cameroon
Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend treating hundreds of patients
In the West African country there are not many doctors, only one for 5,000 people
Vote here or with your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 "CNN Heroes of 2013".
You can vote for him or one of the other heroes in the Top 10 to choose him as the "CNN Hero of the Year".
The winner receives $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years George's Bwelle watched his sick father lose consciousness and travel to hospitals that did not have the means to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in 1981 in a car accident near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
At first he had only one broken arm, but then an inflammation developed that spread to his brain and caused a hematoma that would affect him for the rest of his life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," said Georges Bwelle.
We would have taken him out of Cameroon if we had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years accompanying his father in overcrowded clinics and hospitals to get the treatment they had to offer.
"It's not easy," said Bwelle.
You can leave the house at five o'clock in the morning and run to the hospital to be the first, and you're not the first.
There are a lot of patients.
Some people even die because they have to wait.
The situation has hardly changed since Bwell's father died in 2002.
In Cameroon there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people, according to the World Health Organization.
On the other hand, the ratio in the United States lies with a doctor for 413 people.
But even if there were a doctor for them, most Cameroonans could not afford to visit them.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line and nearly three quarters of health expenditure in the country is private.
"The only problem they have is poverty," says Bwelle.
And poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life.
Seeing his father and so many of his countrymen suffering made Bwelle decide to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his volunteer team conducted 700 free operations last year.
He himself became a doctor and works as a vascular surgeon at the Central Hospital in Yaoundé.
He also established a non-profit organization called ASCOVIME, which travels in rural areas on weekends and offers free medical care there.
Since 2008, he and his volunteer group have helped almost 32,000 people.
Nearly every Friday, he and up to 30 people force themselves into small buses and drive with the tethered medical equipment on the roof over unpaved terrain to the villages that need help.
Everything is not always going smoothly.
More than once they had to push the vehicles through rivers and mud.
But when they arrive, they will be received like heroes: a feast, singing and dancing, and the best accommodation the place has to offer.
In these villages, free medical care is really a reason for celebration, and Bwelle – with its broad smile and its boundless energy – is happy to attend the happy celebration.
The next morning, the team starts investigating hundreds of patients.
"We treat 500 people per trip," says Bwelle.
They come from a radius of 60 kilometers around the village – and that on foot.
Each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a number of areas.
Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others receive crutches, glasses or free birth certificates – a document that is required for school, but many poor families simply cannot afford.
In the evening, the team performs simple operations with local anaesthetic.
Operations usually take place in a school, a town hall or an apartment; after the procedure the patients get up and go to the recreation area to make room for the next one.
The lighting for the surgery and disinfection equipment is fed by the group's generator and so Bwelle and his volunteers work until early morning hours on Sunday.
It is a strenuous curriculum, but the village musicians usually help to keep the team motivated.
"They are drumming all night so we can stay awake and continue our work," says Bwelle.
On Sunday the team will return to the city, tired but proud of the work done.
The group – a mixture of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students – has conducted 700 free operations last year and knows that its work makes a huge difference for the people to whom it helps.
One man explained that the free operation of a break in performance that he had received enabled him to work again.
"This changes the future of my family," said the man.
In addition to the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon in the hospital, Bwelle also works in private clinics in Yaoundé.
With this second job he finances 60% of his non-profit activity, says Bwelle; the rest comes from private donations.
"I really don't know when he's sleeping," says Katie O'Malley, who is studying medicine at Drexel University in Philadelphia in the second year and volunteering in Bwelle's group.
He's always either in the hospital or trying to raise money for the organization so he can go on these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students like O'Malley, who come from the USA and Europe and support Bwelle, this is a chance to gain practical experience that they would never get at home.
"We can be in surgery where we can help drain blood or hold the instruments for Dr. Bwelle," explains O'Malley.
That would never be possible in America as a medical student in the second year.
Students usually pay for their trip to Cameroon themselves and bring frequently donated sanitary supplies.
But if they are first in Yaoundé, Bwelle takes over the accommodation, transport and instruction.
"He is undoubtedly a hero," says O'Malley.
He dedicates his life to this organization and his desire to help the Cameroonian people knows no bounds.
For Bwelle, almost constant work is no burden.
Helping others to have a happier life and thus fulfilling a promise he made to his Father brings him great joy.
"I am so happy when I do this work," says Bwelle.
And I'm thinking about my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
I do it to make people laugh again and to relieve the pain.

Excellently Mastered the Fight
The role of Santiago, the old man in Hemingways Novelle "The Old Man and the Sea", is cut off by Horst Janson.
Janson himself is an old rabbit in his metier, the acting art.
The old man Santiago can't do anything about fishing.
So the two simply complement each other in a great way.
It is almost thought to be able to see the wrinkles in the neck of the old man, of whom the fisherman Manolo speaks.
If Santiago sits tired of life on the chair, it's real with Janson.
In addition, the role of the old fisherman is through and through a character role that Janson excels.
Hemingway told the story of a fighter, a courageous man who does not give up and ultimately wins the battle against the fish through his knowledge and his willpower.
Janson is on stage as a solo performer on long distances.
He manages to focus the audience's attention on himself, so that his monologues are not boring for a moment.
His efforts finally to draw the fish to the surface of the water are so real that the viewers forget that the sea is made up of only blue water bottles.
Director Jens Hasselmann lets the old man act in the boat in front of the fishing village.
In the course of the performance, he sheds light on the active scene: Santiago's hut, the bar of singer Marie-Luise Gunst, who sings the life feeling of Cuba with her songs and her wonderful voice.
The four musicians play Cuba's rhythm and are also guests of the bar.
Tourism: descent to the Romans
At about 120 meters in length, below Cologne, a sewer canal from Roman times is preserved.
If you visit Cologne, you will not pass the cathedral.
Around 157 meters the two towers rise in the sky and make it Europe's second highest church building.
However, only a few visitors who marvel at the two filigree church towers suspect that there is also a lot to discover under the cathedral.
Rainer Schulze is an expert in Kölner Unterwelt.
Meeting point for his tours is the service center of Cologne tourism directly on the cathedral.
The tour begins in a completely unspectacular way: "We start in the underground garage," says Schulze.
In the 1970s, the city’s fathers wanted a car-friendly city, and that’s why the remains of the old city walls only remained what was not too big.
Therefore, most of the users of the car park today also rush past the Roman remains and just park their car.
But who looks more closely, in Parkdeck D2 discovers an archaeological site separated by metal lattice rods.
You can see about five meters high ruins made of hand-plated stones.
"These are the remains of the Roman city walls built after Christ in the second half of the first century," says Schulze.
Before returning to daylight, Schulze lets the participants at the upper parking level take a look into a dark, 15 meter deep shaft.
This is the well of the old dome, which unfortunately is hardly perceived.
The next stop of the tour is the Praetorium, and here the participants descend again to the depths.
We are experiencing here the seat of the once most powerful man north of the Alps, the Presbyterian of the CCAA.
What CCAA means, a visitor wants to know.
"The abbreviation stands for "Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium", which means in good German as much as "City of Roman law and city of Agrippinens, founded under Emperor Claudius at the place of the altar for the imperial cult".
And the Praetorium is the former governorial palace, the center of power of the Roman Empire on the Rhine.
From the front room of the exhibition a tunnel access leads to the Roman sewer canal, which is maintained here at about 120 meters in length.
"You can quietly walk along the so-called Cloaca Maxima if you want," Schulze cheers up the guests.
There's still a surprise for Schulze.
After picking up the key at the checkout, he leads the group to a 16 meter deep, walkable shaft.
"We are now in the Mikwe, a ritual Jewish bath," he explains.
The Jewish community built its bath deep into the ground to get to the groundwater, which was indispensable for the ritual washings.
To this day, in the lower end of the Mikwe, whose origins date back to the eighth century, different water levels can be read by changing levels of the Rhine.
The Mikwe becomes part of an archaeological zone on the town hall square, for which the construction work is to begin shortly.
Until completion, however, a few years will pass.
Leg almost chopped off: new edition of rocker process
A bloody attack in the Rocker milieu will be rolled up after over four years.
A trial against two 30-year-olds has begun before the Frankfurt District Court (Oder).
It is accompanied by strict security measures.
The defendants were silent.
They were said to have been active in the rockers scene and were part of the bandidos at the time.
In June 2009, the Public Prosecutor's Office accused them of having stabbed and hit three men in a car together with unknown accomplices in Finowfurt.
All the victims were severely injured, a man almost lost his leg.
The victims are said to have belonged to the competing Hells Angels group.
One should have been a high-ranking member from Berlin.
Apparently, there was a persecution chase with several cars in advance.
According to the charges, it was a territorial battle and a power demonstration.
The two defendants had been acquitted in a first proceedings at the beginning of 2012.
A judge then said that it could not have been proved that the men had actually been involved in the bloody feud.
The perpetrators had worn masks and had not been recognized.
The Federal Court of Justice reversed the judgment following the revision of the Public Prosecutor's Office and referred it back to the Landgericht for a further hearing.
One of the accused is currently in open execution for another offence.
The main issue was the reconstruction of the procedures during the night.
As a witness, the then investigating commissioner was invited.
The centre was the phone calls of the defendants and other people who had heard the police.
It's hard that Rocker always sticks to a law of interest for them - and does not pronounce.
This also applies to the victims.
In the first trial, only one of the victims had unpacked.
Prosecutor Stefan Golfier of the Public Prosecutor's Office Frankfurt (Oder) said on demand that there had been new traces since the last trial.
Eleven further negotiating days are scheduled for the process.
The throwaway society does not think
The night was long, the music was loud and the mood was good, but at some point it goes home.
Only: In the bellies of the people on the passenger seat and back seat, the hunger becomes noticeable.
Of course, one or another cocktail or sparkling wine may be responsible for this!
What's closer than chilling to go to the next drive-in to get a little something?
I admit, I'm happy to be with you when it's late at night or early in the morning.
A few fries, a cola, a burger - and then nothing like going home and going to bed!
But on the way home, the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco walkers are noticeable.
Because what do you need to keep throwing your fast food bags out of the car window with constant regularity?!
Especially on weekends, discarded paper bags lie on roadside and on parking spaces.
"Why?", I wonder.
Are people too deaf to take the bags home with them to the next trash bin?
It's not just that the paperware is ruining the landscape.
Tütten have already hidden transport facilities such as guide planks and thereby triggered accidents.
But not according to what they think, she probably doesn't even know what that word actually means.
When you are on the road more often in the evening, just with several people in the car, you know what a backseat can look like after crowded nights: clothes, bottles and other garbage are storming.
There would be nothing more or less a pair of bags - unlike the street, where no one wants to trample on the food leftovers of others.
I already see the day when the cities and communities are going to have to get away with it - and the fast food chains are going to have to ask for their bags.
Obama's withdrawer in health policy
After harsh criticism, President Obama made a withdrawal yesterday in his frequently repeated, clear promise: 'If you like your health insurance, you can keep it.'
After hundreds of thousands of their insurers received a letter of resignation, the Republicans accused the president of having deceived the American public in the last few days.
Yesterday Obama relativized his original promise.
"The vast majority of citizens who have a functioning health insurance can keep them," he said at a speech in Boston.
In response to the numerous media reports on the redundancies, Obama asked those Americans who received such notices to look around the free market for a new insurance.
Most citizens could thus receive a better, more comprehensive health insurance at the same price or cheaper than predicted.
"They come up with a better offer," he said.
The government said it was little surprising that the five percent of the population, who themselves have taken out insurance, would have to comply with a different tariff, as their contract did not meet the new standards under the Affordable Care Act.
"I would like to say to these Americans quite directly that they deserve better," said Sebelius at a hearing before the Energy and Trade Committee of the House of Representatives in Washington.
Sebelius, who is responsible for implementing the Affordable Care Act, stated that the launch of the online platform has been "disgusting" since October.
"I am as frustrated and angry as everyone else," she said.
I'm determined to regain your trust.
This statement made by Sebelius to an adviser sitting behind her at yesterday's hearing in the House of Representatives was received after a discussion with the Republican MEP Billy Long from Missouri. It was about whether she should be obliged to participate in Obamacare.
After more than three hours of hearing, Long Sebelius repeated the question of why the architect of the Affordable Care Act did not voluntarily refrain from a state-sponsored insurance policy in order to itself conclude a tariff at HealthCare.gov, which she now wants to sell millions of Americans.
Government in Jerusalem confirms attack on Syrian Air Force Base not
An American government official who wanted to remain anonymous claimed on Thursday to the American news station CNN that Israeli fighter aircraft had attacked an air force base in Latakia.
According to CNN, the objective had been "missiles and related equipment" of which the Israeli government feared that they had been destined for the Lebanese Hezbollah.
Syrian and Lebanese media as well as the Arab broadcaster Al-Arabiya had previously reported that the base in the port city of Latakia had been shot on the night of Wednesday on Thursday, and the Israelis were held responsible for it.
The Israeli television channel 2 showed satellite images of the base in Latakia, where Russian S-125 Newa defense missiles and a battery of SA-3 rockets were on display, according to Channel 2, which have a range of 35 kilometres and can transport warheads up to 70 kilograms.
Uncertain The government in Jerusalem has not officially confirmed the attack.
However, Reuters' news agency quotes an also anonymous Israeli government official as saying that he believes that Israel has carried out the attack, but is not sure.
In any case, a spokesman from the Israeli Ministry of Defence said, "We do not comment on these reports".
In the daily Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper, journalist Ron Ben-Yishai stressed that the Syrian regime had tried to deliver ground-air missiles to Hezbollah in the past, partly successfully.
The Israeli government had repeatedly warned that any attempt by Syria to supply Hezbollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons would mean the crossing of a "red line" that would follow a military response.
John Kerry, in an unparalleled admission, said that the U.S. espionage had gone "unreasonably far too far"
John Kerry, with an unexpected admission, suggested a weakening of the US's defensive attitude towards its surveillance programmes by saying that in certain cases the spying had "unreasonably gone too far".
The Foreign Minister also admitted that he, together with Barack Obama, was responsible for turning to Autopilot when the explosive revelations of Whistleblower Edward Snowden about NSA spying activities were made public.
Through the leaked information, the U.S. government has fallen into a diplomatic storm of disillusionment on the part of its allies.
At a talk transmitted by video connection at the London Open Government Conference, Kerry said: "Without a question, the President and I, as well as others in the government, have learned about some things that have almost passed by autopilot, simply because the ability to do what is still due to the Second World War and the difficult years of the Cold War and, of course, to the 11th of September."
He then admitted as the first high-ranking member of the U.S. government that the U.S. spy had crossed a border, but also stressed that no rights had been abused.
He said: 'In some cases this has gone too far too far.'
The President is determined to clarify and therefore conducts a thorough investigation so that no one has to feel that abuse is taking place here.
I assure you that the rights of innocent persons are not affected in this process.
However, Kerry insisted that the NSA was a force of good and that its surveillance operations saved many lives.
He added: "We are dealing with a new world in which people are willing to blow themselves up."
There is a radical extremism in the world that is eager to kill people, blow up people and attack governments.
So what if you were able to intercept and stop this before it happens?
We have actually prevented plane crashes, attacks on buildings and the murder of people because we have experienced such plans in advance.
Meanwhile, US legislators will travel to Europe to dispel the concerns about alleged American espionage and convince Europeans of the need to continue working with the US in the anti-terrorist efforts, as the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs stated on Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy from Connecticut said that he had spoken to representatives of the European Parliament and other people this week and was concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti-terrorist organisations due to the frustration about the monitoring by the National Security Agency.
"It is very important for the national security interests of the United States that Europeans remain on board with regard to our joint efforts against terrorism," said Murphy, who is a democrat for the first time in the Senate and is chairing the Senate Subcommittee on Foreign Relations and European Affairs, in an interview in Washington.
Furthermore, I am going to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to work together in the fight against terrorism, regardless of their anger over the NSA programmes.
Media reports that the NSA has collected millions of telephone data in Europe have strained relations with some U.S. allies, although the Head of the Secret Service said this week that the reports were inappropriate and based on a misunderstanding of the metadata collected by NATO allies and exchanged with the United States.
Other revelations quoted from documents passed on by Snowden, according to which the NSA monitored the cell phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other heads of state worldwide.
The head of the national secret services, James Clapper, defended the espionage of allies as necessary and stated that this was common on both sides.
In all the tumult, Murphy said his authority was preparing the trip of the congress this year and hoped that the delegation would include members of both parties and chambers.
The names of the other participating Members will be published in the coming days.
He said that the exact route was still being worked out.
While Murphy stressed that the purpose of the journey was to improve relations, he also said that there would be some "serious words".
He said that European governments should be honest with their people about the kind of spying programmes they have used for years.
"Although we can change our monitoring programmes and thus better protect the rights of Europeans, they also have to deal with the fact that we are not the only ones spying," says Murphy.
Meanwhile, John Kerry is on a weekend trip to the Middle East and Poland to deal with the horror of the US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as the US surveillance activities.
A persistent injury to the jumping joint threatens to prevent Nicolai Müller from playing in the Bundesliga awayspiel of the FSV Mainz 05 at the FC Augsburg.
Mainz is bnagging for a commitment by Nicolai Müller.
Tomorrow he'll try to train with the team.
So far, he's only been able to do it individually.
"We will decide on his commitment in the short term," said coach Thomas Tuchel.
The 40-year-old hopes to have his best goalkeepers with six hits.
Because the Mainzers must already refrain from the injured service providers Niki Zimling, Julian Baumgartlinger and Niko Bungert.
Australians file appeals against prison sentences in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney, who was sentenced to 15 days in prison in Phuket for falsely claiming to have been raped by a taxi driver, appealed against the judgment and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was first found guilty of making a false statement by a provincial court in Phuket on June 15 after she had reported to the Thai police that a local taxi driver raped her in the morning hours on Sunday, June 10, while two other men held her.
Later, however, the footage of a video camera showed that she had safely arrived at her hotel after she had been separated from her Australian friend.
The police in Phuket interrogated Bamford for two days until they confessed to having invented the story.
Until the trial, she was in police custody on site.
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison sentence in a low-security detention centre on the edge of Phuket, instead of in a prison for adult women.
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks, a former player of the Australian Rubgy League, who turned to the foreign ministry in Canberra with the request for help for his daughter.
Tounks explained to the Sunday Telegraph in Sydney that the whole family was "extremely concerned" about his daughter's welfare and wanted her back in Australia.
"We are of course very concerned, but we hope that she will be home as soon as possible," said Tunks.
Bamford has appealed against the judgment and is open against a bail of 50,000 Baht.
In Australian reports it was to be read that in the meantime she is taking vacations in the resort of Krabi in South Thailand.
It was heard from the court that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket and was warned that the appeal could also lead to a higher sentence of up to two years in a prison for adults.
However, it is also possible that after the recent murder of the travel saleswoman Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand may be trying to improve its targeted tourist image, and there is therefore an acquittal.
