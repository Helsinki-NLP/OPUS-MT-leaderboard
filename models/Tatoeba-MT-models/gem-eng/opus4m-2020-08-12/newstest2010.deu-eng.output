Barack Obama receives the Nobel Peace Prize as the fourth US President
American President Barack Obama comes to Oslo, Norway for 26 hours to receive the Nobel Peace Prize here as the fourth US President in history.
In addition, he receives the diploma and the medal and a cheque of over 1.4 million dollars for his extraordinary efforts to intensify world diplomacy and cooperation among the peoples.
The head of the White House arrives tomorrow with his wife Michelle in the northern metropolis and will be busy all the time.
First, he visits the Nobel Institute, where he meets for the first time with the five committee members who elected him from 172 people and 33 organisations in October.
The Presidential Couple then scheduled a meeting with Norwegian King Harald V and Queen Sonja.
In the afternoon, the visit will then reach its climax with the ceremony, where Obama will take the Prestige Prize.
He receives this as the fourth US President, but only as the third who receives the price directly in office.
The White House has already announced that Obama will talk about the Afghanistan war when the price is taken over.
The President does not want to escape this issue because he knows that he is taking over the prize as a president who is currently waging war in two countries.
A few days ago, he reinforced his efforts by sending other troops to Afghanistan, which none of his critics forget to highlight.
At the ceremony Obama also received the Golmedaille, the diploma and the check over ten million Swedish crowns (about 24 million Czech crowns).
He intends to donate the money for charitable purposes, but he has not yet decided on a concrete charitable work.
The event programme will then include a banquet with the President and his wife, where the Prime Minister and other 250 invited guests will also be present except for the King and Queen of Norway.
Obama was very cautious about the price from the beginning.
He suggested, for example, that he felt that he did not deserve the prize.
He also repeated several times that it is not just the price for him, but for all those who seek the same values as he.
Immediately after the announcement, he stated that this was "call for action" for him.
Protectors are accused of extortion
The Leitmeritz police accused the president of the "Naturschutzgemeinschaft Leitmeritz" for blackmail.
In several cases he filed appeals against some construction procedures last year, for the withdrawal of his appeals he demanded money from the investors for his benefit, said Littermitz police officer, Alena Romova.
The Chairman of the Leitmeritz-Naturschutzgemeinschaftist Lubomir Studnicka.
Now he's in custody and he's under threat of imprisonment for up to three years.
The sorting waste container in Brno does not smell good
In Prague people can sort the beverage packaging, in the South Moravian villages you can find the sorter trash container again on foot and step.
And in Brno?
There you would have to book a few minutes to find the suitable garbage bins.
I do not want to claim that the waste separation in Brno would not work at all.
But it seems to me that even if we are the second-largest city in the Republic, the Council does not take sufficient care of this problem.
Brno is located in the waste section in the Urwaldliga, not only because we as citizens are always allowed to dispose of only paper, glass and plastics here in the sorting container, but mainly because of the number of waste tons for such waste.
Have they ever tried to dispose of the PET bottles in a collector's basket, for example?
This is art, before all, it takes time and strong nerves.
The only place I've found by chance so far is the torch place opposite the hit goose.
Mr Unterka should not be annoyed by his colleagues, but that seems to me to be far too little.
Apart from the fact that the waste separation is also not a honey slick in other parts.
Therefore, quite a number of my friends prefer not to sort the waste at all.
Out of laziness.
It is too far from the garbage bins.
I'm not surprised.
Even after the celebration, I offered to dispose of a few glass and plastic bottles.
But on Konicova Street, I didn't see any color bins in sight.
Fortunately, I came to the right place while driving the tram.
The garbage, however, almost ran over.
This is still the center of Brno, which represents the whole city, right?
However, ecology and some kind of aesthetics probably leave the Brno socialists cold.
They prefer to buy the city an ice hockey league that shames us throughout the Republic, instead of buying a few more garbage bins and offering the sorting of other raw materials for a cleaner well.
I'm glad that I was able to confirm my acceptance with official statistics after looking for a while on the Internet.
According to the data of the company EKO-KOM, Brno is really the worst in the whole district of South Moravia.
The Paroubek budget has deducted the money for pensions and medical benefits
After the Left Party gave more money to farmers and officials in spite of the government's view, there is no more money in the budget for pensions, health care and construction business.
But neither for government interest rates nor for international court disputes.
This causes even more problems to those who will be in government in the second half of next year, says the Finance Minister, Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists enforced the salary increase for some groups, they expected the government to pay for the sensitive expenses, old-age pensions or the health allowance in addition. "This is just a postponement of the problems into the future, lay mines," says Janota.
Loans pay an increasing interest rate, and you have to repay the money at some point.
Too much to choose from where to take, the treasury is empty.
If the social benefits or the costs of the operation are not reduced, the tax should be increased.
For all those who the Left Party now gave more money: the fire department, the teachers, the farmers.
And later for their children too.
For the pensions or medical allowance, whose account has disappeared 1.8 billion, people don't have to be afraid, they get this money.
But at the price that the state owes itself even more - next year, so not only 163 billion will be missing in the treasury, but much more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, debt will increase more and more rapidly and, together with it, the costs and interest.
The state will need the money for compensation, then it will no longer be enough to only slightly increase VAT or reduce maternity benefits, as the government did in its regional deficit package.
Because of the currency downturn in favour of some electoral groups, five billion will be missing for the expansion of motorways and railways next year.
These are mainly the sections gained in competition, which can no longer be re-projected and possibly favoured.
At the very most, what is not free.
This means the delay or cancellation of thirty large buildings, which is also a threat to European spending, warns the spokesperson of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka.
The CSD has proposed that it solves the outflow of money Solomonically - it attacks the CEZ shareholders, in which the state is the owner of the majority, and from which the money is then distributed to the transport funds.
The problem is that the level of dividends is never safe and it is by no means an infinite source.
Last year, CEZ spent 18 billion on the budget.
Every year the dividends pay the environmental damage liquidations, the pension account is filled up and this money is also used as a reserve for the planned pension reform.
With this trick, the actual budget deficit rises to the level of 5.7 percent of GDP according to EU rules.
But the carnival of the revolutions does not yet end.
The budget for various compensations for victims of communism and crime, or for court disputes, fell almost three billion, even for building savings.
Whether the state manages without this money is not certain.
It's pure gambling.
If we lose an international court dispute, then we have to pay it anyway, Janota makes it clear.
The Minister will then have to save the money in-house or, in the worst case, attack the government budget reserve.
One hundred million are also missing for the already launched two billion project "Staatskasse", which should allow to monitor on-line for what the individual authorities spend the money.
The first stage starts in January.
If the finance minister did not find the money elsewhere, the project would have to be stopped and in this case sanctions would come, Janota warned.
Your next smartphone will control two operating systems
The Americans expect the future with a mobile phone on which the user can switch between different operating systems by pressing a single button.
The plans presented look promising.
It is enough to press only one key, and Windows Mobile will switch to Android within seconds.
This is precisely the option the American society wants to introduce VMware, which focuses mainly on the development of virtual software for computers.
We allow you to perform two user profiles on your mobile at the same time.
You can switch between these, you can separate them into two home and work profiles.
Both will work in parallel, according to Srinivas Krishnamurti from the company VMware during an interview for the magazine Computerworld.
It was presented last November and presented for the first time a few days ago.
The market will come in 2012.
The virtualization of the smart phones is not fiction.
VMware already successfully presented the smartphone test pattern to the journalist with two operating systems.
One was a modified Nokia N800 with a RAM memory of 128 MB, on which the mentioned systems ran Windows Mobile and Android simultaneously.
The development of the new technology for mobile phones is in full swing.
The company VMware is now working together with the European and American operators on the smartphone virtualization and the devices are to come to the customer by 2012.
Snow shortages on the mountains torment the hotel owners
Snowless slopes not only make the giant mountain dwellers concerned.
The lack of snow also deters people from ordering ski stays in hotels and pensions.
Therefore, in Giant Mountains you can still get free rooms for all winter dates including Christmas and New Year's Eve.
Our pages are frequently visited.
People go through the offers, determine the prices, but in the meantime they are afraid to order legally.
And when they call us, they immediately ask if we believe that this year's Christmas will be on snow or "on mud", the operator of the information portal Spindl.Info, Martin Jandura, pointed out.
Anyone who wants the New Year's stay in the spindle mill exactly according to his ideas should no longer hesitate with the order.
Who prefers saving and where the quality of the stay comes second, who can try to wait a few more days.
The Spindelmühle hotel owners now offer mostly only weekly stays for the New Year's Eve Day.
I think they'll be trying for a while to sell them, but then they'll have to give up, too, and go into shorter times.
And then the free rooms will disappear quickly, Jandura estimated.
Free beds on all winter dates always offer the travel agency Ingtours in Vrchlabi.
Now we are most interested in the Christmas week, which has not yet been sold out.
In our offer, about half of the places are still free.
That is why we have already prepared some more affordable Christmas stays for the last moment, said the director of the travel agency Ingtours, Petr Schiefert.
New Year's Eve in Giant Mountains can also offer the Vrchlabi travel agency, but there are less free places here.
Good sales also find the first fourteen days in February, the remaining winter dates are sold on average.
This year the interest in winter stays is also negatively influenced by the fact that in Giant Mountains there is always no snow.
People are waiting for snow to fall.
No one wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
If the slopes are snowed within a week, Christmas will also be sold out, says Schiefert.
Conversely and slightly better than last year, the rooms at Hotel Horizont in Pecpod Snezkou manage to occupy.
We are about five percent better than in the previous year.
On New Year's Day and Christmas we only have a few more free rooms.
There is great interest in the Polish holidays in Janua, and in February the business will also run well, informed the director of the best Pec hotel, Karel Rada.
The hotel Omnia is also occupied at the central parking lot in Janske Lazne for 80 percent of the New Year's Eve stays.
On the other hand, half of the beds remain at the latest hotel in Janske Lazne for Christmas.
We were pleasantly surprised at this year of January, for which we are already occupied at about 60 percent.
A little weaker is now in February, but at the moment when the snow comes, the interest in the stays in the Giant Mountains certainly increases, the director of the hotel Omnia, Erik Sporysch, led.
In the meantime, the Giant Mountains hotel owners are waiting for a larger snowfall.
On Thursday it should cool down and if there is rainfall, it should be snow on the mountains.
But after that, Jiri Jakubsky informed from the location of the Czech Weather Office in Hradec Kralove.
USA: Repetition is Mother of Wisdom
It is almost comical with which student ambition Barack Obama, the president with his reputation of the smartest, repeated the strategy of his predecessor in the Afghanistan question he himself considered to be the most stupid.
When he finally sweated out his longing-for-anticipated Afghanistan doctrine, it turned out that he wrote it down about the copy paper from the Busch-Irak scenario three years ago.
Not only did he use the phrase "as in Iraq" several times in the text, but he even used the name of the Bush Declaration of January 2007 as the name of his own declaration: "New Forward Path" without tying.
He himself three years ago criticised the Bush idea - sending fresh force quotas in Iraq plagued by the civil war - as "irresponsible and subsequently karastrophic decision".
However, the following months showed that the Bush strategy, based on military recommendations, was the only possible and very successful to the extent that the news about Iraq is no longer available at all today.
Bush's reputation was not improved by this, because objectively he left his successor a much more grateful starting situation than was to be expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle will be repeated.
In order to increase the force quota, the military asked him again, especially the commander of the Afghanistan operation General Stanley McCristal, who, despite the subordination habits, even severely criticized the soothsaying shooters in the White House.
He called on 40,000 soldiers to reverse the situation for the better.
The president hesitated for three months, but has not come up with a better idea, and so he betrayed the general by way of 10,000 soldiers.
From Europe, he has pressed the promise for another 5,000, even if he himself originally calculated at least 10,000.
The most problematic issue in the whole Obama strategy is his plan to withdraw the troops from Afghanistan in 18 months, and to complete this process within three years. The whole Obama doctrine leaves more questions than answers.
Some doubt that the halved increase will have the same effect as the measure in Iraq.
Even in spite of the Brotherly War of recent years, the Iraqi society is relatively well structured, its leaders honor the values.
The Afghan situation is marked by the contraindication - no one can be relied on and no agreements are held.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces who are used to changing their opinion every day.
The political institutions, although formally properly established, remain only shady buildings behind which patriarchal tribal relations will continue to grow.
The balance of interests between the different ethnic groups is unusually complicated, especially because of the intransigence of the conditions that further complicate the Pakistani and Iran influences.
The establishment of a "eligible state", which is the minimalist objective of the entire operation, is also very unrealistic.
Time horizon of the Obama Strategy alienated by its voluntarism
Over the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only deteriorated further and now it is at the edge of the explosion.
In doing so, believe that the little soldiers who have broken into the cry of war about the "early return" can create a miracle here, only a truly romantic soul that cannot be impressed by facts.
From a political point of view, the date set for the withdrawal of troops is simply irresponsible, because the Taliban will take it as the indirect confession of the American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that Europeans' willingness to participate in the fighting in Afghanistan is on the decline.
Europe's politicians cannot and do not want to explain to their voters how Germany's or Italy's security is linked to the war in the Hindu Mountains.
Another possible factor that can radically influence the situation is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the increased sanctions on Iran do not work, the United States will have a very difficult question as to whether the problem should not be solved by troops.
This question needs to be answered during the period when America is moving to Obama for the withdrawal from Afghanistan.
However, any solution will also mean a dramatic reversal of the Afghan situation.
The only consolation for Barack Obama is the fact that three more years remain until the presidential election, and so there is still enough time for him to take on a different strategy, but this would prove to be a total failure.
Bank Goldman Sachs managers no longer receive prize bonuses in cash
The senior executives of the American bank Goldman Sachs will no longer receive prize bonuses in cash this year.
This has been announced by the company, which responds to the strong criticism of its wage practices.
A group of 30 top managers receives shares instead of the money, but it is only allowed to sell in five years.
In addition, the shares may be withdrawn from the managers in the case of excessive risky activities.
Goldman Sachs thus, according to Reuters, is at the forefront of efforts to connect the Wall Street bonus bonuses with long-term performance.
I believe that Wall Street is aware of the further direction in which it has to go, the former banker of JPMorgan, Douglas Elliott, led.
The problem lies in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs made herself the target of criticism after she had set aside almost $17 billion for bonus bonuses for the first three quarters of this year.
According to the Reuters agency, the total amount of premium bonuses during this year is likely to exceed $20 billion despite the measure announced today.
The high premium bonuses in the banking sector have become the hottest political issue at the beginning of the financial crisis in a number of countries.
The UK reported on Wednesday that it intends to charge the bankers' bonuses, which exceed 25,000 pounds, once with a tax of 50 percent.
Similar steps are also being taken by France.
This year, women have won the Nobel Prize in all disciplines, except in physics.
Five record women today in Stockholm have taken over this year's Nobel prizes in the specialized categories and for literature from the king of Sweden Carl XVI.
In addition to the four scientists, among them was the German writer of Romanian descent, Herta Müller.
The Nobel Prize for Medicine has been awarded to two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, together with her compatriot Jack Szostak for research in the chromosome field.
The prize for chemistry was awarded to Israeli Ada Jonah together with the Americans, Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz, for information on the Ribosom structure and function.
The last Laureatin awarded the Nobel Prize for Economics, which the American Elinor Ostrom and her compatriot Oliver Williamson received for analyses of the economic report.
The only subject category in which no woman received a Nobel Prize this year was physics.
Today, scientists Charles Kao have carried this award for research in the fiber optics field and George Smith together with Willard Boyl for the CCD chip invention, which is the basis of all digital cameras, fax machines or astronomical telescopes.
Each of these prizewinners has received the diploma, the Nobel Medals and the certificate of purchase of the money price.
It amounts to ten million Swedish crowns in each category.
If there are several prizewinners in each category, the money price will be divided among them.
Traditionally, the American President, Barak Obama, has already received the most expected Nobel Peace Prize this afternoon in Oslo.
In his speech, he acknowledged the controversy of his appointment because he was only at the beginning of his path, and was also at the top of the country that is waging two wars - in Iraq and in Afghanistan.
In keeping with his policy, however, he added that in certain situations wars are necessary for the struggle for world peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota is considering retiring. Klaus invited him to the castle
President Vaclav Klaus welcomes the finance minister, Eduard Janota, who is thinking about his stay in the government because he does not agree with the implementation of the government budget for the next year in the form that was released by the Assembly on Wednesday.
It is assumed that the budget and perhaps the remaining Janota in the cabinet will be the topics of the Friday meeting.
The budget is also criticised by Klaus.
According to him, the budget deficit is too high, which also deepens the public finances crisis.
The president, Radim Ochvat, informed about the meeting.
On Monday, Janota intends to negotiate his further stay in his function with the Prime Minister, Jan Fischer.
According to the budget law, which now gives Klaus the signature, the Czech Republic should have a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
On Wednesday, however, Parliament voted on the Left-Party proposals for currency conversion and increased the money for government officials' salaries, for the maintenance of social benefits and direct farmers' wages.
The government has opposed the proposals of social democracy that they covertly increase the budget deficit.
Between the Left Party on the one hand and the Government, Klaus and the Legal Party on the other hand, there has been a sharp domestic political dispute, which is why the question mark arises about the further work of the Fischer Office cabinet, on which the Odessa, CSDD and Green Party have agreed in spring.
Critics claim that the budget, as adopted by Parliament, practically liquidates the package of austerity measures implemented by the fishermen's government in the autumn and that, in their understanding, the state debt should end.
Klaus, who is able to sign the law on the state budget, but does not have to, said today at the discussion breakfast with the entrepreneurs that politicians have neglected the "serious problem", which is the "unsustainable deficit" of public finances for a longer period of time.
In his opinion, there is no good solution today.
An improvement could only bring about a strong government that could build on a wider consensus among the political parties.
The ODS chairman, Mirek Topolanek, pointed out that the budget is cruel, and the government should weigh its further existence.
The CEO, Petr Necas, told the CTK that the concept of the Civil Service Cabinet with the support of the CSDD, ODS and the Green Party obviously no longer works.
In the editorial work, Premier Fischer referred to similar words as "strong statements".
The CSDP, Jiri Paroubek, responded to the Topolanek words that the budget deficit was gruesome that the former Topolanek government had prepared for this year, exceeding 200 billion crowns.
As early as Wednesday, the CSD rated the approval of the state budget for the next year as a success.
The People's Party was also satisfied.
Mandela was played in the new film by Clint Eastwood by Morgan Freeman
The South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film "Invictus: The Unbeaten" in the world shows much of the country, whose struggle and victory despite some criticisms that the leading role was occupied by an American actor.
The story tells of sports, racial relationships and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless fighter against the racist apartheid government system in the South African Republic and her first black president, Nelson Mandela, represents the American Oscar actor Morgan Freeman in his life story.
Freeman said he was asked by the ninety-one-year-old Mandela to represent him in the Eastwood movie.
Matt Damon takes on another significant role.
I told him, "If I'm going to play you, I have to meet you.
The seventy-second-year-old actor, who had received the prize for his role in the Eastwood drama from the boxing area "Million Dollar Baby", was already the leader of the movement to abolish slavery, from which has become a slave holder, a fictional US president, and also God in "Evan Almighty", but rarely anyone who still lives and is as important to many people as Mandela.
The former South African statesman was imprisoned for 27 years for his active activity at the end of apartheid in the South African Republic.
He was set free in 1990 and became President of the country for four years.
In 1993, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
"Invictus" is the Latin word for "unbeatable", and at the same time it is the name of a poem by the English author William Ernest Henley, which was published in 1875.
The demand was how to speak
The film describes a true event in which Nelson Mandela joined forces with the captain of the South African Rugbyteam, Francois Pienaar, in order to agree the country. The new President Mandela knows that his people remain racially and economically divided even after apartheid.
He believes that he can unite his people through the sport, so he decides to agree on the rugby players who belong to the outsiders worldwide.
Finally, the South African team rises to the 1995 World Cup.
Freeman worked for several years to bring the Mandela story to the cinema wall.
He had no other purpose than to play this role in order to approach it as closely as possible to reality, Freeman said.
The biggest challenge was of course to speak as he did.
The actor said if he and the world politician were in the same country, he would try to meet Mandela, have dinner with him and be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing for him was to shake Mandela's hand.
I found when I shook your hand, I took over your energy, she was going to transfer, and I felt that I knew what you were feeling, he said.
For me, it's important to be a different person.
Matt Damon portrays in the film François Pienaar, captain of the national Rugbyteam, in which the white players were considered.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for the role in the hard rugby world.
It was a great surprise to him when he first met Pienaar in his house.
I remember when I rang the doorbell that he opened, and the first thing I said to François Pienaar in my life was, 'I look a lot bigger in the movie'.
Despite the obvious differences in the status of the actors compared to their actual role models, he received positive reviews under the direction of director Eastwood "Invictus: Unbeaten" and one also speaks of prospects for an Oscar.
The film critic of the newspaper Daily Variety, Todd McCarthy, summed up his analysis in the following words: "That was very good history, very well executed film."
In the film reviews on the web pages rottentomatoes.com, Invictus has received 76 percent positive evaluations.
Secret of Light on Norway Dissolved: The Russians Tested a Rocket
A special light effect of unknown origin was observed over Norway.
The Russian Ministry of Defence only admitted yesterday that an intercontinental ballistic missile was being tested near the Norwegian border.
However, the launch was not successful again and the rocket called the Bulva type, which was originally supposed to be the pride of the Russian army, will slowly become the nightmare of Russian generality as well as the Premier, Vladimir Putin.
His repeated presence on site at the rocket test also had no positive effect on the success of the test flights.
Bulava has usually not been started or damaged in the air.
The Russian newspapers already write about "Bulava" as about a "missile that doesn't fly".
A rocket that doesn't fly, but lights
This already 13th attempt, at the beginning, went normal.
Only at the end of the flight did technical damage to the rocket occur.
The engine probably exploded in the third rocket stage.
This time "Bulava" started from the nuclear submarine Dmitrij Donskij, which drove under the waters of the White Sea.
This rocket type allows the launch from the submarine.
Therefore, it is likely that the mysterious light over the northern roads caused by an indefinite flying object was indeed the damaged "Bulava".
Moreover, the Norwegians have not doubted since the first moment that it is a Russian rocket.
Generality has this time held back and claimed that one cannot clearly speak of failure.
The first two stages of the rocket did not fall out and the accident only affected the third stage.
In the previous cases, the engines were damaged in the first stage.
Even if there was no test start without errors, the head of the Ministry of Defence considers only six out of thirteen unsuccessful.
The almost fifty percent success therefore meets the generality with optimism and thus continues to claim that the "Bulava" will once fly without problems and will even carry up to ten hypersonic atomheads with a total weight of up to 1.15 tons.
The legendary Fetisov signed an annual contract with CSKA Moscow at age 51
The legendary defender Vjaceslav Fetisov introduces himself in a professional ice hockey game at age 51.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and Stanley Cup holder helps his team CSKA Moscow out in distress, and is probably already in charge of the Friday duel KHL against Petersburg.
Fetisov, who has completed his career at the age of forty, in 1998, is currently president of the CSKA.
After Denis Kuljas was injured, we urgently need another defender.
Fetisov has regularly trained and agreed to support the team.
We just need to clarify some other formalities, the agency AP quoted the coach of the Moscow club of Sergei Nemcinov.
Meanwhile, it is not clear whether the comeback of the famous ice hockey player will only affect one game.
I mean that Fetisov is one of those who can raise the morals of other players, co-player Nemcinov showed up.
When Fetisov returns to the ice area, he will become the oldest professional ice hockey game in Russia after AP.
In the NHL, the legendary stormer Gordie Howe played a whole season for Hartford with fifty-one years and was able to credit 15 hits and 26 assistants.
The oldest of the famous five, Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful ice hockey players in history.
In the Soviet Union's dress, he won two Olympic gold medals, seven world championship titles, and also won the Canada Cup and the Junior World Championship.
In the second part of his career, he also collected successes in the NHL, where he twice raised the Stanley Cup over his head in the Detroit Dress.
He has been a member of the Hockey Star Room since 2001.
Hyundai gave up the trade unions. All overtime hours are abolished
The management of the Nosovice Automobile Factory Hyundai agreed with the union on the abolition of all overtime.
Because of frequent overtime, the union announced its willingness to strike on Monday.
This was confirmed by the spokesperson of the Hyundai Automobile Factory, Petr Vanek.
However, the management wants to agree with the trade unions on a Saturday shift this week.
We must not give up our production plan, which is a principle, which is why voluntary overtime was proposed on Saturday, December 19, because two shifts would be worked, said Vanek.
The Sedmicka.cz website wrote that the company has offered a bonus of 400 CZK to employees who would work on the Saturday shift.
The employees will also receive this in retrospect for the Saturday shift of 28 November.
According to Vanek, the company has decided to change the motivation of employees for the proposed overtime.
Either they can pay the overtime supplement or they can take a spare holiday on December 28 and thus extend the Christmas holidays, Vanek stated.
In addition, all employees of the Saturday shift will be paid the fare and lunch.
Taking into account that the overtime was the most urgent and burning point with regard to the demands and complaints of the trade unionists who stopped production last week, the management decided yesterday afternoon with immediate effect on the abolition of all overtime for the month of December, Vaněk stated.
The employees of the automobile factory had been forced to work almost every day after the eight-hour shift for 2 more hours.
From the signing of the agreement, the willingness to strike will be revoked by the trade unions.
Further negotiations between the management of the automobile factory and the trade unions will take place on Friday afternoon.
The trade union leader, Petr Kuchar, said on Wednesday that if they can agree to meet the demands and sign a joint document, they are willing to cancel the strike.
Last week, on Wednesday, the situation in the automobile factory intensified when about 400 employees spontaneously took off due to constant overtime.
They also protested against the poor payment conditions and alleged harassment.
The management opposed that the employees had to do overtime to meet the automotive delivery needs.
In their Monday strike call, trade unionists also called for no sanctions to be imposed on employees who had interrupted production last Wednesday.
In the area of overtime, trade unions are calling for a minimum reduction in overtime work.
In addition, they are demanding the payment of 5000 crowns this year.
The Nosovice Automobile Factory Hyundai now employs 2,000 people.
Serial production started in the company last November.
Until this September, about 80,000 vehicles were manufactured here, the current production capacity is 200,000 vehicles per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that also works in ́steeled ́ HIV viruses
The team of Czech and German scientists is testing new compounds to stop the spread of HIV viruses in the organism.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also works with viruses that are already resistant to drugs.
This fact outweighs the disadvantage that the compound does not act as strongly on common virus variants as one of the existing medicines.
The disease of AIDS cannot yet be cured.
However, patients can prolong the drug collection and prevent the proliferation of HIV viruses in the body.
However, your intake is accompanied by a whole series of side effects.
In addition, incomplete suppression of viral reproduction results in the development of so-called resistant viruses, which are no longer active.
The work of the experts of three institutes of the Academy of Sciences CR, VSCHT (Chemical-Technological University) Prague and the University of Heidelberg opens the way to deal with virus resistance.
They have demonstrated that the substances referred to as metalocarborane act on the protein substance responsible for the multiplication of the HIV virus.
Metalocarboranes are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block virus reproduction by other means than all medicines used today, so they can overcome the resistance problem.
In their work, the scientists are able to find new 'improved' compounds, which were prepared for the virus protein based on the knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding.
The metalocarboranes have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multifaceted cages, which consist of boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms and are coupled by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
Homegrown and persistent virus
HIV protease is a protein substance of the HIV virus that is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without the HIV virus division caused by HIV protease, no mature infectious virus particles would occur.
If we switch off HIV protease, we also disable the multiplication of the virus in the patient's body, the researchers explain in the press report, published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences CR.
In the work published in the Journal of Medical Chemistry, the scientists describe whole series of connections in which two pairs of cages (see table) are coupled by a short organic chain, which is then systematically further modified.
A little weaker, but more reliable
The impact of this series of substances against HIV protease was tested in the test tube, also against its persistent (resistant) variants obtained from HIV-infected patients.
The effect of metalocarborane on the usual enzyme variant is not as strong as that of the clinically used medicines, but it does not lose its effect on the resistant variants against which the medicines used are often ineffective.
The unique mechanism of action as well as its other properties, such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of further chemical designs, make the metalocarboranes interesting compounds for further research aimed at the development of effective anti-HIV medicinal products, says Pavlina Rezacova, Head of the Laboratory for Structural Biology of the Institute for Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute for Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
Dispute over budget. Odds started on fishermen, he fights
The Chairman of the ODS, Mirek Topolanek, called the approved budget for the next year "grayful" and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should, in his opinion, consider their further existence.
The President of the Minister for Foreign Affairs referred to the statement of the ODS as "strong statements".
It's supposed to be time for the analysis.
The Deputy Chairman of ODS, Petr Necas, said that the concept of the Civil Service Cabinet with the support of the CSDD, ODS and the Green Party obviously no longer works.
According to Necas, the Prime Minister has to decide whether he intends to rely on the minority in Parliament when it comes to the fight against the increasing deficit or whether he is going to stay in office with the help of the left-wing parliament.
Dealing with the problems of public deficits is diametrically different, as Necas pointed out.
On Wednesday, Parliament adopted the budget for 2010, albeit with link party amendments over 12 billion crowns.
Parliament has increased the money for civil servants' salaries, for the maintenance of social benefits and for direct payments to farmers.
In doing so, the government has opposed the proposals of social democracy that they covertly increase the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should have a deficit of 163 billion kronor.
The ODS has left the Chamber before the vote, so it has complied with the government's wish, because the amended budget is also only a less poor variant of the budget's provision.
Disappointment and Insensibility
The finance minister, Eduard Janota, spoke about his disappointment and a sense of senselessness, whereas Prime Minister Jan Fischer argued that the government still assesses the current situation.
Necas is convinced that if Janota had seriously threatened to withdraw in the event that the amendments would be accepted, the situation would look different.
According to Czech television, Janota signed up to the Prime Minister for Monday after the government business.
In doing so, he indicated that he was considering his further stay in office.
The reason for this is his disappointment at the budgetary allocation.
According to Necas, the nominees of Social Democracy (CSSD) who had enforced the changes in the budget have nothing to do with the government to what extent fishermen are in favour of the further struggle with the budget deficit.
The Prime Minister should also say clearly that he will resign if Parliament continues to adopt deficit-enhancing laws, such as those relating to sickness and pensions or the Staff Regulations.
Topolanek: Ministers nominated by ODS were not mistaken
This is the case of the Prime Minister Fischer and the whole government.
The ministers nominated by the ODS did not make any mistakes, pointed out Topolanek in a text message from the USA.
It has mentioned that in some ministries, people are in deputy function who confess to TOP 09 who voted against the budget.
Necas stressed that if fishermen decide to refrain from the fight against the deficit height of public finances, "it is perfectly logical and correct that they rely on the left majority, which is currently in Parliament".
Then he allegedly cannot count on the support and tolerance of the citizens' democrats.
I have not thought about it, and if this is going to be the case, then I will deal with it, the Minister of Defence Martin Bartak, nominated by the citizens' democrats, said to the journalists in Parliament.
In the afternoon, Prime Minister Fischer flew to the Brussels European Council.
The ODS resigned at the Prime Minister's request
At the same time, Necas stressed that on Wednesday, the ODS would probably vote against the amended budget in Parliament if the Prime Minister expressly asked the MEPs of the Citizen's Democrats to allow them to adopt the budget.
We do not appear to be orphans, we are not small children, so he responded to the question whether, in the political debate on the budget, the President of the Party was absent in Parliament and in the Czech Republic.
I didn't realize my voice was going to be missing.
Even when I gave up my mandate, I knew that in the next few months it would be all about the Bolshevikization of Parliament and destruction, Topolanek himself responded.
According to the new timetable of the CD (Czech Railway), fewer trains will travel for approximately the same fare.
The Czech railways will end or limit some less used fast and local trains from 13 December, while other links will be reinforced.
The total traffic volume will be reduced by two percent from the date of validity of the new timetable compared to today.
Most tariffs incl. basic and customer fare will not be changed.
Several connections to the capital receive, for example, residents of the Ostrava area, the railway uses trains of the Pendolino type for this route.
The fast train will no longer go to Bratislava (Pressburg).
Less fast trains will also drive on the Prague - Pisek - Budweis route, in principle the direct connections from Prague to Letohrad will be reduced.
The biggest reduction is planned for the railway in the district of Hradec Kralove (Königsgraz), a total of eight percent, while Prague and its surroundings can look forward to an increase.
Two night trains are also cancelled on the Prague - Tabor - Budweis route and on a few days a week the operation of some fast trains on the Prague - Pisek - Budweis route is reduced.
One of the biggest changes is the introduction of the new direct transport route from Milovice to Prague, and the people of Milovice to Lysa nad Labem have to change at the moment.
It is the fifteenth route of the Esko suburban transport system, which is open thanks to the railway electrification from Lysa nad Labem to Milovice.
The long-distance routes to the capital will end at the destination station Prague - Hauptbahnhof.
The CD introduces more lines SC Pendolino between Prague and Ostrava and the trains to Sumperk/Jesenik will drive for two hours.
With the Pendolino, passengers have been unable to travel to Bratislava since 13 December.
This year's regional railway bill: an increase of 200 million
The rapid trains are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport, overall the railway receives four billion crowns for the so-called loss of liquidity in the next year,just like this year. The local trains provide the districts, overall they pay eight billion crowns for this next year, with the state shooting three billion.
This year, the regional trains cost 200 million Czech crowns.
For the local trains and the high-speed trains, the railway has re-established a ten-year contract, until now the contract has always been concluded for only one year.
The rail system praises the system, perhaps because it has not been used to increase the price of the large majority of tickets.
Changes can only be made in the case of one-day network tickets CD Net and in the case of low-cost Internet tickets eLiska.
For passengers without the customer card, the CD Net price is increased from 450 crowns to 600 crowns.
The eLiska price will then depend on the run-off, until now he was uniform for the journey between any district cities and cost 160 crowns.
Philippines Millitante arrests more than 50 people, the children were released.
Today, Millitante kidnapped 75 people in the south of the Philippines, including some elementary schoolchildren and their teachers.
This led the agency AFP, which initially informed only over 65 abducted.
All 17 children detained were released after eight hours, including one teacher.
It was abducted in the province of Agusan del Sur.
About 19 millionaires reportedly used the hostages as a living shield when fleeing the police.
The local negotiators are now endeavouring to release the remaining hostages.
According to the agency AFP, the militants belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is the Arms Group of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to AP, the police persecuted the kidnappers for the violence that claimed revenge between the two local families.
In the south of the Philippines, in the province of Maguindanao, there was a recent massacre in which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the November 23 massacre associated with the election to the Governor's Office were 30 journalists.
Because of suspicion of participation in the massacre, the governor of this southern Philippine province and his father Andal Ampatuan, Patriarch of the influential Ampatuan clan, were arrested.
Muslim separatists are also active on the island of Mindanao.
But those who resumed the peace negotiations with the Philippine Government on Tuesday.
The history of South Africa affects everyone, says Morgan Freeman a.k.a. Nelson Mandela
In the next few days, the new Hollywood film Clint Eastwoods will come to the American cinemas "Invictus: the Unbeaten", which includes part of the life story of the former president of the Republic of South Africa, Nelsona Mandela.
The role of the world-famous fighter against apartheid has been given to Morgan Freeman, who had already been chosen by Mandela himself a few years ago.
The role of the legendary South African champion in Rugby, Francois Pienaar, has been awarded to Matt Damon.
With the film's cinema start, the reactions of critics as well as the public are also loud.
Nelson Mandela
He is named Nelson Rolihlah Mandela, born on 18 July 1918 in South African Mvez.
In 1988 he received the Sakhar Prize and in 1993 together with de Klerk the Nobel Peace Prize.
He was elected President of the Republic of South Africa in 1994-1999.
Great expectations are placed in the film because it comes to the cinemas at a time when the preparations for the World Cup are culminating in South Africa on the one hand, but at the same time the media are shaking the world public with frightening news of the rising hatred of race and the discrimination of the inhabitants by the black ruling majority.
According to the news agency AP, the reactions to the new film in South Africa are consistently positive for the time being, despite numerous reservations about occupying the leading roles with American Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman is still proud of his own words on the new film.
I have spent many years in this role and have prepared well for it.
Several times I also met Nelson Mandela personally, so that, as they say, I could receive his energy, he performed in the interview after the premiere of the film in Los Angeles.
I think it's good if we can remember Mandelas' personality and his message with this film.
This is a history of South Africa, but it affects everyone, he added.
In the dress of the Rugby National Team
The film is based on the British writer John Carlin's book, freely translated "In the Role of the Enemy": Nelson Mandela and the game that has united the people portray the South African defender of human rights within his first presidential term.
In the course of the film, Morgan Freeman strives to bring together two racial groups, separated from each other for years and days, and, like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he also plays his role in the South African National Rugby Dress on the World Cup field, which then won South Africa.
For entering the lawn in the dress, which is almost like a sacred act in South Africa, Mandela reaped great ovations, mostly from the white audience fourteen years ago and thus gained recognition of the white population.
The Rugby Championship may have achieved the goal of reuniting the people into a single people, led Chester Williams, the rugby player, who was the only "black" on the national team in 1995.
Whether the tense situation in South Africa improves will only show up.
But the white South Africans are skeptical, as for example in recent interview with LN of the Rugby fan, Christopher Dawson, who fled the country to Britain.
The championship starts on June 11, 2010.
In the Louny area, transformers burn for several 10 million crowns
The fire broke out in the morning at the transformer of the company Ceps in the switching plant at the municipality of Vyskov in the Louny area.
At the fire, according to the spokesman of the Usti nad Labem District Fire Department, Lukas Marvan, six units intervened.
Originally, the fire department wanted to burn out the transformers, but later it changed its view and now the fire is wiped out with a mixture of water - foam and special extinguishing agents.
The cause was a technical defect, a transformer short circuit.
No one was injured, according to the company spokesperson, Pavla Mandatova, the safety operation of the management system was not compromised.
The damage was estimated at several 10 million crowns, and the damage will only be calculated after the fire.
According to Mandatova, the destroyed transformer must be replaced by a new one.
For more than 10 years, nothing similar has happened in the company of Ceps, mistakes of this kind are rare, she added.
The power supply was not interrupted, according to the spokesperson of the company CEZ for northern Bohemia, Sona Holingerova, by the fire of the traffic station, the functioning of households, authorities and companies was not affected.
A.G. Ceps operates in the Czech territory as a sole operator of the line system, the electrical lines of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains, refurbishes and develops 39 switchgear with 67 transformers, which transmits the electrical energy into distribution system and line line with a length of 4339 kilometres.
Jancura filed criminal charges for slander against three leaders of the CSDD.
The owner of the Student Agency, Radim Jancura, today raises criminal charges for slandering three social-democratic leaders.
Against Michal Hasek from the district of South Moravia, Radko Martinek from the district of Pardubice and the head of the district of Olomouc, Martin Tesarik.
Jancura said this in a twenty-minute inteview in the radio journal.
The complaint is linked to the company's efforts to operate regional train services in some districts.
However, all regions have finally signed the long-term contracts with the Czech railways.
All three leaders attack us and say that we are taking out the raisins, in which we have only submitted the offer above the scope, as it was agreed with them.
They claim that we are more expensive than the Czech railways because we would know the prices of the Czech railways that were completed last week.
So there's nothing left of us but to fight us.
Because of this slander of the Student Agency Society, Jancura told the radio journal.
At the same time, he argued that he has evidence from all districts that they have taken their steps in accordance with European law.
That is why we are preparing an accusation against the European Commission.
Hasek considers the collection of the criminal charges for the further continuation of the Jancura Media Show, which serves him as free publicity for his company and for his own person.
Of course, I am ready to defend my good name as well as the good reputation of my district, and I also ask for more leaders.
I assume that on this issue too it will become clear that it is Jancura who manipulates the public in the matter of regional rail transport and uses lying and false arguments, said Hasek.
Jancura reported last week that he had invested several million crowns in advertising, which will point to the adverse step of the districts.
He told the radio report that he was interrupting the campaign after Christmas, and that he wanted to continue it after New Year's.
He specified that he would run the campaign against corruption as such.
The campaign launched Jancura after the districts had agreed to operate regional rail transport with the Czech railway system and had not tendered for the contract in a high of 150 billion kroner.
According to Vancura, such conduct is unlawful and contrary to the requirements of the European Court of Justice.
According to Jancura, he was also threatened by a member of the CSDD because of criticism of train traffic in the districts.
The only threat was if we do not refrain from losing our bus licenses.
He introduced himself as a member of the CSDD, I know who it is, I don't say his name, today Jancura told the radio journal.
Vaccination against pneumococci free and voluntary
Inflation against pneumococci changes the habit from January.
It should be the first free and voluntary for families.
But even now there are voices reporting that compulsory vaccination would be more effective.
The preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against pneumococci culminate.
The Institute of Medicine already determines the maximum prices of vaccines that health insurance must pay.
The experts are also aware of the vaccination procedure.
New vaccination
Vaccines free of charge for August children
From January, children can be vaccinated free of charge against pneumococci, which were born on 2 August last year and later.
The condition is that they have not received a dose of vaccine.
Those who have already started vaccination last year or earlier must also pay for further re-vaccination themselves.
The first dose must be given between the 3rd and 5th month of life of the child.
Last year, a quarter of the families had their children vaccinated against pneumococci.
The parents paid 1600 crowns and more for one dose.
Four doses are required for the vaccination of the youngest children.
Overall, the experts estimate that health insurance for the vaccine cans spend 300,000 to 450,000 crowns per year.
However, they save on the treatment the children would need without vaccination.
So far, the state has spent about 500,000 per year on all children's area vaccinations.
The compulsory vaccination was introduced with the so-called janota package.
Pneumococci cause middle ear inflammation, but also severe infections including meningitis and blood poisoning.
Pneumococcal infections kill us after examination in hospitals per year up to 28 children aged up to 10 years.
Outside the Czech Republic, the compulsory vaccination of children against pneumococci was introduced in about 40 countries.
Will the vaccination be mandatory?
At the same time, it is said that this vaccination could be mandatory in the future.
As of January, this is to be paid by the insurance companies and be voluntary.
That compulsory vaccination would be better, mentioned, for example, the head of the Nahlas Association of Citizens, Rudolf Kalovsky.
His association is already promoting long-term pneumococcal vaccination.
The experts at the international conference where our association was involved were not very satisfied with the fact that we have voluntary vaccination.
That's not quite ideal.
On the other hand, we are glad that we have succeeded in enforcing at least that.
I think that's the way we have to go now, led Kalovsky.
However, the Ministry of Health does not want to change the vaccination procedure against pneumococci.
At this moment we do not consider this at all, said his speaker Vlastimil Sesen.
Voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks, the doctors claim.
The chairman of the specialist company of practical pediatricians, Hana Cabrochova, admits that voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks.
If all children were vaccinated, we could think about reducing the number of repeat vaccinations "In a situation where the vaccine is so expensive, we understand the political decision that this vaccination was started as a voluntary vaccination," says Cabrochova.
Experts expect more than 80 percent of parents to have their infants vaccinated against pneumococci from next year.
Vaccination against pneumococci is also groundbreaking in the fact that it is the first area vaccination paid by health insurance companies and not by the state.
The insurance companies should spend the money for prevention so that they save for further treatment, Cabrnokova said.
The doctors have to buy the vaccines themselves.
This, however, is a concern of the practical pediatricians concerned with the purchase of vaccines.
According to the original project, the vaccines should be purchased by insurance companies and the doctors should then obtain them on the same route as other vaccines issued by the State to them.
Some Members, however, feared that the insurance companies could "export the money from health insurance".
Therefore, the doctors will have to buy the vaccines themselves and wait until the insurance companies pay them.
According to estimates, the individual practical doctors will have to invest 40,000 crowns per month, which is a significant sum.
This won't be easy, says Cabrnochova.
U.S. artist son involved in museum theft
The son of the famous American fantasy artist Frank Frazetta was accused of trying to steal paintings worth 20 million dollars from his father's museum.
According to the Pennsylvania police, Alfonso Frank Frazetta was taken to his vehicle with a trailer at the invitation of 90 paintings.
It says that Frank Frazetta Junior and another man would have used a excavator to get into the museum in the Pocono Mountains.
The 81-year-old Frank Frazetta Senior is famous for his depiction of figures such as Conan the Barbar and Tarzan.
As reported by the news agency Associated Press, the artist stayed in Florida at the time of the incident.
AP quoted an anonymous police officer who said that Frank Frazetta Junior might have been motivated by a family feud.
The agency reported that according to a police official statement, Frazetta Junior claimed that he was instructed by his father "that he should enter the museum by all means to bring all paintings into a camp".
The agency announced that Frank Frazetta Senior argued that he had granted any permission.
Labour defends budget and tax increases
Ministers defended the tax increases and expenditure stops announced in the preliminary report against the criticism of the opposition, the economy and the trade unions.
The conservatives said that Alistair Darling had "done" an opportunity to show that he meant it seriously with the reduction of the deficit by pushing the decisions forward until after the election.
The treasurer was also shot at targeting workers with low and medium incomes.
Its main proposals include a 0.5% increase in social security and a 1% cut-off in public pay for 2011.
Social security insurers
Trade unions have protested that low-wage beneficiaries are being penalised for a recession that they have not caused and warned of forthcoming "problems".
The increase in social security - to about 3 billion pounds a year - has upset the private sector, which says that this is a tax on jobs, although the focus should be on economic recovery.
The increase, which is limited to those who earn more than £20,000 a year, will affect about 10 million workers.
OVERVIEW OF THE PRELIMINARY STATUS REPORT
Increase in social security by another 0.5% from April 2011
This year, the economy is shrinking by more than the expected 4.75%
New 50% tax on bankers bonuses
1 percent increase in corporation tax for small enterprises rejected
Tax reductions for electric vehicles and wind turbines
Increase of government pensions by 2.5%
According to the Treasury estimates, someone with an annual income of £30,000 will be poorer by £90 per year and someone with £40,000 per year will be £190 poorer, while a person with £10,000 annual income by £110 will be richer.
Ministers said that their target of the deficit half-life by 2013 means "difficult decisions", but they also said that 60% of the additional taxes would be borne by the 5 % of the top earners.
Finance Minister Stephen Timms argued that the projected tax increases and expenditure stops would be "a drop on the hot stone" compared to the necessary measures.
"These are large numbers. They will bring us the deficit half-way and this is also absolutely necessary over the next four years," he told the BBC.
Timms said he was confident that the economy would return to growth by the end of the year.
Predictions of the Labour Party on future economic growth – which affects the extent of re-indebtedness and the speed of deficit settlement – were questioned after the Chancellor was forced to revise earlier figures.
He said in his opinion that the economy is likely to shrink by 4.75% this year - much more than the 3.5% decrease predicted in April - while the debt of £3 billion would be higher than predicted earlier.
Missed opportunity
The conservatives, who want to launch a new advertising campaign on Thursday to warn of the Labour "debt crisis", said that the planned indebtedness of 789 billion pounds over the next six years is unsustainable.
They added that the ministers failed to present a credible plan on how they will repay it and press "cynical" before difficult decisions until after the election - which must take place by June 2010 at the latest.
"You have said nothing important about what they will do," said shadow finance minister Philip Hammond. "They had an opportunity to do this, and they let them pass."
"The important announcements will only be made after the election, whoever wins them."
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour insists that schools, hospitals and the police are preserved from future cuts, unlike in the conservative proposals, which see the deficit reduction coming faster and more quickly.
But the Liberal Democrats said that the money won by tax increases and spending stops is being used to cover expenditure for the next year, not to reduce the deficit, and therefore argue that the plans were "built on sand".
The BBC's political editor, Nick Robinson, said that at the time of the announcements, like the above-mentioned inflation adjustment in some invalidity pensions in the next April, the treasurer would expose the treasurer to the charge of taking the vote, as the money could simply be recovered next year.
Labour insists on providing the extra assistance if people need it most and that the situation be reviewed in September 2010.
Holler Etat
Although the Ministers have not announced any budget details beyond 2011, economists say that the pressure on public spending will only be felt in the medium term.
The recognised Institute for Tax Investigations said that the figures of the Chancellor would mean strong cuts in many areas, possibly in the future also in the areas of transport, higher education, science and defence.
"It only shifts the pain to later," said his director Robert Chote.
"The important announcements will only be made after the election, whoever wins it," added Roger Bootle, Economics Consultant at Deloitte.
"This was just the hollow preliminary food report. Markets recognize this."
The FBI investigates "Meetings of US Citizens in Pakistan"
The FBI is investigating the arrest of five reported U.S. citizens because of the suspicion of extremist links in Pakistan.
The men were arrested in a raid on a house in Sarghoda, in the eastern Panjab province, the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan announced to the BBC.
The FBI said it's being investigated whether these are the same men who were reported missing last month in the U.S. state of Virginia.
The U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that they are also looking for information about the men.
Three of them are supposed to be Pakistani descent, one is Egyptian origin and the other has a Yemeni background.
"If they are American citizens, of course, we are very interested in the charges they are being accused of and under what circumstances they are being detained," said Ian Kelly.
The FBI spokesperson Katherine Schweit said that the authority was informed about the arrests and was associated with the families of the missing students.
"We work with the Pakistani authorities to find out their identities and the purpose of their stay there if they are actually the missing students," she said.
The Pakistani Embassy in Washington reported that the men were arrested in a house that belonged to the uncle of one of the students.
He said that the local police had already been interested in the house before and that no charges had been filed against the arrested men.
Reuters reported that Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton refused to comment on the arrests, but she said that the US must "be closer to working with Afghanistan and Pakistan to eradicate the infrastructure of terrorism, which continues to recruit and train people".
The five students were reported missing by your families in northern Virginia at the end of November.
Amnesty condemns "misuse" in Iran
According to a report by the human rights organisation Amnesty International, the human rights situation in Iran is still as bad as it has been in the past 20 years.
The report details "misuse patterns" by the regime, both before and after the contested presidential elections in June.
A man quoted in the report stated that he was beaten and burned with cigarettes. Another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran rejected previous criticism of its human rights balance.
Official offices said that such criticism was politically motivated.
After the contested election of President Mahmud Ahmadinejad, thousands of people were arrested in Iran and dozens were killed, leading to the biggest street protests since the Islamic Revolution of 1979.
Dozens of people were sentenced to imprisonment and prosecutors said that at least five people were sentenced to death.
The BBC-Tehran correspondent Jon Leyne, now in London, said that at the beginning of the protests the highest leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, recognized some of the abuse claims and ordered the closure of the Kahrizak Penitentiary.
But since then there has been no tolerance for criticism on the part of the authorities, said our correspondent.
"False Confession"
Amnesty International quoted the report of 26-year-old computer science student Ebrahim Mehtari, who said that he was accused of "working with Facebook networks" and of protesting the election results.
"They hit me in the face more often," he was quoted.
"I was burned with cigarettes under my eyes, in my neck, on my head. They threatened me with death and they humiliated me."
After five days he signed a false confession and, still bleeding and half unconscious, was released on the street, Amnesty announced.
The beaten presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi said that some demonstrators arrested after the election were tortured to death in prison in August and others raped.
The Iranian authorities denied the rape charges, but admitted that abuses took place.
Amnesty also mentioned the case of a former prisoner who said that he had been detained in a container in a prison in Kahrizak with 75 others for more than eight weeks.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian Parliament and the judicial authorities had set up a committee to investigate the unrest after the election and the government's reactions to it, but Amnesty, the mandates and the power of these institutions would have been unclear and the results obtained by the parliamentary committees had not been published.
The group said that in the last three weeks at least 90 people have been arrested to prevent further demonstrations.
Skihang was set up in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow were used to turn a landmark in Bristol into a competitive pist.
The ski slopes of this park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders who fought for money prices.
On the top of the slope in the Brandon Hill Park there was a short jump chance at the beginning of a 100 meter long slope.
The student John Hickman, who is studying medicine in the fourth year, said there was a beautiful view from the summit of the slope, but it was also quite intimidating.
It is a great view with all the lights of the city that glitter below.
He added: "There are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the country here - some real talents."
Prizes were awarded for the best works of art or tricks performed on the slope.
After the event on Thursday evening, the snow is left to melt.
Still her and us
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters voted in favour of a construction ban for minarette and the concern about the alleged Islamization of Europe has spread, John Bowen, an American academic, has written a well-founded and well-considered report on whether Muslims can be integrated into one of the most declaredly secularized societies in Europe — and integrated.
Some readers will read this new book out of admiration for the author's last work: "Why the French don't love headscarves" (original title: "Why the French don't like headscarves") (2006), an elegant and intimately argumentative study of a dispute that divided the country over a period of a decade and occupied it and its effects are still perceptible today.
Bowen's latest book offers a more comprehensive and bolder spectrum.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and the media say about Islam in France, but what really happens in this area.
He has spent months in mosques, schools and institutes that now offer the 5 to 6 million Muslims in France, as Bowen calls it "Islamic Freedoms".
He is a good listener, he reflects debates between teachers and students on the questions they most worry about.
Should a Muslim marry (or both) in a mosque or a town hall?
Should young Muslims be taught about evolution and the rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it permissible for a Muslim to use a interest-rate banking system to obtain a mortgage?
It is these seemingly profane matters, he claims, which make up daily life, quite unlike the political dramas that the media employ.
The author recognizes a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, none of them with a well-known name, possibly with the exception of Tarik Ramadan, an Arab-Muslim scholar and academic born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how it is possible to be a good Muslim on the one hand and a good citizen in a modern secular society on the other.
You don't have all the arguments on your side.
Conservatives are suspicious of the idea of French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists who questioned Bowen are mostly dissenting from their Salafi counterparts – supporters of purist Sunni Islam, which is linked to Saudi Arabia – who today show a small but influential presence among European Muslims.
Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But a convention requires giving and taking on both sides.
He questions to what extent French political decision-makers (and the intellectual elite, who so passionately guard the separation of church and state) really feel obliged to pluralism.
He suggests that Muslims may have experienced harsher treatment than Catholics, Protestants and Jews who, in turn, had to make their historical compromise with secular republicanism.
He recognizes a "enhancement of the value screws" rather than a growing pragmatism.
Can Islam be French? After reading this book one tends to say "Yes, but not yet".
The Most Dismal Outlook of the World
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other environmental region on earth.
The ice it marks melts at alarming speed and takes life with it, which nowhere else can survive.
Oil, gas, shipping and fishing interests have entered the recently open water, with diplomats, lawyers and now also authors in their wake water.
Richard Ellis, an author and illustrator, draws in "On thin ice" (original title: "On Thin Ice") a natural history of the icon of the north, the polar bear.
Moved in the complicated history and politics of whaling, he describes the long tradition of Arctic scientists who have proved themselves in hunting polar bears.
Admiral Nelson's encounter with an polar bear as a brave 14-year-old enemy to the lake, who only fought with the rifle piston of his Muskete, is certainly a legend, but others are true.
Young bears caught swimming behind the bodies of their recently killed mothers were taken to zoos and circuses.
A circus performance at the beginning of the 20th century showed 75 polar bears at a performance.
Even today zoos still typically have a millionths of the life of a wild old animal. The climate is rarely suitable: the polar bear in Singapore became very green by the algae that grow in the hollow hair of its fur.

Ellis refers to the reports of other authors and historians and often returns to the threat posed by hunters for the survival of the species.
Although prohibited in Norway, America and Russia, laying continues in Greenland and Canada, where hunters in helicopters and motor-sliding Inuit use powerful storm rifles to bring their prey to the track.
Ironically, the ice will remain the longest in the waters in the north of these two hunting nations.
In his new book "After the Ice", Alun Anderson, a former editor of the science magazine "New Scientist", offers a clear and disturbing description of the science of the Arctic and a gripping insight into how the future could develop.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can adequately explain the speed of the changes.
But this is not due to a lack of explanations.
The pioneer irons of Fridtjof Nansen at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century gave the first indication of the twisting of the pack ice.
In the Cold War, submarines measured the moving ridge at the time of the downfall.
A useful addition are satellite surveys and the large area application of measuring probes on icebergs, but still much is achieved by fearless people camping outside in the cold.
Anderson takes a look at the strange, tiny world of the inflow system within the Arctic ice formed by saltwater canals that are pressed together during freezing.
But, starting from the bear on the ice to the microscopic wonders in the ice, all of them are threatened when the summer ice passes, which is expected between 2013 and 2050.
"In a few months ... this could be us"
Marine infantry were among the 6,000 who settled in Arlington Kränze
The chief fried De'Angello Robinson traveled seven hours by bus to lay a single wreath on the tomb of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines, who made the trip of Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, North Carolina, to the National Cemetery in Arlington to decorate graves, the day was a tribute to the men and women in whose footsteps they stepped.
In a few months, from wherever we are returned, we could be, Robinson said about the fallen soldiers.
If we were, I would wish someone would do the same for me, so I try to show my respect.
He was one of over 6,000 volunteers who had gathered on Saturday morning to lay cranes on the tombs of veterans in several sections of the Arlington Peace Court.
Morrill Worcester, owner of Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, founded this tradition in 1992 when he and some others decided to decorate several hundred graves at the cemetery in Arlington.
It is now an 18-year-old tradition and Morrill and his wife Karen, who make this journey every year, stop in various cities along the way to carry out events dedicated to people in the military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit organization, Wreaths Across America, which extended the event to other states.
This year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 cranes on the tombs on the Arlington Peace Court, in areas at the Pentagon, on tombs of the Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, in the Battery Park in New York, and at the memorial site for the United Airlines flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
The Walmart Foundation donated more than $150,000 for the purchase and transport of cranes for the second time.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster said she made the trip to Arlington in memory of her husband, a dead professional soldier.
Although her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said, this is her way of giving back to those who made sacrifices.
She said that this is a small contribution to how we civilians can support our soldiers.
It's like visiting a family graveyard.
Packed in layers of warm clothing, the volunteers wandered across the vast lawns and hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers had older graves from World War I and World War II and the Vietnam War as their goal, as these are not visited as often as the newer graves, the organizers said.
The mood was happy, children played and couples held their hands while carrying the fresh pine branches to the greying tombstones.
Each round wreath was dark green with a small red loop attached to the upper part.
The Section 60, which is nearby and where mainly veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have been buried, remained almost quiet.
The United Service Organizations donated 1,000 cranes to decorate this section, but the gloomy mood of the current wars filled this area.
Individuals cried openly, others prayed and families and friends stuck together in the icy air.
Some read aloud the names carved in stone, while others bowed down to small black-and-white space cards, which had been put into the moist mud for those whose tombstones had not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who forgot bitter tears before her son's tomb.
She was driven 8 hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the Marine Infrastructure Petty Officer David Shane Spicer, who fell in battle in July.
No one should ever forget why we're free... my son paid for it, she said.
"If I haven't been around for a long time, I want someone to remember him."
Contractors of the U.S. Government of Cuban Authorities Arrested
The Cuban government has arrested a US government contractor who sold mobile phones and notebook computers in the country, said representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Saturday.
The contractor, who has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc. based in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for customers, such as USAID, the US authorities for international development and for the World Bank.
Consulates of the US interest representation in Havana are trying to gain access to the prisoner, who was arrested on December 5.
The special charges have not yet been published, although under Cuban law a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor can be arrested for almost everything, under the charge of "risk".
All so-called counterrevolutionary activities, including light protests and critical writings, pose a risk of arrest.
Government-enemy graffiti and statements are considered a serious crime.
Cuba has a growing blogger community, led by popular reporter Yoani Sánchez, who often describes how she and her husband are persecuted and attacked by government representatives.
Sánchez has repeatedly requested permission to leave the country to receive prices, but this has always been rejected.
The arrest of an American contractor will probably increase the tension between the Communist government of the Castro Brother in Cuba and the Obama government, which had sought a "slow" approach to improving relations with the island.
The news of the arrest was first reported Friday night by the New York Times.
The new US policy emphasises that the United States will provide a counter-performance when the Cuban government takes concrete steps in this direction, such as the release of political prisoners and the creation of more space for opposition.
Mobile phones and notebooks are legal in Cuba, although they are new and coveted products in a country where the average salary of a government employee is $15 a month.
The Cuban government has only allowed ordinary citizens to buy a mobile phone since this year, and they are used to send text messages, as a 15-minute phone call would cost a daily fee.
Internet use is extremely restricted on the island.
It is available in expensive hotels and there for foreign visitors and at some government agencies, such as universities.
Cubans who want to sign in often have to report their names to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
In Cuba, the arrest of an American is rare.
Most of the few US citizens who are in prison in Cuba are sitting behind bars for crimes such as drug smuggling, said Gloria Berbena, the press spokesperson of the U.S. interest office in Havana.
Berbena said she couldn't give any further information to arrest.
The arrest and detention are clearly wrong.
An activity that would be legal in any other free society - the delivery of free mobile phones - is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, head of the American section of the Human Rights Watch group, who recently published a hard report on freedom in Cuba entitled "New Castro, the same Cuba", an allusion to Raul Castro's position as leader of the country, who replaced the sick older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said that the accused were very often arrested, sentenced and imprisoned within one day.
He said that probably every solution would be political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, right at the time when both countries are moving towards more dialogue.
Pakistani government representatives plan to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, Pakistani authorities discovered a allegedly leading head of a conspiracy aimed at sending five men from northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill U.S. soldiers, and said that they hope that this case could help uncover an extensive network of terrorists searching the Internet for radicalized young men.
Investigators said that they had been looking for an opaque insurgent, known as Saifullah, who had invited the men to Pakistan after he had found them because one of them had made comments on terrorist attacks on the Internet video page YouTube.
Saifullah became the leader of these men after arriving in Pakistan and tried to help them reach the remote area in Pakistan's tribal belt, which is the home of Al Kaida and his terrorist training camp.
But a representative of Pakistan's secret service who was informed about the matter said on Saturday, Saifullah could not convince the al-Qaeda leaders that the men are not part of a CIA conspiracy to undermine the terrorist network.
As a result, they were detained for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the inhospitable mountains in the northwest, which have become a terrorist refuge.
They were considered part of a hidden operation.
That is why they were rejected, said the government official, who wanted to remain anonymous because of the sensitivity of the matter.
The government official said that the men were by no means discouraged and continued to seek the right recommendations to gain access to the Al-Qaeda camps when they were arrested by the Pakistani Penal Code.
The case of the five men - who are still in Pakistan and are being questioned by the FBI - underlines the crucial role of the applicants in identifying future terrorists and perhaps even more important in deciding who is trustworthy.
Since the September 11, 2001, attacks, U.S. intelligence has made it a matter of the utmost urgency to accommodate human assets within Al-Qaeda.
The applicants of the organization act as porters who do not let in those whose commitment to the Holy War is not serious enough and those who could be spies.
American wanting recruits are subject to a special test by A Kaida, said analysts.
However, due to their potential access to US targets and their propaganda value, they are also considered to be extremely attractive to the group.
Evan Kohlmann, senior analyst of the NEFA Foundation based in the United States, said that in recent years terrorist groups have become much more cautious about who they allow access to, because the US secret services have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you try to involve someone in these groups, what better way could you go than to follow the recruitment model that so many have already followed? said Kohlmann.
The model is now much more based on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of demonstrators demand climate action in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of demonstrators marched through the streets on Saturday and demanded more bold action on climate protection from the negotiators at the Bella Congress Centre in the city.
Demonstrators said that 100,000 people had joined the event, whereas police estimates were more or less 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a handful of masked activists lit small bombers near some government buildings in the city center.
One day, when little happened at the climate negotiations promoted by the UN, thousands of activists with transparent people wandered through the city, where there was "no planet B" in English, and one in Spanish, which said "The Earth says "Enough".
Some stars joined the protest, such as the Danish model, photographer Helena Christensen, who said that the journeys to Peru, her mother's country of birth, make her aware of what heartbreaking problems the country has to contend with due to the already noticeable effects of climate change.
That is part of the reason why I have decided to take part in the big demonstration - in order to pass on the word and appeal to the world leaders to achieve a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
It's not an easy task, but it has to be done now and there is no way to go about it.
The police kept the demonstrators from coming too close to the Bella Center and said they had arrested 19 people, mainly because they were either masked or carrying pocket knives.
According to Danish law, these actions are prohibited in demonstrations.
According to a spectator who did not want to be mentioned because he was involved in the climate negotiations, masked demonstrators in black clothing lit several explosive bodies near the Copenhagen Main Channel, near which there are several ministries.
They threw them near the buildings, he said and added that they started as light rockets, but then followed by "a few major explosions".
Inside the convention center, people gathered in front of television screens to follow the demonstration all afternoon.
But the protest apparently did not reach the awareness of the main officials, such as Su Wie, China's chief climate negotiator.
When asked if he thought that the demonstration would have a constructive effect on international considerations, he replied in English: "This is something I was not aware of at all."
He then went on to Mandarin and said, "Because the venue is big, I can't hear what's happening outside."
He noted that it depended on the individual's perspective whether the demonstration would harm or help.
It shows the concentration of the general public and various sectors on the topic of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "you can also say that they interfere with the negotiations or the freedom of other people".
Test data show stubborn race gap
The certificates of mathematics performance were welcome last week for public schools in Washington, D.C.
Although the district of Washington is still far behind the schools of the country, producing the highest performances, the evidence shows that in the past two years, the four- and eight-klusters have made faster progress than cities that include Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what is included in the latest figures of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) is the persistent performance gap between African-American and white students, both at local and national level.
In the last two years, the average number of white four-clads from Washington D.C. rose from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but their African-American counterparts only rose by three points from 209 to 212.
In reality, the power gap rose from 53 points to 58 points between 2007 and 2009.
The progress of the Afro-American eight-kläsler remained basically the same, he fell around a statistically negligible point from 245 to 244.
The average score of white students was not included in the test data, as the sample size was not large enough.
The picture over a six-year period is also not encouraging.
The gap, which separated white and black four-pieces in 2003, when the first NAEP was recorded in this district, was 60 scale points (262 to 202).
And although the scores that the children of both groups have reached have grown in this period, the difference has now narrowed by 58 points.
Some district education advocates expressed their concern last week that the results, which were celebrated by school chancellor Michelle A. Rhein and democratic mayor Adrian M. Fenty, were largely driven by white students who are already powerful children anyway.
This indicates that we have raised the overall score by treating those at the top of the scale, which is problematic and difficult, said Jeff Smith, Executive Director of D.C. Voice, a non-profit group that is in favour of educational equality in Washington D.C.
I'm not jumping up and down for a span of two or three points, said Democratic Washington City Councilman Kwame R. Brown, who has a daughter in the fourth grade of Eaton Primary School.
Brown, a frequent critic of Rhee's management style, said that the message of the test score is that the city's middle schools urgently need attention.
Of course, you always want to see the positive signs, I respect that.
What scares me, however, is that we do not spend nearly the time and energy we need to use for our high school.
Rhee said the district must continue to find better ways to meet the needs of the poor pupils.
This autumn, for example, some teachers are trained to use a new reading curriculum, the Wilson-reading system, which aims at upper secondary and secondary school pupils, which basic skills of reading have not mastered at the beginning of their school career and which are significantly behind their peers.
Everyday mathematics, a curriculum that brings to the foreground from kindergarten to sixth grade games and lifelong experiences, was brought under the former senior school inspector Clifford Janey to Washington and this curriculum will be attributed to some of the NAEP advances reported last week.
I believe that we must continue to work to make the best measures available to students below the score line, said Rhee.
Others say that the NAEP results highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to improve the overall performance of the system and can continue to provide the additional money and resources for the low-performance schools that are needed to reduce the gap.
This is a serious dilemma for Michelle Rhein, said Bruce Fuller, Professor of Education at the University of California in Berkeley, investigating urban test results.
The conventional remedy is to focus its resources and management reforms on the schools in the poorest areas of Washington, D.C.
The objective could produce political repercussions that are working against this important agenda item.
The weak point is of course, as with other urban school inspectors, that they are trying to keep the white and black middle layer.
Our focus is to ensure that we create a system of great schools.
We need to strengthen our schools in the neighborhoods so that all families, wherever they live, can be sure that their children can receive excellent public education.
Janey, now a school inspector in Newark, said this week in an interview that one of the most important elements to close the performance gap is to extend the traditional public school year, which is currently 180 days in Washington, in order to compete with the charter schools.
One has to increase the school year to nearly 200 days in order to have the power to change, said Janey, who came to an agreement with his teacher union last year over 185 days a year, which he considers to be a "milestone" on the way to a larger increase in the next contract.
Higher education for more people than the future
The bus reaches the Gettysburg College with a loud pipe.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, rises and blinks a moment at the sight of the white columns, the brick facades and the emerald green lawn.
Graciela's parents have hardly completed high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela, who was saved in Silver Spring and now lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a college campus.
Their attitude and that of the other eight-klussers of the group who explore Gettysburg, where the class costs 38,690 dollars a year, was rather that of an awe-inspiring visitor than that of an enthusiastic future student.
"Yes! Here I will be soon!" cried Graciela, who would like to study medicine when the leader announced that they had now entered the building for science.
"Wow, really?" she said thoughtfully when she was told the low professor-to-student ratio of the school.
The school in Pennsylvania was the 7th that the children visited on their three-day tour and now they have taken up the intended message completely: the question is not whether you go to college.
The question is, where.
On the one hand, there is growing concern about the large number of children of hispanic immigrants born in the United States, who do not finish high school or become pregnant as teenagers, but on the other hand, there are hundreds of thousands who receive college education, which is necessary to get up to the middle class.
In fact, one of five of these "second generation" of Hispanics completes the college – which is a remarkable achievement, as many of their immigrant parents, mostly from Mexico or Central America, came to the United States without completing high school.
Their success stories are important, say researchers, because they show the way forward for a generation that will play a huge role in the country's workforce.
Those who study powerful children say that they often have a natural affinity for school and an indwelling drive to success.
Many of them also have parents who set their children high goals and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But counselling programs also play a major role by helping Graciela and millions of children like them to get to college, especially if these efforts continue over a long period of time.
If you look at low-income children whose parents do not have the experience and skills to help them search the way through the system, then a single measure will not solve the problem at any time, said Patricia Gándara, researcher at the University of California in Davis, who investigated hispano-American students.
We need to think about providing these children with a supportive network from preschool to high school.
The federal program that Gracielas College Tour had financed is a useful example.
It is known as GEAR UP - a gear-up - and provides more than 300 million dollars a year for local school systems to start college preparation programs that start when low-income students are in high school and continue to run until they finish high school.
According to the US Department of Education, the programme has helped more than 10 million students since 1999, more than 60% of whom have gone to college.
Iraqi Oil Ministry concludes contracts with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi Government has been able to restore its damaged infrastructure in two auctions on Saturday.
The 10 contracts concluded with foreign oil companies by the Iraqi Ministry of Oil indicate that China, Russia and European oil companies are ready to play an important role in the renovation of the Iraqi oil industry, which has been paralysed by war and economic sanctions for decades.
American companies could only book shares in two of the 10 auctioned fields on their own.
Seven American companies had paid for participating in the second auction, which began on Friday.
The only company that has submitted a bid has pulled the trigger.
Two American companies were able to conclude contracts for auctioned fields in June.
The thinly sown representatives of American oil mills at the opening of the Iraqi oil industry surprised the analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors after 6 years of war, and instead of US companies, Asiatic and European have set out the way, said Ruba Husari, the editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, an online news service.
There will be no further offers in Iraq for a long time.
Security concerns still highlighted by massively coordinated bombings on Tuesday and political instability due to the withdrawal of the US military have probably prevented American oil companies from engaging more closely in Iraq, which has the third largest proven crude oil reserves in the world.
US companies have been disadvantaged in some cases because competitors, especially the Chinese and other state-controlled energy companies, have significantly lower wage costs and are more likely to face risks because they do not have to account for shareholders.
Exxon-Mobile and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies that were able to conclude contracts with the Ministry.
Major US companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, who maintain close relations with the Iraqi Ministry of Oil and who have been assisting in recent years with technical advice, have gone out empty.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main players in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The State China National Petroleum Corporation has offered for more contracts than any other company and has been able to go home with large packages of contracts for two larger fields.
We all know, said the spokesperson of the Ministry of Oil, Assam Jihad, that China is on its way to becoming one of the great economies of the world as well as a technology power.
We are convinced that the Chinese company will be able to measure itself with its partners and fulfil its obligations towards Iraq.
Pre-selected companies submitted bids which were then compared with the fee per barrel of oil that the Ministry was willing to pay in order to increase the output of each field beyond the current level.
Al-Qaeda's top planner apparently killed in Pakistan
In the event of an obvious US missile attack along the Pakistani border to Afghanistan, an Al-Qaeda Top Action Planer was said to have been killed this week, according to U.S. anti-terrorism representatives on Friday.
This would be, if it were confirmed, the second deadly attack on a high-ranking terrorist organization this autumn.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arabs who, according to US sources and Pakistani authorities, were said to have been killed by a number of rockets that hit their vehicle near the city of Miran Shah in the province of North Waziristan on Tuesday.
Local authorities reported that the rockets were fired by a drone type used by the CIA in the illegal tribal belt of Pakistan.
They drove in a white vehicle towards the Afghan border when the car was hit, said a public representative of a Pakistani civilian secret service from Miran Shah by phone.
Local residents, suspected of belonging to the militants, ran to the spot and quickly took on everything that was left of the "completely destroyed bodies".
The local authorities could not confirm the identity of the victims, but two representatives of the U.S. counter-terrorism led to indeterminate evidence that Somali was one of the dead.
Somali was described as the leading military planner of Al Kaida, who led operations of terrorist groups outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He was involved in conspiracy all over the world, noted a senior official who wanted to remain anonymous, and pointed to the delicate nature of the US air raids on Pakistani soil.
Taking on its central role as a given, this included planning attacks against the US and Europe.
He adopted strategic instructions from the top leaders of Al Kaida and implemented them in operational plans for possible terrorist attacks.
The second U.S. government representative said that Somalia had risen rapidly in the Al-Qaeda hierarchy and maintained best links with other extremist groups in the region.
He may not be known to some Americans, said the second official, but this does not at all reduce the danger he posed to us and our allies.
If his death were confirmed, Somalia would be the second leading Al-Qaeda or Taliban leader killed since September, as in a similar attack by Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant faction in the tribal area and three other top activists.
Since the summer, according to a summary of the Long War Journal, a website maintained by a non-profit organization, the rate of attacks by the CIA's drones has dropped from six operations per month to two.
The decrease can be based on improved tactics of the terrorist groups, who have taken steps to reduce their attackability and at the same time brutally kill suspect informants, the page reported.
Leading UN envoy in Kabul will resign
On Friday, the UN leader in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said that he would resign from his office in March, ending a stormy term of office that was swept by allegations of widespread corruption in the Afghan presidential election supported by the UN.
The oath of departure took place when the Obama government decided to send another 30,000 U.S. soldiers to Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said that he supported the increase in troops, but he also expressed his concern that the US military withdrawal timetable, which is scheduled to begin in 18 months, could cause other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to speed up the development of Afghan security forces and send the right signal to the Afghans that they can trust the international community, said oath in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military forces to increase the number of international civilian helpers to help in the political conversion of Afghanistan.
The military increase must correspond to an increase on the civilian side, he said.
Eide said that he did not lay down his office, but only made an agreement with his family in March 2008 to stay in Kabul for only two years.
He said he wanted the notification to UNO-
General Secretary Ban Ki-moon is now forwarding so that he can have time to arrange for a replacement.
What I said was that he'd better start looking for a successor, said oath.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
Ban has started the search for a replacement according to UN representatives.
The UN representatives say that he has recently led the UN mission in Baghdad and considered the Frenchman Jean-Marie Guéhenno, who had previously led UN peace operations.
An oath in Afghanistan was put to the test after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, accused him in September of preferring President Hamid Karzai in the presidential election in the country and hiding evidence of massive electoral fraud.
The oath rejected all accusations, but he also said that the accusations of Galbraith - which was fired - "damaged the mission without a doubt because there was already a great deal of scepticism about international interference in the election".
Eide said that he recommended the appointment of a leading civilian representative to coordinate the aid measures of the American-led forces in Afghanistan.
He also insisted that the UN leadership allow his successor to recruit more staff from the United States and other Western countries who contribute to the Afghan mission, and said that this would strengthen their confidence in the proper use of their money.
Eide expressed his disappointment at the limitation of his forces in Afghanistan and said that the cumbersome UN regulations have undermined his ability to bring in capable people.
The UN rules are designed so that since May, he said, only one person could be hired.
It's catastrophic and can't go on like that.
US Defence Minister Gates: Iran must expect additional sanctions
Minister of Defense Robert M. Gates said on Friday that the world powers will soon impose "significant additional sanctions" on Iran because he did not participate in talks about his nuclear plans.
Gates spoke to a group of about 300 U.S. soldiers in northern Iraq during a 7-day journey through the war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq and took the prospect of military action against the Islamic Republic of Iran.
In Iran there are no good options to choose, he said in response to the question of a soldier about the likelihood of such a development.
"One of the things that is on my mind is if in the last six years we have learned something from Iraq that has its own unpredictability."
The Obama government is considering a sanction package aimed at Iran's military and political elite, but Gates has announced that some sanctions could also affect the average Iranians.
He said that a "package of positive and negative incentives" is necessary, "to convince the Iranian government that it is actually less protected by nuclear weapons", because "their people will suffer enormously" from the sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement by the White House spokesperson Robert Gibbs, the American government joined the European leaders in warning that Iran must expect "faithful" consequences if it does not meet the demands of the UN Security Council and its nuclear monitoring organisation, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran continues to claim that knowledge of nuclear technology should only be gained for peaceful purposes.
During talks in Geneva on 1 October, Iran said that it would resume talks to limit its nuclear programme and refrain from a substantial part of its stock of enriched uranium in exchange for urgently needed nuclear fuel for its medical research reactor.
The US government has forced this kind of agreement to build trust between the two parties and to gain time for negotiations.
However, since then Iran seems to have left the negotiations on the provisional agreements -- in part, experts say, because the Iranian leadership disagrees as to whether they should commit themselves to the United States.
Gates said that Iran had simply left the international community standing in relation to some of the proposals that they had already approved in early October, and that the international community, including the Russians and Chinese, had brought it together in a way that they had never been in conjunction with important additional sanctions for Iran.
President Obama has set the 31st Dec as a deadline for Iran to respond to these proposals before continuing to pursue other options, including those that Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "oppressive sanctions".
In an opinion issued in New York, the Iranian representation of the United Nations condemned what it called "undeserved and unsubstantiated allegations" by some Security Council members about Iranian nuclear activities on Thursday and said that they are ready to continue the talks with the United States and five other world powers to "achieve an appropriate long-term solution".
Gates, who was due to return to Washington last Friday, met with the Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki in the morning before flying to the oil-rich Kurdish region in Iraq to meet with the soldiers in Kirkuk and with Kurdish officials in Irbil.
The tensions between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq are still high, particularly in relation to borders, property rights and the distribution of public revenue.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential for conflict in order to prevent delays in US plans from lowering the American force from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also tried to dispel the Kurdish concern about the imminent withdrawal of troops. US representatives quoted Gates, who said to Masud Barzani, president of the Kurdish regional government: "We will maintain your security, your prosperity and your autonomy within a united Iraq.
We will not leave you."
A Change of Course in Older China
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters that gave them lectures that "Mother Earth is too tired to entertain other children" and "A baby more means a grave more".
They have learned these lessons so well that, as a government official in Shanghai, who suddenly started to change course this summer due to the low birth rate and the ageing population, and encouraged young couples to have more than one child, their answer was immediate and final: "Not at all".
We have already invested all our time and energy in a child.
For a second child there is nothing left, said Wang, 31, a staff manager with an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the one-child policy in China, which has produced two generations of notoriously thick, seductive single children who are affectionately called "little emperors", a population crisis is rising in the country.
The average birth rate has fallen to 1.8 children per couple compared to 6 at the time when this policy came into force, the UN
The population division is set to increase from 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 percent in terms of explosions by 2050. This is well above the global average of about 20 percent.
The imbalance is stronger in rich coastal cities with educated populations, such as Shanghai.
Last year, 60-year-olds and older people made up almost 22 percent of the reported inhabitants of Shanghai, while the birth rate was below one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, head of the Shanghai City and Family Planning Commission, said that couples of child-bearing age must be given "to help reduce the ratio of the older population and to alleviate the labour shortage of the future".
Shanghai will soon be "as old -- but not as rich -- as the industrialized countries, like Japan and Sweden," she said.
A gradual relaxation
Established in the country's constitution in 1978, China's one-child policy is likely to be the most controversial option introduced by the ruling Communist Party to date.
Couples who violate this policy have to expect enormous fines -- up to their three-year salary in some regions -- and discrimination at their workplace.
Chinese state representatives have attributed this policy to the fact that the critical burden of natural land resources could be avoided, whereas human rights representatives have condemned abuses in the enforcement of policies.
In rural areas, some officials forced pregnant women who already had a child to do so.
Many couples also had sex-selective abortions carried out, resulting in an unnaturally high male-female relationship.
In recent years, government representatives for the population have gradually weakened their attitude towards one-child policy.
In 2004, they approved more exceptions to the rule -- including city dwellers, members of ethnic minorities and cases in which both husband and wife have been single children -- and in 2007 the tone of many hard slogans was mitigated.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute for Population Research at the University of Beijing, said that government representatives have recently discussed even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children, one of whom is a single child.
Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to promote more births in July.
Posters that taught families to have only one child were replaced almost overnight by guidelines that describe in detail who comes into question for a second child and how to apply for the authorisation.
The city administration has sent out urban employees and volunteers for family planning to visit couples at home and to push information sheets under the doors.
She also asked to provide psychological and financial advice for those who had more than one child.
The reaction was not encouraging, said family planning representatives.
Disappointing reaction
Although officials from a small rural town outside Shanghai said that there was a recovery in the requests of couples who, after the campaign, wanted a second child, the urban districts did not report any change.
The municipality of Huinan with a population of 115,000 still receives only four to five applications per month.
Disappointed Shanghai officials say that despite the campaign, the number of births expected for 2010 in the city will still be about 165,000 -- slightly higher than in 2009, but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the Family Planning Committee of the Shanghai municipality of Caolu, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people no longer want to have children.
They want to give the best to their first, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said that they would like to have two children and that this was also legally allowed.
But they have, like many Chinese, only a minor health and life insurance of the government.
Without a social network, they say, this decision would be irresponsible.
People in the West misjudge the one-child policy as a human rights issue, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is pregnant with her first child in the seventh month.
Yes, we are deprived of the opportunity to have more than one child.
The problem, however, is not simply a political one.
The problem is money.
Other couples give psychological reasons for their hesitation.
Wang, the head of staff, said she only wants a child because she was also a single child. "We were the center of the family and we used to have everyone take care of us.
We are not used to caring for others and do not really want to do this."
Chen Zijian, a 42-year-old who belongs to a translation company, said it unmistakably.
For middle-class parents with double careers, through which the birth rate decreases, he said it is about being successful and for that one must be selfish.
The age group of today's 20- to 39-year-olds grew up to see their parents fight during the early days of the Chinese capitalism experiment, and they don't want such a life for themselves at all, he said.
Even a single child, he said, places huge demands on the time of the parents.
A mother must give up her social life for at least two years.
Then there's the space question -- "You have to rebuild your apartment" -- and life planning -- "When the child is 9 months old, you already have to have a CV ready for the best preschools."
Most of his friends are ready to go through this once, said Chen, but not twice.
Our generation is the first to achieve a higher standard of living, he said.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
United Nations Group drafts emission reduction plan
The UN-funded climate conference, which has so far been characterised by wild posse and mutual accusations, has once again placed a focus on Friday with the publication of a document that records an ambitious reduction in greenhouse gases for the next 40 years, with industrial nations having to shoulder the greatest burdens in the near future.
The text that could provide the basis for a final political agreement on the regulation of greenhouse gases has shown both the remaining obstacles and the way forward.
But it has been seen as an important step forward in a negotiation that is running out of time, as next week more than 100 top politicians from all over the world will arrive in Copenhagen.
The text, formulated by a specially created UN working group, is silent on the amount of money that rich countries should give to the poor countries so that they can cope with global warming in the short and long term.
It also offers a range of options for key issues, including how industrial and large emerging countries can limit their carbon emissions and how high should be the upper limit of the global temperature rise that policy makers would contribute to.
The process will provide great flexibility, says John Coequyt, head representative of the Sierra Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who designed the six-page document, has summarized a 180-page negotiating text to put the focus on what the UN's leading climate protection representative, Yvo de Boer, has called "the great whole".
It shows the basis for a possible agreement whereby industrial nations would jointly reduce their emissions by 25 to 45 percent by 2020, compared with the 1990 limit values, while larger developing countries would reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 percent over the same period.
Together, countries could reduce emissions by 50 to 95 percent by 2050.
The European Community has also given the talks on Friday a boost by its commitment to provide over the next three years USD 3.6 billion a year to help poorer countries adapt to the effects of climate change - from master of floods and droughts to prevention of deforestation.
The Friday still brought the same verbal fireworks that the conversations had determined in the last week.
The American climate expert Todd Stern has rejected formulations calling for binding reductions in greenhouse gas emissions for industrialised countries, compared to voluntary reductions for larger emerging countries, if these are not financed by industrial nations.
This move announced that the Obama government is running a tougher line with China, as a representative of the Bush government not even two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without major emerging countries coming up and taking action, says Stark, who also complained that the text would not go far enough to ensure that the reductions could also be confirmed by outsiders.
Stern made his statement one hour after the Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister He Yafei declared that it was either lack of "reason" to the leading American climate negotiator or it was "very irresponsible" to him that he said at the beginning of the week that the United States would not financially help China to master global warming.
As a result, the future economic direction of the great world powers is at stake, break-lines have been opened both within industrial nations and between industrial nations and emerging economies.
The current struggle also refers to the rescue of individual economies, as well as to the rescue of the planet, with China and the United States being responsible for their corresponding commitments, while poorer countries claim that the two dozen most influential countries would ignore the scientific need to take more courageous action.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegation from Costa Rica, said that it is not surprising that the major powers are fighting for who should bear the cost of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, as even affected countries have become more aggressive in taking the countries with very high greenhouse gas taxes into account for their actions.
This is clearly a game from which a new economic dominance will develop, says Ulate, who is also working as a regional climate change advisor for Conservation International in Mexico and Central America.
Some of the countries that are most exposed to the effects of climate change indicated that they would continue to fight for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although the leading participants say that the talks will lead to a political agreement at best.
The small island states' alliance with 43 members presented a 24-page draft treaty on Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who is leading the international climate negotiations for the European Commission, said that the small island states' offensive "imposes political pressure on the whole political process," partly because they are now united and demand action from emerging countries, such as China and India.
The talks were given a new urgency when the delegates focused on the fact that most open questions had to be settled before the Heads of Government arrived to reach an agreement.
High-level representatives, such as Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and Chinese Deputy Minister, got off their planes and rushed through the corridors of the Bella Centre to meetings behind closed doors and press conferences to intercept claims that are being negotiated during the next week.
The sheer extent of the meeting -- 13,000 people go into and out of the congress centre every day, guitar-replaying activists stage night shows in which they make fun of the countries that in their opinion betray and sell themselves, and drafts of contracts are passed on by hand instead of by e-mail -- is already a challenge.
The intensity is just building up: almost all important ministers are now here and from Wednesday, 60 government leaders will be in Copenhagen.
We come to the Oberliga, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Vice-President for Global Policy of the Organization Conservation International.
The heavy weights are coming.
Great Britain's first 225 km/h fast train redefines the Monday feeling
On Monday morning at 5 p.m., a pipe will penetrate the darkness to announce a train departure that represents a revolution in traffic in Great Britain.
The first high-speed commuter train in the country will reach 225 km/h in its flash drive from Ashfort, Kent, London St. Pancras, and will travel 93 km in 38 minutes.
To Lord Adonis, the Minister of Transport, Dame Kelly Holmes will board the first Javelin pendulum service from London.
He hopes that the new UK service will eventually connect to an international rail network faster, reliable trains and connect the major metropolitan areas of the Midlands, the North and Scotland to London.
The neglected province could become vibrant commuter cities, working hours would be radically reduced and changing aircraft and cars to the railways would reduce national carbon emissions and congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three major parties believe in this vision.
But the many billions of pounds needed to build a new national rail network could continue to slow down the inevitable planning battle and fears of environmental damage to British high-speed rails.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company founded in January to submit a feasibility study to the government, will submit the report to Lord Adonis on December 30, according to the Times.
This gives him a detailed route map of the next planned stage of the high-speed rail network.
The new railway line that London will connect with the West Midlands will pass by urban areas and places where the environmental impact is controversial.
In the open space, the plan will show the concept within a distance of 25 meters from the final route.
HS2 is also to create three options for a larger, north-facing high-speed rail network.
Lord Adonis will respond to this in the spring.
The preferred option is a Y-shaped route, where a single high-speed route would lead to the West Midlands.
The route would split in or near Birmingham and a branch would lead west of the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and another towards northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would lead to Scotland.
"It seems to be the best-functioning option," said a railroad insider.
After completion the journey time between London and Edinburgh would decrease to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first section, which would not be opened before 2025, would allow travellers to cross the London-Birmingham route in 49 minutes, compared to today a little over an hour.
The drafts provide for the possibility of driving at a speed of 400 km/h, making the UK rail network the fastest in Europe.
The first route was planned in such a way that 400 meters of trains with a maximum capacity of 1,100 people can ride on it.
Up to 18 trains could be operated per hour on the London-Birmingham route.
This, in turn, would mean that a terminal station would be needed in London where 20,000 travellers could be completed per hour.
In view of the spatial constraints in the capital, it is expected that an existing railway station will be expanded to accommodate the high-speed network.
Railway experts say that only St. Pancras International or Euston have this potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether this plan should be continued in his view or not, but the lengthy public consultation and planning measures mean that a final decision will only be taken after the parliamentary elections.
But even if he sets the wheels in motion, the rail network must be built in sections.
The trains would first have to switch from the high-speed lines to existing rail lines in the north of Birmingham, leaving the journey time between London and Scotland at more than three hours.
This is considered to be a decisive point of impact in order to ensure a change from the plane to the train, a yardstick for the rail revolution.
Tax payers come for mortgage for 75,000 pounds-orangery of a conservative
Alan Duncan, the leading house member of the Conservatives, has charged the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year for the cost of an orangery that he was able to build in his house in his constituency.
The party's prison spokesman, David Cameron's degraded for complaining that under-house members must live "by lean rations", has increased his mortgage by 75,000 pounds to build an oak-wood factory plant on his second house in Rutland.
He was allowed to charge the taxpayer the additional interest income, a sum of hundreds of pounds per month.
The people in charge of the House approved the applications at the time and they were also not questioned by Sir Thomas Legg, who carried out a review of the expenses of the House members. Last night Duncan said that the applications could have been "not even cleaner or more understandable".
Duncan, one of the richest house members, owns a two-storey house in a village in his constituency Rutland and Melton.
Nearby houses have reached a purchase price of almost one million pounds (1.1 million euros).
The ground floor includes kitchen, living room and dining room, but the Fees Office, an expenditure control unit of the House, has agreed that Duncan needs more space.
Last year he cultivated a winter garden called "Orangerie" in the plans.
Neighbors described him as a "glass house for entertainment".
Duncan was also not invited by the Committee on Standards and Privileges to comment on the increased take-up of funds during a recent examination of his previous mortgage contracts.
The Committee acquitted him last month after examining his expenditure from the breach of the rules.
In 2004, Duncan transferred the security for a mortgage of over 271,406 pounds (300,000 euros) from his London house to his constituency, which he had bought in 1991, one year before his election as a member of parliament.
This week published documents show that by March last year Duncan received approximately 1,400 pounds (1,500 euros) per month as a mortgage interest refund.
In April, his claims rose to more than 1,800 pounds (2,000 euros) per month.
The interest rate of Duncan's RBS mortgage has not changed during this period, suggesting that the total increase was used to finance the raising of 75,000 pounds (85.000 euros).
The normal stepless RBS mortgage rate declined from 7.94 percent in December 2007 to 4 percent in March this year, where it still stands.
The latest documents published by the House of Commons show that Duncan continued to assert his right to £1,250 (€1,400) per month in May.
Duncan lost his position as opposition leader of the House of Commons in September after an undercover reporter filmed him when he said, after the spending scandal, that parliamentarians would live "by lean rations".
"In essence, working for the state means living by lean ratios and being treated as S*****e."
He said, "I have spent my money on my garden, and I am entitled to a small part, as measured by what belongs to it.
And I could have demanded the whole damn sum, but I don't."
The parliamentarian, a millionaire from his former career as an oil wholesaler, was attacked for the first time in May for his expenses when it became clear that he had asked for thousands of pounds for his garden before he had finished with the Fees Office that this could be considered "an excessive demand".
As a protester in Duncan's lawn, an activist dug a hole in the form of a pound mark after it had become known that he had over three years demanded 4,000 pounds (4,500 euros).
Last night, when he was questioned about the increased mortgage, Duncan said, "This was approved by the Fees Office as well as subsequently by Legg zur Werkung."
He added: "There is no debate about avoiding and piercing or bending the rules or the like.
Everything is completely transparent and moves strictly within the rules, is approved and everything.
It couldn't be cleaner and clearer at all."
Come all your faithful to admire Brighton's beach cottage Advent calendar
Beach cabins in Brighton have found a new life content for the winter months as an interactive Advent calendar.
"Beyond", an alternative church group that stimulates spiritual discoveries by creativity, has invited 24 owners to decorate their huts with Christmas songs as a theme for every December day.
The event started on December 1st and visitors were allowed to watch the newest cottage every day from 17:30 to 18:30 with free incandescent wine and traditional Mince Pies, filled with dry fruits.
The Christmas songs selected so far are "I saw three ships", "O come, o come, Emmanuel" and "The first Noël", where the hut decoration is the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is an honorary cleric of the Chichester Diocese and director of Beyond.
He said, "We want to make religion more important for people in a post-Christian society.
Why do we, as a church, expect people to come to a strange old building? I think the church should go to people and organize enthusiastic celebrations.
The idea of the beach hut Advent calendar began as a conversation with some friends at dinner.
Brighton is such a fantastically creative and lively place and we try to express this through our spirituality."
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and in the world for climate.
Tens of thousands of people have demonstrated worldwide on Saturday and in Copenhagen to demand an ambitious and binding agreement on the fight against climate warming, where the police have arrested several hundred people.
At least thirty thousand people, according to the police, a hundred thousand according to the organizers, are marching in the cold of the Danish capital, on the margins of the United Nations Climate Change Conference, which should lead to a conclusion by Friday that could enter into force from 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, the Danish chairman of the climate conference, the increasing mobilization in the world contributes to the climate, which is illustrated by these demonstrations that the "political price" of a failure in Copenhagen would be very high.
The incidents in the Danish capital took place shortly after the train passed, when a group of 300 demonstrators, dressed in black, had smashed windows with pavements and hammers, a journalist of the AFP noted.
Anti-turbulence policemen have intervened immediately and with no regard.
The police have announced that, according to your opinion, 600 to 700 people, mainly members of the Blacks Blocs, these extremely violent splitter groups, who have already become famous at the NATO Summit in Strasbourg, were arrested in eastern France, in April.
The Coalition Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the organizers of the demonstration, has been arrested under the conditions under which hundreds of militant supporters were "without distinction", sharply criticized, and has underlined that about a hundred of you "were still held in the streets on Saturday evening", despite the extreme cold with handcuffs and in seating position.
The rather peaceful train has gone from Parliament towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations took place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to get in.
A stage has been installed to welcome the appointed spokespersons for an evening with candlelight, with the participation of the former South African archbishop, Desmond Tutu.
Most of the demonstrators have travelled by bus and train from the big European cities, but also many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans were present, as well as some Africans.
About 3,000 people, most of you with sky blue raincoats, have made a first run in the morning in Copenhagen, as you have followed the call of Earth's friends to form "blue tides" for the "climate justice".
Today we are going to the streets to demand a restitution of the ecological blame in favour of the South, said Lidy Nacpil, Filipino activist of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can't go on like this and say: we have time, said Angelique Kidjo, singer from Benin.
There are rivers in Africa that dry out, watercourses where you can walk, just as it has never been the case in the past.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, founded in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the movement of globalisation critics has approached environmental organisations.
European MEP José Bové, the figure of the critics of globalisation, announced that he came to Copenhagen to link "Climate justice and social justice": "Today there is no difference between the fight against climate warming and the fight for another world."
The Asian-Pacific area, where there are many islands which are particularly at risk as a result of warming, has given the start to the demonstrations.
According to the organizers in Australia, about 50,000 people have gone on the streets.
In Manila there were hundreds of people, mostly students, who marched in red and hopped Bandanas, where you praised the solar energy.
In Hong Kong or in Jakarta, but also in Canada, marches of several hundred demonstrators took place to demand an energetic approach to climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organized by the "350" network have gathered several hundred people, namely in Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (North), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).
Some people gathered in Geneva.
The separatist Abkhazia has elected its president, Georgia denies that this is a "strike".
Abkhazia elected his president on Saturday, this happened a little more than a year after Moscow had recognized this pro-Russian separatist Georgian area as independent, Tbilisi denounced the "strike".
Some 131,000 people were called upon to take part in the first election after the August 2008 Russian-Georgian War for the control of the South Ossetian region, another Georgian secessionist area recognised by Russia.
The polling stations closed GMT at 5 p.m.
The turnout was about 58% a few hours before the polling, according to the Abkhaz election commissioners.
The first preliminary results should be announced during the night from Saturday to Sunday.
The five candidates, including the former President, Serguei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which condemns the election.
These elections are a farce.
On the other hand, the Georgian President, Mikheil Saakachvili, regrets that Abkhazia is now under Russian-safe total occupation, has declared his press spokesperson, Manana Manjgaladze.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognized the independence of this area with 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world perceives it as part of Georgia that is illegally occupied by Russia.
After it had separated from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict, where several thousand people died, Abkhazia wants to prove by this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage in our new life, a new era, as an independent state, has explained Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian who claims to have chosen Mr. Bagapch.
She was one of the voters who went to a polling room in a school in the capital Soukhoumi, to choose a beautiful white building with a few palm trees in front of the entrance.
The question of Russian dominance is the heart of this presidential election, in a region with beautiful landscapes on the Black Sea.
Large signs on which Bagapch can be seen at the side of the Russian President and the Head of Government, Dmitri Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, are located everywhere in this small area that has 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, which is located in the east of the country, the district chief, Beslan Archba, has prepared a warm welcome to the Russian representatives who have come to monitor the electoral process.
We, the Abkhazi people, are grateful, he said at a small celebration, as an allusion to Moscow's support, especially in the decision to recognize Abkhazia's independence.
I hope that your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian Parliament, answered and raised a glass of vodka.
The opposition, represented by the former Vice-President and two Russian businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticised the agreements reached with Moscow last year, as the one in which Abkhazia left Russia the control of the railways for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Banca, claims to support neither the present government nor the opposition.
A majority of 50% plus one vote is necessary to win the election.
If none of the candidates reaches this limit, a second round of elections must be organised within two weeks.
Climate: Demos worldwide, incidents in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people have demonstrated all over the world on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding treaty from the Kopenhagen Climate Conference, where the police, at any time ready to use, arrested about 700 people, on the verge of an important demonstration.
Thirty thousand people according to the police, a hundred thousand according to the organizers have demonstrated in the afternoon cold in the Danish capital, which will receive the delegates from 193 countries until December 18, which are in search of an agreement to enter into force on January 1, 2013.
From Parliament the peaceful train marched towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations take place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 meters from the center and have not tried to penetrate.
A stage was built to welcome the appointed speakers for an evening with candlelight, with the participation of the former South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu.
A few moments after the train had passed, a group of demonstrators, dressed in black and armed with bricks and hammers, began to enter discs, a journalist of the AFP noted.
Anti-turbulence police officers have immediately encircled you and have intervened without consideration by throwing some of you on the ground.
The police have announced that 600 to 700 people have been arrested and have made it clear that they are mainly members of the Blacks Blocs, these extremely violent splitter groups, which have already become famous at the NATO Summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, in April.
Towards evening, a police officer suffered an injury from a paving stone during the incidents where, according to the police, about twenty persons were temporarily arrested at the chin. Four vehicles burned near an occupied house.
"We've got the extreme groups under control," said Henrik Jakobsen, the police spokesperson, while the helicopters of the law forces are flying in the air.
Most demonstrators who arrived by train or by their own vehicle from German cities, from London, Amsterdam or Milan were Europeans.
However, there were also many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, and Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in the sky-blue raincoat, formed in the morning in Copenhagen after the call of "Friends of the Earth" to a first group to represent the "blue seas" for "climate justice".
"Today we go to the street to demand that the ecological debt be repaid to the people of the south," said activist Lidy Nacpil of the Jubilee South Coalition of the Philippines in Copenhagen.
"We can't say we still have time," says singer Angélique Kidjo from Benin.
"In Africa there are rivers that drain, there are streams through which you can walk, which was never the case before."
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which was launched in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the movement of globalization opponents has approached environmental organisations.
The French MEP of the European Parliament and globalization critic José Bové told AFP that he had come to Copenhagen to "connect climate justice and social justice." "There is no difference between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world today."
The organization Oxfam has mobilized several personalities, such as the Danish model Helena Christensen or the former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson, who turn to the masses.
The Asian-Pacific area, where many islands are particularly vulnerable to global warming, has given the impetus to the demonstrations.
In Australia, according to the organizers, about 50,000 people went on the road.
In Manila, several hundred people, in the majority of students, dressed in red with bandanas, made advertising in front of the city administration of the Philippine capital for solar energy.
In Hong Kong and Jakarta, hundreds of demonstrators have also gathered in an action against climate change.
In France, several hundred people gathered during the demonstrations organized by the "Network of 350", especially in Paris, Marseilles in the south, Lille in the north, Bordeaux in the west and Lyons in the east.
Several people gathered in Geneva.
According to Chatel, the subjects of geography and history are reinforced by the school reform of the Lycés.
National Education Minister Luc Chatel explained in an interview, which appeared in the Sunday newspaper "Journal du dimanche", that the subjects of geography and history are reinforced by the school reform of the Lycées, even if they are not compulsoryly taught in the terminals (12th school year).
"The students of the Première (11th year of school) now have every four hours of the week and the same program," Mr. Chatel confirms.
For the minister, "this hypocrisy has to be overcome", because according to him, "the scientific profile is no longer a scientific profile," but essentially a concentration "of the best students."
"The economic-social and literary profile (ES and L) must not become a sub-profile of the scientific," he continued. He underlined: "I have not heard many historians and intellectuals who have been outraged by the lack of historical-geographical education in the terminals on technical Lyceen."
On Saturday, an IFOP survey published in the Humanité revealed that nearly seven out of ten French people (69%) criticise the state project of eradicating compulsory education in history and geography in Terminals S (12th school year with scientific profile). Many teachers and intellectuals also objected to this project, as well as the left and some representatives of the right.
The Minister replied that there was no question about limiting the philosophy of the S Terminals programme.
Luc Chatel also defended the educational reform for teachers, while 16 organisations (students and trade unions) called for protest against the project for Tuesday, which they felt is the victim of the pedagogical training of future teachers.
The Minister explained that at the beginning of the year, Master 2 (M2) was subject to an aptitude test and at the end of the year an aptitude test assessing their teaching abilities.
In addition, they conduct internships in M2 during the year and then teach one year in front of the students as teachers in the internship.
He continued: "If you add all the internships offered before the performance test, you will reach even more hours you have spent in front of the students, i.e. more than 300 hours."
Finally, the Minister stated that he wanted to offer "the individual right to education" - a "thing that does not exist in the education of the people."
He confirmed once again that he wanted to abolish the school card "until 2012.
15 minutes for the climate at the "Ecole Normale Supérieure"
Fifteen minutes to talk about the deployment at the Copenhagen Summit: this is the challenge Jean Jouzel, Vice President of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, had to face on Saturday morning at the Ecole Normale Supérieure in the Rue d'Ulm in Paris.
As a journalist of the AFP noted, the Nobel Peace Prize winner Jean Jouzel opened the first "Ernest" conferences, where experts turn to the audience for fifteen minutes with filmed contributions.
One would like to do something to reach people and in them the feeling of wanting to learn more, said Edouard Hannezo, 22 years old and one of the organizers of this day, on the margins of the conference. The name of this event goes back to the name given by the students to the fish in the pool of the school.
"Among the experts, around twenty participants were selected, even after their charisma," he explained.
"Climatic warming can be spoken for hours, but the core goals can also be explained in a few minutes," said Jean Jouzel of the AFP, who spoke freely to about 50 people only with the help of foils.
"This is part of our role as a scientist," he stressed, hoping that the audience may recall that "the Copenhagen conference is based on an absolutely serious scientific dossier."
The videos shot by these conferences will be available online on the school page from 15 December.
The next "Ernest" day is scheduled for February and will take place every two months thereafter.
Delay in payment : angry prison guards, actions planned
On Friday, the unions of law enforcement officials called for a general day of action to ensure that the premiums and overtime paid for budget reasons were paid up to January are transferred before Christmas holidays.
The 2nd Trade Union of Penitentiaries ("FO-Pénitentiaire"), called on the staff who have no service to demonstrate on Tuesday morning in front of the Penitentiary and to block them in order to draw attention to the "theft of what is due to them".
The Third Union of Criminal Enforcement Officers ("CGT-Pénitentiaire") called for "to unite to a strong mobilization in the various prisons" on which the non-payment of overtime, night surcharges and the Sunday and holiday supplements in December will be burned as "disgraceful and unacceptable".
The first trade union of the Criminal Enforcement Officers, the Autonomous Federal Criminal Union (UFAP/UNSA), called for "general mobilizations (...) to show the discontent and anger."
The management of the Penal Code and the Ministry of Justice stated that overtime increased sharply in 2009 and not all were in the budget. However, they guarantee that the remaining claims will be paid in January.
As the Ministry of Justice announced in the evening, Michèle Alliot-Marie sent a letter to the unions of the law enforcement officers guaranteeing that the payment was made in the next month.
"I am very well aware of the efforts of the staff to keep our criminal execution system functioning and to modernise it," said the Minister of Justice in this letter.
"I have ordered the management of the Penal Court to take immediate action so that such a situation, caused by the lack of assessment of the overtime due, does not recur in the future," added Mrs Alliot-Marie.
The December wage is therefore low, except for management staff who benefit from high service and target premiums, the UFAP/UNSA explains for which the "budget constraints" must be maintained.
"This is an absolute scandal," says the interregional trade union FO in Marseille, announcing that "all assemblies and convocations" should boycott up to new instructions.
"The staff do not go to work on Sundays and holidays when the hours of October in December are still not paid. This also applies to their overtime hours," also threatens the FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
"At a time when more and more tasks are being assigned to us without more staff being recruited, the attempt to enrich the staff's money is more than inappropriate," says the CGT-Gewerkschaft of Bordeaux.
According to trade unions, the situation is not the same in all regions; some are less affected than others.
In any case, however, it is wrong, says UFAP Secretary General Jean-François Forgett.
Obama believes he is always giving Christmas better gifts than he himself gets.
The American president, Barack Obama, who is going to spend Christmas with his family in the White House for the first time, has told the TV voice teacher Oprah Winfrey that he is always giving better gifts than he himself gets.
On a special broadcast broadcast on Sunday evening via the ABC channel, the president and his wife, Michelle, gave insights into how they will spend the holidays in their new illustrious home.
Even Bo, the small four-legged companion of the family, will be part of the game.
"Santa Claus also loves Bo," confirms Michelle Obama and adds that the dog also gets a gift of course.
Michelle Obama rejected her husband's claims about the quality of the gifts. "I made you beautiful gifts last year," she nodded the president.
"So please," he pleaded to her, pointing to the pearl chain of the First Lady: "And who gave you these?"
During this one-hour broadcast in a casual atmosphere with the well-known TV hostess who had supported Barack Obama so vehemently during his election campaign, the president and his wife also talked about gifts they loved most as a child.
Barack Obama remembered a bicycle with ten gears and also a basketball that his father, whom he rarely saw, had brought with him at Christmas from Kenya.
"I remember when my father visited us once for Christmas and brought me a basketball ball," said the president.
"It wasn't until much later in my life that I understood that I had this ball from him."
The First Lady remembered her dollhouse for her part.
"I didn't know how to arrange the furniture in a house at all, so I put them all on the wall instead of grouping them around the fireplace. But I loved this little dollhouse," said Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday operated again, RTL confirms that he was transferred to the artificial coma
Johnny Hallyday was again operated in Los Angeles due to significant "damage" after surgery in France. According to the people around him, the situation was "under control", although RTL confirmed that the singer was transferred to the artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rock musician was again operated on the night of Wednesday to Thursday at the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles, after the American doctors found "damages due to the operation of a disc attack" he had suffered in Paris on 26 November, according to his production company in Paris, which added that these injuries required a further surgery.
The singer's production company nevertheless wanted to clarify that the situation was "under control" and announced that a new medical opinion would be available in 48 hours at the latest.
According to RTL, the partner during the singer's last tour, Johnny Hallyday was transferred to an artificial coma to avoid "pain and complications".
However, it was only after 48 hours that one had a little more certainty about the patient’s condition when he opened his eyes that RTL added.
At the request of the AFP, there was neither a confirmation nor a comment from the production company.
RTL also confirms that "from certain sources" that after his first operation in Paris "no drainage" was laid.
The rocker had been operated in the international clinic of Parc Monceau because of a disc attack.
The surgery was scheduled for several days by neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known doctor who had already treated many stars.
This was not available on Thursday evening for comments to RTL.
After Johnny Hallyday's surgery, the singer was admitted to Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles on Monday due to a subsequent infection after the procedure.
The singer Eddy Mitchell, who is very close to Johnny Hallyday, felt to RTL on Thursday that his friend was just going through a "deep valley". However, he assured himself that he needed "no worries" to make the rock musician, since this is "a good fighter".
"He had called me before his flight to Los Angeles. I told him it was stupid to get on a plane after such an operation for 12 hours, which would not go like that," said Eddy Mitchell.
On Wednesday evening the singer's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, confirmed that Johnny Hallyday "reacted well to antibiotics" and that "the infection was contained".
Mr Camus also said that he had spoken to Laeticia, the singer's wife, and he felt no particular concern.
Nevertheless, the concern for the health of the singer had grown ever since he spent nine days in a hospital in July after he crashed on his yacht.
Two months later, to the general amazement of Johnny Hallyday's having a "small intestinal cancer surgery", it led to a slight infection.
At the end of September, the singer began his long "Tour 66" as a farewell tour.
Since then, however, every health problem has been commented extensively. Fans and journalists have not escaped the fact that the singer had trouble moving on stage.
It was not until mid-November that the people surrounding him had to deny a return to the hospital.
Euro-2009/Shortway: First place for Bousquet about his favorite distance
The Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, three-time medal winner at the 2009 World Swimming Championships, won an international title on Thursday about his favourite distance, 50m freestyle, at the Euro-2009 on the short track in Istanbul.
On the first day of this competition, the last time the polyurethane suits were allowed, there were only three world records, while a true record flood was expected.
One record was improved by the Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto over 4 x 200 m and the other two by Russia at 4 x 50 m positions of the men.
Too bad for Bousquet, who wanted to take the 50m freestyle after the world record, whose record he holds in the large basin (20.94).
At one of the two king's distances in swimming, 50m-free style, the 28-year-old Frenchman claimed in 20.53 sec.. in a final with ten swimmers at the start (usually there are eight) - a premiere at international level.
Bousquet defeated the Croats Duje Draganja (20.70) and the Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but he failed to break the world record (20.30) as planned.
"One can believe in ever greater, and in this case I said, if the world record is in my reach, I will try."
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers started in polyurethane clothing, which is banned from 1 January 2010.
With 238 world records since February 2008, these combinations end their epic in Istanbul, which began in 1999 at the same competition for the first time.
This time, the use of the combination has not been paid out for the German Paul Biedermann, double world champion in the pool this summer in Rome and the world record.
The young swimmer has not managed to improve his best time over 400m of freestyle (3:32.77), yet he has prevailed with the second best time in his career (3:34.55), before the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and the Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
"I didn't give everything this time.
I knew I couldn't reach a world record today, but I defended my title and fulfilled my task."
"Lobintsev will be a serious opponent in the future," said Biedermann.
USA : Tomb plate estimated at US$1.5 million at Zola
A Roman tomb plate, calculated by the French writer Emile Zola, was estimated to be US$1.5 million on Thursday, according to the art dealer Sotheby's.
This plate is two meters long and 63 cm high. It comes from the third century after Christ and has always been rated at 150,000 to 250,000 dollars.
The marble on which "four scenes of the Dionysus are depicted in a sophisticational architectural decoration, surrounded by satyrs and Bacchus figures, is a rare piece. There are only four or five of them in the world," said Florent Heinz, Vice President for Auctioning Roman and Egyptian Antiquities at Sotheby's, on Tuesday opposite the AFP.
It was sold among hundreds of pieces.
"The sale is still in progress, but this part is certainly what the buyers have offered the most for so far," says the speaker of Sotheby's, Dan Abernethy, opposite the AFP.
The discovery of this acquisition of the marble part by Emile Zola goes a long way.
The record was at home almost 300 years in Rome in the famous collection of the Borghese family, after which she appeared piece by piece at the French actress Cécile Sorel, who used it in her bathroom of her Paris hotel and at Paul Reynaud, Minister in the French Republic and President of the Council, before Marshal Pétain came to power.
The next fifty years are in the dark.
When searching the Louvre's database, Florent Heinz discovered that this record was part of an "Emile Zola heritage" which was opened in 1903, one year after the death of the author of "Thérèse Raquin" and the Fresko "Rougon-Macquart".
Zelaya's exit attempt from Honduras towards Mexico has been thwarted
On Thursday, Mexico had declared the conditions for the transfer of the overthrown Honduran President Manuel Zelaya to domestic soil as no longer compatible after the coup d'état had rejected it as unacceptable.
After a telephone conversation with President Zelaya at night, everything seems to indicate that there is a disagreement about the possibilities of carrying out this transfer, said Patricia Espinosa, Mexican Minister for Foreign Affairs.
According to the immigration authority, the plane provided by the Mexican government, which had arrived in Salvador on Wednesday for the transfer of M. Zelayas, had returned to its base.
The Putsch government wanted to require M. Zelaya to "dispose" and to ask him for political asylum abroad under the guidance of M. Zelaya.
The overthrown president, however, refused to do so, since he wished to return to Mexico as the most welcoming, official head of state.
The Putsch regime "has suffered a further failure by moving me to give up at my expense (...), they wanted me to give up," said on Thursday M. Zelaya to Radio Globo, in which he has often spoken since the beginning of the political crisis, which has lasted for five months in the Central American country.
I can stay here for ten years, here I have my guitar, added the fallen president, who had fled to the Brazilian Embassy of Tegucigalpa two and a half months ago, under the attack of some chords.
The Mexican Embassy has presented us with a request for guidance, but unfortunately we cannot accept it, as it does not include a request for asylum, had declared on Wednesday Oscar Raul Matute, Minister of Interior of the Putsch Government, to the Honduran radio HRN.
I do not seek asylum in any country at all, Manuel Zelaya had responded in an interview with the channel Telesur, whose seat is in Caracas.
A possible departure from Honduras, as he had underlined, would only take place as president of the Honduran people.
The rumors of a departure of Mr. Zelayas had mobilized the supporters of the overthrown president on Wednesday, who had opened up to the Brazilian Embassy and gathered around them, and the military there had increased its commitment.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticized the position of the Putsch government.
This, according to his assessment, reveals the marginal character of this government in the face of international standards.
Zelaya, who had approached the Socialist Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, had been overthrown on the 28th of June, on the day of the referendum he organised to prepare for his re-election, against the advice of the Supreme Court, the army and the Congress.
He had returned from exile in Costa Rica on 21 September and had fled to the Brazilian Embassy.
If he leaves it, he is arrested for treason, which he is accused of by the judiciary, the coup government says.
The coup president Roberto Micheletti succeeded in organising a presidential election on November 29 to replace M. Zelaya.
Porfirio Lobo was recognized by the United States in the course of the controversial election, but was rejected by the Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil.
Three days later, the Kogress had voted massively against Mr. Zelaya's return to office until the end of his mandate on January 27.
Wall Street on the rise, the trade balance of the US feeds optimism
The New York Stock Exchange closed on Thursday with a high figure, the figures of the American trade balance show a price recovery of the shares of the United States and their partners: the Dow Jones added 0.67%, the Nasdaq added 0.33%.
According to the numbers at the closing of the stock exchange, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has risen from 68.78 points to 10,405.83 points, the Nasdaq again dominated by technology, from 7,13 points to 2,190.06 points.
The extended Standard & Poor ́s 500 index was registered with 0.58% (6.40 points) on 1.102.35 points.
There are good news from various industries, judged Lindsey Piegza by FTN Financial.
However, this remains anecdotal under the premise that the market focuses only on "half-full glasses", she said.
According to Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors are mainly focused on the figures of the American trade balance, "which has an improvement in activity in the fourth quarter".
The United States' trade deficit fell by 7.6% in October compared to September to $32.9 billion.
By contrast, the analysts had expected a defitzuwach.
Imports as well as exports have increased.
The big news is the increase in the total volume of trade, especially in goods exports, reflecting the economic growth of the main trading partners of the United States, said Christopher Cornell of Business Research Economy.com.
In return, the unemployment reports in the United States increased in the last week, despite all expectations, reaching the level of 474,000 questions.
However, the average of new jobseekers "falled to the bottom of the year during the last four weeks," said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market has fallen.
The profitability of government bonds rose to 3.482 % compared with 3.432 % on Tuesday evening, and the profitability of bonds to 30 years was 4,492 % compared with 4,408 % on the previous evening.
Cuba: Hundreds of partisans standing in power whistle "Damen in Weiss"
On Thursday, several hundred partisans standing in Cuban power beat out the wives of political prisoners gathered in Havana for the purpose of the World Human Rights Day and also thwarted another rally, resulting in the temporary arrest of a good dozen dissidents.
Around the forty "Damen in Weiss", wives or neighbouring political prisoners, were on the open road of partisans from the government under Raul Castro, just when they were on the foot march to the center of the capital to demand the liberation of the political prisoners, a journalist of the AFP confirmed.
Down with the Yankies!, "Selders!", "the road belongs to the revolutionaries!", "Fidel and Raul live!" the powerful partisans with raised fists scandalized the dissidents.
The latter were escorted by civilian agents who had appeared to "guarantee their protection".
A similar demonstration against the "Damen in Weiss" had taken place on the eve of Havana, where neither injured nor arrested occurred.
On the other hand, a dozen dissidents in the Vedado district, who also opened up for the demonstration on Thursday in the face of the International Human Rights Day, were temporarily arrested by civilian police, confirmed by a reporter from the AFP.
According to this journalist, the dissidents of the government, who were bent out by the partisans, have been forced to enter civil vehicles under force.
The temporary detention of dissidents under such circumstances is usually limited to only a few hours.
As a candidate for the Sakharov Prize awarded by the European Parliament in 2005, the Women in Weiss have organized an unapproved march for the purpose of "the request for the release of all political prisoners", the number of which, according to the dissident list, has about 200 persons, says Laura Pollan, one of the leaders whose husband Hector Maceda is incarcerated for 20 years.
M. Maceda belongs to the group of 75 Cuban dissidents detained in March 2003, of whom 53 are still behind bars.
The Cuban authorities consider the opponents of the regime to be "soldiers" or "agents" in the service of the declared archenemy, the United States.
A rarity in itself is that Cuban television reported on the demonstration events that took place on Thursday between militant pro-government fighters and "counter-revolutionary" reports.
Cuba, led by a united party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of vilifying rights and freedoms, in particular freedom of expression.
Crazy kills 80-year-olds with the knife and leaves 5 injured in Clichy-la-Garenne
A maniac armed with two knives killed an eighty-year-old in the city centre of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine) on Friday afternoon and injured five more people.
According to the first data of the survey, the 28-year-old attacker had injured the eighty-year-old for an unexplained cause in or before a pharmacy on the Jean-Jaures Boulevard with two knives and this, according to police information, in the presence of witnesses.
The old man, born in 1929, is reported to be responsible for the police syndicate Alliance in the hospital for the consequences of his injuries.
In or before the same pharmacy, he had a couple with a pregnant woman in front of him.
The man, about in the tridents, intervened and was injured.
The first two victims were seriously injured in the hospital, where the eighty-year-old died.
The other injured person floats in danger of life, since, according to him, police sources, apparently vital organs were affected.
The pregnant woman has become ill as a result of the events and according to a police source she has been hospitalized in a "shock state".
The armed man who seemed to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs, according to police reports, should immediately have eluded the road, Jean Jaures, the same boulevard.
He would have injured two other passersby, apparently by chance: one thirty-year-old and one forty-year-old, with the latter of both heavy.
The scenario stayed in the dark in the evening.
He had been armed with two carnival knives, which he carried crossed behind his back, explained on site Arnaud Pressé, a responsible member of the Syndicate Alliance of the Hauts-de-Seine area.
Several passers-by, including young people, are said to have tried, according to the witnesses determined by the AFP, to bind the madman.
I saw a guy in the tridents with a green vest.
Three youths tried to step in.
They couldn't do it because the guy was well built, Alberto, a waitress of a nearby bar.
A horde has fallen over him, he added, including a city police officer who broke his wrist.
Still on the Jean-Jaures Boulevard, at the number 61, two city policemen, including their superior, tried to arrest the armed man and were injured with knife sticks, so police reports.
The event took place in one of Clichy-la-Garenne's main battles, where a number of shops are located.
Passersby have come to me to inform me that there is an injured person outside.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old person lying on the floor, I brought her into the first-aid position and noticed a claping wound in the stomach area, said Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist, the AFP.
Five minutes later, a second person, about thirty years old, was injured by cuts.
Officials of the state police finally arrested the man who didn't carry any ID.
Nanterre's Public Prosecutor's Office has ordered the case investigation by Hauts-de Seine (SDPJ 92).
The madman was hospitalized on Thursday night.
In view of his condition, he has not yet been heard in court.
A police source does not rule out his being transferred to a mental institution.
According to another police source, there were six police officers to arrest him at the police commission in Clichy, where he had been deported.
He was "in a state of exasperation" like "all mentally confused of this kind, in which the forces set themselves free during the tantrum".
USA: Polanski's lawyer once again demands the suspension of the prosecution
The lawyer of the French-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski has repeatedly demanded, on Thursday in Los Angeles (California, western United States), that the prosecution be brought against his client, who is currently in court at his place of residence in Switzerland for more than 30 years of moral abuse.
Chad Hummel, lawyer of the director of the "Pianist", denounced gross procedural errors before three judges of the appeal court in the second district of California at the time of the negotiations in 1977.
I demand punishment on the spot, said M. Hummel, before adding that the conduct of Judge Laurence Riddenband, commissioned at the time of the trial, "let a cold man run down his back".
According to him, before the judge fell his judge, the judge had discussed with a prosecutor who said that Roman Polanski had earned a breeding house -- which represented a serious procedural error.
This discussion was raised in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and wanted" (Roman Polanski: persecuted and coveted), especially by the questioning prosecutor David Wells.
M. Wells had finally declared at the end of September to have the authors of the documentary film "believed".
If the Court refuses to suspend the criminal proceedings, Mr Hummel will ask for the conduct of a trial which would enable him to present the evidence of his argument.
The indictment has, for its part, repeated the evidence already presented in the first instance, i.e. that a discussion on the annulment of the facts imposed on the accused cannot be seriously considered as long as Roman Polanski does not appear in court.
The 76-year-old director had fled the United States in 1978, even before the announcement of the penalty for "illegal sexual relations" with a 13-year-old.
Since then, he has not travelled to the United States.
The deputy prosecutor of Los Angeles County, Phyllis Asayama, had explained that Roman Polanski "must be there to attend the trial".
Would you like to spread the message in this matter, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other defendants, who are a means of escape?, asks Mrs Asayma.
In her opinion, "the filmmaker asks the court for a favor and thus despises its authority".
One of the three judges – who now have 90 days to announce their decision – even pointed out "that there are other alternatives to escape".
Hummel was not the only one who had requested the suspension of the prosecution against Roman Polanski.
The attorney of Samantha Geimer, the victim, once again demanded the abolition of the criminal proceedings.
She recalled that her client would no longer tolerate being harassed by any resurgence of the affair Polanski and added: "No one in this room can say that this procedure was just.
Thirty-two years are enough".
Roman Polanski was arrested on September 26 in Switzerland, on the occasion of an American arrest warrant.
After spending two months behind bars, he was then sentenced to a possible extradition to his house arrest in his chalet in Gstaad.
Wall Street is slowed by the rise of the dollar and closes without price.
The New York Stock Exchange closed on Friday without a price in a market that was torn down between better indicators than envisaged in the USA and an increase in the dollar: Dow Jones won 0.63%, but Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
On the basis of the final figures available at closure, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has risen by 65.67 points to 10.471.50 points, while the technologically dominated Nasdaq has dropped 0.55 points to 2.190.31 points.
The extended Standard & Poor's 500 index has risen by 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1,106.41 points.
"To be honest, the market is quite quiet," Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management noted.
"It remains very limited, the volume of trade has become very low and I think this will remain so until the end of the year."
The trend was supported by the publication of better economic indicators than envisaged, which "have contributed to improving the market view towards the solidity of the recovery of the economy", the analysts from Charles Schwab summarized.
In the USA retail sales increased by 1.3% in November, thus already two months in a row and much more than planned.
Furthermore, US consumers' confidence improved significantly in December to 73.4 compared to 66.4 in the previous month, according to the Michigan University Index Preview.
However, the indices were slowed down by a new rise in the dollar rate, which has reached the highest level compared to the euro for two months, thus pushing 'the sectors susceptible to the economic situation down', said Owen Fitzpatrick, Deutsche Bank.
The technological values have thus lost something to the ground.
The bond market has fallen.
The return on the Treasury bond over 10 years increased by 3,540% on Wednesday evening compared to 3.482% and that of the bond over 30 years to 4.497% compared to 4.492% on the previous day.
Election of Miss World again in South Africa
After a month of tour through South Africa, the 112 candidates for the title of Miss World will cross the last hurdle on Saturday to realize their dream: to be chosen to be the most beautiful woman in the world and this in front of a billion television viewers.
During this great beauty fair, which will be held for the second time in a row in the Johannesburg area, five of them have already got their ticket to the semi-final.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma from Canada were named Miss Sportive or Miss Topmodel during her African stay.
This was a true strudel of pleasures.
Beautiful cities to visit, such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Hoorn, were simply extraordinary.
I have seen many things and made lots of experiences!, said Miss Sierra Leone with full enthusiasm.
This competition takes place for the ninth time in South Africa and will be broadcast live from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, on Saturday, from 5 p.m. (15 p.m.).
I couldn't imagine a better country to hand over my crown.
This experience was simply fascinating.
I'm happy to have had this experience twice, Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova underlined in the heat of South Africa's summer.
For the young Russian, her second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges of experience with candidates and the rediscovery of "breathtaking landscapes".
After a month of galas, rehearsals, meetings with the press and Safari, the Miss now focuses on the competition.
The Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to step into the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, who was elected in 2000 and will also be present in this election, as well as to imitate Aishwarya Rai, who was elected in 1994 and became both Bollywoodstars.
Of course, it is the dream of every woman to be crowned once as the most beautiful woman in the world, but it is not just about the appearance here.
We are ambassadors of our country and I want to come home with the crown, Miss India throws in a broad smile.
According to the organizers, this 59th edition will be underlined with music and dance.
The candidates defil in traditional dresses and not to forget in the swimsuit.
The performance is presented by a television hostess, Chinesewoman Angela Chow, ex-beauty queen from South Africa, Michelle McLean and a director of the Miss World Committee, Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it knows to receive the world with an almost unsurpassed warmth and pride, says Julia Morley, Chairman of Miss World.
The candidates, like last year, made a safari, visited the famous township in Soweto, but this time they took the bike and the local kitchen.
However, the meeting with South African President Jacob Zuma, who gave them his hand, was quite extraordinary.
Not usual for a head of state, Miss Sierra Leone noted.
Their most beautiful memory, however, undoubtedly remains the draw in Cape Town (South West) to the World Cup in June 2010, a kind of country to advertise for this event a little more.
I'm wrong about people I could probably never get close to.
I will certainly return to the 2010 World Championship, promised Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
The news about Johnny Hallyday is "very positive" according to his son David
The news about Johnny Hallyday is "very positive", his son David assured him on Friday when he arrived at Los Angeles Airport, where he visited his father, who has been in the hospital for a few days.
The news is very positive.
He is very strong, everything is going very well, explained David Hallyday to the press when he left the plane, where he arrived from Paris shortly after 1 p.m. local time (21 p.m. CET).
The son of the singer, who made a relaxed impression, assured him that he would go to Cedars-Sinaï hospital as soon as possible, and that Johnny Hallyday was transferred to Paris on Monday for a bacterial follow-up infection following an operation on a disc incident on November 26th.
The singer was "moved into an artificial coma this night in Los Angeles to relieve his severe pain and to carry out his treatment, the press service announced.
Johnny Hallyday was transferred by the doctors at the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles to an artificial coma, into which he was handed in on Monday for a bacterial follow-up infection after a disc surgery in Paris on 26 November.
The singer had to undergo an operation again during the night from Wednesday to Thursday due to the sickening changes caused by the last intervention.
His wife Laeticia attended a school event on Friday morning at the French high school in Los Angeles, where her daughter Jade goes to school, a photographer from the AFP found out.
The head of the Department of Orthopedic and Traumatological Surgery at the Hôpital Pitié-Salpêtrière, Yves Catoné, announced that he would visit the singer on Monday at the hospital in Los Angeles.
The producer has severely burdened the neurosurgeon Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, who performed the singer on November 26 at the Clinique internationale du parc Monceau in Paris.
We were told that he executed the purest massacre.
The Los Angeles surgeons said they were totally upset, said Mr. Camus.
I've heard of the possibility of initiating a trial, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus believes that Johnny Hallyday has "traveled far too quickly and this with the permission of the Parisian surgeon to Los Angeles".
I made a personal phone call with this doctor who assured me that he considered this journey completely unproblematic, which surprised me very much, since I already have two disc operations behind me, he added.
Shortly before, he announced to RTL that the singer had apparently left the hospital "without drainage without everything" after the operation.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is very well known in the artist's environment.
He had the actress Marie Trintignant, who operated a few days before her death in Vilnius, in a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine where he practiced at that time.
In 2007, he also operated on actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to resorb a hematoma after a brain hemorrhage.
But he is also a doctor with a dubious reputation, who has already been sentenced several times for failure of surgery and not to forget, for tax evasion and fraud.
Me Olivier Metzner, lawyer of the Medical Board, called him "a man without a scruple" who has to be "regularly" accountable to the board of directors and is "everything other than recommendable".
After a few days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux made an explanation about his lawyer, Me David Koubbi, on Friday.
He explained that the intervention would have been "perfect" and the post-operative investigations would have been "normal".
The operation "did not induce bleeding and therefore does not require drainage," he added.
In any case, the tour of the singer, whose health problems have been exaggerating since last summer, seems to be in question.
It is quite clear that it is a bit too short for a continuation of the tour on 8 January (in Amiens), said Mr Camus.
The party alliance UDF (Union for French Democracy) becomes energetic and urges the party Nouveau Centre to stop using its seal
The party alliance, supervised by François Bayrou's MoDem Party, has responded strongly on Friday to an attempt to take the seal, the party once founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, from the chairman of the Nouveau Centre, Hervé Morin, and called on him, under the threat of legal persecution, to no longer use this seal on any document.
Hervé Morin publicly announces his intention to take over this UDF seal because he believes that François Bayrou would not be worthy to defend this political heritage after he had given his hand to the left.
By the way, the Minister of Defence, whose party partner is the UMP, wanted to reaffirm this strategy before the NC National Council on Saturday.
In order to emphasise his efforts, he had received the support of the Member Hervé de Charette (former UMP, now at NC) who claimed the ownership of the UDF brand, since he first applied for this brand in 2004 at the "Institut national de la propriété industrieelle".
However, the branch of the UDF party alliance, which was supervised by François Bayrous's friends, broke the silence and made it clear that they could not be expropriated and set a deadline for the Minister and the MP, under the threat of judicial persecution, to stop using this seal and transfer the property rights of the brand to them.
In the last few days, you have made numerous declarations that you would propose to your political movement to accept the UDF seal to +take over+, the party alliance wrote in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 office members, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez, the MoDem Party and Senator Jean Arthuis des centristisches Bündnissen.
You probably also believed that you have the right to have the name of this movement +Nouveau centre+, the slogan + today's UDF+ printed on their political material as well as on the homepage of your website.
As you know, you have no right to use this seal, declared the UDF's office and called on the party NC "to remove without delay the mention of the name UDF from all material as well as from (their) website".
In addition, Hervé de Charette was required to "transfer the trademark's property rights to its legal rightholders".
If you refuse to do so, we will bring an action against you to ensure respect for the law and to defend the legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories warned.
In their letter, they stress that "UDF" has been a full political movement since 1978 and reminds that Morin and his friends have "made the choice" to leave it in 2007 in order to set up a competing movement, as had already been done in 2002 to establish the party "UMP".
The Nouveau Centre Party therefore has no rights to use the Union pour la démocratie française (UDF) seal, according to the signatories.
They continue to recall that the last UDF Congress in 2007 adopted the three-year membership of the MoDem Party and the establishment of an office to defend "material and moral interests" of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the office continues, "he was not a member of the UDF" but of the UMP at the time he applied for the brand name for three years.
It benefits in a scandalous and fraudulent way, from the lack of deposit of the acronym UDF to do so for itself.
Furthermore, you should bear in mind that this recklessness is the best way to turn into a crime, and ironize the NC strategy: "It seems more dignified to us in politics and in life to make a name for ourselves instead of trying to get out of the anonymity by fraudulently adopting a name on which you have no legal claims."
Affaire Liliane Bettencourt : François-Marie Banier is convicted of exploitation of weakness
On Friday, the Court of Justice of Nanterre decided to assess the artist François-Marie Banier in order to determine whether, as the daughter of the billionaire Liliane Bettencourt claims, he has used a weak moment of the eighty-year-olds in order to swallow some of her assets.
The 62-year-old photographer, who is known for his star photos, will have to take responsibility for the exploitation of weakness in court on 15 and 16 April 2010, a crime that will be punished with a maximum sentence of three years and a fine of 375,000 euros.
This decision means that there will in fact be a trial in this affair worthy of the saga of one of France's richest families, where mother and daughter fatten themselves and at the same time have the reins of the cosmetic empire L'Oréal in their hands.
However, the 15th Chamber of Penalties also ordered a medical examination of the 87-year-old Liliane Bettencourt, which is carried out jointly by three doctors.
The heir and principal shareholder of L'Oréal have so far refused to submit to such an investigation, especially under the conditions laid down by the Prosecutor's Office of Nanterre during the investigations.
The doctors appointed on Friday will present a report before 10 March 2010 which will clearly indicate whether and at what times Liliane Bettencourt may have been in a state of weakness.
I think she's going to undergo these investigations.
I'll talk to her, said Mrs. Beddencourt's lawyer, Me Georges Kiejman, after the trial.
As for the lawyer of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Me Olivier Metzner, he is very satisfied with the decision of the court.
This is an excellent news (...). The opinion will prove that he (banister) has manipulated this old lady who needs to be protected, he confirmed.
For two years, the only daughter of Liliane Bettencourt has initiated a criminal lawsuit against François-Marie Banier, photographer and all-round artist, accusing him of having exploited her mother's weakness for years to swallow donations of a total of one billion euros in bank cheques, insurance policies or paintings.
Liliane Bettencourt, for her part, had always refused to be manipulated by the photographer she sees as a longtime friend.
Although the court would have to examine the admissibility of the action initiated by Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers, the lawyers' plaintiffs led to a large family debacle on Friday.
The lawyer of Liliane Bettencourt has called herself on three letters sent by his client to her notary (1999, 2003 and 2005), in which she wrote that she had mistrusted the husband of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers.
According to her lawyer, Liliane Bettencourt added the following: "Please explain to my daughter that for fifteen years, I wrote to Banier once or twice a day.
Françoise has never been able to speak since her marriage."
The Nanterre Public Prosecutor's Office once again considers that the plaintiff had no right to react in this way, especially because in recent days a guardian judge has refused her application to initiate a judicial procedure against her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "is fully legal, is not under protection and has no guardian.
No one has the right to act in their place," confirmed the public prosecutor, Marie-Christine Daubigney.
The court has now decided to give a judgment after the trial on the admissibility of Mme Bettencourt-Meyers took place.
Manager revolution or the end of the Strategic Early Education?
If nothing changes in the leadership of the big French companies, our struggle for the development of economic intelligence has been for nothing ...
For over a decade, the attitude of managing large companies in relation to its employees, said the position of the companies vis-à-vis the consumers before the marketing revolution: It is for the staff to join "values" determined the best, as it was previously designed to impose on the consumer products designed by the technicians at the factory.
By placing the customer at the heart of the company, the marketing revolution has given the strategies of conquering the markets in the place ... although the authoritarian temptation products separate factors to impose customer preferences again regularly!
Demobilization of employees can lead to fatal demoralization.
The suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are just the tip of a much larger phenomenon that affects employees in particular.
This demobilisation has a negative impact on the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, in particular those of R&D and, more decisively, those of economic intelligence.
Indeed, the IE (Intelligence Economique = Economic Intelligence) "calls on all parties involved to take a proactive approach and a forward-looking approach"; it claims by its employees a commitment that completely contradicts the instructions of authoritarian management.
That is why we are calling for a corporate revolution, which would consist of placing employees in the middle of the company's concerns on an equal footing with customers.
The very limited benefits of internal opinion polls
Will the internal opinion polls, as the questionnaire, which Orange submitted to its wage recipients, stimulate this revolution in management practices?
I'm afraid not.
- First of all, because I could see that, given a new situation, the whole structure finally, after many detours, got to do first of all what it always did.
Also because authoritarianism - one of the pathologies of power- proportional to the importance of its own failure increases.
And finally, because most leaders have a strongly simplified idea of human behavior.
Its interpretation of psychology is mechanistic.
Through intellectual comfort, they take over the old behaviorist theory, which was recently reactivated by the American "Neurosciences" and unwittingly spread by research institutes and by the media.
Thus and by suggesting that it is possible to use the "Hebel" (sic) to engage employees, a recent Le Figaro.fr survey of Ipsos strengthens the leadership in a position towards a mechanistic control system that is unsuitable for today's world.
Identify and measure the mobilization factors
Instead, a corporate revolution necessary for the smooth functioning of modern companies requires the adoption of a definitive view of human behaviour.
It consists in integrating a basic protocol into any consideration or practice of governance: for wage earners, commitment to the company is only possible if it clearly appears to be a means of achieving part of their dreams, ambitions and projects.
Currently, only the studies from the multifunctional analysis take this concept of the motivation of the employees.
These studies have shown that they assess their business on the basis of a specified Doxa that allows them to estimate what it offers them to achieve their life goals through their perceived image of the company.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of these mobilization factors, the managers of the companies can control, predict and anticipate their "social performance" and place their human resource management in the right place again.
They thus create a fertile soil that is favourable to the coordinated development of robust and efficient economic intelligence.
The speech of Oslo: the "just war" brings Obama praise from the right
American rights welcomed the speech given by Barack Obama in Oslo on Friday and were pleased that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize defended the term "just war" against the enemies of the United States.
The Conservatives who ridiculed the award to Obama on 9 October applauded the President's speech this time, the example of the former Vice-Presidential candidate at the 2008 elections, Sarah Palin.
I liked what he said, said Palin, the face of the right wing of the Republican Party in the daily U.S. Today and added that she herself spoke of a "sometimes necessary" war in her memoirs published.
The war is of course the last thing I think Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
We have to stop the terrorists down there, she says.
Obama, who inherited two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, tried on Thursday in Oslo to justify the use of violence; one way to explain his decision nine days ago to send 30,000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, expressed the opinion that the president had done "very good work" in Oslo.
I found that the speech was really very good, the former president of the House of Representatives, who particularly acknowledged the reference to "the existence of evil in the world" in the words of Obama.
In some parts, Ginrich, who was interviewed in the radio show "The Takeaway", felt that this speech was entirely historical.
The previous Member, who is considered by some to be a possible candidate for the Republican nomination for the 2012 presidential election, said that he was pleased to have seen a "president of the left" who reminded members of the Nobel Committee that they "could not be free and could not afford a price for peace if the use of violence did not exist".
For Michael Gerson, former writer of George W. Bush and editor of the Washington Post, Obama gave "a very American speech".
In addition to being a "cosmopolitan", as "he always does", he has "spoken like an American president" when he pointed out that Europeans "live in a security bubble that they did not create themselves and do not do much for their protection," says Gerson.
Among the few unconvinced rights, former UN ambassador John Bolton, a falcon of the Bush era, referred to the speech on the National Review Online website as "tired, high-end and uninspiring".
On the left of the President, the democratic representative Dennis Kucinich is concerned about how Barack Obama defends the withdrawal of the armed forces.
If you pack the war under the cover of justice, you can simply justify the massacre against the innocent, he warns.
However, the press of the moderated left remains on the President's side.
The Los Angeles Times, which still believes that the Nobel Prize was prematurely awarded to Obama, called the speech itself "Monumental Work" for a speaker like him who is known for his talent.
The speech in Oslo "offers an agenda for managing international decisions against conflict, poverty and oppression", says the Californian daily.
The New York Times believes that Obama "promulgated the necessary discourse" and calls his speech "dark and exemplary at the same time".
Distance driver: Three marathons for an agreement that secures the supply for Christmas
After a three-week negotiating marathon, the trade unions of the road association and the TLF - the only employers' organisation that remained until the end - came to an agreement on Friday evening that would put an end to the strike order and the threatening severe supply deficit at Christmas.
At the signing meeting on Friday evening, the State Secretary responsible for transport Dominique Bussereau "welcome" the agreement, which was opened on Wednesday morning after several weeks of negotiations.
After a second night of negotiations, the negotiators separated on the early Friday morning, hoping to sign the agreement quickly in the late morning.
Although the three employers' associations (FNTR, Unostra and OTRE) had left the meeting.
However, more than six hours passed from the beginning of the meeting at 11:00 a.m. until the conclusion of the agreement and only at 18:00 a.m. the agreement was signed.
The conflict "had caused a great deal of damage to the companies" and "it was to be feared that it would affect the holidays at the end of the year," said Bussereau.
The agreement provides for a 4% increase in wages for the lowest wages (local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest wage groups (international transport).
The hourly rate for employees with the lowest wages thus rises from EUR 8.72 to EUR 9.06.
"That's not very much, but we start small first," said Patrice Clos (FO).
The activists are now required to stop blocking the supply centres.
"There will probably always be some opponents who are not satisfied with the agreement," he adds.
TLF President Philippe Grillot spoke of a "good agreement", although it was "difficult to grant these wage increases in the face of international competition".
According to him, the increase is EUR 170 per month for the low and between EUR 100 and EUR 120 for the high wage groups.
"This agreement is based on common sense and respect for employees," says Maxime Dumont (CFDT), whereas Thierry Douine (CFTC) spoke of "an historic agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) spoke on this subject about "an acceptable compromise".
The agreement also provides for an increase of 3% in travel costs and the maintenance of the total road transport budget in the first half of 2010, which will enable the issue of 13th month salary and the modernisation of collective agreements to be addressed in particular.
Mr Bussereau recalled that "the reduction in employers' contributions of EUR 100 million" was the subject of a government amendment to the 2009 draft law on adjusted finances, which was adopted by the National Assembly on the night of Thursday to Friday.
The government demands "an identical" vote from the Senate.
The signature of the TLF allows the agreement to apply initially to the companies affiliated to this organisation and then to apply to the entire professional status in the event of an extension by the Minister of Labour.
This will be the case "in a short time", Bussereau assures.
The opposition of the employers' associations can only delay the procedure.
The FNTR Association denounced a "fraud trade" because the EUR 100 million "had already been promised to the sector to offset some of the carbon tax".
The State Secretary for Transport forced us to negotiate as soon as possible, but not on the basis of a joint analysis, but not to dispel the goose-eating foods on the approaching Christmas days, the Unostra complains.
For the Association Otre, the agreement "is threatening to create a large grave for small and medium-sized companies in the industry over the next 12 months".
Line RER A: Disturbances at this weekend, unions dissatisfied with the proposals of RATP
The disruptions on the RER A line, the largest expressway network in France for the Paris metropolitan area and the Île-de-France, continued on the weekend, while a meeting on Friday, the 2nd strike day between the trade unions and the management of the RATP (independent Paris passenger transport administration) continued to keep strikers waiting with their demands for wage increases.
At this important shopping weekend before Christmas there were no trains between 10:00 and 20:00. On the central section (between La Défense and Nation) only one of two trains and outside the central section was only one of four trains ready for use.
The connection to the trains of the SNCF was interrupted in Nanterre Préfecture, which forced travellers to switch.
The department store chain Galeries Lafayette, which counts 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that "the RATP is trying to connect the large shops with traffic technology".
Line RER A runs through the Paris metropolitan area from west to east.
The route section of the RATP connects Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre as well as Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one in two trains at the main time of traffic were scheduled, and almost none during the low time of traffic.
As was the case on Thursday, there was no human rush on the platform, as the residents of Île-de-France had adjusted to the situation.
So early in the morning, the train station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was far less crowded than usual, especially because of the lack of high school students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, engineer (29), said that he would have been extra "an hour and a half earlier to get to work on time".
The SNCF, which had planned for the care of travellers by officials and officers, pointed out that there had been no shortages at the Saint-Lazare station.
The trains operated by the SNCF on line RER A or towards Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or departed from Saint-Lazare station to ensure the connection to the metros.
On Saturday and Sunday, general meetings of the strikers took place again, during which the results which the associations had classified as "necessary" after the meeting with the leader on Friday afternoon.
The RER managing director proposed the specific drafting of a protocol for Line RER A with regard to all relevant aspects, working hours, careers, etc.
However, this is not what the drivers want. According to Thierry Garon (Sud), they demand a long-due wage supplement.
The CGT was outraged that the RATP itself puts its wage proposals in brackets and stressed that the leader's point "is unable to solve a problem, while this was also possible for the long-distance drivers and the SNCF."
The RATP made it clear that a new meeting on the "comprehensive examination of working conditions" was scheduled for Monday.
This also shows the associations that the company "ignores the weekend drivers".
In the morning, about 150 drivers visited the establishment of a committee in Paris.
Once again, it was the leading point that so far rejected any discussion during the strike and suggested a meeting after a calming of the situation.
On Tuesday, the conflict threatened to expand after a prior announcement by Unsa and Indépendants on the RER B line.
The associations demand a wage supplement of 120 (Unsa) to 150 Euros, of which 30 Euros are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud, Indépendants). In addition, they complain about the deterioration of working conditions on this route, where millions of travellers travel daily.
The drivers of the RER line, who have years of professional experience, receive a gross wage of 2,200 to 2,700 euros and a salary supplement of 600 to 650 euros for shift services as well as Sundays and holidays.
Turkish Constitutional Court dissolves pro-Kurdish party. Decision with serious consequences
On Friday, the Turkish Constitutional Court announced the dissolution of the country's pro-Kurdish main party; a decision that immediately followed the angry demonstrations in the Kurdish community in the south-east of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision threatens to make the work of the government extremely difficult, which is trying to reach the Kurdish community to put an end to the conflicts that have been going on for 25 years.
The "Party for a Democratic Society" (DTP) was dissolved as it had become a "place for activities which are detrimental to the independence of the state and its indivisible unity", said the President of the Constitutional Court Hasim Kiliç four days after the decision against the press.
According to Kiliç, the decision had been taken unanimously by 11 judges, with a majority of seven votes required to impose dissolution. He also pointed out that 37 of the party’s leaders, including Ahmet Türk, and Aysel Tugluk, parliamentarian, were excluded from political action for five years.
Furthermore, the judge announced the abolition of parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Turk and Tugluk, as well as the confiscation of the Party's property.
The DTP now has 21 seats in Parliament (of 550).
The party leaders said before the ruling that parliamentarians would rather leave Parliament than meet as non-partisan parliamentarians.
The decision followed a trial initiated in 2007 by the prosecutor of the Turkish federal court Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya. He accused the DTP of following the "wisdoms" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which is considered by Ankara and many other countries to be a terrorist organisation.
Numerous observers believe that the DTP is the legal political window of the PKK rebels.
However, the party assures that it has "no connection" to the PKK, refuses to call it a terrorist organisation and calls on the government to negotiate.
The ruling of the Constitutional Court runs between the Government, seeking to meet the Kurdish community and to propose a series of measures to strengthen the rights of the Kurds in order to defuse the support of the PKK by the Kurds and to put an end to the conflicts.
The leaders of the DTP confirm that a resolution could lead to a resumption of tensions in Southeast Anatolia, where numerous demonstrations against PKK Chief Abdullah Öcalan's conditions of detention had led to conflicts with the police in recent weeks.
Since the court's announcement, thousands of demonstrators have gathered in front of the DTP's premises in the million-dollar city of Diyarbakir in the southeast, which is populated mainly by Kurds.
Ordinary forces used tear gas grenades and water jets when the demonstrators began to throw molotow cocktails and stones.
Hundreds of people also demonstrated in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Türk assumed that the decision of the court "will deepen despair even further".
"Turkey cannot resolve this question (Kurdish, note d. editorial) on the basis of the ban of a party," he explained to the press.
The government, consisting of a party that emerged from the Islamist movement, also regretted the decision.
"We oppose the closure of the parties on principle.
This does not solve the problems," said energy minister Taner Yildiz.
"This decision is a torpedoing of the democratic openness promoted by the government," said political market observer Ahmet Island.
"You can obviously look at a reaction of the PKK," he adds.
On Thursday, the PKK announced an attack three days earlier, killing seven soldiers in the north of Turkey. This was one of the most brutal attacks in recent months.
The snowfall can come
A really crisp winter, that's what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
Not because he wants to harass the citizens, says the winter shift manager of the FES.
But so that its employees can try out and master the entire vehicle technology.
On the weekend, according to meteorologists, it could be this far for the first time.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are available to take care of snow and ice.
In doing so, the FES is proceeding according to a precise plan.
As soon as it snows in Frankfurt and temperatures are below zero, 20 so-called A-tracks are driven off by large-scale distribution vehicles, explains Brauburger.
These include main traffic and transit roads such as the Neue Weg and the Hanauer Landstraße.
But also fire brigade accesses, public transport routes, pedestrian zones and tracks with gradients, such as the Atzelbergstraße.
The service of the FES starts at three o'clock in the morning
The approximately 1040 kilometers would have to be sprinkled in a maximum of three hours with moisture salt, which is better bonded.
That is why the FES starts at three o'clock at night, "so that the routes are free until professional traffic starts".
It would be difficult if it didn't snow until 7.30.
Then we have a problem, says the Winter Service Manager, "because then no one is ready to give way to the scattered vehicles".
Only after that, if it does not continue to snow, are access and development roads, including the Council of Beil Road, on the row.
The last priority is side and side roads.
There will be complaints, Brauburger knows.
At five o'clock in the morning, the foot people of the FES are on their way, danger points and transitions are given priority.
In most cases, the FES could not take care of all cycle paths.
There is a special service in Frankfurt that keeps the bridges in focus from 22 to 4.30 a.m., says Brauburger.
As it gives on this fast smoothness, as soon as the temperature falls below two degrees, the scatter is on the move.
If necessary, he will also be called by the police.
The Cradle of the Dinosaurs
Tawa hallae looked like many other carnivorous dinosaurs: The two-meter-long and 1.50-meter-large animal ran on two powerful hind legs, had a long skull with sharp, curved teeth, short arms with sickles and a long tail.
If the species had lived a few million years later, it would have been nothing special.
But Tawa hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these body characteristics, reports Sterling Nesbitt from the University of Texas in Austin and colleagues in the journal Science of Thursday.
The animal lived about 215 million years ago in today's New Mexico, which was then on the equator in a dry zone of the supercontinent Pangea.
Tawa opens a new window for early evolution of dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
He shows us much about the relationship, the spread and characteristics of the early dinosaurs.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other paleontologists began digging on the Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico.
We sometimes found a dozen dinosaur bones in one day, which is unprecedented for deposits from the Trias, reports team member Randall Irmis from the Utah Museum of Natural History.
Some of the bones quickly identified the researchers as a new species.
During the excavation they assembled the remains of a total of five individuals.
Fund confirms theories on Dino Early History
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt it is an extraordinary find: "Dinosaurier fossils from the trias are extremely rare, usually you will find only single fragments."
Other dinosaur experts do not necessarily share the enthusiasm.
Especially spectacular is this find not, but it confirms some theories about the early history of dinosaurs, says Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
After the current teaching, the dinosaurs first appeared some 230 million years ago.
However, many of the oldest fossils are incomplete, which is why the assignment of these ur-dinos is mostly controversial.
For example, the experts debate when the lizards split into their three main development lines: the carnivorous theropods, which later included the tyrannosaurus rex, the Velociraptor and also the birds, the four-legged sauropods and their relatives, and the plants eating Ornithischia (bird pool sour), which included, for example, the species Triceratops and Stegosaurus.
After the analysis of Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa hallae is an original theropode.
He has an interesting combination of primitive and progressive properties, says Nesbitt.
At the skull of Tawa hallae, for example, the researchers found evidence of air sacs, such as the descendants of the theropods, the birds.
Thanks to the air sacs, the breathing of the birds is more efficient than that of the mammals.
At Tawa hallae the bones of the spine were apparently partly filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive theropode with air bags, says Randall Irmis.
Since the related line of the huge sauropods later also had air bags and lightweight bones, probably the common ancestor of both groups had already produced this useful innovation.
At least three waves of migration to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs known so far lived in South America, the researchers concluded that the lizards appeared there for the first time.
Thus, the three development lines separated early and spread from South America across all continents, which at that time formed a single land mass as a supercontinent Pangäa.
For this the fact that the team together with Tawa hallae found the remains of two other, not particularly closely related theropods.
The three cannot be derived from a common immigrant ancestor, the researchers argue.
We believe that there were at least three waves of migration to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, a co-author of the science study.
Of course, there are also contradictions.
An even older species, Silesaurus, which belongs to a sister group of dinosaurs, lived in today's Poland, says Bonner paleontologist Martin Sander.
His opinion could be a distorted picture, because in South America just a lot of primitive Dino fossils have been preserved, while on other continents there is hardly anything to find.
As the dinosaurs managed to develop from a relatively rare sideline of the reptile tribe to the dominant agricultural vertebrates of the Middle Ages, it is still puzzling.
During the trias, the dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, for example with the ancestors of today's crocodiles and the flying aura and with numerous other lizards.
Toward the end of the Trias, the dinosaurs spread around the world and developed many new species, while the relationship on the border from the Trias to the Jura died out.
Success story did not last forever
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There may have been a mass death that the dinosaurs survived by chance, but the other reptiles did not.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted so they could beat the competition out of the field.
At any rate, the success story did not last forever.
150 million years later, a meteorite impact of a group of animals helped to blossom, which had also developed in the Trias and since then tempted a shadowy existence: the mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signatories are international.
Professors at the University of Toronto, University of Cambridge, University of Vienna, or Berkeley, California.
Professors from Naples are present, from Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The police evacuation of the occupied casino of the Frankfurt Goethe University beats waves worldwide.
278 professors and lecturers at Goethe University, but also from universities throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America are working together with the protesting students on the Westend campus.
In a statement written in German and English, they "disapprove" the police operation initiated by the Bureau.
University President Werner Müller-Estler had cleared the building occupied by students and lecturers in the educational strike last week because walls and artworks had been stained.
Five students were injured.
The damage to property, judging the signatories, did not justify "the violent dissolution of self-organized courses of students and teachers by a police command".
The evacuation represents an "unacceptable intervention" in the freedom of research and teaching.
The exclusive focus on vandalism is on "delegating and criminalizing the protest" and diverts from the content.
The Bureau abstained from the necessary discourse.
The lecturers demand the immediate cessation of criminal prosecution.
The majority of the occupiers did not support the damage to property, it says.
Objection Legitimated
The youth of the Verdi trade union and the German Trade Union Confederation are also cooperating with the students.
The protest is a legitimate expression of a growing concern for one's own future, says Verdi-Landesjugendsecretary Alexander Klein.
However, Hessen's Minister of Science Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU) defended the action of Uni-President and the police.
We are grateful to the University President.
Destruction and occupation are totally unacceptable means, she said in a current hour on Thursday in Wiesbadener Landtag.
We have an understanding of the protest, but no understanding of vandalism, says CDU-Landtag MEP Peter Beuth.
Otherwise, the opposition fractions saw SPD, Green and Left.
The CDU takes painted walls as a pretext to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (left).
Instead of dealing with the arguments and demands of the students, one would have cleared up.
The Left has submitted a request calling on the Minister of the Interior to report on the police operation.
New Silicon Valley
For many years it was considered a secret city, inaccessible to Western visitors.
Selenograd, one of the ten districts of the capital Moscow, was a strictly guarded location for secret armaments research in the Soviet Union.
Today the municipality with its 216,000 inhabitants, 37 kilometres from the Moscow center, is considered to be "Russian Silicon Valley".
Significant research and production sites for micro- and nanoelectronics are located here.
Since September 2008, representatives of Selenograds had established contacts with the Frankfurter Wissenschaftsstandort Riedberg - with the university institutes and the companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Center (FIZ).
There were several mutual visits and on Wednesday Selenograd and Riedberg signed a "Protocol on closer cooperation" in Frankfurt.
The Moscow Vice-Citizen Juri Rosljak and Prefect Anatoly Smirnov of Selenograd led the Russian delegation, for which Frankfurt signed the planning dean Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and small and medium-sized enterprises will travel to Selenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchange
It is a matter of continuous scientific exchange.
But it is also about economic relations.
FIZ companies will be able to take a foothold on the growing Russian market.
On the other hand, Russian science companies want to take orders in Germany.
Selenograd is the seat of major Russian research institutes and companies.
These include the Moscow Institute of Electronic Engineering, the large companies Sitronics and Rossijskaja Elektronika.
The municipality was founded in 1958 as a so-called "socialist plan city" for arms research.
Selenograd (literally translated "Grünstadt") received his name from the forested hill landscape, where the research institutions are embedded.
Stuttgarter Braksklotz
The dimension of Stuttgart 21 cannot be set high enough.
For the project's supporters, it is simply about "the new heart of Europe".
S21 is much more than the laying down of a railway station, more than a monstrous construction project that will overthrow the city of Baden-Württemberg's state capital for a decade in unwholesome construction chaos.
Stuttgart 21 was born of the spirit of the 1980s.
Headquarters with tracks ending in the middle of the city were then considered to be 19th-century traffic fossils, which seemed like brake pads of modern rail traffic, as it took a huge amount of time to realign locomotives from the back to the front.
Get in, stop for a minute, keep going - this is how it's supposed to go.
And that's why the Hauptbahnhofs should disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a through railway station, which lies about half the distance of the trans-European rail magistral between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava - therefore the slogan of the "heart of Europe".
S21 is now actually being addressed, although the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even very ambitious planners have realized that it is almost unfeasible in the Hessian and Bavarian big city to implement the lower elevation.
Headquarters, however, no longer have an entry and exit problem, since there are modern turntables with motor vehicles and vans at both ends.
Nevertheless: Stuttgart 21 next to the ICE new construction line to Ulm is now being started.
National and local politicians have enforced it.
The railway also participates because the risks of the largest individual infrastructure project in the Republic of the taxpayers and not in the state group are borne.
In terms of urban planning, the project can still be justified to some extent.
New urban space is created, which - it is believed to be the computer-generated graphics of the planners - is equipped with a lot of greenery.
S21 is harmful to the rail transport system.
The railway station and the extension of the route are intended for passenger transport, which - typically in the 1980s - was attributed to huge growth.
At that time there was no competition of the cheap flyers.
Modern transport policy must, however, first of all, strengthen freight transport, as rail transport is much more environmentally friendly than road transport.
However, because of steep climbs, the new line is not suitable for freight trains.
Even more serious is the fact that S21 indirectly acts on many other railway projects.
A good six billion euros will be banned in Swabian.
That's the official number.
Experts consider ten to 15 billion to be realistic.
It is clear that in the next decade the money will be missing from other nodes and bottlenecks in the net.
A total of sixty major projects are on the list of the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the expansion of the well 180 km long route through the Rhine Valley.

It would be necessary to press the tube right here.
But S21 will act as a brake pad.
The Rheintal line becomes a bottleneck for international freight transport: in the heart of Europe.
Government examines judgment on the airport
The state government has left open in the Wiesbaden Landtag whether it will review the decision of the Hessian Administrative Court (VGH) on the night flight ban.
The CDU/FDP coalition had commissioned experts to have the more than 400 pages of VGH juridical judgment examined, said Dieter Posch (FDP).
On those days, the VGH in Kassel had explained in writing that the country had to re-regulate the night flight ban in the case of construction of the planned northwest runway at Frankfurt Airport.
The approval of 17 flights between 23 and 5 p.m., as provided for by the State Government, is not compatible with the statutory protection of the population against night-time noise.
The coalition must decide by 4 January whether to oppose the judgment in revision.
The opposition criticized this postponement and urged the representatives of the government to refrain from a revision at the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
Head of SPD Group Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel urged the CDU and FDP to return to their promises before the election to a night flight ban. Otherwise this would be considered a "wordbreak".
It's fucking hard if you can keep your word, said Green Chief Tarek Al-Wazir, alluding to the FDP election slogan "We keep word".
Minister Posch rejected Schäfer-Gümbel's accusation that the state government is trying to get to her night flights with "right-twisting and trickery".
A precise legal review takes time.
The coalition does not want to operate on the basis of a "fast first impression".
We need a legally secure decision, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
As they represent the opposition, the statements of his group on the night flight ban had never been.
US Banks Pay Help Back
The U.S. major banks, shaken by the crisis, are stripping off their state bonds.
On Wednesday, the Bank of America returned the aid from the Tarp bank rescue fund of a total of 45 billion dollars (a good 30 billion euros) to one blow.
And the Citigroup is also planning, according to a report by the US transmitter CNBC, to refund state aid.
The institutions want to remove the restrictions associated with the acceptance of the money – such as the limitation on the payment of manager bonuses and the payment of high fees.
The Bank of America had obtained some 19 billion dollars of fresh money from investors over convertible bonds.
She took the rest of the sum out of her own checkout, which was well filled, among other things, by segment sales.
Bank Manager Kenneth Lewis expressly thanked the American taxpayer on Wednesday evening: The money injection had helped over a very difficult time.
The money house had increased to the height of the financial crisis with the acquisition of the investment bank Merrill Lynch.
The Citigroup also wants to obtain money on the capital market to relieve its liabilities to the State.
As early as Thursday, the US bank could announce a 20 billion dollar increase in its capital, reported CNBC calling for circles.
A Citigroup spokesperson didn't want to speak.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley paid back their help.
Quick Choice
Everything went faster than I thought.
Just two weeks after the ZDF Board of Directors had expelled the current chief editor Nikolaus Brender from office, the station can present a successor.
Last night, the committee wanted to vote on the personalisation.
Peter Frey, head of the ZDF Capital Studio in Berlin, was a favourite.
However, there was no confirmation from the transmitter - official to prevent the process.
However, it should also have been possible to prevent further damage to ZDF-intendent Markus Schächter, even this proposal should not be passed on to the Board of Directors.
Frey, Schächter's candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 board members.
The result of the vote was not yet established at the end of this edition.
Two weeks ago, Schächter had failed in the Board of Directors with his proposal to extend the contract with Nikolaus Brender for another five years.
Only seven members spoke out for Brender, seven voted against him. Brender’s election was a hard defeat for Schächter, but one that could be expected.
For the majority of the Union in the Board of Directors had already signaled weeks before the election not to want to confirm Brender in office.
He had organized the resistance against the chief editor of the Hessen Prime Minister Roland Koch.
With the argument that among Brender the news broadcasts of the ZDF had lost their turn-on rates, he rejected another term of office of the highly respected editor-in-chief.
Until shortly before the election, there were therefore protests in which the political influence on the ZDF was shattered.
Last but not least, 35 state jurists had intervened in the debate, which considered the conduct of Koch to be unconstitutional.
It has nothing to do with it.
To person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and romance.
He then worked at Südwestfunk and the Frankfurter Rundschau.
In 1983 Frey moved to ZDF, initially to "today-journal".
Subsequent stations: 1988-1990 personal editor of the editor-in-chief; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 director and moderator of the "morning magazine"; until 2001 director of the ZDF foreign policy; since then head of the ZDF capital studio.
The Greens announced a constitutional complaint after the election of Brender, who was still elected journalist of the year by the Media Magazine magazine on Wednesday.
Koch's opponent in the Board of Directors, Rhineland-Palatinate Prime Minister Kurt Beck, said last week that the countries should change the ZDF State Treaty in such a way that the manager's staff proposals cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
However, Beck also ruled out an exodus of party politicians from the supervisory bodies of the ZDF.
Brender's expected successor Peter Frey had recommended himself to the board of directors with a wise move of chess - by harshly criticizing the board immediately after the Brender election.
Thanks to this proof of journalistic independence, both chessmen could nominate him without loss of face for the position of the editor-in-chief as well as the board of directors, without suspecting that a party-goer would be transferred to office.
In party arithmetic, Frey is anyway attributed to the left liberals.
Study Is Disrupted
Partial success for the students: After a year of the educational strike, the country's ministers of culture finally started on Thursday: At a meeting of the Minister of Culture and Higher Education Rectors' Conference, both sides agreed to want to improve the terms of study at Bachelor and Master.
In the future, students should be able to handle their studies as well.
In particular, they agreed to reduce the test loads: In principle, each study module should only be completed with a single examination.
In addition, the students' workload should be reviewed and "a realistic and reasonable measure" guaranteed.
Politics and universities also want to simplify the recognition of degrees between universities within and outside Germany.
The countries committed themselves to making common structural requirements for Bachelor's and Master's programmes more flexible.
There should also be no different country regimes.
Less examinations
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, cult ministers and university rectors have been carrying the winged word of better studyability in their mouths.
Now it was filled with a concrete content for the first time.
The so-called Accreditation Council decided to partially drastically reduce the number of examinations: "Each module usually concludes with only one examination," says a 30-page paper, which aims to partially re-regulate the admission of courses.
With the "significant reduction in the audit burden", said the accreditation council chairman Reinhold Grimm, a "failure development should be halted, which significantly impaired studyability."
In addition, "studyability" should in future be "the crucial criterion" in the design process.
Modules such as content are "hard to check", whether "necessary restrictions of the students in the choice of
In the case of the United Kingdom, the Commission has decided to initiate proceedings under Article 93(2) of the EC Treaty.
The students would have "a right to obtain the playrooms that allow and promote their own initiative".
The rules should apply to the admission of new students, but also to the review of existing courses.
These must be "reaccredited" every five years – which means, however, that it takes until 2015 until all the courses have been reviewed.
Ten accreditation agencies are responsible for this, nationwide, which are subject to the accreditation Council set up by the countries.
In October, the Ministers for Culture had called on the countries to "emphasize" so that the agencies were not too large and the testing regime was not too strict.
In individual federal states, universities and universities of applied sciences have already agreed on appropriate measures with the state ministries.
As the only country to date, Rhineland-Palatinate pledged additional funds for the further development of the Bologna process.
From the money, universities are mainly to set up tutor programs and strengthen student counselling as well as examination and abroad offices.
Land and universities want to spend ten million euros on this.
At the beginning of 2010, the government intends to introduce a revision of the Higher Education Act into Parliament.
After this, only one examination is required for the completion of a study model.
The aim is to make the design of studies more flexible, to ensure recognition of qualifications at other universities and to facilitate access to the master's degree.
By the end of next year, all the country's study programmes will be reviewed for their studyability.
On Thursday, the government and opposition had once again debated the study conditions in the country.
In addition to praise, however, there was also criticism of the decisions.
The Federal Board of Juso University Groups demanded that the development of education policy should no longer take place "behind closed doors" by ministers and university rectors.
At the latest after the educational strikes, the students should now also speak to "a word" as the subject.
The future academics received support from the president of the University Rectors' Conference (HRK), Margret Wintermantel: "We need the students' experiences," she said on Thursday at a meeting with the cult ministers, with whom the HRC discussed a joint reform paper.
The Trade Union Education and Science (GEW) did not go far enough overall: it calls for a legal claim that allows each graduate with a bachelor's degree to have access to a further master's degree.
On the other hand, the countries need to ensure that the current generation of Bachelor students will have sufficient Master's places of study with the best possible study conditions tomorrow, according to GEW member of the board Andreas Keller.
The countries need to employ significantly more lecturers.
However, the Ministers of Culture did not comment on freer access to the Master.
More than one footnote to Herta Müller
Entering Germany and coming out of it is hardly control..." is the starting line of a poem by poet Werner Söllner, in which, in disturbing speech, he addresses the arrival experience of a dissident who has gained freedom, but at the same time has lost his language space.
Werner Söllner, born in 1951 in the Romanian Banat, had worked as a German and English teacher in Bucharest and later as a lecturer in a children's book publishing house before moving to Frankfurt am Main in 1982.
Söllner has been awarded various literary awards, in 1993 he gave the legendary Frankfurt poetry lectures at Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been head of the Hessian Literature Forum at Mouson Tower in Frankfurt.
On Tuesday, during a meeting in Munich, he arranged for a considerable extraliterary appearance, which was about "German Literature in Romania in the Mirror and Zerrspiegel of her Securitatacts".
Söllner was visibly dismayed and misplaced by a statement in which he stood before Romanian-German writers such as Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer, as IM for the Romanian secret service Securitate.
Together with some of the participants, Söllner had received the German Language Prize in 1989.
The attempts at recruitment had begun in a sneaking way, first in 1971.
I am, closed Söllner, "so someone who has not resisted the intimidation attempts of the Securitate enough."
The poet Werner Söllner is IM Walter.
Almost at the same time as the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller and its unprecedented literary debate with the mechanisms of dictatorial rule, the literary scene, and in particular the community of German authors from Romania, is shaken by a case that identifies the abyss and humiliation of a political system based on monitoring and focusing.
Werner Söllner is not only a perpetrator, but also a victim, as far as we can say as we know.
In his securitate act, IM Walter played a role, said according to Söllner's confession of literary scientist Michael Markel and referred to the positive influence of IM Walter for him.
He had "cut him out" in all the difficious points for him at the time, according to Markel.
It is a moral need for him to make this comment.
Söllner's statement was unexpected in form and in front of this audience, but completely surprising is the confession of an earlier dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian secret service.
Germany had been a comfortable reserve for Securitate-Spitzel, Herta Müller had already written in July in the time after she had read her own file, 914 pages.
The people affected are supposed to be speculated and in some cases have probably also known what clear name was behind the cover name Sorin, Voicu and Walter.
Contrary to the fact that the Stasi files are now being viewed in a very procedural manner, the handling of the securitate monitoring remains very diffuse.
Systematic education has been delayed and hampered in recent years.
One of the Birthler authorities of the corresponding National Council for the Review of the Securitate Acts (CNSAS) was established only in 1999, but the publication of the files has since been rather slow.
Only since 2005 has there been a law governing the administration of the files.
The fact that the influence of former Securitate members is still very strong in Romania, after the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller was announced, revealed an interview in which a former Securitate Chief of Temesvar spoke about the winner.
She had a psychosis, after all, she was only interrogated once.
The infamy of power here meant to be able to express itself in the form of freedom of expression.
Certainly, the case of Söllner, as so often in connection with hidden guilt, raises inevitable questions.
Why only now? Who has been harmed? The thoughtful response of the listeners to Söllner's confession makes it hoped that the continuation of this chapter will be determined by a desire for knowledge rather than by guilt and shame.
To the genesis of the work of Herta Müller, who received the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than a footnote.
Saturation Supplement Champions League
It seemed as if an adrett-dressed foreign servant had just come from a very nice Christmas party where a sports goods manufacturer had distributed Goodies when the new VfB coach Christian Gross, accompanied by an orange plastic bag of the equipment, rose to a C-class called after midnight for a quarter of an hour. ̈
The man with the striking glass was driven because of the strange city he was still in.
Otherwise he could have driven himself - alcohol was finally not in play, and drunk before luck the 55-year-old was just as little.
Had been a pleasant evening, but tomorrow the work continues.
Or let's get out of here.
In the words of the Swiss who had been committed only three days earlier: "We have achieved the eighth finale", namely in the Champions League thanks to the 3:1 success against Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "but we must not let ourselves be blinded by the success: there will be a brutal hard fight against the descent."
The "much more important task" will be on Sunday.
Then it is necessary to repeat in Mainz the king-class performance in the league everyday.
And the well-revealed weaknesses after the fast three gates through Marica (5th), Trasch (8th) and Pogrebnyak (11th).
Exploitation
The 8th Final of the Champions League (Hinspiele 16/17. + 23/24 February/ Backspiele 9/10. + 16/17. March) will be released in Nyon on 18 December.
So the joy of the fulminant state of the Babbel successor remained.
Not only the supposed healer, who had in the short time imparted confidence, commitment and joy to the uninsured Stuttgart professionals.
I went to the players and told them to think about their strengths, and I stopped them to be braver, the soul clipper Gross explained the simple sounding recipe of success, which under therapist Babbel had no effect anymore.
He has sparked a certain magic, admitted Babbel advocate Jens Lehmann, "when a new impulse comes in football, sometimes things happen that you wouldn't have thought possible."
And Sami Khedira, who, thanks to his dynamic, advanced to the best player on the square after weeks of injury, tried to describe the established "phenomenon" with the proverbial "fresh wind" and the workings of the new superior: "He is a man who grasps and demands discipline.
That is what we need in the current situation."
Under Babbel it had obviously failed.
The VfB Stuttgart is not yet over the mountain, warns sports director Horst Helt
The VfB Stuttgart, however, needs above all constanz.
Like Gross, players and managers guarded themselves against overrating the victory against a weakened and completely over-restrained defense of Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow, before four days later in Leverkusen at 0:4 the evil awakening had come to mind Khedira.
And Sports Director Horst Helt warned that although a season goal has been reached, the other is still far away.
We're not over the mountain yet.
On his 40th birthday, even after the first home victory for three months, he was not expected to celebrate, was due to the events of the weekend, which relived in the form of a television interview by Torschüter Jens Lehmann, broadcast just before the start of the game.
There are decisions that others make and not the Jens, contrasted the harsh criticism of Lehmann.
He had shown a lack of leadership to the board and had decided to change the coach on pressure from puberty fans.
Also that his free day had been cancelled after games, Lehmann valued as a sign of lack of sovereignty and favor.
Lehmann's statements were "marked by pure egoism", Helt knelt back and announced consequences for the closing man.
You probably won't be friends for life anymore, the two forty years old.
Nevertheless, they agreed with all the others that without the pre-work by the replaced coach team the playful and combative strong idea would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants would have "a large part of the success," said Helt and Lehmann unisono - and the man with the plastic bag also agreed.
WM-Fight in Heavyweight
Hot Duell in Bern: Time and again challenger Kevin Johnson World Champion Vitali Klitschko provoked with words and gestures.
However, after twelve hard laps, the Ukrainian defended his heavyweight title after the WBC version.
The judgment of the judges was unanimous.
Hamburg - Vitali Klitschko remains box world champion in heavyweight.
The 38-year-old champion, according to the version of the WBC Association, defeated U.S. American Kevin Johnson unanimously at points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109) on Saturday night in Bern.
For Klitschko it was the third successful title defense after his comeback in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian had already twice been the world champion of the WBO and WBC associations.
Unfortunately, the K.o. that everyone was expecting failed.
Klitschko expanded his balance sheet to 39 victories in 41 professional battles, twice he had to fight for injuries.
Challenger Johnson had to take the first defeat in the 24th fight.
Before about 17,000 spectators in the Bernese Arena, the 2.02-metre-large Klitschko wanted to dictate the fight with his left leader.
The 11 centimeter smaller Johnson, who had announced the end of the Klitschko era before the duel, repeatedly withdrew the beats of the world champion, so that Klitschko could not bring his dangerous rights decisively into the goal.
Overall, the passive Johnson did not do enough for a challenger and only tried to get over the rounds.
Although he provoked Klitschko with words and gestures, his beats rarely met the world champion.
After all, he was only the second boxer to Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who went with Klitschko over the full distance of twelve laps.
The challenger had provided some vortex before the fight in the Swiss capital.
He insulted Klitschko as a "horrible zombie" who "can't do anything right".
When weighing, the champion was then provoked on Friday to push Johnson's sunglasses from his nose to "see his eyes."
Fourth victory for Klitschkos Comeback
Klitschko also remained victorious in his fourth fight after his comeback on October 11, 2008.
After almost four years of retirement, he had beaten Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and recovered "his" WBC belt, which he had previously had to give up without a fight.
This year he won his title defenses Juan Carlos Gomez from Cuba and Chris Arreola from the United States in September.
In this fight I only got one hit and is physically very good in shape, Klitschko had founded the quick return to the ring.
His dream, however, remains the union of all four important titles in the family.
Brother Vladimir is the world champion of the WBO and IBF associations.
But the belt of the WBA is worn by the British David Haye, after he was able to dethrone Nikolai Waluyev in November.
Haye had previously cancelled a fight planned for September against Vitali Klitschko.
It is claimed that his doctoral society is already planning the fight against Klitschko in the Wembley Stadium in London.
Case Kunduz
Frontal attack from the opposition: Green Group leader Jürgen Trittin has called Defense Minister Guttenberg a liar because of false information about the Kunduz affair.
SPD and left demand clarification from the chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin - According to the latest findings on the air attack by Kunduz, the opposition defense minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) has been subject to a deliberate deception.
The Minister had said "knowingly the untruth" about the deadly bombardment on two tanker trains in September," said Green Group leader Jürgen Trittin on Saturday in the ARD news show "Dayshow".
It's called the countrywide. He lied.
The order for killing had been issued in violation of the rules of the International Guard Force for Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the substance of the report that NATO had read, which Mr Guttenberg said.
On Friday, it had become known that the attack involved not only the destruction of the abducted cargoes but also the targeted killing of two Taliban leaders.
According to the NATO investigation report, up to 142 people were killed or injured in the US air raid requested by German commander Colonel Klein.
Green, SPD and Left called on Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) on Saturday to speak immediately before the Bundestag and also to clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Ms. Merkel has to clarify whether a strategy of targeted killing is part of the government's Afghanistan policy - and whether the Chancellor's Office, the Bundeswehr and the intelligence service have approved this new strategy, Jürgen Trittin and the Green Collegin Renate called for Künast.
The government spokesperson Ulrich Wilhelm firmly rejected the criticism.
The Chancellor's Office did not influence concrete operations of the Bundeswehr in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, doubts about the presentation of the Ministry about the reasons for the dismissal of General Inspector Wolfgang Schneiderhan and State Secretary Peter Wichert had also become loud.
According to information from the SPIEGEL, the two Guttenberg correctly and completely informed about the backgrounds of the tanker attack.
Officially, they had said that they had denied the existence of NATO reports and withheld sensitive details from the minister.
However, from the environment of the two top officials, they claimed that they had even pointed out several reports to the Ministry of Defence, including a two-page document from the commander-in-command Colonel Klein and a field hunter report.
Wichert is said to have asked for clarification of the matter in a letter, reports the "Frankfurt General Sunday newspaper".
He has not received an answer so far, it says.
The Ministry did not comment on the allegations on Saturday and pointed out that this would be clarified in the Committee of Inquiry of the Bundestag, which wants to establish itself next Wednesday.
Dream Worlds
Some see images in awake condition and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
Not only do mental illness and drug noise blur the boundaries between imagination and reality.
As long as it's in the sleep, everything's fine.
If we lie with closed eyes in our dark rooms, we can unhinderedly give in to the wildest ideas and imaginations.
However, those who experience dreamlike conditions in their wake, see and hear things that others do not see or hear, in the modern Western world, are usually considered crazy or drug addicts, at least as a special person.
However, such images and voices do not arise only in the case of mental illness or in the case of drug noise.
The same neuronal processes that enable us to design houses, to paint pictures or to write novels sometimes cause the boundaries between dream, madness and reality to blur.
Dream-like shift-conscious states can occur in a variety of forms, at best we call them visions, in the worst case madness.
Although triggers and effects may differ, the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of the New Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, shamanic states of rapture, psychosis and hallucinations can be traced back to similar processes.
Hallucinations or delusions arise when the balance of the neuronal messenger substances of the brain - above all dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholine - is derailed and the interaction of various brain parts is disturbed.
Complex hallucinations and delusional thoughts occur very often during schizophrenic psychosis.
Gravity has no more power over him
The connection between madness and dream has occupied philosophers and physicians since ancient times.
In 1861, Aristotle perceived hallucinations as a form of dream in a watchful state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, as a "great resemblance of error to dream states", for Sigmund Freud, the dream was even "a psychosis, with all the inconsistency, delusions, sensory confusions of such a kind".
It's autumn 2001, when Henning T. turns into a comic character.
His body is two-dimensional and quiet.
Gravity has no more power over him, it floats on the ceiling of the room.
He's feeling a kick.
Behind him winged devil figures with bloodred, distorted frets, fanciful.
They hunt him, kick him with heavy, flaming boots, throw him against the walls, he feels the pain all over the body.
Loud, vicious voices roar from walls and radio.
He can no longer bear them, the voices that insult and insult him.
Henning T. rips two cables from the stereo system, knots them to a loop and attaches them to a hook on the ceiling.
He climbs on a speaker and lays down the loops around his neck.
Run.
The sling is loose.
This is supposed to be a lesson for you, yelling at the voices in a drumming choir, "Go to the clinic and let yourself be healed!"
Today Henning T. is 40 years old, he has experienced six acute psychosis, the last being 2 years ago, the first almost 20 years.
It was triggered by LSD.
His diagnosis is schizoaffective paranoid psychosis, as well as he is manic-depressive, he takes medications, against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, he has been married for three years.
In psychosis, he says, I have experienced the worst fear and the deepest despair.
The Deceptions Are Cruel Reality
About one percent of the population suffers from schizophrenia at least once in their life, and in psychiatric clinics it is treated as the second most common disease after depression.
In an acute schizophrenic psychosis, those affected can usually no longer distinguish between the inner and outer worlds, they get into an exuberant state that can lead to hallucinations, size, relationship or persecution.
The voice hearing is particularly common - voices that command, comment or dialogue.
Even optical hallucinations are not uncommon.
The affected person can no longer separate important from unimportant, the brain can no longer filter out disturbing signals, the consciousness is flooded by impressions.
Like the dream, psychosis also opens the locks for a flood of ideas and fantasies that stem from deeper layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is subject-centered, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, Chief Physician of the General Psychiatry Clinic in Heidelberg University Hospital.
The schizophrenic is in the center of the event, everything has a meaning for him.
At the same time he becomes in a passive role, he is, like in the dream, overwhelmed by the events and cannot actively shape them.
Schizophrenics therefore often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
A balance of reality is usually not possible to them, the illusions are cruel reality, awakening is excluded.
Once in a lifetime having experienced a hallucination
Unlike in the dream, Fuchs says, "but the sensual and spatial structure of reality perceived in psychosis remains in principle."
The delusional thoughts and hallucinations are rooted in reality, the alienation of experience takes place in the real context.
Why exactly our brain beats caprioles, researchers still present puzzles.
Exceptional states can cause any person to lose the reality relationship for a short time, says Fuchs.
But not everyone will develop a psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but twin studies have shown that genes are not the only determining factors.
Researchers assume that there are minimal brain damage in the affected patients.
We suspect that the neuronal maturation of the brain is disturbed at an early stage of development, for example by a viral disease of the mother during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
But there remains a mystery about the disruption of the neural system, which also does not manifest itself for many years at first.
Environmental influences also play a role - stress or traumatic experiences can trigger a psychosis if the disposition is present.
Hallucinogenic drugs can also trigger psychosis as they interfere with the transmission system.
When our brain is hot
The crazy thing is, psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and swallow expensive medications to get rid of them, others spend money on drugs to get which, says Lübecker psychology professor Erich Kasten.
Whether images are perceived as pleasant or unpleasant is often just a matter of opinion.
Kasten has been collecting reports on hallucinations and illusions for ten years, last year he evaluated his results in the book "The Irreal World in Our Head".
Hallucinations are among the typical accompaniments of psychosis, but also of amazingly many other diseases.
These include, in addition to mental disorders such as borderline or depression, diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer's disease and skull trauma.
Surprisingly, under certain conditions, even the brain of healthy people hallucinates.
Hallucinations, according to Kasten, consist of memory contents that are normally withheld.
They occur when the brains, in which sensory perceptions are processed, are overactive or too little inhibited; if our brain is hot or even if stimulation is missing.
Drugs can trigger this condition as well as brain damage or psychosis.
But also thrills, stress, anguish of love or other mental exceptions.
In recent studies, up to a third of respondents reported having experienced hallucination at least once in life.
Sarah K. is 16 years old in the summer of 2005, and lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and attends the gymnasium there.
A normal girl, actually.
If there weren't the pictures and voices.
During the break, it may occur that a sluggish boy with long, dark hair addresses it.
When it answers, the students look at it as a surprise - no one else sees or hears this boy.
They think the shy girl is a spun daydreamer, but Sarah K. doesn't dream, she knows that.
She's awake, she hears and sees this boy, just as she hears and sees the girl in the bank next door.
She can even feel his presence, at least for moments.
A pleasant feeling is that, she likes the boy.
Am I crazy?, she sometimes asks herself.
But she knows that this boy and the other illusions are not real and disappear again.
At night the appearances are mostly frightening
Often the illusions are also a burden.
When she sits in the classroom, she sometimes cannot follow the teaching material, because the teacher in her eyes and ears just introduces a new student, while he explains mathematical equations to everyone else on the board.
At night the apparitions are mostly frightening.
When she waits for her sleep in her dark room, which is much too rare and much too late, she often cannot tell whether she is awake or dreaming whether the pictures she sees arise, the frats or the girl with the bleeding cuts on her arms and legs, in front of her open or closed eyes.
Leave me alone, she screams at the figures.
Parents and friends don't tell her about what they think is crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
She passed her degree last year and lives with her friend.
A year ago, the hallucinations stopped.
Since she has contacted the psychologist box on the Internet, she knows exactly that she is not crazy.
Mad is also a work of art out of despair
If a person is socially isolated or suffers from seduction, he is likely to have hallucinations after a while, says Kasten.
I guess the brain's under-worked then, and it's up to him to have his own conversation.
Sarah K., a single child, was as a little girl afraid of other children, often she played alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at age 13 that the man she calls Papa, since she can think, is not her physical father.
Since visual and acoustic hallucinations are active in the same areas of the brain, which also process real impressions and sounds, it is difficult for those affected, such as Sarah K., to distinguish illusions and reality. "Every experience," says Kasten, "is taking place in the brain, the reality arises there.
Hallucinations are also images that make the brain appear so real."
Nightly dream images also value box as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally different from those of acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics, mentally healthy people are able to recognize their illusions as unrealistic.
Kasten therefore advises his patients to appreciate the hallucinations also as a special ability.
Border state between dream and hallucination
Unfortunately, in our very conscious world, imaginary experience is mostly pathologized, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, Professor in Heidelberg and Chief Physician of the Hospital for Psychiatry and Psychotherapy of the Florence Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious, painful disease, but it also contains positive, creative - madness is also a work of art out of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has explored the so-called oneiroide experience form, a special form of the dream-likely altered watch consciousness.
Oneiroides are highly complex, detailed quasi-dreams, which the experienced person considers real and which he cannot distinguish from the wake-up state after all.
The oneiroid state of consciousness occurs in trauma or illness-related extreme situations, for example in polyradiculitis patients who experience motor paralysis with full consciousness.
When a person is threatened with self-loss and world loss, for example by persistent, total inability to move, he replaces the life-threatening real situation with his own imaginary world, decoupled from reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
A kind of boundary between dream and hallucination.
Since the handling of a situation in reality is not possible, a world change takes place, but the real situation is present in the imagination.
An intense form of sentiment and sentiment in an inherently intolerable situation, which enables us humans to have their own ability to design, not to suffer in the absence of loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in memory
The Zurich art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen also describes his oneiroid experiences in his book "Heart Change" as a salvation action of the soul.
He is 49 years old when, after a heart valve operation with subsequent heart transplantation, his consciousness travels for days, while his body is condemned to motionlessness at the intensive station.
Claussen dives into a self-created world, visits strange times and places: he experiences himself as a bedridden old man, aboard a train sanatorium, a robot watching over his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages among nobles who make drugs from blood.
When dragged by a Greek on the motorcycle in his home country, he surfs with his hospital bed in the pine snow of the Alps and meets a Korean mafioso.
He goes up completely in the imaginary event, everything is real, even later in memory.
These inner journeys are fundamentally different for Claussen from every dream.
Dream is a different state, he describes his experience.
In contrast, the memories of mental travel are still obvious to me after years and in minor details.
Clearer and more intense even than really experienced.
The intensity of this experience blows the horizon of our other life-world experiences, says psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
In the end, oneiroides, psychosis, hallucinations and drug noise show how fragile our inner images of outer reality are also in guard.
Any change in the state of consciousness, sums up the psychologist's box, "can lead to a distortion of what we call reality."
An experience that can be quite enriching.
The snowfall can come
Burda
Children are to take over the publishing house at the age of 27
The new publishing manager Kallen is an interim solution: in the long run, Hubert Burda wants to give his company to his two children, he told the SPIEGEL.
The holding company will continue to belong to 100 percent of the family in the future.
Hamburg - The publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children in the long run.
Both children inherit at the age of 27 and have the firm will to enter the company, the 69-year-old said to the SPIEGEL.
We have carefully regulated the details of this.
The question of whether they are also active in the company only arises after that.
The question is also whether they are capable of doing so.
You can't put 7500 employees in charge of your children if they're not adequately qualified.
This kills the children and the company as well.
Burda announced on Thursday that he had resigned from the board of directors from January, and appointed Paul-Bernhard Kallen as his successor.
The 52-year-old Kallen has been a member of the Board of Directors at Burda since 1999.
First, he was responsible for technology.
Later, with Treasury, the responsibility for the company's assets came and after Jürgen Todenhöfer left, also the ones for direct marketing, foreign affairs, pressure and finance.
For the first time there is no family member at the top of the publishing house.
Burda's children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who is now 42 years old, died a few years ago.
The designation of Kallen also serves to bridge "10, 15 years", says Burda.
According to Burda, the holding company should still belong to 100 percent of the family in the future.
With regard to the cases of fate dance and Schaeffler, Burda said that even family businesses are not safe from the downfall: "That was always true of families who let themselves be infected by a search for capital that had completely speculated and thought that they could rise to the very big player.
My strategy was never that.
He had "never dreams of world power," says Burda.
I don't see myself as the political preceptor of this country, as it was Springer, and I don't want to play with 'Time' in the World League, these stores have become too big.
Perfect Beauty
Everything you wish for in terms of beauty and well-being is now available to you.
At least this is what El Corte Inglés has done, which recently opened a store with an area of more than 1000 m2 in the shopping centre in Callao (Madrid), where everything is only about body care.
In the wellness area, located on the eighth floor, you will find renowned companies such as Hedonai, who provide a dehairing with lasers; Spaxión, with rooms for relaxation and beauty treatments; the hairdressers Luis & Tachi, Marina d'Or with a gym or L'Occitane with their natural cosmetics.
But there is also a food department that stands out through its tea house with more than 130 different tea varieties.
Enjoy a relaxing massage together with your partner while having a fantastic view of the capital, or rent the relax area for two hours to put your own beauty party on your feet with eight friends and then relax in the hot tub or with massages and a glass of champagne, these are just some of the many options Spaxión offers.
The total area is 250 m2, which is divided into 12 rooms for the latest facial and body treatments as well as for hydrotherapy.
For example, for cavitation in the fight against cellulitis or with vibrating surfaces.
The fitness studio also has this type of equipment, and there are also virtual trainers who take care of the training units of the customers and thus offer them a completely personal training.
You start a training unit by entering a personal password on a touchscreen that is located opposite the devices.
After that, you will see different videos on how to perform your training sessions correctly.
The head of the gym assures that 15 minutes (including warm-up and stretch exercises) are sufficient to train the body muscles.
And if, after you have trained your body, you still want to look past the hair salon, the company Luis & Tachi has a room in which treatments to regain the hair splendor, shine and health for your hair are offered in a personalized way.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to be the key words for this wellness area in the middle of the city, which is always open from 10.00 a.m. to 22.00 p.m. 365 days a year.
The most diverse décolletés
Christmas is getting closer and closer and that's why it's a good opportunity to copy the look of the stars and get their clothes in our wardrobe.
The form of the décolleté, which is very important for highlighting the silhouette, is one of the points that needs to be considered.
Here are some suggestions.
The singer Fergie has chosen an exaggerated and very complicated décolleté. Of this one can only be advised.
Endesa and Barcelona by electric car
The electricity company Endesa, together with the city of Barcelona, created the "LIVE office".
This is a project to develop and promote the electric car in the Catalan capital.
The "LIVE Office" (Logistics for the introduction of the electric car) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the introduction of the electric car in the city and make agreements on mobility by managing, coordinating, subsidizing, etc.
On the other hand, the MOVELE project is being developed to promote the electric car and to summarise opinions and measures in the areas concerned.
This is an attempt to drive forward the means of transport of the future.
3 "electric cities"
Barcelona, however, is not the only city that will be involved in the introduction of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville also participate in this project.
These are the three cities selected by the government in the MOVELE project to accelerate the introduction of the electric car.
The electricity company Endesa has already signed a framework contract with the Government of Catalonia (la Generalitat).
This framework agreement aims to promote the activities of research and technological development in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These activities include activities related to energy and, in particular, to their performance.
However, it is by no means the only initiative in which Endesa participates in the promotion of the electric car.
The company participates in standardisation groups across Europe and maintains a whole range of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees "a horizon of peace" for the automotive sector
The government president, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, prophesies of the Spanish automotive industry, which is the country's largest exporter, "a horizon of peace".
In presenting the 2009 economic report by the President of the Government, Zapatero once again recalled the measures taken by the government to support the automotive sector in the course of the government year.
"Without the plan for the competitiveness of the car industry, we today have a panorama of the neglect and closure of some of our main production plants," said the President of the Government.
"Thanks to this plan and the willingness of car manufacturers to continue to produce in Spain in a highly competitive industry, we can see a quiet horizon for the future of this industry, which is our largest export industry," he added.
He also recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, which is part of the overall plan for the automotive industry (PIA), provided EUR 800 million for projects of 19 vehicle manufacturers and 137 suppliers, which in turn generated investments of more than EUR 3 billion.
The Head of Government stated that these investments are intended both for the development of new models and for the modernisation of existing products and processes.
Zapatero also underlined the government's measures to boost demand, in line with the 2000E plan, which will be applied in cooperation with the Autonomous Communities and the car manufacturers.
According to the Head of Government , this plan allows the average reduction of emissions from new vehicles sold on the Spanish market by 6%, which in turn led to a "strong increase" in the approvals which increased by "40%" in November.

Mazda3 i-Stop: Environmentally-friendly sport
Mazda wants to prove that sportiness is entirely compatible with the protection of the environment.
For this reason, Mazda recently introduced the automatic engine stop and start system, named i-Stop, in the Mazda3 model, a device that is currently only available for the 2.0 petrol engine with 150 hp.
This second generation of Mazda's 3 stands out because of its good grades in the overall picture.
The final processing, the execution of the vehicle, the comfort, its street behaviour, the mechanics, the i-stop system ...
All these aspects are "very good" with the new Mazda3.
Starting with the front seats you can see that the front seats offer excellent ergonomics and good hold.
In addition, the steering wheel game is excellent.
Looking further at the unit, which consists of the instrument panel and the dashboard, it can be seen that Mazda is on the same line as the Japanese trend towards a futuristic interior design with a variety of buttons and switches in the eye-catching colors red and blue.
This style partly reminds us of the style of Honda Civics.
That is why it can be said without further ado that both the Mazda 3 and the Civic, both Japanese models, differ from the sobriety of German automobiles, especially from the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to surpass.
The passenger compartment of these two Japanese compact cars offers more than ever the corresponding comfort so that four adults can easily drive by car.
All this comes with a large and clearly shaped trunk.
The stop and start system is currently only available for the 2-litre petrol engine with 150 hp and a 6-speed circuit.
This engine is a real pleasure. It stands out by its fineness, its quiet sound, its performance and its low consumption.
And all those who don't drive many kilometers a year should consider this i-stop with gasoline engine because of its great comfort in gearing and its low consumption, even though the diesel models are the most sold at Mazda.
With regard to the equipment, the so-called Sportive model selected for the test ride is a special feature, as it has a much larger number of elements from the standard equipment.
From the serial equipment, the RVM, which removes the dead angle, also the controls for traction and stability, speed control, light-sensitive interior mirrors, on-board computers with a large screen, sensors for parking, independent air conditioning, rain and light sensors, Bluetooth and audio Bluetooth, as well as the chromed 17-inch wheels.
In addition, this version also includes, as if not yet enough equipment, the Premium package, which contains the following for an additional 1,500 euros: in addition to additional elements, especially the learningable Bixenon headlights and the BOSE sound system with CD-Lader.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars in its class.
It is particularly outstanding in terms of the materials used, its driving behaviour and the variety of equipment.
In addition, those who do not travel many kilometers a year can also buy the i-Stop version, which is only available with a 2.0 petrol engine with 150 hp.
The only negative on this model is its slightly high price, which is between 21,770 euros for the Luxury model and 23,270 euros for the tested Sportive model.
However, in return for this high price, the Mazda3 offers us every day on the new highest pass.
A premiere with a lot of glamour
L. A. unrolls the red carpet of sensuality for Penélope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
At the premiere of "Nine", the stars, dressed in models that look as elegant as sexy, shined more than ever before.(Photos: Gtresonline).
Our "Pe", as elegant as ever, chose a dark "Lady" dress.
The promises of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, a device with which you can only read your emails without being able to see certain attachments or browse the Internet.
It enjoyed its five minutes of fame when it chose Time magazine as one of the products of the year.
Seeing it on the street is rather unlikely, but the idea itself is nevertheless of interest especially to young people.
Unlike the smartphones, Peek costs very little and has a very cheap flat rate, for example only half of the price of the flat rate of an iPhone.
After seeing the success of this, the company has launched two new devices: one that is intended only for Twitter, the other with a life-long free service for data, quite unlike Peek, where you have to pay a six-time higher price.
Fonpeek, presented at the event Le Web yesterday, is the European version of this invention and therefore its third version.
It has the same limits as its American counterpart, however, has a surprise.
The monthly maintenance price for the phone, about 12 euros a month, includes roaming for the whole of Europe.
Those who travel around the world with a smartphone already know what it means to omit all the data to read their emails once you cross the country border or if you are desperate for a café with WIFI (or a connection with Fon).
The idea of roaming with flatrate is incredibly seductive and should have been possible for a long time.
It is true that some telephone providers already offer special contracts and prices for stays abroad, but according to my experience you need a doctorate in physics and a good glasses to read all the small prints.
The European Commission's repeated criticism of affordable roaming tariffs for the whole of Europe was almost always ignored.
Outside one's own country, one is always afraid to read his e-mails and rightly so.
The fact that a small device such as FonPeek (although it is always amazing that it has the name Fon, although it does not have a Wifi/WLAN) can offer this kind of tariff means that the phone providers have to slowly but safely rethink and start to consider different ways to use their data network.
Kindle is another good example for this, its prices include downloading books and other enquiries on the Internet.
Without a suit and without a hook.
This is an Internet-enabled device and you pay for it only once, namely when you buy it, and not month by month.
And that's exactly what I expect one day from FonPeek, a purchase opportunity with life-long internet access as the Peek already offers in the US.
And not because I want to buy it.
I read my emails with the phone, thank you.
But I expect this because I believe it would be a more appropriate model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
Michelle’s Fetish Color
Yellow is undoubtedly the favorite color of the American First Lady.
Already when Barack Obama took office as president of the United States, she appeared in a dress and a coat of this color and has chosen the same color again to accompany him in his, no doubt, second most important moment in his life: the award of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama has worn very similar models on both occasions: besides that it was almost the same color - a shiny green yellow -, the clothing consisted of three parts - dress, jacket and coat made of the same fabric, and for this she wore a little large embroidered or a necklace.
It even goes so far that at first sight it seemed that the First Lady of the United States wanted to follow the example of the Princess of Asturias and had decided to wear the same dress on more than one occasion.
However, the two clothes are very different in the type of fabric from which they are made.
At the inauguration she wore a dress made of lace and in Oslo a patterned velvet.
Also the accessories were different: for the first time green shoes with half-high paragraphs and for the second time a uniform model, but gold colors.
Also the hairstyle was different every time: The hair was stuck as a hairline on this occasion, while the previous hair was open.
75% of working mothers have had problems at work because of their motherhood
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially among younger women who want to have children.
This is the result of the study carried out by CSIC in cooperation with the Institute for Women on Fertility and Career of Women in Spain.
The survey of 9,737 women between 15 and 75 years of age leaves no doubt: 75% of women in employment see their career prospects on the labour market limited because of their motherhood.
The study reveals that there are major differences in the decision to set up a family and the number of children, depending on whether women work or not, and if so, what kind of profession they pursue.
Those of them who do not do any other work outside the house, work only half-day or have no fixed contract of employment will be more mothers and have more children.
In contrast, women are moving with a fixed position, especially in the public sector, the establishment of a family and motherhood and therefore have fewer children.
"The women of the age group aged between 35 and 49 with a fixed employment receive on average their first child only 3.7 years after the contraction, a figure which increases to 4.1 years for women with fixed employment who have taken longer to achieve this and who have contracted and realized the first child much later.
Moreover, the type of work also has a major influence on maternity, although less than the calendar regarding the willingness to conceive," explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor to be taken into account at the age of women in marriage and the first child.
According to the survey, the age at the time of marriage and the first child is even higher, the higher the level of education.
This difference has also been observed in women of the same age.
For example, women in the group between 35 and 49 years of age, depending on whether they have only primary or higher education, were on average mothers with 25.1 or 32.1 for the first time.
There is also a further difference between women, depending on their level of education.
While the women get married before their first permanent employment and have their first child, the women with a middle or high school degree do it exactly differently and seek a permanent position and get married after that and then have their first child, Delgado notes.
Diane Kruger is also worth it
L'Oréal Paris recently added a new name: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will be the image of various products of the brand and will also say the well-known advertisement "Because you are worth it".
The leading actress from "Joyeux Noël", one of the most elegant actresses on an international level, will become another famous banner like Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before her were the last to join this exclusive club the actresses Evangeline Lilly ("Lost") and Freida Pinto ("Slumdog Millonaire").
For the men, the cosmetics company also has only exceptional ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey ("Grey ́s Anatomy") and Matthew Fox (coworker of Evangeline in "Lost").
The award ceremony of the British fashion industry
The British have an important word in the fashion world.
Their highest representatives - fashion designers and models, both yesterday and today - met at the annual award ceremony held in London at the Royal Court of Justice.
On this occasion they had all appeared.
The ex-model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, who was chosen as the best model this year.
The Poker Game by Manuel Vicent
Manuel Vicent presents in "Poker der Asse" (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) to the thirty X-rays of writers who accompanied him in his literary life (and, in some cases, even in real life).
He does not use a predictable and fear-provoking genre (short biography, life and work) but looks for an affection for the glowing heart of the Creator.
The journey is exciting and Vicent saves neither horror nor enlightenment.
Besides that this book is a delicious reading pleasure, it is also a moving invitation to read and read again and again.
Here are some excerpts from the book.
About Albert Camus: "When I read his pages, I found out that the Mediterranean is not a sea, but rather a spiritual, almost sensual drive, just as I always felt, without having found words for it: joy in contrast to unwholesome fate, morality without guilt and innocence without any god."
About Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, allegorical Christian, he wrote about what he had in the blood, not in his mind, between impotence and ignorance, with a stunning poetic humor, without any sense, like the knife blade that would have almost killed him."
About Graham Greene: "Our husband, with a passion that lasted thirteen years, was put in a trap by this woman, in whose flesh the emotions of adultery were united with the pleasures of repentance, a spiritual privilege which consisted of getting into heaven on the way of destruction."
About James Joyce: "The Odysseus" was published in 1922 in Paris by Sylvia Beach. This is one of the 8000 summits in worldwide literature, you have to climb up the north wall, on the wall where the best climbers try again and again."
About William Faulkner: "He was a funny cat.
He sometimes said about himself that he was the heir of a landowner of the county and again other times he said that he was the son of a black man and a crocodile.
Both dreams gave birth to a certain size.'
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: This writer recorded the insane cry that was screamed out of a bridge by that person from Munich, so that his echo could sound in his literary way until deep into the night of the 20th century. He did this on a journey where he fled from himself and pleaded the afterworld with a speech full of violence from the worms.
About Dorothy Parker: "One day she kneels down and prays: my dear God, I beg you to do everything in your power so that I finally stop writing like a woman."
About Joseph Conrad: "On his grave are these verses engraved by Spencer: 'the sleep after the effort,/after the storm of the port,/the peace after the war,/after a full life one finds pleasure in death."
About Virginia Wolf: "She always had her depression in her luggage.
The husband took it with complete normality when she told him that Eduard VII was spying on them between the azaleas or singing the birds in Greek.
It is not known any other case where the man was so patient and in love with a neurotic woman whose literary talent was much larger than her madness."
About Pío Baroja: "What else did Martín-Santos do than try to bring Joyce into Baroja?
What did Benet mean if he didn't bring Baroja to Faulkner's weapons?
What did Cela do, except to destroy the glory of that man, so that he could put himself on this podium?"
Fig Aggression
My 70-year-old mother walked through our neighborhood in the village of Fuenlabrada last week, when suddenly a group of young people between 15 and 18 years of age walked by her and our dog, our dog is a mixture that we got out of the animal shelter and weighs just six kilos, and then out of a cheerful sky they missed him two steps and hurt him severely.
Our dismay cannot be put into words, as it is incomprehensible to us, since the fun of a cheap aggression against a small and helpless animal, which was of course carried out on the leash, is supposed to be.
In addition, the suffocation that a woman who went for a pleasant walk had when she wanted to correct these people because of the incident, she even feared for her own life, for if such a madman attacks a dog, he might also do the same with a woman, a child, an older master or probably even with anyone who is weaker than himself.
The incident occurred in a normally quiet neighborhood at five o'clock in the afternoon on a very ordinary Tuesday.
The dog's been crying all day.
Of course, we have reported in a nearby police station, but we have great doubts as to whether this will bring anything at all and to prevent any prejudice from the beginning, we just want to make it clear that the cowards were Spaniards.
Our dismay at what has happened has prompted us to report this incident.
We cannot understand what needs to be done in the minds of these young people that they find a cheap attack on a helpless animal funny, on an animal that gives us love, society and friendship.
We do not know where good education and respect for animals and persons have remained.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of the helmet
The tire manufacturer Michelin, in cooperation with the Spanish Foundation for Traffic Safety (Fesvial), launched a campaign to promote helmet use, especially among the younger motorcyclists, as both companies today announced.
This initiative seeks to draw attention to the importance of helmet use, since this is ultimately the only protection element that can prevent head injuries or even death in the event of a motorcycle accident.
Michelin pointed out that this campaign is part of its commitment to road safety, which "includes far more than just the design and manufacture of products that are becoming more and more safe every day" and further reaffirmed that it also contributes with other actions educational and informative character to getting closer to this goal every day.
This new campaign to promote helmet use on the motorcycle, which runs under the slogan 'To be or not to be', will distribute posters in a first phase to over 500 motorbike workshops to achieve the best possible distribution.
Finally, Michelin stressed that road safety is "a constant concern" of the company, and precisely because it is always committed as a manufacturer of tyres for two-wheeled vehicles, one of its main objectives must be the development of ever safer products.
The sale of small trucks is increasing slightly again
After almost two years, the car market for small transporters finally starts to see some light at the end of the dark tunnel.
The 9,425 vehicles registered in Spain in November represent an increase of 12,6 % in 2008 and, more importantly, they are thus the first to grow at all after 22 consecutive months with a steady decline, in line with the figures presented by the Anfac and Ganvam Association of Manufacturers.
However, these good figures are currently only to be enjoyed with great caution, as the reference data used for the comparison are November 2008, which was a particularly poor sales year with a fall of 60% in the previous year.
However, it must be borne in mind that, apart from the increase last month, the total allowances for these 11 months are still 40% below the sales figures for the previous financial year.
Since January, a total of 95,853 vehicles have been sold, but in this number all the vehicles that make up the small transport market are included: descendants of passenger cars, pick-ups, small transporters, small delivery cars and lighter small trucks/cars.
Furthermore, there are still the same thunder clouds in the sky, which make demand the most pitiful, because even if some of the vehicles are purchased by private individuals, the majority of sales to small and medium-sized enterprises, which in almost 100 % of all cases make the purchase with a third-party financing.
Thus, to these limitations, which are the result of the money gap between credit institutions, one has to include other factors, such as the increase in the unemployment rate or the persistence of the bad economic situation.
With this panorama and unlike the passenger cars, the financial support has not helped much in the purchase of a 2000E vehicle.
However, this plan is not only intended for private individuals, even self-employed and small companies have a right to buy a small carrier up to 3.5 tonnes with a CO2 emissions that may not exceed 160 grams per km driven, but the low sales figures speak for themselves.
Just yesterday Ganvam had reminded us that it is essential for the state to pay special attention to these small loads as well as, of course, to industrial vehicles (cars and buses).
The car dealership association prophesied for 2010 a similar year to the previous one, for which it expects a sales failure (for passenger cars and off-road vehicles) of 19%.
Support for brake manoeuvres in critical situations is now mandatory
As with the ABS anti-lock braking system at the time, and as with the ESP stability control system at the moment, the emergency braking systems must become mandatory in European cars.
In fact, they are already mandatory for all newly registered passenger cars and light small vehicles, for the remaining vehicles a withdrawal period has been set by the end of February 2011.
The measure adopted by the European Union aims to improve the protection of pedestrians, but these braking systems can also help to prevent many road accidents due to their operation.
The task of the emergency brake assist is to exert more pressure on the brakes in the event of a critical brake manoeuvre which detects the system on the brake pedal on the basis of the brake force applied by the driver.
However, this system does not exert this pressure until the end.
According to an investigation commissioned by the component manufacturer for the Bosch vehicles, a third of the drivers involved in an accident did not get on the brake pedal before the collision, and half of them had not braked with full force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
By contrast, the braking aid intervenes in the braking system with maximum force and thus reduces the braking time and thus also the braking distance that a car travels during the braking process.
According to an EU study, up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be prevented every year if all cars were equipped with this type of emergency brake assist.
There would be even fewer accidents - one expects that every fourth accident could be prevented by personal injury - as soon as the so-called intelligent emergency braking systems become popular.
Then the vehicle is equipped with a system that detects obstacles (via radar or a camera) and warns the driver, while at the same time exerting light pressure on the brakes.
If the driver responds, the system helps him increase the pressure on the brake pedal if necessary.
If the driver does not respond to the warning and even if the collision is already inevitable, the brake assistant exerts the maximum pressure on the brakes to keep the damage as low as possible.
General Motors moves the plan for Opel until January
While the staff of the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) have already been informed by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva will start in the first week of April, probably on the 8th, according to Javier Ortega, the American vehicle manufacturer points out that he needs more time to complete the rescue plan for Opel.
Nick Reilly, the new chairman of GM Europe, wants to ensure that the affected side gives its consent to each single point of the plan in advance.
And for this reason, it may be that the final document, first presented to the workers and then to the governments of the countries in which there are works, will be postponed until the beginning of 2010.
On the other hand, GM assures that it will make a decision on the sale of Saab in the next few days.
It is not surprising that the Swedish government has increased the pressure on the American carmaker to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to be in contact with some possible new buyers.
One of these buyers could be Geely, who would also like to buy Volvo, but the option of the Dutch manufacturer of the Skyper sports cars, which has back cover from the Russian group Converg, is gaining ever stronger appeal.
If no agreement was to be reached with any of these buyers, GM could sell some assets to the Chinese BAIC.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year, if it has not been sold until then, will continue to be maintained.
At the wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
For the development of their latest and very expensive jewels, the engineers used the Boxster S as the basis and managed to make it really easy by 80 kilos, bringing only 1,275 kilos to the scales.
In order to create such a thing, they avoided the automatic folding roof, which was replaced by a screened roof with manual drive, so that alone they saved 21 kilos; thanks to the aluminium doors used in this model, such as those of the GT3 "disappear" another 15; by the removal of the air conditioner another 13; in addition, the fuel tank was reduced from 64 to 54 liters, so that another 7 kilos were saved; by the installation of sporty Bacquet seats again 12 and with the light 19-inch wheels again five were saved.
Then another six kilos less and the missing kilo had been achieved by replacing the door handles with handles made of fabric, thanks to the omission of the CDR-30 audio system.
Although it is also available with the double coupling gear PDK, the trial was carried out with a vehicle with 6-speed manual transmission, mainly on the smaller country roads of California, on mountain sections that were really very curved.
In his driving behavior, he can only be given the grade without any blame.
However, the reduction in its weight has by no means led to its becoming less secure on the road.
It is rather the opposite: for a long time now we have not tried a model as small and light, which gives you a sense of great safety in the curves, even at high speed.
He is a small athlete, able to warm his muscles at a low pace in the necessary time, until we give him the commands to race, slow down, recover and then again to get everything out of his engine ...
He does everything he is told, and the car does everything we can to show him with our hands on the steering wheel, thanks to its steering, which is as communicative as it is precise.
And he does it with the precision of a surgeon.
A motor sound for all tastes
The sound of his V6 boxer with 320 hp (10 more than the boxster S) has been very successful and you can still increase it with the 'sport' option as well as with a system that can change the engine noise, which has already been used for the first time in the Panamera.
The acceleration ability is unimaginably brutal, whether out of the stand or on the move again.
The suspensions are strong, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt on the country roads on which we drove with the Boxster Spyder was already pretty damaged, but the car did the punch holes well.
The electronic assistants had almost nothing to do on the whole route; and that, although we found ice in some of these curves in the morning grey and roll split in the morning.
In summary, you can say that it is an ultralight car, a car with which you have an indescribable driving pass, as otherwise it is rather rare and in it there is much more than just a small improvement of the boxster Ss.
The car will be on the market in February 2010 and cost EUR 70,831.
Bag Girl'
The singer, a bustling friend of Karl Lagerfeld, is the face of the cosmetics line Coco Cocoon and an occasional starlet at the fashion shows of 'maison', she presents her evil face with the same neck rigidity as her pockets of Chanel.
Much more than "Bad Girl" or "It Girl", she's a "Bag Girl".
The Baskonia gives itself a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboratory, despite the many outstanding players in the team of Dusko Ivanovic, celebrated an outstanding triumph with 82-91 during his visit to the complicated football field of Maccabi Electra and thus comes first within his group after the great appearance of Mirza Teletovic, which was with eight triples the best of his team (29 in the rating).
The team from Vitoria was able to replace the significant failures of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with a large dose of work and teamwork, even if they had to wait for their victory until the bitter end.
The great hits from the perimeter with 16 rated triples contributed to their final victory.
The game began with the leadership of the Blue Reds, who from the beginning sat at the top of the ad board.
Since the first four baskets of the team from Vitoria already came out of the perimeter, it was already possible to imagine that they had come to the field with well heated wrists.
It was English and Teletovic who were mainly responsible for the 18-20 at the end of the first quarter.
The second quarter was hardly different, only that the team from Álava opted for an internal game of Barac and for the game of Eliyahu, who was received on his return to the team with whistles and applause, which is his home to further expand their advantage until the break (34-43).
Teletovic already began to stand out as the best of his team with 13 points, even though the "minus six" rating of Splitter had already assumed that this would not be the best evening of the Brazilian.
Nevertheless, despite the clear advantage of the break, the game was long overdue, and the Maccabees wanted to remind the Vitorians that not everyone wins on their field, and thanks to the repeatedly attacking "Hand of Elijah" they came back to the game.
Eidson and Pnini contributed decisively to the "Yellows" turning the rudder (50-49).
More Disadvantages
Ivanovic's team, injured, but everything but dead, had to prepare a few games with security to get air back, and one of them suddenly came up with Mirza Teletovic's pistol, which with three almost consecutive triples and with the support of English and Ribas made sure that the ad display was shown again a rowing distance of (54-67) that the host could embellish at the end of the third quarter with (57-67).
The Alaves were blossed in the last quarter and English and San Emeterio (60-75) already announced that they would not allow anyone to take away the victory they had honestly earned in the first three minutes.
Nevertheless, Pnini and Eidson resigned, not the best of their team, and tried to force their team through three points from the line (70-77).
Nevertheless, and although splitter was put in place because of Fouls, Ivanovic's team did not give up, defended themselves well and although the Israelis still picked up in the last minute (80-85), the game had already lost a winner and Tel Aviv lost for the first time in this season.
Injury prevented Unicaja from being given the forehead
Unicaja lost loudly in Greece against Olympiacos and had to resign the leadership in Group B of the Euroliga to him, and that was marked in a game that was marked by the failure of the players of Unicajas (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), especially in the game of the interior, which facilitated the victory of the Greeks.
The team from Málaga was neither afraid of the mood in the hall of peace and friendship nor of the opposing team, which is perhaps one of the strongest in Europe and has a lot of money.
Thanks to their first-quarter game, the Andalusians were allowed to dream. An aggressive defense and three consecutive triples, two of them by Omar Cook and one by Guillem Rubio, the hosts were blinded with 12-18 in the 9th minute.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of Unicaja, even though the local team with an internal game between Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis managed to show the scoreboard in the 13th minute 22-20 in their favor, the minute in which, due to an action, it would have come almost to the battle between the two Americans Beverley and Williams and therefore both were disqualified.
The Greek team finally started to get warm and its superiority on both sides of the game, while the departure of the Englishman Joel Freeland due to an injury and the three self-caused mistakes of Carlos Jiménez left clear traces of Unicaja.
Among their players in the field and the Lithuanian forerunner Linas Kleizas, with his triples, they increased their advantage in the 19th minute to 44-32.
A catch-up hunt was impossible
The third quarter was characterized by many attacks against the team of Olympiacos, which proved superior despite its 19 losses and even managed to compensate the difference of the game played in Málaga with 66-48 in the 27th minute, which in turn led the group to fluctuate.
Unicaja tried to get over the many failures and the departure of Robert Archibald, who had been injured during the game.
Despite the many disadvantages for the Unicaja came back in the 31st minute thanks to the leadership and triple of Cook and the use of Lewis some hope for 66-57.
Nevertheless, it was actually impossible because the Olympics, as soon as he attacked and showed his superiority with centimeters within the basket area, were not to be slowed down.
The Croatian captain Nikola Vujcic managed in the 37th minute to raise the basket difference to 81-62 and Unicaja had to be beaten and had to resign to Olympicos.
How much should you earn in Facebook because of his profile?
The users of Facebook can now, thanks to the new application Trovit, the search engine with most ads of real estate, job offers and cars in Spain, learn their salary that they should earn due to their profile.
The tool "How much should you earn?" calculates the salaries of users based on more than 140,000 job offers available at Trovit in Spain. Users can enter a form in Facebook into which they can enter their profession, professional experience, age and the city in which they work.
Already after a week after the application was available for the first time, the search engine found out that the Spanish worker feels "poorly paid on average," explains the product manager, Albert Ribera, in a press release.
The Spanish are the worst paid according to the data Trovit has through its search engines in Great Britain and France.
A British programmer receives an annual gross salary of 45,226 euros and a Frenchman of 31,059, in contrast to the 24,000 euros that a Spaniard earns.
As a result, a truck driver has an annual net salary of EUR 34,247 in England, EUR 25,751 in France and EUR 16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the worst paid work in Spain is that of a waiter with an annual net of 11,592 euros; followed by the work of a seller with 14,725 euros and that of a worker with 15,667 euros.
The most sought-after jobs on the Internet in the last three months are those of a driver, half-day workers and social workers.
Brazil calls Zelaya a date to leave
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for the stay of Manuel Zelaya in her embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The President of the Office must leave the diplomatic service by 27 January 2010 at the latest when his mandate officially expires.
Francisco Catunda, the trade delegate to the Brazilian Embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows that he must have left the message he had found since September 21st.
"He is aware that he has to leave on January 27th, because his mandate is due on that day and he has to look for a new accommodation."
The sender also quoted the ex-president, who confirmed his intention to leave the message before the scheduled date: "My position is to go as soon as possible, logically with the back cover of the government of Brazil," Zelaya explained on the phone.
After the elections on November 29 (where Porfirio Lobo won), Zelaya assured him that he would remain in the Brazilian Embassy until January.
However, this week he tried to find refuge in Brazil.
This failed, however, to deny Zelayas the status of an asylum seeker who wanted to force the de facto government under Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you very much!
After the most tempting days since last spring, when the inflation of the assets was the prevailing mood in the markets, the uncertainty has returned to the markets, which is by no means surprising, as this is their natural state, in an environment in which the brokers make decisions about an uncertain future by nature.
The measure used to stabilise the markets was to settle the debt with the direct purchase of assets and to allow indirectly the liquidity to be released at interest rates that move around zero so that the banks buy assets to settle.
The central banks have already confirmed that the direct purchases of assets are almost complete and, without questioning their heterodox policy on liquidity, begin to scatter some sand into the gear as the BCE already launched with its annual auction next week.
Therefore, investors doubt the ability of the world economy to maintain economic recovery without these heterodox measures and we are witnessing a reversal in the reduction of risk premiums.
The volatility of the stock exchanges and the differences in corporate bonuses are rising again, even though they are still far from the paranormal amounts they reached at the beginning of the year.
The states were forced to publicise private risks and government debt is rising again.
The focus is again on quality and the USA, Japan and Germany are the preferred place of refuge for investors, which in turn leads to an increase in the differences between the countries of the Eurozone in terms of Germany.
Until now, Spain had hardly been affected by this episode of instability, but then Standard & Poor's came and threatened with a new revision downwards regarding Spain's assessment.
On the other hand, a certain uncertainty does not harm the defenders of moral risk who had once again tried to raise awareness among those responsible for global economic policy of what they had caused, as they had curbed the devastating effects that the limitation of loans led to the loss of jobs when they should have decided to take a new day of thank-you action.
Nevertheless, what has happened in Dubai suggests a tribal war between the Emirs to restore power in the Emirates and the development in Greece has also been anticipated in the past.
A government that conceals the state debt, elections and a new government that draws on the same strand.
Prodi did it in Italy to Berlusconi and Sócrates in Portugal to Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense for Ecofin to rescue Hungary from the non-fulfilment of its foreign payments at the beginning of the year and thus allow a euro member country to cease to comply with its obligations.
On the other hand, it is logical that Ecofin has forced the Greek government to be transparent and to take its citizens into the duty of taking out-of-court measures in order to maintain the stability of state funds.
Yes, we are as expected before an episode of normalization of risk premiums, after some outflows of too much, would now be within the expected amount.
In the case of Spain, there is no need to worry as long as the differences in government debt increase at the same speed as the European business bonuses.
However, if European differences were to decrease and the Spanish were to increase further, this would be a special Spanish risk.
Standard & Poor's is a farce. While the above-mentioned indicators force a large part of the market research institutes to prefer their recovery scenarios and to correct their 2011 scenario upwards, including the OCDE and the European Commission, which are therefore coming back with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy, all of this does not promise a long life span despite warnings.
Once again, it seems that it is an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish shares, although "cautious driving" is at the moment.

The chairman of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to appear before Parliament's subcommittee yesterday, when the strategy on Spain's energy supply is being debated in the next two decades.
After his appearance, which was followed by the chairman of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Galán gave the press some clues about what he had submitted to the subcommittee behind closed doors.
According to the President of Iberdrola, Spain will have to invest EUR 50 billion by 2020 and another 60 billion by 2030, provided that current nuclear power plants continue to operate.
If this were not the case, the investment needed would amount not to 60 billion but to 95 billion.
However, Iberdrola believes that it is no longer necessary to invest in an increase in energy generation capacity, but rather in distribution networks and international alliances.
As of 2020, the issue will change and performance should be increased.
His proposal focuses on both gas and coal plants with carbon dioxide capture facilities and, of course, on renewable energies.
In this case, it assumes that 18,000 MW will be needed more, under the condition of course due to other "support energies".
Galán, who believes that the bill for a sustainable economy, just adopted by the government, is in line with what his company has demanded, did not in any case want to say anything against this law, how to create incentives for national coal consumption, which would be exactly the opposite of all political strategies in the fight against climate change.
In his opinion, "in the long term it is clearly set on this direction, despite some "individual" measures, as the President of Iberdrola said.
Be it as it may, Galán believes that decisions on investment should already be made now, even if they are long-term, as it will take some time and a stable remuneration framework to tackle them.
Ferrovial gets Aer Lingus' "handling" at ten airports
The subsidiary of Ferrovial for services at airports on the ground, Swiss Swiss Sport, is the preferred partner of the Irish Flugesellschaft Aer Lingus for luggage services at ten European airports at which they are represented.
Paris, London, Frankfurt and Brussels are some of the most important.
The agreement, to which no figures have yet been published, has been concluded for five years.
On the other hand, yesterday Ferrovial, the government of Castile-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed a protocol for cooperation to create an innovation centre for intelligent infrastructures.
The alliance plans investments of 20 million to 2012, of which 50 % will come from Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the Centre will be to examine energy efficiency at motorways and airports.
Acciona competes with high-deep and Bouygues for its first highway construction in Australia
Acciona is fighting for the approval of its first motorway in Australia, a market in which they are already represented as energy and water companies.
The construction is a tunnel that will cost 1.7 billion Australian dollars (about 1.047 billion euros).
The French company Bouygues and the German high-deep are its competitors.
A 5 km long tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east coast, has become the best opportunity for Acciona to establish itself in the country as a construction company and highway operator.
The city administration wants the construction completed at the end of 2014.
After the administration has decided on public-private cooperation (PPP is the English abbreviation) in order to advance the project according to a business plan drawn up by Ernst & Young, the administration is already in possession of a final list of candidates for construction and toll point management.
In anticipation of the offers presented in May, the estimated investment amounts to 1.7 billion Australian dollars (1.047 billion euros), with three consortia, mainly European construction companies, competing at the last stage.
The group called Transcity is led by Acciona, the only Spanish company, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first company is one of Australia's largest construction companies, while the second is based in Italy, one of the best specialists in civil engineering.
Against the team of Acciona, the Consortium of Northern Direct, formed by the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian Transfield, which is responsible for infrastructure and the French Bouygues.
The third and last consortium, which is in the narrower choice, is called LBRJV, formed from the capital of the Australian Leighton (subsidiary of the German construction company Hochtief, which in turn belongs to ACS), which is also native Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the French company Razel, which specializes in public construction.
The Australian infrastructure market promises to overcome massive construction work and privatisation, however, has a barrier to overcome, as access is only obtained through the purchase of a local construction company.
A strategy that has been followed by the said companies, in addition to Asian references, and which must only be followed by the Spanish builders.
Even ACS has gained access to this market only through its 30 % participation in High Depth, the owner of the Leighton mentioned.
Millions of Assets
Acciona attaches great importance to this geographical area for the sector in which it is already well known because of its activity as an energy supplier and in the desalination industry.
Under other assets, it already has its large wind farm (192 MW) in Victoria and leads the group of companies commissioned to build and manage Adelaide’s desalination plant with a budget of 700 million.
It is his intention now to consolidate itself in these two areas and to use these synergies to gain access to the construction and infrastructure branches.
The underground toll line, which will be supported by the city's infrastructure office and called the Northern Link (Nordzubringer), aims to connect the western highway in Toowong with the bypass road in Kelvin Grove (see map) on a length of 5 kilometres through tunnels. This is the largest measure of staure reduction on Brisbane streets.
The schedule issued by the city administration foresees the award for summer 2010 and the start of the construction work in December next year.
Even if this toll line is to open up to traffic in the last months of 2014, it is estimated that construction will continue until 2016.
The tunnel was designed in 2005.
It has two lanes in each direction, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The government of Queensland participates in financing with 500 million Australian dollars (308 million euros).
Brisbane is already a big business for high depths.
Australia is constantly awarding substantial contracts to High-Depletion, which yesterday signed a contract with the government of 154 million.
The sub-company ACS will use its local subsidiary Leighton to improve the infrastructure of the domestic broadband network with fiber optic cables.
This improvement will provide rapid Internet access for 400,000 people and will employ the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has received the King George Tower construction project with 27 floors in Brisbane City, Australia. The construction work has not yet begun and has received a high depth of 129 million.
Also in the United Kingdom, in Manchester, it competes with Laing O'Rourke for the construction and administration of two schools for 25 years.
Initial investment amounts to EUR 75 million.
FCC receives the contract for a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC has acquired its subsidiary Alpine, the construction of a tunnel over 2.1 kilometres in length for a motorway in Slovenia over the sum of 64.5 million euros.
The company received this contract only a few days after it received the grant for the construction work to expand the Bosruck tunnel (Austria) over 130 million.
In this way Alpine strengthens its experience in tunnelling.
The start of construction work is planned for the beginning of 2010 and its implementation will last for 32 months.
Sri. Rushmore receives advertising of Renfe
Renfe has attributed advertising and marketing services for the next two years to the agency Sra. Rushmore for a sum of about three million euros annually, the railway company announced.
In this contract there is also the possibility of two extensions of 12 months each. Sri. Rushmore was selected among 16 agencies which presented themselves to this competition, launched by Renfe, 4 of which came to the final round, among them TBWA, which was responsible for advertising in the last three years.
From now on, Sri. Rushmore will be responsible for the design and production of the campaigns.
Punish over 63 million for France Télécom because of the slowdown in competition.
France Télécom has imposed a penalty of more than EUR 63 million on competition regulators in France for anticompetitive behaviour in the Caribbean.
According to the Authority, the telephone provider has restricted competition in landline and mobile telephony by signing exclusive contracts, pricing plans and loyalty programmes for consumers on the margins of regulation.
Together with this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state-owned company has accumulated more than EUR 560 million in penalties since 1994 due to the handicap of its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday was even increased, because the authority that watches over the competition believes that France Télécom has committed similar crimes in the past and has therefore fallen back.
Application trade
On the other hand, the French company’s subsidiary has followed the example of other telephone providers and has opened up an application trading site on the Internet to increase revenues from non-telephone transactions.
In principle, this Orange application website is active in France and the United Kingdom.
One has to wait until 2010 until this site will also be available in other countries, such as Spain.
The game at the Champions League has brought in Madrid and Barça 476.4 million since the beginning.
The Champions League has developed into a source of revenue for the football club since its inception in 1992.
So much so that Real Madrid and Barcelona have since taken 476.4 million, bringing them the third and fifth place of football clubs that have made the most money in the league.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
Winning the Champions League of the UEFA brings not only fame with it. It is also one of the main sources of revenue of the big clubs.
According to the UEFA, the league has distributed up to EUR 5.362.5 million to the 105 teams (including 12 Spanish) who have participated in this event since its inception in the 1992/1993 season.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona have benefited from this distribution.
The white club is located in third place in Europe, which has made the most money through its participation and the only one who won the trophy three times next to the AC Milan.
The current Catalan champion and last winner of the former European Cup in 1992 takes fifth place.
The list leads to Manchester United and Bayern Munich, two teams who also took the most money through their participation in the last Champoins League.
And that, even though they have lost against Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only third of the countries that were able to take money from the Champions, although it has more titles than everyone else (five, in contrast to four bee Italy, three with England and two with Germany).
Distribution
This obvious contradiction is explained by the complicated financial allocation procedure used by UEFA.
During this financial year, the organisation chaired by Michel Platini expects to receive a revenue of 1,090 million from the Champions League.
Of this money, UEFA provides 413.1 million for fixed payments: each of the 20 football clubs participating in the qualifying round (including the Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who competed received 3.8 million due to their bloated presence, in addition to the 550,000 euros for each game they disputed.
There is also a bonus for winning (800.000 euros) and for a draw (400.000 euros per team). Clubs that have come to the eighth final receive three million each; the four that have come to the quarter final, 3.3 million each.
The last four will each receive 4 million.
The winner earns 9 million, as opposed to the second, who receives 5.2 million.
So a football club gets at least 7.1 million and at most 31.2 million in fixed income.
Barça again earned 2.5 million with his victory at the European Super Cup in August.
However, there are also variable payments, for which 337.8 million are foreseen.
This money is allocated proportionally to the value of each individual television market.
The Spanish is among the first and has 4 assigned places.
Last year's champion receives 40% of the money allocated, 30% of the second, 20% of the third and 10% of the fourth.
The other part is distributed depending on the number of games they play at this year's edition.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million for 29.9% participation in Sos
Yesterday, the Nueva Rumasa Group saw through to the purchase offer of shares with which it intends to acquire a ceiling of between 25 and 29,9 % of Sos' capital.
A percentage that does not force them to make a public tender (opa) due to the number of shares.
In concrete terms, Nueva Rumasa offers EUR 1.5025 per share, which is paid out to ten years and with an interest rate of 1% per year due to this shift.
Yesterday, the Sos shares closed with EUR 1.85, which is why Nueva Rumasa considers the company to be 18% below market value.
According to Nuevan Rumasa, the price of 1.50 Euro reflects the real evaluation of Sos.
The offer is linked to the appointment of eight of the 15 consultants.
The Jérez Group gives shareholders a period of 15 days to inform them of their interest in the sale of their shares.
CNMV confirmed that it had not been informed of this offer, although Ruiz Mateos confirmed that it had come into contact with the Authority.
At a close, the deposit would amount to 611.7 million, while the value of Sos is 254.27 million.
In the meantime, Sos continues to restructure its management.
In an attempt to stay on the verge of possible offers of purchase and the judicial questions of his ex-managers, the brothers Jesús and Jaime Salazar announced the appointment of María Luisa Jordá as head of the internal book review.
A decision that makes her the first woman to have a high position in the food business.
This is a newly created post, which is directly under the chairman of the group.
This is anything but free from polemics, because the company is involved in a court battle because of the suspicion of redirection of more than 230 million of Sos to other companies in the Salazar family.
It cannot be excluded that Sos will move further capital over the next few months.
With regard to the Salazar loan, the ex-consultants Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (representatives of the CCM and Unicaja) appeared before the National Assembly yesterday and confirmed that they had authorised the postponement of 212 million without knowing their destination.
CNMV approves the public exclusion notice submitted by Paternina by the investment company Mer
The National Stock Exchange Commission (CNMV) approved the public tender for Federico Paternina submitted by the investment company Mer on 9 October.
The supervisory authority stated that it approved this invitation to tender after it had been established that the conditions comply with the legally binding laws and can therefore be considered as "sufficient" in the content of the explanatory note submitted, following the amendments of last 2 December.
CNMV has also announced that this offer is intended to acquire 550.008 shares of Federico Paternina at the price of EUR 7.65 per share, which in turn is 8.95 % of the capital of the company, which consists of EUR 6,142,786 in shares admitted to the Madrid and Bilbao stock exchanges.
In addition, it has been announced that 5,592,778 million shares have been fixed, which cannot be transferred in any way until the closing of the tender and whose price has been fixed by Federico Paternina in accordance with the laws of law.
New vehicle assessment programmes
In these days of storms and accidents not only the car repair shops deserve
Every day, thousands of vehicles involved in an accident are dragged into the workshops, where an expert has to assess the damage caused and the cost of the repair.
No accident is the same and calculating the cost of the parts and working hours can be a long and complicated task.
The calculation of repair costs of between 20,000 and 30,000 euros by hand, including parts and working hours, may take up to two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the support of the latest information technology tools, it is a matter of minutes
That is why almost 100 % of the experts use this type of system.
Service and application providers for the assessment of accidents and repairs shall collect the information they receive from manufacturers in order to process it accordingly and to offer them to their customers in the form of a useful programme.
In Spain, Audatex, part of the American group Solera, is the market leader; 80% of all opinions are produced with their products.
The other two companies competing with the tool market for assessment and preparation of a report are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data that manufacturers make available is anything but simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, Sales Manager of Audatex, 63 manufacturers and importers are working together, each of them providing the information in a different format.
In addition, the volume of data to be processed is becoming larger and larger, up to the point that in the last five years more versions, variants and motorizations have been on the market than in the 15 years before.
As soon as a new car enters the market, the work begins for the companies.
It is a laborious task, for each of the thousands of vehicle parts has to be catagolated and its price entered.
In addition, each model creates an "intelligent" graphics image on which you can "click" different parts of the vehicle.
If this is a much-sold model, the work can be completed in a week if the procedure is speedy.
If it is a less common car, it can take up to three or four months. Currently, Audatex has full information at 99.2% of the cars distributed in Spain.
Among the more exclusive models, for example, they have information about the Porsche models, but not via Ferrari or Lamborghini.
With regard to the road-riding vehicle fleet, it is over 99%.
For the execution of documentation work and the production of databases, Audatex has eight centres worldwide (Spain, France, Germany, the USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) and each of them specializes in certain brands.
The national headquarters are located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (usually mechanics) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex invests 90 million euros annually in the development of these databases.
Each month they record 2.5 million data and their customers receive the updates every other day.
The development of this enormous flow of information enables companies to use it in different ways and thus offer different products.
The most common use is the use for repairs and repairs, but depending on the country, there are also tools for the management of scrap parts or for calculating the error or residual value of a car.
The only company that informs about a guide who is about the value of used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer this offer in Spain but in the United States.
With the transparency of the products offered by Audatex, you can easily get an overview of the type of support it provides to industry experts.
This company offers ten different tools, with the star of the products AudaPlus, a standard solution for handling accidents for the experts.
It includes vehicles, motorcycles and light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it contains the repair times or paint prices estimated by the manufacturer.
This tool is paid depending on the purpose of use, i.e. for each opinion.
It will be the most expensive for customers who rarely use it up to a maximum of ten times a month, namely 5.75 euros per month.
On the other hand, every insurance company that produces thousands of opinions negotiates the price with Audatex.
With other products, such as AudaVIN, you can fully identify a vehicle and the equipment with which it ran from the assembly line, using the chassis number alone.
AudaGlass deals with the vehicle discs, and AudaSubastas is an online service open to the specialist market, with which you can provide for vehicles that have been declared to be total damage.
Your statistical service is very useful in identifying trends, carrying out geodemographic analyses or in obtaining information on the variations by brand and model.
For example, one can examine how many models of a particular car brand had to go to the workshop because of breakdowns or how many of them were involved in a serious accident during a certain period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of computer tools.
It distributes among others Gt Estimate, which is also intended for reviewers and provides digital images of the same kind, access to parts or prices and official working hours of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Eina Group, which was founded in 1971 as a provider of services and solutions for the assessment of damages, breakdowns and maintenance of vehicles.
The GT leader for expert opinions is a reference product on the market.
They work with 24,000 users in workshops, 3,100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
In the last three years, their business volume has increased by 20% annually and in 2008 its turnover was EUR 10.8 million.
At the beginning of last year they began to go on the international market with the opening of an office in Paris.
Audatex, on the other hand, was founded in Germany in 1966 and established in Spain in 1979.
According to the company's sources, 62% of its business is in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38% in North and South America. They work with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 workshops, 3,000 of them in Spain.
Total sales in the world of the Solera group (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) amount to 557 million dollars, 3.35 more than in 2008.
The company has revenue of EUR 19.1 million, 7.2% more than in the previous year.
In 2005, the Solera Group was worth $1 billion on the stock exchange and today its shares are traded at a value of $2.4 billion.
Since 2007, they have been on the New York Stock Exchange and part of the Standard & Poor's Reference Index.
Auctioning of accident cars on the Internet
Last October, the Solera Autoonline group bought a record fom on the Internet for the sale of accident vehicles and motorcycles.
This purchase meant the payment of EUR 59.5 million for 85% of the company's capital, which could increase to the remaining 15% next year.
The purpose of this purchase was to offer its customers more services and value-enhancing, with the possibility of gaining access to a huge international market.
This review and purchase service is exclusively addressed to professionals such as insurance companies, experts, car rental companies, workshops, scrap sites and car dealers, who need to be registered prior to their activities.
This platform was founded in Germany in 1996 and manages more than 650,000 operations across Europe, 500,000 of them in Germany alone.
Their main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
Today, the website has more than 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 consultants.
Each day 3,000 ads are managed and 100 new ads are added to the Spanish market every day.
According to Spanish legislation, a vehicle whose chassis number has been unregistered may no longer drive on the roads, but certain parts which are not damaged may be used as spare parts.
The cars with historical value, on the other hand, may be re-authorised even if they have been de-registered after difficult administrative procedures.
Estimate of the cost of the workshop in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, the company Audatex ensures that the user receives a cost estimate in just four steps: identification of the vehicle, search of the spare part, creation and creation of a cost estimate.
The easy handling of these systems is a fundamental condition, especially to convince older professionals, who are usually more or less opposed to the use of these new computer techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, 666 of which are passenger cars, 109 off-road vehicles, 137 motorcycles, 78 small hauliers and 44 trucks.
Of course, you need a computer with Internet connection to use.
After the model to be repaired has been identified using the chassis number, a graphic of the respective model appears and then the required spare part is selected.
The user can include variables such as the price for working hours, surcharges or discounts, and thereafter he can have the cost estimate printed out and pass it on to his customers.
AudaTaller, however, is not a tool for assessment such as AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalogue.
The main difference between the two systems is that the workshop-oriented approach does not include estimated working hours.
The cost of using this tool is 350 euros a year, an amount that the customer can pay without further delay.
Currently, the company Audatex is working to offer these images in three-dimensional format.
This is an innovation that car mechanics have been waiting for for a long time, as you can, for example, choose a door with it and then turn the picture completely around to look at the inside.
