DFB Chief Grindel sees no basis for Özil-Comeback
Berlin DFB President Reinhard Grindel currently sees no basis for a return of Mesut Özil to the national team.
"This is a question that, of course, depends on one's getting into a conversation, that one also talks to him about why he apparently felt something like that in his statement," said Grindel in the football podcast "Phrasenmacher" of the "Picture newspaper.
Despite the now months of debate over the photos of Özil with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he regrets the resignation of the 92-fold national player Özil.
"I would have been pleased if Mesut Özil had continued to play for Germany.
I also assumed at some point that this would be the case," said Grindel.
The 29-year-old had declared his resignation from the DFB team in July, and he was also justified by the fact that Grindel had not defended him against racist adversities during the World Cup.
The DFB Chief repeated his criticism of Özil that he was not ready for a conversation with German coach Joachim Löw and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He didn't want to build up pressure, but he knows it from football so that "if you leave a team or change a club, you talk about it with his coach and I feel sorry that this conversation hasn't happened so far".
Linz: Garden cottage in Schrebergartensiedlung burned
At 14.13 o'clock the professional fire department Linz was alerted to a fire in the Angererhofweg.
Because a high-voltage line leads directly across the Schrebergarten settlement, danger was in default.
The professional fire department pulled out and found the hut in full fire when it arrived.
The roof had to be removed practically to the full and fire protection to the strictly necessary extent.
According to the owner of the burning garden hut, he had put on a battery for lunch.
That might be the cause of the fire.
At any rate, the charger was in the area of the greatest fire intensity according to the fire department.
The damage caused by the fire still needs to be determined - as well as the cause of the fire.
However, he is likely to be considerable, for the owner had many collector's items in his garden hut.
Angry Mother Fights: Lindsay Lohan Attacks Refugee Family on Open Street
What only led Lindsay Lohan to this very strange action?
She apparently wanted to detach the children from an alleged refugee family.
Lindsay Lohan (32, "Herbie: Fully Loaded") has himself streamed live, as she apparently wants to detach a family in Moscow.
This is reported by the U.S. portal "TMZ" and publishes a partial cut-off of the stream.
Here you see "Happy Kissing" with Lindsay Lohan
The clip shows Lohan getting out of a car and going to a potentially homeless family who wants to make her a refugee from Syria.
When the family flees from the actress, Lohan follows the parents and their children.
She accuses adults of trafficking in children.
For all this, she doesn't provide any evidence in the clip.
"The whole world sees this right," Lohan is hearing in the video how she continues to follow the family along the road.
Apparently, she is trying to separate the children from her parents.
At some point, however, the obviously angry mother seems to be enough.
It looks like she's turning around and Lohan is missing an earring.
Under tears, the actress turns to how shocked she is - and she keeps her cheek.
What Lohan has done to this action is currently completely unclear.
Landing on Ryugu: This task has "Mascot" on the asteroid
The Hayabusa2 probe was launched in December 2014 in Japan.
It should approach the asteroid Ryugu so much that it can absorb material from its surface and bring it to earth.
The lander "Mascot" will stay on Ryugu.
Foreign Ticker: Number of deaths on Sulawesi increases to more than 400
After the severe earthquake of the thickness 7.5 and subsequent tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, at least 420 deaths are mentioned.
The number of victims could increase even further.
The rescue teams have not yet moved into the devastated areas cut off from the outside world.
Elon Musk resigns as Tesla Supervisory Board Chief
At first there was a tweet.
At the beginning of August, Tesla-Chief Elon Musk caused unrest in the stock markets when he announced a withdrawal from the Eletro Automaker.
The U.S. stock exchange supervisor sued him for fraud, but now both have agreed.
Tesla and Musk have to pay, and the Tesla Chief resigns from the Supervisory Board, but he is allowed to remain Chairman of the Board.
British Conservative Party
Sightly guarded - the Tories Party
Birmingham becomes the stage of a power struggle.
At the party's meeting it will be about foreign policy, trade and development policy, but the four-day conference will be overshadowed by the dispute between Prime Minister Theresa May and the Brexit hardliners, to the front-run ex-Minister of Foreign Affairs Boris Johnson.
Referendum for a new State name
Foreign Ministers of Macedonia (right) and Greece have already agreed
Macedonia is a state in the Balkans, but Macedonia is also a province in northern Greece.
Skopje and Athens have been arguing about these name doubles for years.
Now they have agreed.
The state of Macedonia is to be called northern Macedonia in the future, and on this Sunday the people are voting against it - whether it is going well?
Protests in Brazil against right-wing populists Bolsonaro.
"Ele Nao" ("The non") - is Jair Bolsonaro.
A week before the presidential elections in Brazil, the mood is divided in the country.
Thousands went on the streets in several cities to protest against the right-wing populist Jair Bolsonaro.
The "Trump of Brazil" is an anti-system candidate and is therefore in front of the polls.
His strongest competitor is Fernando Haddad of the Left Workers' Party.
Audi: "Dieselgate" processing takes longer than planned
"The Diesel Task Force is still in place," said development director Peter Mertens of the "Automobile Week" business journal.
The imprisoned and retired Audi Chief Rupert Stadler announced in December 2017 that the task force would soon be disbanded.
"In the first quarter of 2018 all engine/gearwork combinations are expected to be tested," he said.
Mertens now said: "At the beginning of July, we reached an important stage in the resolution of the diesel crisis.
We have completed the internal technical analyses of our VTDI engines.
The task force was founded in September 2015 after the discovery of the diesel scandal at the Audi-Mother Volkswagen.
Mertens stressed that the carmaker had made "significant organizational changes" so that such a scandal would never occur again.
The VW Supervisory Board had postponed a decision on Stadler's future on Friday and wants to discuss it further on this Tuesday.
The investigation authorities are accusing the Audi chief of having authorised the sale of diesel cars with false exhaust values after the exhaust gas fraud has become known.
He knew or deliberately ignored the manipulations.
At the moment, Head of Sales Bram Schot heads the company as Chief Executive Officer.
Because of the change to the new exhaust gas and consumption test standard WLTP, production failures occurred in Audi, said Schot of the "Heilbronn voice".
In principle, he sees a declining demand for limousines such as the Audi models A6, A7 and A8, which are produced in Neckarsulm.
"The segment itself is difficult," he said.
Schot relies on electromobility.
For the e-tron, the first Audi electric car, there were already 15,000 reservations.
Grindel strives to re-election - Lahm is expected to take part in the DFB Presidency
Mainz (dpa) - Reinhard Grindel wants to run once again for office as DFB President despite the criticism of his person after the World Championships and the Özil affair next year.
"I do my job and try to do it as well as I can," said Grindel as a guest at ZDF's "Current Sports Studio" on the early Sunday morning.
You have to keep trying to re-elect, I will.
And then you have to see if the support is there.
In his own words, the head of the association would find it "wonderful" if he did not have "the desire to participate in the future project" after the award for the European Football Championship 2024.
Since April 2016, Grindel has been Head of the Association as a successor to Wolfgang Niersbach, who has fallen over the summer fairy tale affair.
In autumn 2016 he was elected for a first complete term of three years.
The next vote will take place at the DFB Bundestag on 27 September 2019.
According to Grindel, the future EM Chief Organizer Philipp Lahm is to work in the DFB Presidency.
"I would be pleased if my colleagues in the Bureau agreed that in this role he would also be advised in the Bureau in the future and then, of course, would be cordially invited to make his experience available in sporting matters," said Grindel.
In speculation whether Lahm could become his successor as DFB chief, he did not want to participate.
As a consequence of the affair over the photos of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Grindel expressed the wish that a national player without a migration background should become DFB's integration ambassador.
Currently, this office is run by the native Brazilians Cacau and Celia Sasic, the latter has family roots in Cameroon.
"If one is clearly involved in society and football without a migration background and says, "the issue is important, then we have to take care of it," that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our clubs on the ground where integration must work," said Grindel.
Gently lose weight with half-smart scales
I've had a new toy for four weeks.
A balance that not only measures my weight, but also the body fat content.
It can also display muscle and bone mass.
The body mass index calculates the thing too, but it's more for the sausage.
He doesn't tell me if I've replaced fat with muscle.
Basketball League: Clear follow-up for Berlin and Oldenburg
Berlin - ALBA Berlin started with a clear victory for the new season of the basketball league.
Against Science City Jena, the Vice Champion won without a problem at 112:55 (52:31) and offered a convincing game for over 40 minutes.
New entry Rokas Giedraitis was top scorer for the dominant Berliners with 20 points.
The national player Johannes Thiemann (18 counter) from Ludwigsburg also showed an appealing performance before 9113 spectators in his compulsory play debut.
Ex-Master Brose Bamberg won the compulsory play debut of Trainer Ainars Bagatskis with 84:80 (39:37) at s.Oliver Würzburg.
Augustine Rubit was the best pitcher among the guests with 24 points.
Würzburg-Profi Gabriel Olaseni came to 14 counters.
The last-year-old Playoff semi-finalist MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg defeated the Fraport Skyliners from Frankfurt with 83:76 (41:34).
New national player Karim Jallow was the best shooter in the team of coach John Patrick with 24 points.
The EWE Baskets Oldenburg started the new season with a clear success.
At the basketball lions Braunschweig there was a clear 100:64 (48:30) and the first two points.
The new gamemaker Will Cummings overcame the Oldenburgers with 25 counters.
The Braunschweiger, where NBA-Star Dennis Schröder has been a majority owner since the beginning of the season, disappointed after a good first quarter.
A 26:1 race of the basketballs quickly provided clear conditions.
Erdoğan opens mosque in Cologne
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan officially opened the ditib mosque in Cologne on Saturday.
Erdoğan had previously met with Chancellor Angela Merkel and Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier during his three-day state visit.
Criticism of Germany
In his opening speech, Erdoğan called on the German government to deliver living supporters of the Gülen movement in Germany and to take action against Kurdish separatists.
We will protect our citizens no matter where they live.
We will not allow the sympathizers of the PKK or the Gülen movement to shake our citizens and harm German-Turkish friendship," he said.
For the opening of the ditib mosque, the city centre of Cologne had been partially blocked.
Several thousand policemen were in use - among them also snipers.
The Islam Association Ditib is critical because it is regarded as an extended arm of the Turkish government.
Global Citizen Festival: Music against Poverty: Stars, Bow Calls and Horror Seconds
Musicians such as Janet Jackson, John Legend, Shawn Mendes and Cardi B have won a joint concert in the Central Park of New York for more commitment to the fight against poverty and diseases.
"Involve you wherever you can," said Mendes at the festival in the night to Sunday in front of about 600,000 spectators.
Thank you for coming here. It's a dream.
Cardi B appeared in a red outfit with fringes and golden microphone.
I'm nervous, I'm sweating, but it's okay, because I'm here and ready to change the world.
Actors such as Hugh Jackman and Forest Whitaker, as well as representatives of governments, the United Nations and relief organizations, also appeared on stage in the multi-hour spectacle.
In the meantime, however, there was a horrific second when many spectators thought the sound of a falling metal lock for shots got scared and tried to escape.
In a short time, panic arose, people ran into each other.
Seven spectators were easily injured, said the organizer Hugh Evans.
However, the New York police and the musician Chris Martin calmed people from the stage.
"No one tries to hurt anyone," said Martin.
You're all safe.
Tickets for the "Global Citizens Festival" concert were available free of charge on the Internet as every year.
Anyone who wanted to join one had to read and disseminate texts, photos and videos about the global fight against poverty and diseases on the Internet.
For the many musicians and actors there was a cheer and applause for the public for the Republican Senator Jeff Flake.
This, together with his democratic colleague Chris Coons, spoke on the stage for more equality between men and women.
On Friday, however, Flake, in the U.S. Senate Judicial Committee for the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh, had declared himself a judge on the Supreme Court and had therefore confronted many women.
At least three women have filed abuses until attempted rape against Kavanaugh, who rejects them.
Flake called for an FBI investigation of the allegations after he faced two women who reportedly had their own sexual assaults on the way to a committee meeting in an elevator.
"You can also come together with me at any time in an elevator," Flake said to the audience at the concert in New York.
Freedom of the press: Federal Government defends the journalist's outrage
Government spokesperson Steffen Seibert has defended a journalist's report from the press conference of Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
At the chancellor's office, the Turkish journalist living in Hamburg had covered a T-shirt with the Turkish and German inscription "Freedom for Journalists" and had gone into the first row.
The T-shirt, had not been the problem, Seibert said the picture on Sunday.
It was a disturbance in the course of the press conference.
The journalist's action caused a great deal of unrest, which was unacceptable.
That's why he had a personal protector take the man out.
Seibert said that it was not allowed to demonstrate political concerns at press conferences in the Federal Chancellery.
This applies completely regardless of whether it is a legitimate concern or not.
The rules are the rules.
Many journalists are in prison in Turkey.
Many of them are accused of alleged espionage activities or of support or membership in prohibited parties or the Fethullah Golden Movement.
The Turkish leadership is responsible for the failed coup attempt on July 15, 2016.
Some of the accused journalists threaten decades of detention.
Foreign journalists are also not sure about the Turkish authorities: Only in early September was the Austrian journalist Max Zirngast arrested.
Last but not least, the cases of the imprisoned journalists Meşale Tolu and Deniz Yücel had caused a stir.
Although they came free and were able to return to Germany, there are still trials against the two in Turkey.
Munich: Florian David Fitz totally drunk with Ina Müller
His fans usually know him so fresh and good-looking: Florian David Fitz.
You have to look at it twice: yes, that's really Florian David Fitz.
The popular actor was in Hamburg - and experienced a wild night!
Hamburg - The talk show "Inas Nacht" produced by the NDR is known for humid conversation at the counter of the Hamburg harbour pub "Schellfish Posts".
Moderator Ina Müller meets with her guests on some beer, some wine or even higher percentage drinks to relax the mood and tongues.
Not a few celebrities also drink courage for the compulsory singing contributions.
Another episode of the popular talk show was recorded on Friday.
This time: The actor Florian David Fitz is known from movies like "Men's Hearts", "Terror - Your Judgment" or "The Lovest Day".
The Municher did not get the trip to the high north, however.
On Saturday he posted a selfie - his face is completely crushed on it, the eyes only two small slits.
The bed-selfie shows a totally exhausted Florian David Fitz.
But he's not sick, he only has a powerful cat.
Addressed to his fans, he posted some - probably not very serious - insights that he has now gained: "Rule one: does NOT go to Ina's night.
Rule two: Never drink the black sauce.
And Spritz.
And the round egg liqueur, which Ina throws at half past three, also let go.
Alcohol consumption is indeed written in the face of the 43-year-old.
His fans immediately posted a few tips to combat the after pain.
They ranged from instant broths, fish rolls or - probably the most effective - headache tablets.
Others simply enjoyed the sight of the normally attractive cinematar.
As Ina Müller has survived the nightly suffrage, so far is not known.
Since she has been moderating the TV fun on the counter since 2007, the 53-year-old seems to be clearly more experienced...
On a beer with Ina Müller.
Treysa has to fight with vandalism and disorder
The entry into the 36-kilometre long railway cycle path in the Red Capeland in Treysa presents itself difficult to find and litter.
Recipes against grassy vandalism are sought, but solutions hardly stand out.
Scissors, cigarette chickens, garbage and dirt, demolished trash bins and now disassembled signposts - this has been the way to the Haatse Hill in Treysa for a longer time.
A more than illustrious sight for the rail cycle path in the Rotköppchenland.
The topic concerns members of the ADFC local group Schwalmstadt but also others for a long time, according to the cycling representative of the city of Ulrich Wüstenhagen.
The problem had already been addressed in the cycling board.
There is no solution so far.
The proposals ranged from the relocation of the seating group to regular emptying of the waste containers and cleaning of the surfaces at the entry point.
"I think the latter would be the commandment of the hour - regardless of possible further activities," says Wüstenhagen.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reports that the topic has also been included in the local council.
Not only the garbage drives cyclists and residents - the seating group is a regular meeting point for celebration on weekends.
Not only is it loud, but the layers are also destroyed: posts are torn from the ground, garbage bins demolished, signs are snapped, seat furniture is smeared.
Volunteers had already cleaned up more frequently, says ADFC member Susanne Klippert.
The actions, however, are only the proverbial drop on the hot stone.
They are annoyed that the rest area on the cycle path in Treysa is the meeting point for sale.
"The focus is clearly on the Haatse Hill along the entire cycle path," confirms the cycling commissioner, who is now also taking care of the new cycling site in Ziegenhain, which is being opened today.
"If she suffers the same fate, it will be really expensive."
Another idea was a video surveillance on the hill: "Maybe this will significantly increase the threshold for violating common property.
This would, however, presuppose that a police patrol would come by in time.
In principle, Wüstenhagen wishes to develop the hill of hatred.
It had to be made more attractive.
The frequency of the cycle path so far can be very satisfactory.
Tourist marketing is still expandable.
Our cycle path is very high-quality compared to others in Germany," said ADFC members.
As an extremely critical danger point, ADFC member Susanne Klippert estimates the situation in Ascheröder Straße in Treysa.
There's no turning-off on the hate hill.
In the event of heavy traffic, cyclists may have to wait in the middle of the road between both sides of the traffic flow," she explains.
This is not a problem for sports drivers, but probably for older people and especially for children.
Music contest in the Kulturbahnhof: The "Kö von Hiltrup" and the lake
The first call to the music contest was a success, creative and in collaboration.
"D a song for Hiltrup" is the appeal of the district offensive Hiltrup, in the "Music Contest for Big and Small, Young and Experienced Musicians".
A contest "with eyelashes in the sympathetic Hiltruper family", as Karl Franke put it.
In fact, it was soon a family affair with coffee and cakes from the volunteers of the Kulturbahnhof.
Seven formations took place, from the one-man band to the big ensemble: Alvin Jasic with pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Ihmig, a long-lived albachtener in Hiltrup, the nine of the "Hiltrup star colours", three members and three generations of the Trenkamp and Claus families, an ensemble from the Kindergarten Lummerland and finally Rike Weßling and the Zwarties.
This contest, according to district mayor Joachim Schmidt, is a novelty.
We haven't experienced that in other districts.
What were the lyrics connected to?
The Hiltruper lake and the market hall were particularly frequently mentioned in the places.
Rolf Hemig named the Allee "Kö von Hiltrup" in his beat-like song.
The cultural station was also recognized.
Again and again it was about the experience of one another in these places, especially with Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke revived the short remodeling breaks with short interviews with the performers or clues to her creation.
Thus, it was learned from Humberg that he actually studied chemistry, but now he also taught guitar.
From sound engineer Stefan Schemmelmann, Franke knew that he recently appeared in Ludwigshafen - at a big event of BASF with Barclay James Harvest in the program.
And Alvin Jasic has placed everything on Youtube.
"It's not about winning," Franke said.
In fact, all participants received a gift from Hiltruper Gastronomy.
There was something special for the jury's favorites - so that others can also hear their songs.
Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Unitied can record an entire CD with sound engineer Schemmelmann.
Other musicians can record a song: Him with his Hiltrup-Schlager, which impressed Franke especially with his musicality, and the "Lummerland-Rudel": "a very beautiful performance" with ten children and two educators on guitar and Cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle.
Like everyone else, the children appeared again at the finale - and even sounded "really good" without electronic support, as Franke said.
The jury was guided by the aspects of originality, reference to Hiltrup, recognizability of the melody and recognizability.
The jury belonged to Gisbert Keller from the Westphalian School of Music, Andreas Klomfaß from the KvG-Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers from the Business Association and Jan Kaven, Chairman of the District offensive.
The district offensive had launched the event on the occasion of its ten-year existence.
She valued the event as a complete success.
All are "very satisfied", and "the atmosphere was good" in the soon very full cultural station.
The word game: "Decrypto" in the game test
The players form two teams that sit opposite each other.
For each page there is a screen, in which four cards with keywords can only be deciphered - the old trick with the red slide - once you have inserted them.
This ensures that the opposite side cannot read by mistake.
For example, on the maps you can read from left to right: "1. Renaissance.
2nd window.
3rd cube.
Fourth party".
These are the terms that need to be encrypted from now on.
Because here the terms should not be guessed, but codes.
Each time one player per team is the encoder.
He gets a code card on which "3.4.2" may appear.
"Decrypto" should be guessed not the terms behind the secret film, but their encryption codes.
His task in this case is to describe - in this order and in this example - the terms "Dice", "Fest" and "Windows" - in such a way that his own team recognizes the correct order and the opposing team as far as possible; for that wins the game if he succeeds twice in cracking the code.
So the encoder notes and reads aloud: "Throw" for the dice, "Lose" as opposed to party; of course, here would be something like "Party" possible and "Prag" because he has been watching at school and knows the window crash there.
That's how it goes round for round, team for team.
Although one does not know the terms of the opposite side, it can better fit together with any indication given by the encoder there.
As mysterious as possible, but not too twisted, the rewriting should be so, otherwise you make it unnecessarily difficult for your team.
Unfortunately, the most cryptic thing about "Decrypto" is the rule book.
The players will probably have to study it for quite a long time and in detail until they can finally play.
The explanation video under decrypto.info on the web makes it easier.
But once he has started, he will be fascinated by how much feeling there is in this inconspicuous game.
Overall, however, "Decrypto" is not as conclusive as predecessors and genre prime "Codenames", which also supports an agent theme on a game of less words, but is much better to play in small groups.
And what it's all about, and not about winning points, can easily invent a version for two.
Kulmbach: Man shows police Hitler greeting and harassing guests in the pub
A 48-year-old man engaged the police inspection Kulmbach on the night from Saturday to Sunday equally double.
First he showed the Hitler greeting in the Upper City of a passing police strip, later he also appeared in the Upper City in a pub when he harassed other guests.
After he clearly did not alcoholize the given refusal by the police, he had to spend the night at the Kulmbach Police Inspectorate in the prison.
In a sobering state, he must then also be liable for criminal law on the basis of the use of identification marks of non-constitutional organisations.
Pressig plant was home to the Schubloks
For decades the railway operation in Pressig was the hub in the Frankenwald.
In 1991, a piece of railway history ended.
"When buffers hit buffers, they heard it all over Pressig," remembers Georg Dinkel, who archives the history of the place and the station.
That didn't work out for anyone.
The brakes were quiet and the wagons rattled.
That was pure railroad.
Statements typical of Dinkel's home Pressig.
Nowhere in the Frankenwald was a place so shaped by the railway.
Here was the starting point of the steep mountain stretch to the north, which after an increase of about 220 meters of altitude has its headlight in Steinbach am Wald.
In order to cope with this, earlier train and slide blocks were needed that had their home in Pressig.
In 1901 the Bavarian Landtag approved the construction of a railway operation workshop with 21 locomotive sheds, apprenticeship workshop, guidance and railway mastery.
"The heartpiece was the turning disc, which had a diameter of 18 meters after a conversion in 1899," says Norbert Heidrich from Hirschaid, railway historian and 47 years of professional railway.
Pressig, which was submitted to Bamberg in 1968, also operated locomotives for the secondary sections Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehesten, Stockheim - Sonneberg and Kronach - Nordhalben.
On July 15, 1950, the "Volksblatt" reported a staff of 160 men; 13 steam and eight elloks were stationed in Pressig at that time.
The electrification of the line in 1939 already minimized the need for train and slide blocks.
From 1977 they were only used for freight trains.
By 1991 at least 10 000 weighers were ranked each month.
In 1982, parts of the plant were destroyed, 1991 the rest of it was abandoned.
Heidrich: "It is regrettable that we have not considered a better use of the site, even in terms of freight transport".
At Pentecost 1989, the Railway Directorate Nuremberg celebrated the anniversary of "50 Years of Electrification Nuremberg - Saalfeld" a pompous train station festival in Pressig.
"There were 10,000 enthusiastic spectators here," recalls Georg Dinkel.
Sooner or later, it's off.
On June 1, 1991, the last 30 men were removed, the Pressig marshalling station was history.
"The marshals and hemmshoe teams did the most difficult work in train traffic," recalls Dinkel.
Any miscarriage would have had fatal consequences.
Why the Pressig-Rothenkirchen station has led to the reversal of the hierarchy of the two places and many more historical and current pictures are available here in the infrankenPlus article.
Kerber with follow-up at China Open
Beijing (dpa) - Wimbledon winner Angelique Kerber and Laura Siegemund have already reached the second round of the tennis tournament in Beijing as before.
Kerber won the China Open 6:2, 6:2 against the Frenchwoman Kristina Mladenovic.
Next opponent of the world ranking third is either Julia Putinzewa from Kazakhstan or Spaniard Carla Suárez Navarro.
Siegemund led 6:3, 4:2 against Darja Kassatkina when the Russian woman, who was assigned to number 13, gave up.
The Schwäbin now gets to deal with Anett Kontaveit from Estonia.
A special exhibition was opened in Mittelehrenbach on the weekend during the series "Kunst und Eruss".
With great relief registered organizers and visitors looked at the ideal weather when the special Vernissage "Windspiel-Performance" was opened in the open-air area of the property Dahlmann- Schmidt, Mittelehrenbach.
It takes place under the roof of the tourism association "Round ums Walberla" in the context of the series "Art and Pleasure".
This opened its doors in the 15th year.
A large audience showed the fascination of the exhibition.
21 copies of 20 artists can now be visited in Mittelehrenbach.
Hausherr Ernst Jürgen Dahlmann welcomed the artists to open the Vernissage.
He himself has been there since the first hour.
Just like Volker Hahn, who made a name for himself as the main organizer and artist.
Something surprising but Hahn announced his resignation a few days ago.
With Tania Engelke and Kurt Neubauer, however, he placed his task in proven, young hands with a good future perspective.
In the past, both have already actively participated in the selection of the artists and have contributed to the design of flyers.
Also this year there is once again a 70-cent special letter brand designed by Kunst & Geuss, available at every art station.
This year's "Better Dance" poster, designed by Volker Hahn, can also be purchased for eight euros.
Hahn was pleased with the high appeal of the special exhibition.
Max Marcus Stadler from Nuremberg could be won for the musical framework.
When walking through the generous garden, the visitor quickly becomes aware that the title "Windspiel-Performance" formally challenges the artistic imagination and ultimately expresses it in a playful way.
They are works of metal or ceramics, often with colored accents.
Already at the entrance of the property awaits the visitor on the right side of the "Glücksbaum" by artist Werner Baur, Eschenau.
It is a tree stump, brightly lit, playful with 20 windwheels, 24 horseshoes and 24 aluminium tubes as a sound piece.
With the sun flashing through the bushwork in the background, the object appears mysteriously clever and invites you to stay.
From Eckental comes Barbara Waschneck, who prefers to focus in three-dimensional letters on the event 15 years K&G.
There are many parts in the wind in motion.
On half a distance Siegrid Frey from Eckental has exhibited her work "The Wind of the Heavenly Child".
And at the end of the area Volker Hahn shows his colorful fantasy shapes of clay, cement and stainless steel.
The theme "Windspiel-Performance" for sledding through the versatile art exhibition.
Until 31 December 2018 the special exhibition can be visited.
50 years MGV 68 Albachten: singers celebrate 50th birthday festive
1968 - that was the time of protest and student movement.
And the Albachtens also breathed their resentment at the time.
At least five of them.
They did not want to partout with the fact that after the dissolution of the church choir "Cecilia" there should be no more singing life in the district.
It has now become a legend: At a bank in the tin bush they raised the MGV 68 albachtes from baptism.
That was 50 years ago.
Now the anniversary was celebrated in the "House of Encounters".
"It's going to be full today," suspected chairman Jürgen Holstiege, and he should be right.
150 guests were there, a real success for the Albachten singers.
Especially for the anniversary, they had revived the foundation festival.
For years it was tradition, then there was a break.
On time for the 50th anniversary, the traditional festival was back.
An elegant ball it became for festive clothes had been asked before.
The guests did not sit in rows of seats as usual in the "House of the Meeting", but comfortably at tables.
In the meantime, movement was trendy: DJ Matthias Drees from Nottuln put on the controls and asked for the dance floor.
Honorably, the singers of the MGV made 68 albachten sound the voice themselves.
It was a good occasion for merry songs.
Almost already set: "As a day, as beautiful as today".
Suitable for the exquisite grape juice that many had in front of them, there was the "Rüdesheimer Wein".
In allusion to another cool drink "Humulus lupulus", which is the Latin term for "hopping".
Again sovereign was Richard Homann's choir, who is one of the five who were in the tin bush at the time.
"It's just fun to sing under his direction," Holstiege said, "He has such a light way, it's a master's achievement that he accomplishes." By the way, this time not only men presented themselves in song.
The women's choir "Hohes C" was also a guest, whose repertoire mainly includes Evergreens from the 1920s to the 1960s.
Finally, there was still poetry.
Singer Theo Weber had sat at the desk until three o'clock in the morning to create his own rhymes.
And Andreas Winterhoff also presented sounding poetry.
There was also a large tombola.
The proceeds are intended to finance a visit to the Allwetterzoo to the children of the Albatros Youth Centre.

Volleyball: 3rd League Women: USC II wins high-class Derby against BW Aasee
The climber's marching.
Three games, three wins - the reserve of the USC Münster under the patronage of Axel Büring is quite right in the third league.
No trace of shyness or fracking sauces, the independents do their thing.
And that at 3:0 (25:15, 25:23, 26:24) against city competitor BW Aasee really good.
"It wasn't clear, but we've already left an impression," says the rather satisfied trainer.
BWA-Coach Kai Annacker immediately committed himself to this: "This is a defeat with which we can live very well.
We are not satisfied." On the contrary.
In the evening at a subsequent birthday celebration of Ronja de Boer, the mood was good, the game cut off.
Yes, the result is indeed an optical illusion.
In the third sentence, the guests had a set ball.
"If they bring it to the goal, such a game can already tilt," Büring knows from years of experience.
Finally, the USC made it clear with its routined forces and brought the full profit into the goal.
"All of us are aware of who is standing in such a Derby on the other side.
It won't break our necks.
I have seen really good volleyball in stages," Annacker did not argue with the 0:3 - and immediately went over to the agenda.
Where the journey goes for the independents does not seem to be foreseeable after just three days of play.
"It's just too early for that," says Axel Büring.
Only in one does he feel confirmed: "The third league has an incredibly good level.
With regional league volleyball, this is not nearly comparable. In the fourth league, they don’t want to look down anyway.
Should the vest not be contaminated in the next few weeks, they must look up.
However, a first balance sheet can only be drawn after ten, eleven games.
On Saturday we go to Emlichheim.
Aasee will begin in Essen on 14 October.

About her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband
On the "dreamship" Heide became a star.
Now she speaks openly of the fact that the series may have had a share of her marriage out with Hans von Borsody.
Her role as chief hostess Beatrice of Ledebur on the "dreamship" made Heide Keller (76) famous, but on January 1, 2018 she left the ship forever.
The series that made her a star could be responsible for her failed marriage to Hans von Borsody (1929 - 2013) with whom she had been married for ten years.
"That could have been a reason.
Because I grew up with this work, traveled around the world alone with a suitcase, and many of my admired colleagues noticed me at eye level," says Keller in conversation with the "Picture on Sunday".
At first, she was always just "the wife of Hans von Borsody", but that changed with the "dreamship".
Because now the journalists only called at Heide Keller.
"Whether he liked it so well, I don't know."
She thinks it's possible that her husband back then might have been jealous, but "how many men shuddered his conversations about problems and feelings as well."
Keller has always tried to be the only one right for Hans von Borsody "and he didn't want to know my fears, my weaknesses.
That means in good German: I've changed my mind", as she continues to explain.
She always felt "not being good enough for him.
He saw in me an emancipated woman who I was never really, even though I sometimes appeared bold and courageous on stage.
I wanted our love to be forever."
After a previously failed marriage to Thomas Härtner, Keller once again said yes, "although I was afraid that it might go wrong a second time too."
On the day before the official wedding, I sat crying in the closet and wanted to cancel everything.
The marriage to Borsody also failed.
Why never did it with the men?
Because I wanted too much.
Keller had come up with love at the time "as in the film.
Unfortunately, this vision is not suitable for everyday use.
I have approached love much too naively."
The night-folder, who regularly explores the nightlife of the city in the Zurich NZZ resort, ventured to the ZFF opening party this time.
Our falter is not a moth, but a little bit of light.
And the glaring glimmer in which a green carpet is dipped on the six-sleeved square blinds him over fee.
But it's a film festival, because more or less famous people want to sunbathe in the spotlight.
So on this late Thursday evening he dries over the square to make it easier in the "Aquaclean toilet oasis".
The public toilet facility sponsored by a large sanitary company, which celebrates its premiere at the festival, is called: The institution of need in the party of a new pavilion has a lot of work to do to emanate a luxurious ambience.
This evening, however, it stinks in the men's oasis for some reason.
So out here, over on the other side of the road: Invited guests who have been entertaining in the cinema next to the opening film "Green Book" at the best level celebrate the festival start every year with a party in the three-storey department store.
Its name fits perfectly with this film festival: The works shown are known from all over the globe.
What do you have to think about an article about this festival in order not to fall into the trap of its 190 partner companies.
The trap binds itself to a small band around the feelers, who have given him a good fairy, and two bully doorsteps actually wave it generously in.
Inside, the invited ones dance to live music long after midnight or are pretended by DJ rhythms to which they shout at each other, and rinse down with Cüpli exquisite snacks.
In the delicacies store in the souterrain, oysters wait for swirling mouths, next door the incomparable raw ham Culatello di Zillo is freshly cut, a chocolate well is splattered.
And the hammer is: all the sales shelves full of exclusive products have not been cleared for the occasion.
This has been the case for years, so it seems to work without big losses.
You have to love this country for it!
The trap studies the sign at the escalator: "Wear a long dress, please be careful on the escalator".
If the two are separate instructions, he has escaped in the dress code.
But it's rather a conditional construction, and it's certainly saved lives already.
In the household goods department on the upper floor, the poultry tilts a cocktail prepared with espresso called "Golden Eye", suitable for the festival award.
The price of the best drink is not imposed by this mixture, with which a capsule manufacturer presents itself.
And George Clooney, who has been advertising for that brand for years, is not here in the evening either.
But there, between local prominence, cash desk and kitchen items, a face that is known to the observer: Peter Farrelly, director of the opening film.
It's not likely that his lead actor will be far off.
And really: Viggo Mortensen walks through the crowd, with almost sixty almost acting like a choral hub.
He's not being humiliated, not being gifted, he's being robbed at most.
This film festival is especially loved by international stars for this restraint, which is often misunderstood as a paralysis.
Maradona celebrates victory in Mexico with Cumbia Dances
Trainer and former football star Diego Maradona is delighted with the victory of his team.
Argentina's football legend Diego Maradona seems to have lived well in his new home Mexico.
After a 2:0 win of his club Dorados de Sinaloa, the 57-year-old coach danced with a player in the cabin to Cumbia Rhythms, as can be seen in a video published on Saturday.
In the 15-second clip of a team member, Maradona dances in a yellow jersey, fired by the players.
The Mexican secondligist had defeated the Leone Negros with 2:0 on Saturday.
After the game, Maradona called a TV camera "Always with my boys, always".
The 57-year-old has been training the Mexican club since the beginning of September.
Handball: Verbandsliga 1: ASV Send to Last Minute Pleit "Destroyed on the Ground"
Swen Bieletzki, coach of the handball league player ASV, could hardly believe it: "So bitter defeat". His guards were "destroyed on the ground" after the unfortunate 29:30 (12:14) - the fourth in the fourth game - on Saturday evening at LIT Germania 2.
They hadn't played bad over long periods, like in Steinhagen, like against Hüllhorst, the transmitters.
Only the initial phase "we have totally slept", the ASV trainer got annoyed.
Soon the masters led with 8:1, also the early break that Bieletzki had taken did not at first fruit.
"But then suddenly a ruck passed through the team," Bieletzki summed up the second quarter of an hour.
At the break, the residue was only two gates.
In particular, the broadcaster, Marius Hintze, met one other time in the phase.
After the change it became even better from the visitor's point of view.
After 33 minutes, David Ernst finished at 15:15, then the season changer was almost continuous.
Four minutes before the siren the lead was still seemingly calming three hits (29:26).
And then?
Interact with the impartial.
Bieletzki usually avoids looking for fault with others.
But: The 120-second time penalty that Steffen Mühlhoff collected, "was a joke".
LIT had laughed well and met up to the end four more times - during the decimated ASV also failed in the last attack.
The boys fought great, back also stood well against seven men and repeatedly threw on the empty gate.
Only they can buy a little for the compliments.
"Now must be a damn victory," said the restless Bieletzki.
ASV-Tore: Hintze (9), Ernst (6), Schlögl (4), Kretschmer (3), Kümper (2), Mühlhoff (2), van de Pol (2).
Hüging (1).
Bayern: Woman missing for 30 years - Police digging for body parts
More than 30 years after the disappearance of an 18-year-old from Naila (Landkreis Hof), the police are looking for the remains of the woman.
On Saturday, a road was dug up by operational staff at Marxgrün.
To this end, the road surface and several layers of it were taken off, as police and prosecutors jointly reported.
According to new findings, the missing person may not have been buried far away from their hometown.
The woman has disappeared since 4 November 1986.
The investigators did not rule out a crime at the time.
Since last year, the Criminal Police Court has been working closely with the Public Prosecutor's Office on the case again.
Together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the Bavarian Memorial Protection Authority, the investigators encountered a disturbance under the street near Marxgrün using a ground radar.
With the help of a dog trained on the smell of human bones, the officials confined the place to a few metres.
The results of the excavations should be published during the afternoon.
The hacker attack on millions of Facebook users shows what dangers lurk on the web.
However, users themselves can also provide additional security.

In addition, security updates, such as for Windows, should be installed quickly, even if it does not harm to equip computers with anti-virus protection.
Elon Musk, founder of the electric car manufacturer Tesla, has been removed as head of the billion-dollar company.
He and the U.S. stock exchange supervisor SEC added out-of-court litigation over misleading Twitter news, in which Musk could have lost permission to run listed companies.
As part of the comparison, Musk and Tesla each pay 20 million dollars, as well as Musk gives the office of Chairman, a position comparable to that of the German Supervisory Board.
He's allowed to stay on the other side of the board.
In the comparison, which must be confirmed by either a court, neither Musk nor Tesla admitted any misconduct.
The SEC had sued the world-renowned manager in the U.S. Federal Court of Manhattan for fraud.
Musk, who also runs space company SpaceX, is the public face of the loss-writing electric car pioneer, which is now rated at the stock exchange with more than $50 billion.
Musk is not aware of any guilt
Musk explained that he had done nothing wrong and was sad and disappointed about the complaint.
He has always acted in the sense of truth, transparency and investors.
On August 7, Musk had written to his more than 22 million Twitter followers that he might take the company from the stock exchange and pay 420 dollars per share that the financing was secured.
This would have resulted in a total of 72 billion dollars for Tesla.
Later Musk rowed back: Tesla stay on the stock exchange.
After the agreement, Tesla must now find an external chairman, appoint two independent members of the board and also set up a committee to monitor Musk's communication.

Surveys: 46 percent do not want Merkel as chancellor until 2021
After the questionnaires of the past weeks, GroKo collects several survey hits.
The SPD falls back in a survey behind the AfD - Angela Merkel is critically seen.
Berlin - The AfD has overtaken the SPD for the first time in the Emnid Sunday trend for the picture on Sunday nationwide.
In the weekly survey of the Ethics Research Institute, the AfD increases a counter to 17 percent, the SPD makes a point compared to the previous week and lands at 16 percent.
CDU and CSU also lose a counter and only reach 27 percent.
This is the lowest value for the Union so far in the Sunday trend.
Greens reach 15 percent, Left 11 and FDP 10 percent.
If the Bundestag elections were held on Sunday, the government parties SPD, CDU and CSU would receive only 43 percent of the votes, according to Emnid.
With this in mind, the great coalition has now lost the majority in the Sunday question at all major research institutes, with the exception of Allensbach.
The government parties consistently reach 43 to 45 percent of the votes (Allerbach: 51 percent).
In the 2017 Bundestag election, they still received 53.4 percent.
For the other parties the band is also large: the AfD, in several polls the second strongest party, comes to 15 to 18 percent.
The Greens reach votes of 12.5 to 17 percent.
The left is an average of 10 percent, and the FDP is 9 percent.
For statistical reasons, such surveys have an uncertainty of 2 to 3 percent up and down, depending on the proportion of votes.
But the support for Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in the population has also fallen significantly since the Bundestag election in 2017.
At present, only 48 percent of the citizens still find that Merkel is the right one in the office of chancellor, as the Emnid survey on behalf of the BamS revealed.
According to the survey, only every second (50 percent) wants the large coalition to hold until the next regular Bundestag election in three years, 41 percent are for a new election.
Also in a further survey published on Saturday, there was a marked loss of popularity for Merkel.
The Germans also assess whether Merkel should be running for the CDU presidency again in December.
According to Emnid, 47 percent are against it, 44 percent against it.
Thus, 64 per cent of the Union's followers want a candidacy, 35 per cent do not.
Exhibit at Aldi: Price Reduced to Love Happiness
Will Aldi become Tinder 2.0?
Anyone who says, in times of Tinder, there are no more romantic acquaintance stories - he should talk about putten-flesh at Aldi.
Munich - In times of digital "fast food dating" by Tinder and Co., the supermarket as an acquaintance place for great love almost radiates an anachronistic romance.
Yes, right, a conversation about reduced turkey meat, boxer short snacks at the wühltisch or the favorite pudding is undoubtedly still a better story for the later grandchildren than a mere swoop to the right.
The app Tinder is called to be less of a contact, but rather a slippery stock exchange.
We risked the test: How do women react, not talking around the hot breeze for long in the first news?
Here's the amazing result.
It has a true Hollywood-Lovestory potential when the love happiness precedes a lost-eye-and-recovered plot.
If the guy still reports to his adored person at the e-mail address bio-putenfleisch@gmx.de, that sounds like Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant and consorts - Romantic Comedy at it's best.
Thus, the author of this ad in an Aldi section that we know is to wish that she will also find her Trabury, with which she has briefly talked about the "30 percent reduced organic pit meat".
For the belief in the magic of analog know-how, she definitely earned her Happy End à la Hollywood.
Bilderbeck: 500 lids for a life without paralysis
Since the beginning of the new school year, the Ludgeri School has been involved in the action "Deck versus Polio - 500 lids for a life without child paralysis".
Polio is the abbreviation for poliomyelitis, an infectious disease caused by polioviruses.
The disease referred to in German as child paralysis leads from paralysis to death.
In Germany, Polio is considered exterminated, but there are still three countries around the world where the disease occurs.
The cause of poliomyelitis, the polioviruses, can only be contained by vaccinations so far, as a press release says.
Football: Reus and Zorc demand peace for idols
Leverkusen (dpa) - BVB Sports Director Michael Zorc and Captain Marco Reus have called for an end to the public debate on the form and fitness of Mario Götze.
"We should stop thinking about Mario.
That's not good for the boy.
And that doesn't do us any good," said the idol-friended Reus after the 4:2 win in Leverkusen at the TV broadcaster Sky.
Zorc had already emphasized before the game.
For him personally, this is not an easy situation.
Football: Eberl: Don't rush into contract discussions with Hecking
Mönchengladbach (dpa) - Manager Max Eberl from the football league player Borussia Mönchengladbach sees no hurry in a possible contract extension with coach Dieter Hecking.
We have not even talked about a contract so far.
There's no fixed date when we do that.
"But there will certainly be the moment when we sit down and talk," said Eberl on Sunday evening at the TV station Sky.
Football: District League: Researcher appearance of the VfL Wolbeck against the SC Altenrheine makes courage
There were moments in this still young season, when Alois Fetsch went to court hard with his people.
He was the coach of the football district league player VfL Wolbeck, who first withdrew (internally) to think about the lack of performance on the green.
All history.
In the meantime, it runs again around the Brandhoveweg.
Taufrischer Beweig is the 1:1 on Sunday against the SC Altenrheine, in the past season only thinly scraped past the ascent.
Yeah, I'm very happy with the performance.
"We made the rooms tight and put pressure on the ball.
This could be seen," Fetsch praised his boys and sought out every individual for the game to simply say "thank you" for so much resistance against the ambitious guests.
The coach had to make a system change after 26 minutes.
After the injury of Nico Frerichs (muscular problems) - for him came Luca Rehberg - it went from the 4-4-2 almost seamlessly into a 4- 2-3-1 where Niklas Thewes waited in front of the ball.
Wolbeck had significantly more playthings in the first section.
And chances.
But Frerichs before his departure (17th), who moved in Luca Rehberg (26th) and Jan Schroer (38th) missed the lead.
Almost this would have happened when in minute 41 the SCA hit dangerously in person by Kevin Vollrath and Chris Naberbaumer in front of the Wolbecker Kasten two times - Tormann Damian Hallas proved to be the master of his profession.
After the break, the VfL took full control.
Thewes from 18 meters almost failed.
Schroer came too late after 58 minutes with a Thewes entry.
With the inversion of Miles Geske, the left side of the fetsch missed a fresh cell cure again.
When Altenrheine's Chris Naberbaumer fell in the 70th minute Robin Westhues, there was an indirect release for the locals 18 meters ahead of the guest house.
The foul entered himself and demonstrated his danger at standards.
Westhues" thing with the right slip hit the bottom left from the point of view of the shooter - 1:0 (71.).
20 more minutes, they should be damn long.
And then that: VfL Captain Florian Quabeck flew the leather in the penalty room in the 80th minute unluckily.
Arbitrator Hüseyin Sahin (Hamm) immediately pointed to the point.
Jannis Schneider did not miss the gift (79.).
Bange minutes had to pass Wolbeck in the final phase, before Geske had the victory hit on the push in the 87th minute from twelve meters.
Might have been too much of a good thing.
VfL: Hallas - N. Rehberg, Quabeck, Bodin, J. Schroer - Klemke (75th Seidel), Bensmann - Frerichs (26. L. Rehberg), Westhues, Vielmeyer (66th Geske) - Thewes

Helicopter crashed in Kottingbrunn
At the time of the landing, it was still at the airfield for an accident.
The four inmates were slightly injured.
Around 2:00 p.m. on Sunday, there was a drama at the airport in Kottingbrunn.
During the landing of a helicopter, turbulence occurred, as confirmed by the police against oe24.
The heli was captured by a windbow, force on the ground and came to rest side by side.
Immediately, police, rescue and fire department were notified.
With a big deal, the emergency force came to the scene.
The ÖAMTC notarz helicopter was also called for caution.
Inmates Only Slightly Injured
Fortunately, everything turned out to be largely harmless.
There's only one damage to property.
The four inmates were only slightly injured and were able to go home on their own.
The precise circumstances of the accident have not yet been clarified and the subject matter of the investigation.
According to fire-fighter Franz Resperger, a small fire of origin arose, which could be quickly erased.
Report of the Allbright Foundation: Women remain rare in executives
This meant that only 8 percent of the executives were female on September 1st, as the report "The Power of Monoculture", which is officially presented by the Allbright Foundation on this Monday and the German press agency was available in advance.
"The companies will have to set up differently, otherwise the international competitors will pass them," said Stiftungs managing director Wiebke Anchorsen.
In the United States, the United Kingdom or Sweden, purely male-occupied management teams - with few exceptions - are far from being conceivable.
The backwardness makes the German competitors less diverse, innovation-friendly and future-oriented.
It's a different corporate culture.
Moreover, the slight increase in the proportion of women among German stock exchanges was only due to positive impulses in the medium-sized index (MDax) companies.
According to Allbright, only 6.8 percent of the executives are female.
In the previous year, however, the value had remained at 3.8 percent.
The proportion of women stagnated among the 30 Dax companies - in recent years pioneers.
Last time, 26 women worked in the boards.
"I'm sure the Dax companies will be recruiting more consistent women in the coming year - in their own interest," said Anchorsen.
The only RWE and Heidelberg Cement would have signaled that they would not continue to commit themselves to increasing the share of "zero percent" so far.
Another picture emerges from the Supervisory Boards: As of 1 September, the proportion of women was 30.5 per cent - 45 more women and 68 less men than one year ago.
"Annually recruiting equal numbers of women for executives would have reached a share of 40 percent in 2023," says the report.
Some even make messy: Luxury bodies: Which manufacturer earns the most per car?
Ferrari deserves the best.
The Italians take in €280,000 with each Ferrari sold and make €69.000 operating profit.
Big cars, big profits: This slogan still applies today - in most cases.
Who among the noble providers makes the most profit per car.
Munich - Ferrari, Maserati, Bentley: How much do luxury manufacturers collect per car they sell?
This question was addressed by "Autopapst" and business professor Ferdinand Dudenjofer.
His study shows that the differences are massive.
Ferrari made 69.000 euros operating profit with each car sold in the first half of the year - Jaguar Land Rover, on the other hand, only comes to around 800 euros, Tesla and Bentley lay heavily on it even with each car.
Mercedes, BMW and Audi are good in the race with prices of an average of 33,000 to 38,000 euros per car and around 3,000 euros before interest and taxes EBIT.

Torch train for the opening of the 60th Abtswinder Wine Festival
With a torch train, the tourist club opened its wine festival session in Abtswind.

The president of the Tourist Association, Wolfgang Starz, mayor Jürgen Schulz and wine princess Lisa Kursawe welcomed the guests in the already bulwark tent. "60 years of this sort of arrangement - this is an act of madness for a small town with 800 inhabitants.
You can be proud of that," Starz thanked all the helpers.
The wine princess Lisa II later symbolically met the guests from the stage.
"I'm glad so many have found the way to us after Abtswind." Later, "The Troglauers" caused mood.
On Sunday, when the abbotswinder Kirchweih was also celebrated, the club had set the drinks prices as 60 years ago on the occasion of the anniversary in the afternoon.
A feast evening for the 60th wine festival takes place on Friday, October 5th, in the guest's house, before it takes place one day later in the party tent in the second round.
In Bonn: Emergency car power in Taxi
An emergency car is severely damaged next to a road.
A 27-year-old passantine has been fatally injured in the collision of the operating vehicle with a taxi.
When emergency doctors are called, they should help - best even save human lives.
Such a rescue trip took a fatal end for a 26-year-old in Bonn.
Bonn - A 26-year-old pedestrian in Bonn has been fatally injured by the collision of an emergency car with a taxi.
The taxi driver, the emergency doctor and their drivers were severely injured, as the police reported.
The 46-year-old driver of the emergency car had crossed a red light on Saturday afternoon with blue light and Martinshorn.
He then bumped into a crossroads with the taxi that went by green.
After the collision, the doctor’s car hurled a lamppost and a tree.
He recorded the passantine who still died at the accident site.
Driver of the emergency car and taxi driver severely injured
The 62-year-old taxi driver and the driver of the emergency car were severely injured in their vehicles and had to be freed from emergency personnel.
The also severely injured 29-year-old emergency doctor was able to free himself, but the pedestrian could no longer help her.
Another inducted emergency doctor tried this - but without success.
The three severely injured were taken to hospitals.
The police, in close consultation with the Bonner Procuratorate, determine who is to blame for the accident.
Manchester United loses again, for Mourinho we're untiring
After the blamable out in the league, Manchester United is now also losing in the 7th round of the Premier League.
Against West Ham United is ManU 1:3. The way of defeat should still give way to talk.
The scene was symbolic in the 74th minute, in which the recovered Marko Arnautovic shot the 3:1 for West Ham; only three minutes after Marcus Rashford had allegedly led the Red Devils back into the game.
As they suspected an offside at the Pass of Mark Nobel, all the defenders of Manchester stood still, and Arnautovic left all the time in the world to shoot the ball at the helpless David de Gea.
It was the negative peak of a previously far-reaching lack of performance.
The mood of Uniteds Stadtrivale Manchester City is very different at the moment.
The citizens trained by Mourinho's big competitors Pep Guardiola came against Brighton & Hove Albion for an approximate 2:0 win.
After half an hour, Raheem Sterling broke the defense bar of the outsider for the home team for the first time.
After a good hour and a double pass with the former goalkeeper, Sergio Agüero ensured the sixth victory in the seventh game, and thus also the jump to the top of the table.
Liverpool No More Table Leader
Three days after the 1:2 defeat in the league, Xherdan Shaqiri fought with Liverpool in the Premier League a 1:1 against Chelsea.
As with the Cup Off, the Belgian Eden Hazard was the best man among the Londoners.
The hit of the 27-year-old in the 25th minute remained the only hit of the game until the final phase.
Shaqiri, who came to the field in the 66th minute for Mohamed Salah, missed the compensation after 70 minutes.
Daniel Sturridge made it better in the 89th minute with his sleigh.
So after the Reds started with an impeccable balance in the week, Chelsea was not to be beaten for the second time.
First, the Londoners eliminated Jürgen Klopp's team in the Cup, and now the Blues Liverpool fell from the top of the table.
Like City, the two London city clubs also celebrated Tottenham (in Huddersfield) and Arsenal (against Watford) 2:0 win.
The fans of the Gunners, where Granit Xhaka played through, had to wait until the 81st minute against the surprise team from the county of Hertfordshire.
Nine minutes before the end, Watford defender Craig Cathcart unluckily gave Alex Iwabi a herein in his own gate, just two minutes later Mesut Özil and his third season hit the decision.
Thanks to the fifth consecutive victory, Arsenal passed Watford and is again immediately behind the big rival Tottenham to rank 5. A strong impression remains of the climber Wolverhampton under his Portuguese coach Espirito Santo.
The Wolves remained unbeaten at 2:0 against Southampton in the league for the fifth consecutive time and took eighth place.
VW core brand missing: Paris automotive salon in the sign of the diesel debate
The Paris Motor Show will take place every two years in exchange for the IAA in Frankfurt.
Paris - Officially no subject and yet ubiquitous: The diesel scandal and the struggle for driving bans and retrofitting should not let go of the German car companies at the industry meeting in Paris.
From next week at the 2018 Automobile Salon, they will be showing their innovations together with the competition from all over the world in the French capital.
The diesel doesn't really play a big role anymore.
The possible exchange and retrofit offers for diesel owners in Germany, which are yet to be negotiated with the government in Berlin, are still likely to be an important topic at least behind the shiny scenes of the trade fair stands.
A big name is missing in Paris: The Volkswagen Group is with Audi, Porsche and other daughters, but not with the VW brand itself.
Audi and Mercedes-Benz are there and have their first pure electric models: the e-tron of the Ingol cities is due to enter the market at the end of the year, the EQC of Stuttgart 2019.
Officially, however, both were already presented.
The iNext of BMW is due to start in 2021.
At the centre of Paris is the new 3's.
In total, more than 250 exhibitors are represented this year from 4 to 14 October.
In addition to car companies, motorcyclists as well as numerous mobility service and software providers are present in their own halls.
The fair, which celebrates its 120th birthday this year, takes place every two years in exchange for the IAA in Frankfurt.
In 2016, well over a million visitors came.
At least 380 people have been killed in the severe earthquakes and the following tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Dozens are still missing.
In addition, there are more than 500 injured.
The island was shaken by two earthquakes on Friday.
The first quake had the strength 5.9, the second the strength 7.4.
Communication and traffic connections are damaged, and huge damage to property was caused.
After the quake, the Tsunami broke into the west coast of Sulawesi.
In the coastal town of Palu, hundreds had gathered at the beach for a feast.
It is feared that the number of victims is still clearly on the rise.
So far, the numbers are only from Palu.
But there are also numerous other municipalities - along the west coast of Sulawesis.
About 150 Bikers Celebrate Worship in Werdohl
Motorcycle Pastor Frank Schröder (right) from Herne celebrated the final God service for motorcyclists in the Peace Church in Eveking on Sunday with a team of helpers.
Werdohl - The place in front of the Peace Church in Eveking belonged to the motorcyclists on Sunday.
After all, the final service for the bikers was on the program.
Frank Schröder is the motor pastor within the Evangelical Church of Westphalia and thus responsible for the mental care concerns of the PS-strong two-wheelers.
Between April and September, on the last Sunday of a month, the traditional motorcycle service (MoGo) takes place at the house Nordhelle.
The bikers traditionally celebrate the end of the season at the Peace Church in Eveking.
On Sunday, about 150 bikers gathered there to do anything but ordinary worship.
As early as 10 a.m., the Bolidens were placed in front of the church's entrance.
First, the biker breakfast was on the program and it was allowed to be strengthened with coffee and cakes or even with a delicious curry sausage.
In addition to the MoGo team, the Holy Riders, a Christian motorcycle group from Gummersbach, were present.
The sermon took place during the Biker divination pastor Dirk Grzegorek.
The singer-songwriter Valerie Lill provided the musical underpainting.
"Although the bikers prefer the blues rock, Valerie Lill rather beats poetically calm tones," said Father Frank Schröder.
This too was certainly a novelty in the history of the motorcycle service yesterday.
Fuchtorfer Heimatverein celebrates a big festival: After the apple comes the milk
And also on the actual day of action Borisch was active.
She supplied her hungry guests with freshly prepared apple pancakes.
Georg Hartmann-Niemerg also aroused great interest.
He had his apple press in his luggage and demonstrated his amazing spectators step by step the process from ripe apple to apple juice.
Then and when did Hartmann-Niemerg leave the field to the children and let them fill the apples in the big funnels.
With a little muscle power, the apples became a finely crushed mass.
Not many of the children could imagine how it was to be a tasty drink.
But they were also able to look at this important step of work on this late Friday afternoon.
Packed in shapes and covered with nets, Georg Hartmann-Niemerg stacked the a little like hedgehog-looking apple pieces layer for layer above each other.
Thanks to some technical support, the last step in the work was no longer so difficult.
The freshly pressed juice gradually passed into a large vessel.
But the humidifier farmer had already completed specialities.
Thus he opened his "Schatzkaste" and presented to the older visitors the latest spring whites.
The demand for the good drop "Made in Fuchtorf" was accordingly great.
In a cozy atmosphere, the parents came into conversation, while the children could not only follow the process of apple pressing, but also discovered the built-up Hüpfburg for themselves.
Active of the Fuchtorfer comradeship of former soldiers also engaged in the festival and invited to some stations to casual games.
The Heimatverein will also offer an action day in the coming year.
Then, however, Gregor Krützkamp emphasized, the home house will not be in the heart of the asparagus village of the place of the event.
Instead, a farm will be visited.
This is also obvious because of the subject: finally, the milk will be around.
1:4 against Frankfurt: Hannover with fourth season break: "Better situation"
Frankfurt/Main After the fourth Bundesliga defeat in a row, Coach André Breitenreiter gathered his disappointed professionals from Hannover 96 around and spoke up to them with courage.
However, there was a lot of positive at the 1:4 (0:2) of the last table at Eintracht Frankfurt.
"It's a shitty situation, but you have to get out of there as a team," said 96-foot pro Pirmin Schwegler and pushed after: "This is of course disappointing, because you always take a lot of action."
The further victories of Lower Saxony, for which only Florent Muslija (86th) met for connection, stand with two counters at the bottom and are in their present condition a candidate for descent.
Frankfurt, on the other hand, celebrated the first victory of the season, led by Ante Rebic.
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th minute, Rebic (45.+1), Jonathan de Guzmán (59.) and Luka Jovic (89.) scored the goals for the DFB Cup winner before 46,300 spectators who, after the successful general test for the Europe League game against Lazio Rome, advanced seven points into the middle field of the table.
Croatia's Vice World Champion Rebic was involved in almost every dangerous offensive action of Hessen and never to be caught up in Hanover's defense.
The stormer, long struck after the World Cup, showed with its speed and perseverance why it is so valuable to the accord.
In addition to Rebic, the Brazilian Allan, loaned by Liverpool FC, was the first time in the early formation of the Frankfurters, which began to swing.
Lucas Torró (17th) had a bad headball for the first time.
Six minutes later, Sébastien Haller was stopped in a promising position at the last moment by the 96 defense around the Brazilian Felipe, who replaced the short term Kevin Wimmer (backs).
The leadership for the landlords fell almost necessarily and completely deserved.
Filip Kostic lifted the ball after a corner in the penalty room, Haller extended by head in front of the gate, where Ndicka only needed to keep his foot down.
It was the first Bundesliga hit for the defender who came in summer from the French second league player AJ Auxerre.
And Frankfurt laid down before the break.
This time Haller matched his storm partner Rebic, who refueled well and left 96-tower Michael Esser no chance.
In the mid-term, Hanover-Coach Breitenreiter responded to the weak performance of his eleven and brought two new offensive forces to Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt.
The Niedersachsen played a little more courageously forward, but lighting ideas remained until shortly before the end, when the hitchhike still succeeded.
The Hessens were much more efficient.
After an hour, Rebic started a solo and then laid across De Guzmán, who had to push the ball into the empty gate.
The rest was only for the Frankfurters against overcrowded guests, also Jovic met one minute before the end.
The Morlaix Square becomes the party mile
Dice Despite cold temperatures, there was a good mood at the October festival in the city centre.
The Munich mayor Dieter Reiter managed to do so in front of millions of people at the opening of the 185.
Münchener Wies'n last week with two hits.
Geisinger Christian Celebrate Holy Cross Festival
The Geisinger Catholics celebrate the Holy Cross celebration on 14 September or on Sunday after.
The feast service takes place in the city church and then is a procession to the Holy Cross Church with the final part.
The Holy Cross Church houses the shot Christ, who comes from the 30-year war and on whom the legend is said to have shot after a Swedish soldier.
From the gunshot wound, blood flowed.
From this developed a great pilgrimage to the shot Christ, who then also led to the construction of the Holy Cross Church.
This is not yet completed, only the altar room stands, the missing long house is indicated by the trees.
In his sermon, Father Adolf Buhl reminds us that the cross is a sign of hope, comfort and life.
Despite the importance for the Geisinger parish, the service was badly visited.
After the divine service, the procession to the Holy Cross Church took place and with the final part the church part of the crucifixion ended.
For many years, the Catholic Church choir has been inviting the Catholic parish to the secular part of the feast.
The choir members supplied visitors with hearty food as well as a wide selection of cakes and the weather adapted, farm ice cream.
In the afternoon, the parish church offered guided tours around the city church, Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmid-Seger informed visitors on behalf of the parish about the damage to the façade, roof, sandstone works and windows as well as the upcoming construction measures, which will continue until next year.
After some time the scaffolding had been in place, the damage could be identified more precisely and the individual tenders prepared more concretely.
It is certain that the renovation will be more expensive than planned, because the damage already existing a few years ago has become greater, but more has been found, which has only been possible by means of the in-eye inspection by means of scaffolding.
The pedestal work is completed, before the winter the natural stone work is to be started and one hopes to be able to complete half of this work this year.
Inauguration: Neues Wohnheim in der Neu-Ulmer Münsterblickstraße
The Donau-Iller Lebenshilfe opens a new residence for people with disabilities on Münsterblickstraße.
That in the Münsterblickstraße "a very special house" will now be handed over to his destination - all present agreed on the inauguration date.
Finally, the twelve wheelchair users who have been living in the home of the Donau-Iller life support for some time have been dependent on the special architecture of the new building.
Wider corridors, hallways and doors, larger rooms and barrier-free access for all areas, architect Rudolf Bader has taken into account in his concept.
The first plans began about eight years ago when the former US Army officer's building was put to the test for the residents with mobile phone cap: "The house had come into the years and was no longer present in the equipment," said Bader retrospectively.
In 2016, the excavators called to demolish the house.
The new building should be made as friendly and bright as possible so that the residents can feel comfortable in it, says the architect.
Life support Danube-Iller opens new residential home
Around 4.6 million euros invested life support in the new building.
The Free State granted EUR 2.4 million, the district of Schwaben EUR 450000.
According to architect Bader, the construction work has remained within the planned framework - both in time and in financial terms.
He was also thanked by the managing director of Lebenshilfe, Jürgen Heinz.
The spat between a barrier-free and fire-proof construction was not always easy.
Nevertheless, the planners and craftsmen had built a home with the many requirements that allowed the inhabitants to experience the freedom to move even without foreign help.
Similarly, the head of the social administration of the district of Schwaben, Gertrud Kreutmayer, said: "The house is oriented to the special needs of its residents who need help to be mobile".
The housing and functionality had been well combined, said Kreutmayer.
And further: "The land in this situation is a real happiness, because it is no longer possible to acquire it in the present situation".
In total, the new residential home in Münsterblickstraße offers space for 30 people with disabilities, which are divided into three groups.
He is proud of the eleven full-time workers who are all employed by collective agreement.
Germany: Schwesig complains differences between East and West
Berlin - Before the day of unity, Vice-President Manuela Schwesig of the SPD called on all countrymen not to compromise with the disadvantages of East Germans.
There are differences that hurt unity after almost 30 years.
We must not be satisfied with these differences," said the Prime Minister of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern to the "Day Mirror on Sunday".
The goal must remain to create the same living conditions throughout the country.
It is unacceptable that East Germans worked on average longer than the people in West Germany, but received 15 percent less pay.
"I can't explain that to anyone almost 30 years after German unity," said Schwesig.
North Korea: Does this dirty dog end the Korean conflict?
The one-year-old Pungsan hunting dog is supposed to smooth the balance between the two Koreas.
In an effort to relax relations with Seoul, Pyongyang has made a gift to South Korean President Moon Jae In two North Korean Pungsan hunting dogs.
As Moon's office announced on Sunday, the two about a year old dogs reached their recipients already on Thursday.
They then passed the border town of Panmunjom along with three kilograms of dog food to "make it easier for the animals to get used to".
The dogs with the thick white fur, pointed ears and brown eyes are considered loyal and intelligent.
They are part of the national cultural heritage of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
At the third summit this year between Moon and the North Korean ruler Kim Jong Un in Pyongyang in mid-September, the North had announced the gift of friendship to the North.
The two countries also agreed to join forces in international sports competitions such as the 2020 Olympic Games and to join forces to compete for the 2032 Olympic Games.
Kim also agreed to close the Tongchang Ri test facility for rocket engines as a result of the mutual approach.
Austria's moving history in the mirror of 99 documents
What is Austria?
For the 100th anniversary of the Republic, which has been celebrated for almost ten months in this commemoration year, numerous new books have been published that usually answer this question in retrospect of the past hundred years.
Wolfgang Maderthaner, historian and general director of the Austrian State Archives, in the magnificent "Bilderbuch" Austria, will be published on 1 October.
New week, new opportunity for the government
Back to work - this is the unofficial motto for the working week of the Great Coalition which is beginning today.
Hardly an interview, hardly a speech in which the chancellor and her ministers from CDU, SPD and also from the CSU last did not appeal to the "return to work".
This may have led some craftsmen, doctors, cashiers and otherwise employed citizens in this country to the legitimate question, which is actually the difference between work and work, but be it so.
If the Federal Government is now ready to devote itself again to its mission - the government - then it should not be held back by debates on terms.
Whether Union and SPD can actually bring something together after the provocations and bluffs of the last weeks will probably show already Monday.
In the evening, the leaders of the government parties meet in the coalition committee.
Chancellor Angela Merkel now wants to call this round regularly to clear up conflicts early; a lesson from all the dispute.
First of all, however, there are once again conflicting issues on the agenda with the diesel retrofitting and the labour migration law.
CSU-Verkehrsminister Scheuer wants to let the car companies take advantage of this with exchange premiums, SPD and CDU see the manufacturers in the obligation to technically retrofit older diesel.
While there has been a rapprochement over the weekend in the diesel crisis, the Union and the SPD are still far apart from the planned labour force immigration law.
The SPD calls for a stay perspective for rejected asylum seekers who work or train.
The Union is strictly opposed to the "trace change" from the asylum system into the labour market.
So there will be disputes between the coalition partners again - and how should it be different?
Not the same and the same has come together to Groko, but three partners with some very different social images and priorities.
Fight is good.
Without dispute, a society that is so diverse and sometimes conflicting does not advance.
In order to be constructive, however, disputes must not be re-established for party tactical reasons on the question of being or not being.
It's still about politics, not theater.
Union and SPD should fight - but always have the reality of people's lives in mind.
What is feasible and useful to many?
With this key question, both the diesel and the track change question can be pragmatically clarified - and thus regain confidence.
Above all, that is why the people's parties must fight now.
Mushrooms check working hours at Hartinger
Minister in the visor
Is the Minister for Labour in breach of the applicable service law?
Daniela Holzinger wants to take a closer look at this.
"Actually day and night" had worked on the reform of social security, reported an overwhelming social minister in the presentation two weeks ago.
In the case of Liste Pilz-Mandatarin Daniela Holzinger, Beate Hartinger-Klein (FPÖ)'s statement comes as a surprise - she is now bringing the matter to Parliament via question.
She assumes that "the Minister only expressed her enthusiasm about the deployment of her team and did not want to proclaim any violations of applicable service law to current cameras".
Nevertheless, she now has questions to "be able to absolve Har tinger of any suspicion".
Police are tearing a street in search of women's corpses
Marxgrün - Lange did not want the police to comment on this.
Now there's a confirmation.
Since early Saturday morning, on the state road between Naila and Bad Steben is dug.
The route is still blocked in the Marx Green area until Monday.
It was preceded by the fact that the investigators had previously used an archaeology dog.
The dog specially trained for the smell of old human bones, together with its guide in multiple use, could finally limit the relevant place to a few meters.
In addition, a soil anomaly was discovered together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the top Bavarian Memorial Protection Authority in the area of the said road section.
For more than a year now, the prosecution and criminal police have been working on the missing person case.
Time and again a cycle path was blocked at Marxgrün and examined with sonar devices, because the investigators suspect that heike's body could have been sharpened here 30 years ago in the course of the new construction of the Staatsstraße.
Color powder and eggs: Crabs in Barcelona before Catalonia anniversary
On Monday, the controversial independence referendum in Catalonia will be held for the first time.
But before that, there's a crash.
The separatists did not forget the autumn 2017 police operation.
Barcelona - Just before the anniversary of the Catalan independence referendum on 1 October 2017, there was a conflict between separatists and the police in the centre of Barcelona.
Catalan security forces were attacked, among other things, by the independenceists with paint powder when they wanted to prevent them from approaching a demonstration of the National Police and Civil Guard.
Around 3,000 police officers from Policía Nacional and Guardia Civil wanted to honor their colleagues with a rally that was held last year at the referendum that was considered illegal in the polls.
When trying to prevent citizens from voting, there was violence at the time.
The Catalan police would have formed a chain to keep the demonstrations of the separatists and the central government security forces separate, reported Spanish media.
However, some of the approximately 6,000 separatists would have violently tried to break the police chain, and the officials among other things threw color bags and eggs.
Six persons had been arrested, 24 more had been slightly injured, it was referred to as the authorities.
On Monday, the independence referendum will be held for the first time.
Following the vote and a subsequent decision to split the prosperous region of Spain, the central government in Madrid placed Catalonia under forced administration in autumn 2017.
At that time, regional president Carles Puigdemont fled to exile in Belgium.
Other politicians also settled abroad.
Several ministers of the then regional government and other activists of the separatist movement, on the other hand, continue to sit in U-Haft.
In December, new elections were held in the region.
After the new Catalan government took office in May, the forced administration was terminated.
However, the new regional president Quim Torra also insists on the "right to self-determination" of the Catalans.
Soccer: Oberliga Westfalen: Collected perplexity: FC Gütersloh and RW Ahlen separate torlos
Red-White Ahlen continues to stand.
Also in the FC Gütersloh it was only a 0:0-decision.
The final light and the third last, they appeared before 438 spectators in the Heidewald Stadium as a gathering of perplexity.
The first half was badly manageable by the entertainment factor.
Therefore, those who preferred to get a beer or a sausage could do so without worry.
There was no danger of missing a torch because there was virtually none.
First shot after half an hour
Güterslohs Nick Flock was responsible for the first (harmless) goal shot of the entire game in the 28th minute.
The best - and in principle the only real - option had been for the Ahlenians, when Cihan Yilmaz FCG tower guard Frederic Westergerling forced a parade after 32 minutes with a shot from the penalty zone.
Even more harmless were the hosts.
Their most effective action was an early change.
Stürmer Lars Schröder had to be replaced due to injury, for him Sinan Aygün came.
After the change, both teams decided to do something about the growing boredom.
In the 48th minute Sebastian Mützel from 18 meters aimed just above the housing and after an hour the Güttersloher appeared for the first time offensively.
After a ball conquest by Matthew Wieckowicz, it was fixed.
The fast-paced account about Sinan Aygün "kronte" Nick Flock (62nd) with a but lazy shot into the arms of RWA-Torwart Bernd Schipmann.
They also played with a headball of Wieckowicz (66th) after a corner ball of former Ahlener Tim Manstein.
RWA instructor Angelo Daut responded, initially brought Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy (60th) and a little later Enes Güney for Sebastian Mützel (70th).
It caused - nothing.
More than optical superiority thanks to their own initiative, the Ahleners failed.
It was not until the 91st minute that Cihan Yilmaz had the last chance, but they also brought nothing in.
Angelo Daut tried to remove the positive: "I like that we played to zero." But unfortunately the zero also stood forward.
"We were not as dangerous this time as we were against wooden wickede and this even though our opponent had no desire to play here," noted RW Ahlens Interim Trainer.
Offensive "spattered everything a bit" against a team, "who just wanted to defend.
At least I didn't feel like we could get a opponent," says Daut.
However, as an observer, he did not feel that his team could shoot a goal.
The idea was too poor for that.
Reckenfelder Erntendankmarkt: Fortunately, there are enough Kreimers
Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler from the Reckenfelder Table Edition Office, for which these donations are intended.
The volunteers assure: "These donations also remain in Reckenfeld".
At the opening, the sky was shining blue, the space was still a little empty, but that should still change over the day.
Because: "Here it's so nice to meet you, that's why we're here today," said one visitor.
The organizer of the festival Franz Josef Holthaus greeted the guests in the Kiepenkerl outfit as always with a decent touch of humor.
For the couple Brockmann, who should actually be balanced against food, Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer jumped in short term.
The Verena (daughter of Ferdi Kreimer) has become ill.
But there's plenty of creamers.
And the "replace" did not allow itself to entertain musically the increasingly increasing visitors.
This was so good that later some folk songs were sung.
"Just great," Marcel Kreimer rejoiced.
Mayor Peter Vennemeyer was able to accommodate the opening date this time in his schedule.
He is pleased about the many active people with their stalls, including mostly clubs.
"Actually, there should be no such thing as a board at all," he nevertheless thanked himself for the action of the male choir.
Andreas Hajek praised the commitment of all who were in use at the booths and also included the other festivals held in September and the "Clean up" action.
Our garden city gives itself a colorful touch - here's what goes on.
Then the Maikranz was taken from Georg Knorr and Gerd Klück with the help of the fire department and taken to winter quarters.
Many stands were worked for the physical well-being.
From sweet to hearty it was all to have.
Stefan Hagemeyer, who has only been living in Reckenfeld for a year, became creative on his decupier saw.
Fireworks, beer lid with Reckenfelder motifs and much more he had on offer.
A speciality was offered by three Reckenfelder Bemkers: "Reckenfelder Honig", brought by Maria-Theresia Smolka, Christian Wedershoven and Helen Roth-Buschschluter.
The latter has a specialty.
Honeycake in the glass, of course with honey from my own production.
There the little Elsa had to access again and again, so the cake tasted good.
It is the company that allowed visitors to stay for a long time until the evening hours, even without a stage program that does not exist at the autumn festival.
Lubrications with local political message: No successful advertising for skating facilities
In Lengerich, unknowns have probably hardly promoted the construction of a skate plant.
In several places there are corresponding lubrications, says Jürgen Kohne from the city administration upon request of the WN.
In at least one case, criminal proceedings have been brought against the police for damage to property.
In large letters, the three words "Skatepark für Lengerich" appear among others at the Gempt Hall and at the Old Town Hall.
Michael Rottmann, manager of the hall, reports that after the trade fair on 19 September, a corresponding lettering on the billboard at the staircase to the Gempt bistro had been discovered.
Since the short message had apparently been left "only" with an Edding at the time, it could have been removed easily.
"A few days later, however, this was again there, this time sprang up," says Rottmann.
He assumes that the corresponding billboard must be replaced.
A special note is given to this particular case by the fact that on the board several large companies from Lengerich are also mentioned.
If the skate system is built, its realization should also be made possible by sponsors.
Jörg Hesselmann of the School, Sport and Culture Department explains that there are already promises, without mentioning names.
It is possible, however, that one or more of the sponsors are identical to those companies that stand on the smeared board.
For years, local policy and administration have been dealing with the topic of skates.
After the old one had been demolished at the LWL clinic, after some time the search for an alternative location began.
Finally, the Council spoke out in favour of the fire station.
However, this idea was not implemented - too many factors seemed to speak against a construction at this point.
A turnaround followed at the end of June.
The members of the Main and Financial Committee now voted unanimously for the area of Gutenberg School.
Jürgen Kohne says about the state of affairs that the administration is currently in the middle of concrete planning.
The last word then comes from the city council.
He expects a decision this year so that a positive vote could be held in 2019.
Air navigation congestion is getting even worse
Frankfurt/Hamburg After the European air traffic chaos in summer, the German air traffic controllers see no signs of improvement in the coming year.
"This year we had wind, 2019 we will have strong wind and then the storm will come," said Matthias Maas, head of the aviation security union, the German press agency in front of the aviation summit in Hamburg on October 5.
An important reason for the numerous delays and flight failures was the long-known staff shortage in European air navigation services, for which there is no quick solution.
" Airlines and airports can achieve rapid improvements for the coming year, but the training of new pilots takes four to five years," said the trade unionist.
Europe-wide, the market for fully trained pilots was empty.
In the centre of Karlsruhe alone, about a hundred people were missing to monitor the upper German airspace.
Maas again criticised that various air transport unions were not invited to the summit.
In the Hanseatic City on Friday, representatives of the Federal Republic, the countries, air traffic control, airlines and airports will meet to address the causes of delays.
"If you want to talk about additional work compaction and overtime, that won't work without us," said the head of the GdF, who has many members at the federal German Air Safety Agency.
Maas again made the EU Commission responsible for the pilots.
Traffic forecasts for the current regulatory period up to 2019 have been far too low.
The resulting costs and staff savings for national air navigation services are now fully reflected in the operational business.
Maas appealed to Federal Minister for Transport Andreas Scheuer (CSU) to take action in Brussels for regulations that "do not detach the air further to air safety".
At present, EU regulations would be aligned by 2024 and further tightening would be feared.
The EU was subject to constant lobbying pressure from the airlines.
"Ryanair Chief Michael O'Leary and his colleagues have now reaped exactly what they themselves have sown in recent years," Maas said.
He hoped that the high delay costs of the airlines would lead to a rethink.
The GdF would only contribute to the improvement of the situation if the German Air Safety Agency (DFS) offered a "voiced training and future pact", Maas said.
The previously announced annual admission of 120 pilot students over the next five years is just enough to compensate for the age-related declines.
The necessary staffing is not yet connected.
Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board votes for Group Conversion
The members of the Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board unanimously voted in favour of the plans to restructure the Group.
Following the will of Thyssenkrupp Interim Manager Guido Kerkhoff, who was appointed Chairman of the Executive Board at the meeting on Sunday, the operating group is to be split into two independent companies.
Both companies should have their seat in Essen and be listed on the stock exchange.
There should be no additional staff cuts beyond the already known administrative cuts.
After two resignations, the control body on the capital side only counts eight heads.
Ten representatives of the workforce are opposed to this.
However, the final decision is expected to take a general meeting in 2020.
The new Thyssenkrupp Materials AG is to include among other things the 50 percent share from the merged steel business with the Indian partner Tata.
In the second company Thyssenkrupp Industrials AG, the business is to be bundled with elevators and supplies.
Barcelona: violence at demos by policemen and Catalan independence advocates.
Two simultaneous demonstrations by Spanish police and Catalan independence advocates in Barcelona have led to violent confrontations with numerous victims.
According to the city council, about 3,000 policemen from all over Spain gathered on Saturday, as well as some 6,000 supporters of independence demonstrated.
The Catalan police tried with a big offer to keep the two protests away from each other.
However, according to the operational personnel, independenceists have repeatedly tried to break through the security barrier.
They would have attacked the officers with paint and throwing shots.
Ranges were reported to be also between the participants of the various protest trains.
According to rescue personnel, 24 people were injured.
The police said there were six arrests.
Better salaries and appreciation of colleagues
With their demonstration, the police wanted to honour the colleagues who almost a year ago opposed the Spanish Central Government's ban on the referendum on independence in Catalonia.
At the same time, they demanded better wages.
Members of the Spanish police and Guardia Civil feel that it is unfair that Catalan and Basque police officers earn much more than they do.
The demonstrators felt it was provocative that the Spanish police were demonstrating in Barcelona.
"Why did they come here to protest?" asked 55-year-old Catalan protester Manel Perez of the news agency AFP.
Just to provoke and celebrate the fact that they drowned us a year ago.
A 31-year-old police officer from the Balearic Islands, who only wanted to give his name with Daniel, rejected the accusation.
"Of course, we want to support our comrades who did only their duty last year: defend the law," he said.
But the demonstration is there to enforce our rights and we do it in Barcelona because it is a big European city and there is more echo here.
But he and his colleagues had "not come to provoke," the policeman assured.
Panne allowed access to personal data of British Minister
A security gap with a mobile app has led to the personal data of ministers and members of the Conservative British Tory Party being temporarily accessible to everyone on Saturday.
According to British media reports, several ministers received calls from unknowns after the breakdown was announced one day before the Tory party in Birmingham.
Two people stuck to B217
On Sunday morning, the police report a serious traffic accident on Bundesstraße 217, Hamelner Chaussee, at the exit of Wettbergen in the direction of Ronnenberg.
Two people died driving their car against a tree.
The car is currently in flames.
The operational staff are on site.

Soccer: Juve Trainer Praises by Top: Ronaldo's Best Game
The Portuguese star stormer "played the best game together with half an hour of Valencia this evening," praised Juve-Coach Massimiliano Allegri after the 3:1 (1:1) victory of the record champion against the SSC Naples.
For the coach, the expensive purchased star was the decisive man in the important game against the pursuer, even without his own goal.
"Ronaldo had a lot of fun and it's good," Allegri said.
Even though we started with tactical mistakes, Ronaldo was very good at our first gate - and from the moment we grew.
Thanks to the three goals of Ronaldo, Juve turned the game after the early fall through the hits of Dries Mertens (10th minute) and depended on the worst pursuiter for the time being.
The goal hunter, who was picked up by Real Madrid, first posted Mario Mandzukic, a former Bundesliga professional, who took the lead with a double pack (26th/49th).
And Ronaldo also did the preliminary work on the hit of defense chief Leonardo Bonucci (76.), who had to push in just before the finish line.
"He gives many templates," praised the coach.
But Allegri also wants to see goals from the attacker, who is both in the Champions League and in the Portuguese national team of the record goalie.
"We need to be even better at serving him," the coach demanded.
Best Juve sniper is currently Mandzukic with four hits - Ronaldo has three in the account.
With Ronaldo's purchase for more than 100 million euros, Juventus' overpower seems to be becoming even more oppressive.
Seven wins in seven games is the impeccable series in series A. At 21 points the master of the past seven years already has six counter lead on Naples.
The table width trained by the former Bayer-Coach Carlo Ancelotti was not impossible against Turin.
But at the latest after the rejection of the already warned Mario Rui (58th), the top section was decided.
The Portuguese had to go hard against Paulo Dybala with yellow-red from the square.
"We have played well against a good Naples," commented the Turin Coach.
Emre Can was also allowed to feel there.
The German national player has come to the fore at Juve.
The professional from Liverpool FC was in use at all seven league parties.
The middlefield player also played in the Champions League party against Valencia, which Allegri meant with the "half hour": Ronaldo had flown from the square at the 2:0 victory of the Turiners and was locked up for the home game on Tuesday against Young Boys Bern.
Kanye West Changes His Name
Rapper Kanye West has given attention to Saturday Night Live at the U.S. TV show on the weekend.
Among other things, his joint performance with Lil Pump in a mineral water costume provided forehead curls and question marks for the audience.
In addition, the 41-year-old announced a name change on time for the release of his new album.
From now on, he can only be called "Ye", says the musician.
"The being who was formerly known as Kanye West," he tweeted in line with the late singer Prince when he gave his artist's name.
The pseudonym, however, is not news.
The tenth album was released under this name.
In an interview with the radio station KRRL, the artist had explained that "Ye" had a religious meaning for him.
"I believe "Ye" is the most commonly used word in the Bible and there it means "you", says the rapper.
Football: Kreisliga A1 Münster: Finally!
Done!
Hoetmars Trainer Averhage did not make a heath out of his disappointment.
That was a weak game of ours today.
The opponent was simply more apprehensive, we never put him in trouble." Accordingly, the list of Hoetmar's shots reads out thinly.
Grades times two torch chances in 90 minutes, so you can rarely make games positive.
Soccer-Kreisliga A1: SC Hoetmar is subject to SG Sendenhorst with 0:2 (0:1) Photo: Heinz Schwackenberg
Also the SG had only two possibilities in the first passage, but the first one used Maik Krause from a sharp angle for early guidance (7).
In the 43rd minute, Steffen could have increased Uphus, but after great preparation by Krause, he turned free.
The hosts only had a double opportunity when Moritz Höne failed at first to Torsteher Jos Schuhmacher and also found his master in the postshot Jan Blome in the sendenhorster Keeper.
After the break the guests became even more dominant and had a number of good chances.
But Uphus (49), Julian Turl (61), and Heinz Linnemann (69) all awarded.
A trade meter - Louis Kortenjann had saved by hand on the gateline and saw red for it - Niklas Eilmann could not use it for the guests (75.).
Only when Nils Berheide stabbed the ball over the line, the game was decided (81.).
"We had been critical of each other before, and that was different today than in the last few weeks," said Florian Kraus's conclusion.
Sendenhorst: J. Schumacher - Linnemann, Scholz, Eilmann, Mey, Kraus, Krause (77. Berheide), L. Hartleif, Uphus, Abu Dalal (90. Leibig), Turl.
Tore: 0:1 Krause (7), 0:2 Berheide (81).
Red card: Shortenjann (75th/Hoetmar).
Football: Kreisliga A2 Münster: Spectacle football in Albachten: GW Albersloh is subject to Concordia with 3:4
"I don't know what to think about it," he said.
"We have no access to them at all." By which he probably meant the wing pliers with Colby McGill and Janis Kröger, but probably also all the other green-whites that fell with collective offensive urge.
He could still laugh: "A dirty victory," he still said, wavered boldly and pulled from then His players, on the other hand, the relief was to note that they had pulled out of the affair with three points.
Well noted, after a duel of two teams, one of which, namely Albachten, plays for the championship and the other, Albersloh, fights for class.
With understandable mixed feelings, GWA coach Sven Lewandowski looked back on the 90 minutes behind him.
"That was by far our best season performance," he says.
"As we come back after the 0:2, as we hold against one of the top teams of the league over the entire playing time, that was already phenomenal."
It seems all the more bitter that you now have to go home empty-handed.
Top-Torjäger Lars Zymner led the hosts with his 12th season hit (24th).
He needed exactly two ball contacts in this game for this goal.
The 2:0 he placed on the left side pattern valid for Fabian Fröhning (39).
We knew that, but you can't take a player like that out completely.
"That was already insane what he did," Lewandowski knew jealously the opponent's quality.
Shortly before the change of sides, his own eleven managed to compensate: McGill's free throw from the left sailed between Hövelmann and Concordia-Torhüter Hinkerohe into the long toreck (45.).
After the change of sides, it was again McGill who achieved the compensation (59).
Then it went back and forth.
It was a cracky, action-loaded game.
Nübel shocked Albachten again (64th), only five minutes later Patrick Horstmann (69th).
Despite the excess, Albersloh no longer managed to counter the last Concordia hit (80th).
We must now focus our full attention on Wednesday.
"The game against sheepskins, that's what we have to win now," said Lewandowski.
Albersloh: Spangenberg - Hecker, Strohbücker, Adolph, Zur Mühlen - Kröger (87. Diallo), P. Horstmann, Thale, McGill - Hövelmann, Bonse (87. Bareksai).
Tore: 1:0 Zymner (24), 2:0 Frøhning (39), 2:1 McGill (45), 2:2 McGill (59), 3:2 Nübel (64), 3:3 P. Horstmann (69), 4:3 Jülkenbeck (80).
Yellow-Rot: Atalan (74./Albachten).
Football: TSV Straßberg fights point against primus
There was no winner in the Landesliga-Duell between the TSV Straßberg and the FV Biberach.
The table leader had actually arrived for three points, but the team of coach Oliver Pfaff was very good and in the end the game ended 0:0.
Media: Total Bureau of Dynamo Dresden Retired
According to media reports, the entire Bureau of Soccer-Zweitligist Dynamo Dresden resigned.
Several media in the evening appealed in agreement to a joint letter from the body of Saxony.
At first, there was no confirmation of the association.
The reason for the withdrawal should be internal power struggles with the former federal league.
Erdogan in Germany: Politics instead of Pomp
I'm glad he's gone again.
There are only a few state guests whose departure in Germany provides as much relief as that of Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Three days the Turkish president was a guest in Berlin and Cologne, and many had thought that he should not have been invited at all.
Evangelical Academy Tutzing: Prominent Guests and New Offers
The Evangelical Academy Tutzing will be offering about 80 meetings by mid-year next year.
France's President, Emmanuel Macron, has now signaled that he wants to pick up the tolerance price personally in Tutzing.
For Christian Wulff, the term of office was too short: as Federal President, he was not in Tutzing's Evangelical Academy.
But before and after Wulff was a guest there.
So Udo Hahn, director of the Academy, took him in when he proudly said, "All the Federal Presidents and Chancellors were already with us." That the Academy at the Schloss Tutzing always appeared prominent, but was also a topic in the presentation of the annual programme.
At the end of October, songwriter Konstantin Wecker attends a conference on spiritual experience in philosophical perspective.On 29 September, the writer Frido Mann will be at a meeting about his grandfather Thomas Mann.
In the meantime, France's President Emmanuel Macron has also pledged: He wishes to receive personally the "Tolerance Prize" awarded to him by the Academy in Tutzing, which in another category also receives television host Dunja Hayali (we reported).
The approximately 80 meetings until mid-2019 have it in them.
"The pension is not safe!" is in a conference title.
"SOS at the borders of Europe" - the Academy describes the "risky and deadly route over the Mediterranean".
"And to a meeting on Syria: "Barbarei without Limit".
Arms deals, destruction, torture, death - the war mocks every human idea".
From structural racism in society to the scissors between the poor and the rich to the radical change of work through digitization, the spectrum extends.
Akademie-Director Hahn was convinced: "A free democracy needs places where a civil society can come together to look for solutions or at least for partial solutions".
At a meeting of the 200th.
Karl Marx's birthday will soon be expected by one more visitor of the direction of capitalism-criticism, the other more a tendency "from the outside to the middle".
What about neutrality?
"We are 100 percent a daughter of the Evangelical State Church," said study director Dr. Ulrike Haerendel, "so we are not 100 percent neutral."
Music Cabaret: Gender Understanding with Heart - Wolbeck - Westphalian News
"Suitable for both adults and men" was the musical cabaret with Tina Teubner on Friday evening in the hall of the Christ Church in Wolbeck.
As a cabaret girl, Teubner prefaced the gender understanding, not only with humor and warmth of heart for the (feeling) woman and (feeling) man and what else there might be, but also with music.
The mini guitar used it and also mastered its violin.
Ben Süverkrüp was sitting on the wing.
On the one hand, the male sparring partner, who sometimes comes to the end of the sentence, on the other hand, is a true pianist: So royal harmoniously accompanies Süverkrüp Teubner, that some may have wished for a solo.
There was also, with Beethoven and Chopin, but different, namely, as it fit the red thread of the evening.
There Teubner had put a paradox into play: the satisfaction of the man comes if he has a partner, but he does not open the door.
A closed door without a partner, on the other hand, does not bring any benefit.
The piano solo now demonstrates the same thing: What would have come of Mozart's composition, would "the Nannerl" have opened the door unexpectedly?
Thus Süverkrüp glides over in improvisations, from Bach's "O head full of blood and wounds" to the "Song of Death", and from Mozart g minor symphony into a playful dance.
There was a big applause and "Bravo" from the full hall.
Flowers presented Karlheinz Kleintje, treasurer of the club, the chansonette.
But the chairman Heidemarie Markenbeck did not accept any additional thanks.
She also had the idea to give the duo an appearance in Stuttgart and Frankfurt, one in Wolbeck.

Bruchsal.
After a bus accident at the A5 in Baden-Württemberg, the police slightly corrected the number of victims down.
Ten instead of 15 passengers had been slightly injured.
Everyone has been released from the hospital.
The French bus driver had stayed at the hospital for one night to observe.

The bus was unbraked frontally against a guideboard on Saturday morning.
Handball: Women's Landesliga: Ahlener SG keeps the white vest against TV Wattenscheid
The Achleners had problems with the third-liga player Carolin Stallmann, who only marked ten hits.
"Actually, I was well satisfied with the defense, only one player has made too many goals.
We didn't catch them," said ASG coach Dogan Aydogdu.
But he was more annoyed by the many missed opportunities.
The concentration in the end made his team miss this time.
The ASG therefore ran almost to the end behind a backlog, was at the break with 11:12 and later with 15:18 (45.) at the back.
Only towards the end did the wider bank of the host women make a decisive remark.
In addition, Aydogdu put Merle Klement back room on the left, which then made "extremely clever the decisive goals" (Aydogdu).
ASG: Buschkötter, Bolte - Bruland (2), Pumpe, Exner, Klement (5), Colbatzky (5/3), Drewes (1), Schlautmann (1), Deventer (6), Baer (1), C. Fitzek, Ruschhaupt (4), S. Fitzek.
Volleyball: 3rd League Women: Top performance of the BSV Ostbevern in the top game at VC Allbau Essen
Thanks to a top performance in the top game, the volleyballers of the BSV Ostbevern have once again established themselves in the top group of the 3rd League West.
At the second-liga jumper VC Allbau Essen won the blue-whites with 3:1.
"That was a huge step for a cool season.
It makes Lenz play in the upper third of the league.
We have now worked this out," said Trainer Dominik Münch, looking forward to an almost impeccable performance of his team at the fallen table leader.
The first passage dominated the guests almost as desired.
About 4:1, 16:10, and 22:12 he went to the vice-master of the previous year with 25:15.
Food has been accepted in two bars, but has not come into play.
We did a good job with her.
Our opponent has posted high risk, but also produced several tickets.
In the second sentence, the BSV already led with 12:8."Eating has switched the acceptance to three-bar.
We couldn't keep the print.
Food sucked off, and we let ourselves get a little caught up," Münch continues.
At 18:17 the volleyballers from the Ruhr area had their noses in front of them for the first time.
Although Eastbevern resisted four more handballs at 19:24, the fifth attempt found its goal.
"The game was now a class better," the trainer found to the increasing level.
Maike Rüdingloh and finally Wiebke Silge contributed significantly to the BSV turning the sheet in the third section from 14:16 to 25:21.
Münch: "We played there consistently and calmly".
About 7:3 and 15:13 the Blue-White passage brought four passages to their side with 25:22.
Vera Horstmann was chosen as the most valuable player, but Maren Flachmeier had also achieved an excellent day.
BSV women: Egg house, Rüdingloh, Lea and Anna Dreckmann, Auen, Flachmeier, Mersch-Schneider, Silge, Horstmann, Roer.
International: Turkish municipality: mosque opening as missed opportunity
The Turkish community in Germany (TGD) has criticized the way in which the large ditib mosque was inaugurated in Cologne by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
"The opening of the mosque in Cologne has left in the German-Turkish relationship a cluster of shards that can only be worked together," said the chairman of the TGD, Gökay Sofuoglu, the editorial network Germany.
Both the Turkish and the German sides would have missed the opportunity to have a common, reconciled appearance.
"In addition to stressing the Muslim membership of Germany with German leaders, Erdogan has used the date for his purposes," lamented Sofuoglu.
The widespread exclusion of the German public had "encouraged many reservations".
Heimatverein Nottuln: Offer has already established
After the long summer break is finally the folk meeting time again.
On 18 October (Thursday) at 7.30 p.m., the Heimatverein Nottuln already organizes its fifth Nottuln folk meeting in the fireplace room of the Old Amtmannei.
Almost to the day it is then a year ago that we have for the first time conducted a folk meeting.
In the meantime, this event has become an integral part of the musical calendar in Nottuln", says Hanns Moormann, chairman of the Nottulner Heimatverein.
I didn't think our crowd meeting would be so fast in emergency eta.
Whether storm deep Friederike in January or heat wave in July, the fireplace room of the Amtmannei was always fully occupied.
"As always, the program at the next folk meeting is a colorful mix of German folk, hiking and sailor songs, folk songs, Evergreens and old beats," says Karl-Heinz Stevermüer, who invites friends to Nottuln again and again.
Klaus Spellmeyer promised his first folk meeting "birthday" with his accordion.
He was a member of "Gaitling", a group from the Steinfurt district who played music with record German lyrics.
Now he's on his way with an Irish folk band.
The makers of the folk meeting remember the last event in the summer when Christoph Schulz from the Folktreff Emsdetten with his international version of the song "Frog in the Night" excited the audience and sent them home with an earworm.
"We expect many happy guests to spend a pleasant and humorous evening again," says the invitation of the Home Association.
Anyone who plays an instrument and wants to be actively involved is invited to participate.
Since the desired seats are always occupied quickly, it is advisable to be there early enough.
The folk meeting starts at 7.30 p.m., but admission is already at 7 p.m.
China approved planned merger of Linde and Praxair
For legal reasons, all open questions must be resolved by 24 October.
FrankfurtLinde and Praxair are on their way to the world's largest industrial gas group.
The Chinese competition authority approved the proposed merger, informed Linde on Sunday.
This represents the billion-dollar merger still under way in South Korea and, as the biggest obstacle, in the United States.
Last but not least, according to an insider's consent, Linde had improved the chances of selling additional parts of the company.
For legal reasons, all open questions must be resolved by 24 October in order for the merger to succeed.
From pure fruit building to ecology
With a gala in the Dr. Stammberger Hall, the 125-year-old existence of the Circle Association for Horticulture and Landespflege was celebrated.
On 29 September 1893, with a fruit show at the Kulmbacher Vereinshaus, the last foundation impulses for the Kreisverband für Gartenbau und Landespflege Kulmbach were set, and exactly 125 years later he celebrated a big anniversary on Saturday evening in the Kulmbacher Stadthalle.
Of course, he was called a different name at the time: as the "Kulmbach City and Land District Fruit Building Association", he was removed from baptism in 1893 by Mayor Wilhelm Flessa.
The purpose of the fruit-growing association was also different from today's work - it was actually about fruit-growing, flowers and horticulture, no one thought about it at the time.
"At that time, at the time of the Enlightenment, the fruit tree was a favorite child of the elites," explained Kreisheimatpfleger Günter Dippold in his lecture.
Fruit trees should be lined with long-distance roads, so-called industrial gardens were built in schools.
Obstan construction is still the responsibility of the 55 horticultural associations in the district of Kulmbach, which include almost 7,000 members.
But by far the spectrum is not exhausted.
A natural horticulture, biological plant protection, village decoration and nutrition play an equal role as well as the dissemination of knowledge, healthy nutrition and youth work.
How versatile the tasks of a horticultural association are, the members of the Hutchdorf youth group "Moulwörfe" showed entertainingly on stage.
"Young people's work is particularly urgent in the digital age," said Günter Reif, Chairman of the Circle, and OB Henry Schramm also stressed the importance of life experiences in nature.
The chestnut collection was a big deal for us children, I doubt that with smartphone & co. you can gain a similar amount of joy.
Schramm promised to plant two trees together with Landrat Klaus Peter Söllner for the anniversary.
"Where they are to stand, the Kreisverband decides," added Landrat Söllner, highlighting the special importance of the horticultural associations for the villages.
The circle association stands for ecology, the beauty of the garden and green areas in the village.
The fact that this is a real concern of the many horticultural associations in the district also left no doubt about this to the district executive and specialist consultant Friedhelm Haun.
He led the many visitors through the long history of the circle association with an image presentation and reported, among other things, on the need for self-sufficiency after the war.
In the past everything came from the garden, for the winter it was ingested.
At the end of the 1950s, however, the farm turned into a ornamental and residential garden.
" Nature has existed, it was already there before us and we have to focus on it," said the expert for fruit and nut trees.
For this reason, the horticultural associations are encouraged not to give up, so that our home stays beautiful and worth living.
This also includes welcoming the new citizens in our associations, the president of the Bavarian Federation, Wolfram Vaitl.
"We must stop the blatant decline in insects, which we owe to our children and grandchildren," concluded Günter Reif, who was solemnly framed by the towers of Thurnau Music Society.

Priority for Naphta talks: Canada's Foreign Minister gives UN speech
Mexico's government wants clarity on Naphta: they put an ultimatum on both trading partners for an agreement.
Canada's foreign minister now gives the trade agreement absolute priority - and postpones her speech to the United Nations.
Because of the pressure of time in wringing for a new edition of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) with the United States and Mexico, Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland has postponed her speech at the UN General debate in New York.
Instead of today's Saturday, the minister will not speak until Monday before the UN General Assembly, her spokesperson Adam Austen announced.
In the meantime, she concentrates on the renegotiation of Naphta.
Mexican economic minister Ildefonso Guajardo said on Friday that Canada's negotiators and the US would have 48 hours to agree if Canada actually wanted to join the trade agreement already reached between its country and the US.
The United States and Mexico agreed in August on a new version of the Naphta Regional Free Trade Agreement.
US President Donald Trump suggested that Canada could be excluded from Naphta in the future.
Talks about a new edition have been going on for over a year.
By Sunday evening (local time) they are now to be concluded, Trump's government wants to present the agreement to the US Senate before 1 October.
In the event of a failure of the negotiations, Mexico's appointed President Andres Manuel López Obrador announced on Friday that he would endeavour to reach a bilateral agreement with Canada.

Protests against presidential candidates Bolsonaro
The Brazilian presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro injured in a trade fair attack has left the hospital.
The right-wing extreme ex-military wanted to fly to Río de Janeiro, where he lived, after a report by the daily newspaper "O Globo".
After his release, it is still unclear whether the 63-year-old will perform public performances in the South American country last week before the presidential elections.
The politician had been attacked on the open road at the beginning of September during a campaign in southern Brazil.
Meanwhile, in several Brazilian cities thousands of people went on the streets to demonstrate against Bolsonaro.
Under the title "Ele não" (in German: "Der nicht") women's associations called mainly for protests against the ex-military.
Also in the social networks, the associations made racist and womanly statements against Bolsonaro.
In the economic metropolis of São Paulo several thousand demonstrators were expected.
In the capital of Brasilia, the protests were mixed with a demonstration by the presidential candidate of the Brazilian Workers' Party (PT), Fernando Haddad.
He replaced former President Inácio Lula da Silva, who had been sentenced to 12 years in prison for corruption and is therefore not allowed to run for office.
Presidential elections in Brazil will be held on 7 October.
As former mayor of the million-dollar town of São Paulo, Haddad had so far been in polls far behind the right-wing extreme candidate Bolsonaro.
Although the "Trump of Brazil" has been involved in politics for a long time, it recently presents itself as an anti-system candidate.
If none of the candidates in the first round reaches the absolute majority, there will be a roll-call vote on 28 October.
Observers assume that Bolsonaro will not emerge successfully from this - no matter who he is against.
Bolsonaro is known for resisting homosexuals and blacks and glorifying the military dictatorship (1964-1985).
Again and again he shocks with verbal derailments.
Another time he said that the supporters of Lula's left-wing Workers' Party should be shot.
Europe Revokes Ryder Cup Title
Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines - Just an hour from Disneyland, the European golfers have written another Ryder Cup fairy tale in front of the gates of Paris.
Capt. Thomas Björn's outside team had more than 150,000 spectators on the three days in the Le Golf National with great beats and outstanding team spirit deflecting the favorite title defender USA around a toothless tiger Woods.
After long illness: Danish rock legend died
The Danish rock icon Kim Larsen is dead.
The singer died on Sunday at the age of 72 after a long illness, his producer Jörn Jeppesen announced on Larsen's website.
Larsen was surrounded by his wife and six children at the deathbed.
The musician had been in treatment for prostate cancer since the beginning of the year.
Larsen had become famous for the band Gasolin', which was enormously successful in Scandinavia in the 1970s.
Their songs were influenced by international music sizes such as Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan and the Beatles.
After the release of the band in 1978, Larsen was successful as a solo artist.
He sold around three million records in Denmark.
His album "Midt om nacht" from 1983 is still the best-selling album in Denmark.
Danish Prime Minister Lars Löppe Rasmussen honoured Larsen on Sunday in a declaration as a "boy of the road", which was "against everything, but in all hearts".
The head of government also recalled that the monarchy opponent Larsen had occurred in 2010 on the 70th birthday of the Danish queen Margrethe II.
Rocknacht in the shoe factory: Volume at press air hammer level
"Here we stand, take the bone saws and light up a concert evening with the power of a tiger." The band names of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" alone suggest such a description of the rocky live music experience on Saturday evening in the hall of the citizens' centre Schuhfabrik: Pure hard rock of three with another friendly band.
After the sound check and shortly before the start of the concert, the musicians even take time for a group photo.
There's no sign of a lamp fever.
Afterwards, the rock protagonists from Ahlen and the surrounding area - all in association with the booking agency "Mosquito" from Oelde - with their bands are thrilled to see the approximately 120 visitors of the "Mint Mosquito" rock night.
Already the quartet "Tiger Bonesaw" with frontman and guitarist Dennis Hadrika knows how to convince about the start of the concert evening also with the latest, unknown pieces from their own pen and the CD that will soon appear.
In front of the stage, the band is danced for the vocal and expressive interplay of the band.
Although "additional" calls are not to be ignored, "Tiger Bonesaw" then leaves the stage to the trio "Here We Stand".
The fact that hard rock is not the same as hard rock is demonstrated by guitarist Sascha Bregenhorn, Golo Meierhenrich at the bass and drummer Kai Hölscher with their alternative, sometimes classic rock of the 1970s.
After the "High Energy Rock" of the "Tigers", "Here We Stand" also uses a synthesizer for guitar rock.
Not only the longing, almost ballad-like "Take Me Home" impresses with the change from melodic passages to the guitar-burdened rock riffs of the multilayered songs.
However, the quartet "The Ignition" from Tonnishäschen has played a special reputation since its establishment in 2005.
Full agility on Saturday the band presents their hard rock.
The fact that "The Ignition" with its performances in front of very large audiences - recently documented in a film by Max Meis about the 2017 Tour in China - has special stage experience is obvious and incomprehensible.
singer and guitarist Tim Jungmann also sets his own accents in the band's only covert song of the evening, "Word Up" by Cameo from the 80s.
Guitarist Norbert Brinkmann delivers a jubilant solo while still feeling even louder than before, and runs through the audience.
A certain volume is of course part of the genre at such a hard rock concert: At the "Mint Mosquito" rock night, according to the information of the mixing table team, the trio concert of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" is about 98 decibels.
This is, for example, at the pressure air hammer level, but is still clearly below the controls of the "Wacken-Fesitval", pointing to the "The Ignition" on their website.
However, the Ahlener audience does not need 120 decibels in nozzle drive volume as usual with the annual Metal-Stelldichein in the north of the Republic.
After almost four hours, the three bands of the tougher, rocky gangart have long convinced with their sovereign, virtuoso game and their own compositions.
"Here we stand, took the bone saw and lit a concert evening with the power of a tiger," all three groups can say in the end, however, in the transmitted sense.
And especially enjoy the great applause of the visitors.

A dead man in a sailplane accident at Essen/Mülheim Airport
There was a fatal accident at Mülheim/Essen Airport.
A sailplane crashed on Sunday in a parking lot at Mülheim/Essen Airport.
The pilot died in the accident.
A fatal accident occurred on Sunday near Mülheim/Essen Airport.
As reported by the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" (Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung), a sailplane crashed at the trade fair parking lot at the airport.
The pilot had died.
As the "WAZ" continues to report, the student had been on board alone - the pilot is supposed to be a occupant.
The plane was already on its landing at the time of the accident.
The crash site is just a short distance from a festival tent on the airport site.
But a October festival has been taking place since this weekend.
Mülheim/Essen Airport is located on the city border of the two Ruhr-area cities and directly on the driveway to the highway 52.
From the parking lot there is a Park&Ride offer at large events at the Essen Fair or the Gruga Hall in Essen.
Trump in heaven, Kim: "And then we fell in love"
The fact that the U.S. President North Korea's ruler Kim is quite sound in the face of nuclear crisis is no secret.
But now Trump has made a real declaration of love to his colleague.
She also has to do with Kim's "beautiful letters".
At the tender age of 72, the married U.S. president has become known as a new flame.
The Tragic: It's a long distance relationship.
Donald Trump made an unusual declaration of love to the North Korean ruler Kim Jong Un on Saturday in public.
In front of followers in the US state of West Virginia, Trump found almost tender words for the half-so-old spross of the Pjongyang dynasty, although it proves to be a rather tough piece of nuclear disarmament in the struggle for North Korea.
"I was tough, so was he, and between us it went back and forth," said Trump.
And then we fell in love.
Okay?
No, really.
And not just the conversations with Kim would have melted his heart.
He wrote me beautiful letters, they were great letters.
Her personal connection has also borne political fruit: Trump referred to the stop of all nuclear and rocket tests announced by Kim, even though critics have so far seen little more than lip-confidence.
That the affection for the "Rocket Man" - said Trump's nickname for Kim - whether he was notorious for his martial threat bearer - should not be every memoryer, seemed to be quite aware of the US President.
At any rate, he took the foreseeable criticism of this at his performance in a large sports hall in Wheeling City: "Donald Trump says they fell in love."
How terrible is that?
It's so unpresidual.
But he takes care of this very little, said Trump and then pointed his index finger to the crowd: "I have always told you that it is so easy to be presidential."
But then out there wouldn't push 10,000 people into this blast-filled arena, but we would have only 200 people outside.
Octoberfest attracts many guests to Baesweiler
Baesweiler Bestens visited, in a moody and above all pampered by the sun: Very varied and with a good shot Oktoberfestflair, Baesweiler's city center has cleared up on Sunday.
For the first time, the Oktoberfest not only took place in the festival tent at the fire tower, but was extended by the trade association on Sunday to the city.
Refugees rescued thanks to video from Libyan prison
With the help of a mobile video, Nigerian refugees have pointed to their disastrous conditions of detention in Libya, thus enabling their rescue.
The group had shot the shot in their cell in the coastal town of Sawija in July under the threat of life and distributed it online.
"They refuse to send us back," said a man in the video message.
We suffer here, we die here.
The recording was sent to the website "France 24 Observers", whose editors alerted the International Organization for Migration (IOM).
The refugees were finally flown to Nigeria at the end of August.
"Without the video we probably couldn't have returned to Nigeria," said Efe Onyeka, who recorded the video, the news agency AFP.
The 25-year-old was arrested in Libya in an attempt to cross the Mediterranean.
With the video he put himself in danger by his own statement.
One of his associates was almost beaten to death by the guards, said Onyeka.
Generally, the conditions of detention had been disastrous: "They beat us all with pipes and sticks."
They gave us nothing to eat, we had to drink from the latrine.
The IOM organises the voluntary repatriation of refugees stranded in Libya.
About 2,700 migrants from Nigeria were sent back to their homes this year with the help of the program, said the IOM spokesperson in the West African country, Jorge Galindo.
The case of the now rescued Nigerians was not exceptional in view of the bad conditions of detention in Libya.
But he hasn't heard of a phone video help call.
International organisations have long criticized the conditions in the Libyan refugee camps as unworthy of human beings.
The North African state, which is dominated too widely by militias, is the main transit country for migrants on the way from Africa to Europe.
When a teacher went to the public school place on Sunday afternoon to prepare their lessons for Monday, she surprised a burglar.
At 16:50 the teacher entered the building over the main entrance.
In the front house of the 1st floor she saw a man fleeing immediately.
First through a door, then over the roof terrace and from there over a path to the ground floor or the front square.
The teacher informed the police who took the investigation.
Whether things or money have been stolen, cannot yet be said.
Description: about 16 years old, black, very short hair, somewhat darker appearance, dark pants, dark T-shirt.
Please contact the Obernberg police inspectorate at the Inn, telephone number 059 133 4244.
German was caught in his own car for days
A 75-year-old had to stand in a forest area in central France for several days and nights in his car after he had hit the car off all the forest roads and blocked a tree from the car door.
Rescue forces accidentally discovered the car on Saturday afternoon near a pasture and liberated the missing person since Tuesday evening, the police announced on Sunday.
According to the report, the 75-year-old from Pleinfeld was in good health despite the cold nights and the long time without care.
He indicated that he was now looking forward to his home.
The pensioner had been reported as missing by his family after he had not returned from a ride with his off-road car over the local meadows and fields on Tuesday.
Despite intensive search efforts, the man's remains had remained unclear for days.
Laschet urges the rule of law in Turkey
Köln NRW-Minister President Armin Laschet (CDU) called for the rule of law in Turkey in consultation with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
The relations between the two countries were currently "overestimated", said Laschet on Saturday after a meeting with Erdogan at Cologne Airport.
This was primarily about arresting waves, the freedom of the press and religion.
He therefore made it clear to Erdogan "that if relations are to normalize in the future, if economic relations are to be deepened, that rule of law is a very important prerequisite for this".
Laschet also mentioned the cases of Germans in prison in Turkey, according to his own information.
He expressed the expectation that freedom of expression would be respected.
Erdogan once again stressed the independence of Turkish justice.
The conversation between Laschet and Erdogan had been transferred to a short-term building of the German Federal Defence Ministry's readiness to fly at Cologne Airport.
Originally, it was supposed to take place on Schloss Wahn - but the castle owners had refused to do so out of political conviction against Erdogan.
After the conversation Erdogan went on to open the ditib mosque in Cologne.
Laschet had cancelled a joint appearance in the building.
But he said, "The Muslims who go into this mosque are also citizens of our country."
And we are also their partners - and not the Turkish President.
Lack of confidence in the US: North Korea Demands Disarmament
While US President Trump is not tired of stressing the success of the negotiations on the denuclearization of North Korea, the East Asian regime is more sober.
Foreign Minister Ri calls for Washington to meet.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has accused the US government of blocking negotiations for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula with its continued sanctions.
"The recent halt is therefore due to the fact that the US is building on coercive measures that are lethal to build confidence," said Ri in New York.
Disarmament is unthinkable for North Korea under these circumstances.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances there will be no way for us to disarm ourselves as the first," said the North Korean chief diplomat.
The fact that sanctions could force North Korea on its knees is "a dream of people who don't know us".
In order to build confidence, however, his country had stopped its nuclear and missile tests and destroyed an atomic test facility, Ri stressed.
However, there were no "corresponding reactions" on the US side, the Minister criticized.
Due to North Korea's nuclear and missile programme, the UN Security Council had decided on three sanctions against the internationally isolated country alone last year.
U.S. President Donald Trump and his foreign minister Mike Pompeo have been pressing the United Nations for strict compliance with the sanctions in recent days.
At the same time, the US government is working on an approximation.
In June Trump met Kim Jong Un, the first North Korean ruler.
After the first summit in Singapore, the US President is aiming for a second summit with Kim.
In October, Pompeo is scheduled to return to Pyongyang to discuss the end of the North Korean nuclear weapons program.
The HoT serves: New kitchen with donations from the municipality
That they were actually in a youth meeting, many visitors to the open door house HoT got nothing: White blankets and flower decorations on the tables and a large buffet were waiting for the guests after the harvest thanks divine service.
The young people of the HoT had enchanted the buffet with delicacies from different countries in the new kitchen.
The institution was financed by donations from the community, for which the young people wanted to thank themselves with the food.
The start of the new facility was not easy, as Henriette Westbuer, the head of the HoT, recalls.
We had filled our refrigerators with food and ingredients before the summer break and were well prepared for the big day.
But then the first day after the summer break came the bad surprise: a power failure had put the huge, two-piece refrigerator out of operation, the food was rotten and had to be disposed of.
"Now we had to start all over again: we got a lot of support from friends and neighbors, but the children and young people wanted to do it alone," said Westbuer.
And that's how everyone took it.
The result could be seen, the guests were enthusiastic.
"Better can't cook," praised a visitor, while Hokkaido pumpkin soup was served or the guests were allowed to use Quiche, liver cheese or cake.
"It's really great what the kids and young people have put on their feet," said Pastor Frank Beckmann, while Wizard Stephan Lammen with card tricks and other pieces of art caused amazement.
Jürgen Sator leaves the Board of Governors NRW
Out of frustration over criticism from his own ranks, the head of the Essener Tafel, Jörg Sartor, left his post in the Landesverband.
Sartor had become known nationwide because the Essen Table had introduced a reception stop for foreigners.
He had already resigned in July as Vice President of the NRW Boards, said Sartor of the "World on Sunday".
I've lost too many people in my back.
The head of the NRW, Wolfgang Weilerswist, spoke to the dpa about the decision of his long-standing deputy.
Sartor took the sharp criticism.
"I can understand his step - there have been people who did not know exactly why the Essen Table does this."
But Sartor is still active for the Essen Table - "six days a week, nothing changes," says Weilerswist.
Sartor again criticised colleagues from other boards in the "World on Sunday".
One should not follow the approach "without us the people in the city starve."
It was the task of the state to ensure that people did not starve.
The Essener did not attend a conference of the panels on Friday in Berlin.
"That's where too much sweet dirt is told to me," he said.
There are all these social fuzzies that criticized me so much at the time.
Play SF Lorch 2:0 Guide - Gmünder Tagespost
Football, district league Lorch loses against Neuler 2:3 - TV Heuchlingen wins in Kirchheim after arrears - Betringen beats Lauchheim clearly.
At 2:0 Lorch was already in the lead in the home game against the TV Neuler - at the end it was 2:3 and the disappointment among the sports friends was great.
The TV Heuchlingen was quite different: In Kirchheim the TVH quickly got to the back with 0:1 but won after 90 minutes with 2:1. At the top of the table the SGB could now with a 3:0
Gladbach plays twice tour - Schalke without embolo with first victory
Borussia Mönchengladbach must continue to wait for an away victory in Wolfsburg.
At 2:2 the foals play twice a lead.
Schalke comes against Mainz for the first season win (1:0).
(sda) Four times, Schalke has manoeuvred in the first five games with early opponents.
Now the team of Domenico Tedesco once again put that strength on the day with which it had won the first place behind the Bayern in the last season.
Alessandro Schöpf led the home-equipe in the eleventh minute after strong preparatory work by Yevgeni Konopljanka by head, and the hosts subsequently preserved the mini-pull with a compact defensive performance.
Thanks to an extraordinary comeback, Borussia Dortmund greets again from the top of the Bundesliga.
Lucien Favre's team had acted against Bayer Leverkusen until the break with a 0:2-rest, but in the 2nd half came the 4:2 victory.
Jacob-Bruun Larsen (65th) and Marco Reus (69th) compared with a doublet within four minutes, Paco Alcacer, who was replaced by Favre in the 63rd minute, with another doublet in the final phase (86th/94.) ensured the crowning completion of the performance increase after the break.
The VfB Stuttgart won the first victory.
In the meantime, the Stuttgarters had to fear against the dezimated Werder Bremen because of a yellow-red card against Milos Veljkovic.
Borna Sosa and the unremarkable Goalie Ron-Robert Zieler fabricated a curious enlistment owner that helped the guests to compensate in the 68th minute.
Seven minutes later, Gonzalo Castro led the VfB to the first victory.
In Wolfsburg, Michael Lang did not experience a successful debut for Borussia Mönchengladbach.
The Gladbachers who joined the Swiss quartet Yann Sommer, Nico Elvedi, Denis Zakaria and Lang gave a tour twice, finally played 2:2 and are still waiting for an outback victory in the VW city since 2003.
For Wolfsburg's balance to 1:1, Renato Steffen was responsible for his second federal league.
Yann Sommer was powerless in the 20 metres of the Aargauer, as was the second match after an hour.
Nevertheless, the trends at Gladbach are quite promising.
Alassane Pléa appears to be a Goalgetter in the storm of foals.
Against Wolfsburg, the French record purchase from OGC Nice was made for the third time in a row and for the seventh time in a compulsory game.
After seven laps Gladbach takes fourth place.
Within 40 minutes, the previously unbeatable Werder Bremen maneuvered against the VfB Stuttgart into an untiring situation.
After 19 minutes, the team of Florian Kohlfeldt was surprised by a Stuttgart account that the ex-Luganesi Anastasios Donis completed with his first season hit, and after 36 minutes, Milos Veljkovic continued to join his team: the 23-year-old Serb collected against Daniel Didavi Yellow-Rot after a jersey.
Although Stuttgart's defender Borna Sosa and Goalie Ron-Robert Zieler brought back the Bremer through a curious enlisted owner (68th), a quarter of an hour before the end, Gonzalo Castro shot the Stuttgarters back on the winning road in excess.
Nürnberg decided the duell against Düsseldorf 3:0 sovereignly.
After half an hour, Hanno Behrens started the home team with Foulpenalty.
Macedonians vote on new state names
In Macedonia, about 1.8 million citizens today are voting on whether to change the name of their country in northern Macedonia.
With a yes, the nearly three decades-swelling conflict with Greece's neighbours could be resolved.
Athens, because of its northern province of the same name, had undergone a change of name and had blocked every approach of Macedonia to the west.
The voters therefore also decide on future Western integration.
The US had announced that the country could quickly become a NATO member with a positive outcome of the referendum.
Acids in U-Haft.
Refugees attacked three women.
One Syrian brutally beaten three pensioners and thereby severely injured them.
The 41-year-old asylum seeker had rang around 22 o'clock on Friday in the escape street in Alsergrund.
When the police arrived, they spoke to the accused, who started with fistballed fists on passersby and tried to attack them on his behavior.
Then the Syrian tried to beat and kick the officials.
Little later it turned out that the suspect had just hit three older women (65, 67, 75) with his fists on the Währinger Straße at a tram stop.
He had also stepped the trio with his feet.
In part, the pensioners were seriously injured.
They suffered hematomas, convulsions, and concussions.
The asylum seeker was also severely injured "for an unknown reason", as the police called it.
He was taken to the hospital and continuously monitored during treatment.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Almost exactly one year after the marriage came into force for all, SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his long-time friend Christoph Rohde.
The two took the jaword on Saturday in Hamburg.
A registered life partnership had not come into question for them, Kahrs had previously said the "picture" newspaper.
He's been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is the budgetary spokesperson of the SPD-Bundestagsfaktion and one of the spokespersons of the Seeheimer Kreis, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening up of marriage to homosexuals, Kahrs had aroused anger on June 30, 2017.
So he had accused Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of having "postulated" on the subject.
"This was your Shabowski moment," he referred to the accidental announcement of the GDR border opening by Günter Schabowski.
Since 1 October 2017, same-sex couples can marry just like heterosexuals.
Previously, they had been able to register their life partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, for example with the right of adoption.
Garden day: 400 meters hedge cut
There was a lot of work in front of the members of the Citizen's Association Kinderhaus and the Society for Leprakunde.
Because about 400 meters of hedges around the gardens of the inhabitants of the Pfründnerhaus should be cut.
Supported by the residents, it went to work for about twelve supporters.
"We do this to reduce costs," said Walter Schröer, president of the Citizens' Association.
And there have been so many gatherings.
Because of the hot summer we're late this time, but fortunately it's just a form cut.
Because already in spring the hedges had been shaved once.
The breakfast that always follows at work also has a long tradition.
"It's supposed to stay with all the forces," said Walter Schröer.
World Cup in Rio: Hannes Aigner gets gold at the Canuslalom World Cup
The Augsburger Hannes Aigner won the gold medal at the conclusion of the Canuslalom World Championship in Rio de Janeiro.
The 29-year-old made a perfect run on the Olympic track on Sunday.
Two years ago, he had missed the Olympic bridge three hundredths of a second.
I was well prepared, had already had enough rides here on the site and it was all right today," said the London Third Olympics in 2012.
In the goal, he threw away his paddle for joy and stretched both arms to the high - knowing that it would be worth at least a medal.
After all, he had start number four.
But the six remaining starters could not top off their fabulous time of 89.69 seconds.
Second, the Czech Jiri Prskavec became egg before the Russian Pawel.
The Gauting Police Inspectorate mentions the first attempt to break into a family house this autumn.
Fortunately, the perpetrators failed.
The days are getting shorter - that's what burglars want to make use of again.
This is how the Gauting Police Inspectorate reported yesterday's first attempt to break in this autumn.
The alarm system is due to the fact that it has remained at the one-family house on Königswieser Straße.
They started when the perpetrators laid hands on Friday just before 8 p.m.
The burglars knew that the residents were not at home.
The alarm system, however, apparently surprised them so much that they fled without prey.
Notes to PI Gauting, telephone (089) 8 93 13 30.
Break at Hertha: Collected from reality: Bavaria demanded against Ajax
The predicate is unbeatable: The defeat in Berlin wants the FC Bayern "not to be liked".
The next two classics against Ajax and Gladbach now determine the first interim conclusion for Niko Kovac's term of office.
The first small power platter under the new coach Niko Kovac is not supposed to increase for the Munichers to the greater fall depth.
"A week ago you had the impression that we are invincible.
Now we have a little caught up with reality," Thomas Müller noted after the earned 0:2 defeat at Hertha BSC and called for a response for the Champions League duel with Ajax Amsterdam.
Anyone who knows us knows that's really pissing us off and that's why we're going to gas Tuesday.
For the first time in more than a year, no goal of its own has been shot, as at the same time of the previous season two compulsory games in series without victory, lost the table in the football league to Borussia Dortmund for the first time.
Although the overall situation is not as dramatic as the final phase of the failed Carlo Ancelotti at the end of September 2017, the record master must be warned.
The FC Augsburg at 1:1 with its run-intensive man-versus-man-tactics and the Berliners through their playful needle-sticks over the outside have delivered two blue breaks within three days, as the last superpowerful Bavarians have to crack.
"Those who know about FC Bayern know that we don't like it and we will do everything we can to get back to success," said Kovac.
Otherwise, however, he changed with his losers in his hometown surprisingly gently and pushed his first defeat as a Munich coach only on the again flawed handling of opportunities.
A victory against Amsterdam and against Borussia Mönchengladbach on Saturday, the first interim conclusion of his term of office would still be positive - otherwise the tone would probably tighten up.
Thus Kovac did not take any exceptional measures before the second class appearance of this season after the 2:0 at Benfica Lisbon.
After the free day on Sunday, as planned, the short preparation for the second round game against Ajax begins, which had also defeated Athens sovereignly at the start of the AEK with 3:0.
"Now it has caught us in two games, but we will also make our goals again," announced national team captain Manuel Neuer.
As already after the lost cup finale against Eintracht Frankfurt in the same place, Joshua Kimmich spoke plaintext in particular.
The legal defender acted in the role of Mahner.
"I don't think that's all bad, we have to work it out again, because we don't make the many opportunities and make the mistakes in the back," stressed the 23-year-old shortly before leaving the Olympic Stadium.
On the seventh day of the previous season, the Bavarians were already behind Dortmund with five counters, which now took over the lead again with one point of head.
And so Kimich, with a twinkle of his eyes, was at least positive that the public debate on the supposedly unbeatable Bavaria had now ended.
"Yes, that's good," said the national player.
It's good for the league.
DFB boss in shot line: Özil-Cauza: Sharp attack from Erdogan on Grindel
With serious accusations, Turkish President Erdogan denounces the exclusion of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan in Germany.
DFB President Grindel sees mistakes, but defends the line of association.
Now a new post is to be created.
Berlin - On different stages, Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel fought for the high level of interpretation in the long-term issue of Mesut Özil.
After the Turkish President strongly criticized the way the former world champion in Germany was dealing with the large ditib mosque in Cologne, the DFB chief defended the association line.
On the early Sunday morning, the Grindel personally attacked by Özil in the Mainz ZDF "Sportstudio" announced consequences from the causa.
"We must draw very precise conclusions in the future - because we also have many players with migration backgrounds in the U-Teams - that something like this is not repeated," said the 57-year-old and wants to win a national player without migration background as a further integration agent.
At the same time, Grindel again stated that Erdogan did not stand for the values of football and DFB.
He had denounced a racism against Özil and Ilkay Gündogan in harsh words.
Our Mesut Özil and our Ilkay, born and raised in Germany.
They excluded them from this society because they had their photos taken with me in England," Erdogan said on Saturday in the cathedral city.
To be honest, I could not digest it as her president that our two young men, who had ascended to the German national team, were excluded.
Grindel referred to Gundogan's statement that, unlike Özil, he felt "reasonable by the DFB" after the World Cup affair, which had started with Erdogan through photos of the two.
At the same time, he announced that he would want to face players in the future.
That someone says, when I win, I'm German, when I lose, I'm a migrant - that's not possible.
"I am very sorry that he has such an impression," said Grindel.
We had to defend Mesut more, I always said that.
However, he does not see a basis for Özil's return to the national team.
As a consequence, an additional integration officer should be appointed in addition to the native Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic, who have family roots in Cameroon.
"If one is clearly involved in society and football without a migration background and says, "The issue is important, then we have to take care of it," that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our clubs on the ground where integration has to work," said Grindel.
Despite the criticism of his person after the World Championships and the Ozil affair, he wants to run again for the office as DFB President next year.
"I do my job and try to do it as well as I can," said Grindel.
Year-old builds three accidents within three hours
Coburg/Rödental - As reported by the police, the 75-year-old caused the accidents on Friday between 10am and 1pm.
First, the 75-year-old driver was approached by a lady at the red traffic light in the area of Lauterer Höhe.
He told the pensioner that he had driven against her car.
However, there was no exchange of personnel since the 75-year-old could no longer find the lady in the parking lot.
A short time later, the police received a telephone message about a driver who had come off the road and driven against a guidepost.
Speaking of this, the man did not want a police officer on the spot and then drove away.
After that, the Rödentaler drove home.
However, the pensioner has been in his place of residence, where he has been living for decades, and has hit a construction vehicle at the turn.
Finally, the police could find him and stop him.
His car had significant accident damage.
The 75-year-old made a confusing impression and couldn't think of much anymore.
The damage is approximately 1300 euros.
Moorbrand in Meppen: Almost 1000 operational staff are still in use.
About four weeks after the outbreak of the Moorbrand on a federal military site in Emsland, 980 workers are still working on the extinguishing work.
This was announced by the Bundeswehr on Sunday.
As the situation of a speaker continues to be stable, 70 volunteers were last withdrawn.
A further reduction in the number of operational staff is planned, it says.
On the night of Sunday, an above ground fire had been discovered and erased.
Last week the disaster had been lifted, which was proclaimed a week earlier on 21 September, because it had been feared that the flames would put adjacent forests and settlements at risk by wind and spark flight.
Thursday it was then called a crossing of the fire to neighbouring communities no longer threatens.
At times, more than 1500 operational forces tried to get the big fire under control on the ground.
The Air Force continues to support the work on the Bundeswehr test site at Meppen with a transport helicopter.
There are also information flights with drones of the Bundeswehr.
According to the Bundeswehr, "Tornados" is also planned for the 2nd and 5th October.
The fire had been triggered by test rockets fired by Airbus technicians.
The smoke flag of the Moorbrand had temporarily moved to Bremen up to a hundred kilometres above the northwest of Germany.
On Monday, the Bundeswehr wants to set up a contact point that receives damage reports.
First claims for damages had already been announced by hoteliers and holiday rental owners.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Johannes Kahrs (SPD, r) and his husband Christoph Rohde leave the main church of St. Katharine in Hamburg after their wedding.
Almost exactly one year after the marriage came into force for all, the politician married his long-time friend in Hamburg.
The two have been a couple for 25 years.
Hamburg - Almost exactly one year after the marriage came into force for all, SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his long-time friend Christoph Rohde.
The two took the jaword on Saturday in Hamburg.
A registered life partnership had not come into question for them, Kahrs had previously said the "picture" newspaper.
If we get married, then right.
He has been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is the budgetary spokesperson of the SPD-Bundestagsfaktion and one of the spokespersons of the Seeheimer Kreis, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening up of marriage to homosexuals, Kahrs had aroused anger on June 30, 2017.
So he had accused Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of having "postulated" on the subject.
"This was your Shabowski moment," he referred to the accidental announcement of the GDR border opening by Günter Schabowski.
Since 1 October 2017, same-sex couples can marry just like heterosexuals.
Previously, they had been able to register their life partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, for example with the right of adoption.
referendum started in Macedonia on new state names
In Macedonia, the expected referendum on a new name for this small Balkan state has begun.
Some 1.8 million voters are to decide whether their state should be called northern Macedonia in the future.
This is because of its northern province of the neighbours of Greece.
For almost three decades, Athens had blocked every approach of Skopje to the EU and NATO.
If the citizens agree, they will also give the start to the Western integration of their country.
Elie Wiesel - The author who saves the Shoah from forgetting
The Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel had become 90 on September 30.

Switzerland launches electronic register for organ donors
The aim of the register is to facilitate organ donation and to relieve people in stressful situations.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs may continue to be removed only with explicit consent, emphasizes Swisstransplant.
(dpa) Switzerland will start an electronic register for organ donors on this Monday.
This should facilitate organ donation and relieve people in stressful situations.
People who want to make their organs available in the event of death can be registered there.
Your wishes are then available in the case of Swisstransplant.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs may continue to be removed - as in Germany - only with explicit consent, emphasizes Swisstransplant.
According to Franz Immer, Director of the Swiss Transplant Foundation, 15 percent of Swiss citizens are expected to have a donor card.
But only in five percent of cases a card was found at the crucial moment in possible donors.
In more than 60 percent of the conversations, the relatives do not know the wish of the deceased.
"You then have to make a representative decision in the sense of the deceased, which is often very stressful," always says.
A similar registration system has already been established in Great Britain.
In Germany, there are considerations to store information on the possible organ donation on the health insurance card, as the spokesman of the Federal Center for Health Education, Marita Völker-Albert says.
"There is no register in which people can enter their wishes - per or versus organ donation," she says.
Federal Health Minister Jens Spahn has voted in favour of a new organ donation regulation.
According to his proposal, each person would first be considered an organ donor, unless he or his or her members object.
Among other things, the Catholic Church rejects this.
14-year-old student is world champion in headcount
The 14-year-old student Tomohiro Iseda from Japan is world champion in the head.
On the weekend in Wolfsburg, he won against 39 competitors.
Martina Flamme-Jasper announced this on Sunday at the Science Museum Phaeno, the venue of the competition.
The 16-year-old Wenzel Greetings from Germany took third place.
The youngest World Cup participant was a twelve-year-old Japanese student, the oldest of whom was a 74-year-old pensioner from France, as Chief referee Ralf Laue said.
The professor of computer science from Zwickau (Saxony) organizes the competition every two years.
For example, previous tasks were: 14.130 214 x 17.981.822 or 57.809.355 + 28 x 16.448.333.
Since spectators were not allowed, there was a show on Saturday afternoon when participants from the audience took part with calculators.
Wenzel Greetings from Lastrup demonstrated how he keeps a ball with his head in the air while calculating.
He is one of seven Germans in the competition.
A total of 82 candidates from more than 20 countries tried to qualify for the competition.
Greetings were given two years ago when he was 14 years old in Bielefeld.
With terms such as super brain, genius or wonder child organizer Laue can start little.
"Construction can be trained," he said.
Many participants practiced several hours a day.
In India or Singapore, there are even stadium-oriented computing competitions.
Among the disciplines, for example, is the square rooting of six-digit numbers.
When calculating versatility, the candidates get surprise tasks for which they need to quickly find a solution strategy.
The Germans also had a good chance here, said the main referee.
Otherwise, Asians are often in favour, because even in early childhood, there are intensive and other effective methods of thinking.
Intrusive appeal: Video with naked Serena Williams: It's about breast cancer early recognition
Tennis-Ass Serena Williams is shown by her emotional and sensitive side.
The 37-year-old wants to point out breast cancer with this video and make himself strong for early detection.
It's about life and death, but it's also about courage and enlightenment.
Serena Williams sings above without the song "I Touch Myself" by the group "The Divinyls" - only her hands cover their most intimate places.
The singer Chrissy Amphlett died from it.
The emotional video is part of the "I Touch Myself" project, in which breast cancer early recognition can save lives.
Serena Williams would have died almost a year ago.
At the birth of her daughter Alexis Olympia, there were complications.
An emergency surgery was initiated to save the baby's life.
In a subsequent CT, blood clots were discovered in Serena's lung.
Just in time...
Government wants to ban more extremist symbols
Vienna - The Federal Government plans to significantly extend the ban on the use of extremist symbols.
Next week, the turquoise-blue coalition will send a corresponding draft law on the so-called "symbol Law" in review.
The aim is to significantly extend the number of terrorist or similar groups covered by the ban.
Polar cold air brings in the west new snow on the mountains
Ms. Holle shakes her beds for the first time in the West next week: Polar cold air reaches Vorarlberg, Nordtirol and Salzburg on Monday.
According to the meteorologists of the Central Institute of Meteorology and Geodynamics (ZAMG), the snowfall limit drops to 1,500 to 1,200 meters at the beginning of the week - in narrow valleys it can snow down to about 1,000 meters with strong intensity, it said.
From Bregenzerwald to the Hohe Tauern is expected to be above 2,000 meters with 20 to 40 centimeters of new snow.
On higher roads (Arlbergpass, Timmelsjö, Bieler Höhe, Brennerpass, Gerlospass, Felbertauern, Großglockner Hochalpenstraße) the road conditions become wintery.
Farmers are allowed to start their annual knick care on Monday.
Schleswig-Holstein's farmers are allowed to start their annual knick care on Monday.
The unique "green walls" in Germany have shaped the landscape of the forest-poor federal state for about 200 years.
The tree and stump hedges up to five metres wide are "forest replacement" and the last retreat rooms for many animals and plants.
Knicks combine as a corridor scattered habitats, over which the exchange of organisms can still work, as the managing director of the Nature Conservation Association Germany (NABU) in Schleswig-Holstein, Ingo Ludwichowski, said.
Knicks are living fences
The Knicks were constructed on the basis of an order by the Danish king Christian VI in 1766, who ruled Schleswig-Holstein.
The "living fences" were not only field boundary and cattle fence, they also supplied the farmer with firewood and beams for their timber houses.
From that time his name "Knick" also came: By "circling" the branches could develop the dense, intertwined boundaries.
Today, between the North Sea and the Baltic Sea, some 45 000 kilometres of the hedges extend and give the image of a wooded, diverse landscape.
According to NABU, they are now used as a spare habitat by around 7000 species.
In one kilometer of Knick, up to 1800 different species could live and breed up to 30 pairs of birds.
However, its ecologically important function can only be fulfilled if it is maintained accordingly in winter.
Otherwise, he is weakening into a light tree line that, in addition to biodiversity, also loses the wind protection effect, said Ludwichowski.
According to the Ministry of Agriculture, knick care may only be provided outside the breeding period from October to March.
After Tsunami on Sulawesi Indonesia talks about local situation
In an interview with the editorial network Germany (RND), the local Radika Pinto describes the situation on the island of Sulawesi after the earthquakes and the tsunami:
Were you there during the tsunamis yourself?
No, I was just in Jakarta on the island of Java.
When the earthquakes were, my wife called me, she was in Palu.
When I learned about the tsunami, I immediately went back to Sulawesi.
I arrived on Sunday morning because after a flight I had to drive for more than 20 hours because the airport on Palu was closed at the time.
What's the situation on the island like now?
The national government has reopened the airport so that relief goods can also be flown in.
When I arrived, I saw the houses on the coast, all completely destroyed.
Our office of "World Vision" is also destroyed, but we have provisionally set up something where we have also accommodated other people.
Where are the people living on Sulawesi now?
Many have run on surrounding hills where they are still afraid of another tsunami and earthquake and where they have no access to water and food.
Some stay in front of their homes, there are still aftershocks.
Because many grocery stores and also the gas stations are completely closed, people steal food and gasoline in part.
The public service has been completely shut down and the national government is helping out.
A prison has also been destroyed, the prisoners are partly free and the search for them is difficult.
There are still many bodies around, many people have not yet been found and are missing.
How is communication and information provision on the island going?
At the moment we received mobile phones, but before that it didn't work and we only got information on the radio.
Many people are still looking for their children, neighbors and other people, of whom they do not know whether they live or where they are, because people were not at home during the earthquake, but were on the move, for example, at work.
The tsunami warning system has not worked properly.
Do you have any information?
We don't know the reasons, but when the warning came, many thought "okay, no tsunami" - and then he came.
In other regions not hit by the tsunami, there was misinformation that a tsunami hit the region and they ran to the surrounding mountains.
Is not an island like Sulawesi, located on the Pacific fire ring, prepared for earthquakes?
Yes, there are earthquakes every day, but this was the worst.
We usually know how we react to earthquakes and also train evacuations.
But the complete infrastructure has collapsed, the earthquake has hit a lot of people.
Muscle injury against Werder: VfB must refrain from Aogo and Donis for a long time
Anastasios Donis and Dennis Aogo will be missing the VfB Stuttgart with severe muscle injuries for a long time.
At 2:1 against Werder Bremen on Saturday, Aogo attracted a muscle fiber crack in the back left thigh, the football leaguer announced on Sunday.
In Donis, the doctors diagnosed a muscle bundle rupture in the thigh.
Both players are definitely no option against Hannover 96 on Saturday and will probably miss games even after the next break.
The VfB Stuttgart did not provide a forecast of the downtime.
A muscle bundle rupture usually heals within six to eight weeks, a muscle fiber crack usually heals a little faster.
Triumph of Hyperrealism at the San Sebástian Film Festival
San Sebastián - With the film festival of San Sebastián, the series of the most prestigious European festivals close each year.
In spite of all the tunes to the cinema, it can be summed up: 2018 was a remarkable year for the film.
After a convincing competition in Cannes, especially with strong contributions from Europe and Asia and a Venice that was able to attract a lot of attention with Oscar candidates from Hollywood, San Sebastian also delivered one of his best competitions in recent years.
On Sunday morning, the Olching Fire Department tried to capture an injured duck.
However, the action continued for some time.
Even a boat was used.
Olching - Walkers at Lake Olchinger noticed a white, injured duck on Sunday morning.
She stayed in the water guard station.
To help the animal, the passersby called the police and the fire department.
However, the first attempts to catch the duck went wrong.
Despite the injury, she was able to divert the operational forces over and over again.
In the end, she fled to the lake.
With a lifeboat, the fire department could circle the animal and push it back to land, where it was then inserted into a transport box after almost an hour by a fireman with a hardened handle.
The duck injured at the chest was then taken to the animal clinic of the LMU to Oberschleißheim.
But according to the first estimates, their chances of survival are rather low.
Biathlete Julian Eberhard ranks WM-Medal
==References====External links==* Official website
In the coming winter, the Saalfeldener will pick up the missing precious metal at the World Cup in Östersund.
The last shot cost the 31-year-old in the Olympia Sprint of Pyeongchang to grab near the medal.
Seven tenths of a second were missing on bronze at the end.
"I deliberately took the time to process this," says Eberhard at the opening of the MyGym gym in his home town of Saalfelden.
A medal was the goal, I was in top shape, but it just didn't want to be.
The Pinzgauer is all the more motivated to pick up the missing precious metal in the new season: "The goal can only be to come back to a big event with the Constitution, to win something.
Someday you'll have to strike, too.
The WM-Loipe in Östersund (SWE) is located Eberhard: "I have already closed the track to the heart," he remembers with joy his fourth World Cup place in the single race last year.
Immediately after Olympia, he celebrated the only single victory for Austria in the World Cup Winter in Kontiolahti (FIN).
With the season he ran in Oslo (NOR) in second place.
Brett Kavanaugh: FBI investigation in the turbot tempo
The time is extremely short and the number of planned hearings is very limited.
With an FBI investigation at the Turbottempo, the Republicans in the U.S. Senate are trying to secure a very thin majority for the judge candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who has been disputed for advocacy.
President Donald Trump has set a deadline for the investigators to investigate the alleged incidents that have occurred over 30 years ago.
The recent turn in the drama around Kavanaugh's appeal, accompanied by a cultural struggle, had been triggered on Friday.
After an eight-hour hearing of Kavanaugh and the first prosecutor Christine Blasey Ford, in whose course the lawyer cast angry tirades against the opposition Democrats, the Senate's Committee of Justice should pave the way for the final confirmation of the ore-conservative judge at the Supreme U.S. Supreme Court.
The majority of Republicans seemed secure when Senator Jeff Flake suddenly declared against his original announcement that he would agree, but demanded an FBI investigation.
After tumultuous scenes, his party friends agreed.
President Trump, who had still called the serious reservations on Thursday as "Decision", initially contained further attacks on women and spoke on the contrary of "luck in misfortune".
In this way, he said, the last doubt could be resolved.
Later, at an election rally, Trump attacked the Democrats sharply because they reject Kavanaugh: "They are trying to block and destroy".
Trump arranges FBI investigation in Kavanaugh case
The White House has also extremely limited the investigators' powers.
One would specifically investigate the known accusations of two women, no more, a government representative said to the Wall Street Journal: "They are not going on a fishing trip".
According to the New York Times, only four witnesses are to be heard.
According to the municipality, the mobile radar equipment installed in a "civil vehicle" of the municipality of Ried for monitoring the tempo limit is stationed on the Gartenstraße starting on Monday, 1 October.
There is also the Federal School Centre.
The municipality also operates several installed radar boxes.
FC Schalke 04 after victory against Mainz: One felt the fear
Trainer Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated the first season victory against Mainz.
The relief on Schalke is great after the first season victory.
Nevertheless, the factor Time also played a role against Mainz.
Gelsenkirchen - It is now well known that Christian Heidel is a huge pessimist in football games.
This was no different in the home game against Mainz 05.
"I've seen every ball in there.
And there were many corners and many balls in our penalty room," said Schalke's Sports Board 04 - and breathed away.
After all, the royal blues had succeeded in bringing the scarce 1:0 against the Rheinhessen over time and thus the first season victory under roof and compartment.
In fact, this could have been different.
After the leadership by Alessandro Schöpf 11th of the team of head coach Domenico Tedesco had given security: "In total, the first half was good, both playful and from the pressing.", with increasing playing time, Tedesco obviously played more and more of the head.
Don't be a head-ball monster, actually.
"The last ten minutes have felt like two hours for me," said Heidel: "If the team was only half as nervous as I was on the bench, I can understand that."
The boys were afraid to give it out of their hands and therefore withdrew.
And defend against Mainz with man and mouse.
To save the first three counters of the season.
"We all liked a huge stone from the heart," said Schöp, who had no insignificant part in it with his headball hit: "I am actually the worst headball player in the man-made world."
But in the end, only victory counts.
The relief was felt throughout the arena, of course also at Tedesco.
"We wanted to get started in the initial phase and make a fireworks out of it," said Schalke's chief coach.
The victory was important.
Finally, we can enjoy a few hours.
I'm very, very happy for the team and the fans.
We've played intelligently, quietly and courageously, so we have to play games over 90 minutes.
Probably the biggest deficit of the afternoon: Royal Blue missed it, rather for clearer conditions to worry about.
The possibilities were finally there, for example through the strong Yevhen Konpplyanka, which twice hit the latte 59./72. or Amine Harit 62.
"Then it wouldn't have been a victorious victory," said Tedesco: "You've already felt the fear a little bit."
That's why I'm glad we won.
He wasn't the only scarf.
Fischbachau: Smoke column in the Leitzachtal 2 km visible
The smoke was not to be overlooked.
From about two kilometres away, a hiker in the Leitzachtal observed a fire at about 13.30 a.m. on Sunday.
Now the police are investigating.
Fischbachau - The cause soon found out police and fire department: An unknown person had lit garbage on a two square meter surface at Gschwendner Berg.
According to the police, it seemed as if he had watched the fire for a longer time, but then left the fire unsupervised.
And that's close to the forest.
30 Fischbachauer firefighters were busy pulling apart and clearing.
The police are now investigating arson.
Prof. Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani discusses integration: A discussion at eye level
In front of them is the author, Professor Aladin El-Mafaalani.
He has repeatedly followed the invitation of Ernst Reiling and Lore Hauschild.
"I have made it my duty to bring interesting people to Greven for many years," explains the founder and chairman of the "Reckenfelder Treffs" - the association that cooperates with the alliance "culture policy" in the orientation of the evening.
El-Mafaalani enters the reading very easily, describes the writing process of the book, talks about how difficult it was to explain the subject in an understandable way.
With a lot of gestures, tangible figures, and one or the other joke, he brings the audience closer to one of the most conflicting topics: migration and integration.
Why, despite successful integration, are conflicts emerging?
The Syrian author uses the question of a metaphor to answer.
At one table the German society sits, at the cat's table the migrants of the first generation.
Their children grow up in Germany and want to go to the table.
The third generation of migrants was born in Germany, they always sat at the big table and now want to vote.
That leads to conflict.
Therefore, it is not crucial whether one is politically to the right or to the left, but rather: " am I in favour of or against an open society?" he emphasizes.
At first behave rather, then the discussion round starts more and more.
And there is a need for speech.
From his perspective, an Afghan refugee tells two teachers how they see successful or unsuccessful integration among students.
El-Mafaalani stands out, not on stage, a symbol for the discussion: she is at eye level.
The sociology professor does not urge his opinion, emphasizes that he speaks of the average, not of individual fates.
He is pleased that there is interest in the subject, because "first, if we understand what the problem is, we can find solutions," says El-Mafaalani.
Even during the subsequent signing hour, he still had an open ear to the questions of the guests and was also in the foyer, with prepared Kurdish specialities, intensively discussed further.
Basketball: Bonn and casting win kickoffs
The Giessen 46ers and the Telekom Baskets Bonn have finished the first day of the basketball Bundesliga (BBL) with a home and an away victory.
Gießen competed in a hard-hitting game in his own hall with 91:84 (43:46) against the Central German BC.
The ambitious Bonners won at the BG Göttingen with 86:79 (49:47).
The first table leader of the season is Alba Berlin after the 112:55 gala on Saturday against Science City Jena.
Much more effort was made at the beginning of the new season by German champion Bayern Munich and former serial champion Brose Bamberg.
Munich already worked on a 83:77 on Friday at ratiopharm Ulm, Bamberg won the Frankenderby on Saturday at s.Oliver Würzburg with 84:80.
Construction in Landsham: 100 applications for 20 properties
The need is obviously huge: over 100 interested parties have applied for the purchase of one of the properties in Landsham South.
The municipality of Pliening has sold the first plots in the new Landsham-South area on the free market.
That's what Mayor Roland Frick says.
In addition, the application phase is completed for the 20 plots offered by the municipality on cheaper terms and prices - similar to the previous local model.
According to Frick, well over 100 applications had been received.
"The documents are currently being examined", with regard to the application criteria, completeness and correctness.
According to the mayor of Plieninger, the aim is to have the candidate ranking list for the 20 plots by the end of the year and to submit them to the council.
After that, the award could be made.
A total of 50 plots are created on the area in the south of Landsham for single and double houses and four areas for multi-family houses with an expected total of eight housing units.
The development is now almost complete, the roads and roads will soon be paved.
A single plot and two of the multifamily houses belong to a private person, the rest of the municipality of Pliening.
It sells the majority on the free market, 20 plots in a socially compatible model.
According to Frick, the two multifamily houses of the municipality are to be built as affordable living space.
With a total of 16 dwellings funded by the Free State, income-oriented.
Place for 200 people
Roughly estimated is created on the area of the new Landsham-South residential area for about 200 people.
Not only that: According to Frick, now, at the beginning of October, the start for the new construction of a day care centre takes place there.
Three nursery and three crib groups, as well as a multipurpose room, are to be accommodated.
The opening is scheduled for September 2019, to start the next kindergarten year.
Schalkes Naldo "great sport" succeeds also on the bank
For the third time in a row not in the startelf: Nevertheless, Naldo thanks to Schalke-Trainer Domenico Tedesco.
Gelsenkirchen - After Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues spent the third time in a row not in the Schalker Startelf, but on the exchange bench, understanding would have been great for many people if the almost two-meter-large Brazilian would have been talking about the frustration of the soul.
But after the 1:0 victory over the FSV Mainz 05, the Schalker players gathered in the middle circle as usual and thanked Head Coach Domenico Tedesco for all his professionals, the 36-year-old, all of whom call Naldo for simplicity, turned in and said: "We have to thank coach!"
"That was very emotional, that was great sport," Tedesco later said about the reaction of his vice captain, who, despite his reservisting existence, had no grudge whatsoever.
Probably Naldo, who was celebrated as the best jacker in the past season, knows that he did not actually get on the bus with his coach - but is given a break for good reasons.
A reason called "load control".
It wasn't easy to tell him that.
"It wasn't easy to tell him that, I tell you honestly," said Tedesco about the moment he told Naldo that he wasn't in the startel.
He's an important player, he's an important person.
But it's always about the thing, it's about the club," Tedesco explained the step.
Naldo played against Bavaria and Porto for 90 minutes.
He's 36 years old.
It's important that everyone can get caught up in this.
And that we all keep in the boat," Tedesco explained the rotation, which last caught Naldo.
And that the Brazilians responded to with the wisdom of their advanced age: by also proving himself on the bank as an exemplary team player.
The mood in Austria's industry continued to accelerate its descent in August compared to the Eurozone.
The shopping manager index (PMI) was at a 37-month low with 46.7 points.
However, Austria has the third best mood in Europe behind Ireland and the Netherlands, the Markit Institute announced its survey of 3,000 companies on Monday.
Unlike in Austria, the PMI of the Euro-Zone increased by 1.1 to 45.1 points, so the index is still the 13th month in a row under the brand of 50 counters, which indicates growth.
Only Ireland's industry broke this threshold with 50.9 points in August.
Finally, the Greeks (42.1 points).
In Germany, France and Spain, the mood barometer decreased, but slower than in the previous months.
In Spain, the index reached its highest level at 44.0 points since March.
"The slightly weakened downhill trip could mean that the worst is over," said Markit economist Rob Dobson.
But industry - in the third quarter at least - remains growth brake number one.
A rapid return to the growth zone is not in sight: export orders in the eurozone have fallen as strongly as they have since November 2011.
The companies therefore built up jobs for the seventh month in a row.
Industrial production in China also fell more strongly than initially assumed in August.
The mood barometer dropped from 49,3 points in the previous month to 47,6 points.
Experts had initially expected 47.8 points.
The Purchasing Managers Index is based on representative surveys of 3,000 European industrial companies.
Among other things, the developments in sales, employment, stocks and prices are being raised.
Tuchel's PSG team succeeds behind victory in the eighth league game
29 September 2018 at 19:45
Nice Trainer Thomas Tuchel is racing with Paris Saint-Germain in France's football championship from Sieg to Sieg.
At the OGC Nice, the title defender won two hits by Superstar Neymar with 3:0 (1:0) and was also successful in the eighth league.
Most recently, Olympique Lyon in France put such a good start to the season 82 years ago.
The Brazilian Neymar led the PSG after 22 minutes and produced the final score in the playtime.
Christopher Nkunku (46th) provided the 2:0 in the meantime.
Paris also passed the general test for the groundbreaking second Champions League group game against Red Star Belgrade on Wednesday.
At the 2:3 in Liverpool, Tuchel's team had had to accept the only compulsory game defeat this season.
