Members of the National Assembly for Wales fear confusion with the Muppets
In the case of some members of the National Assembly, the proposal to change their title to 'MWP' (Member of the Welsh Parliament, member of the Welsh Parliament) is a stumbling block.
This is due to plans to change the name of the National Assembly to 'Welsh Parliament' (Welsh Parliament).
National Assembly members of all political directions are afraid to become the target of the mockery.
A member of the National Assembly of the Labour Party said that his group is concerned because the name is “with Twp” and “Pwp”.
For non-Welsh readers: In Welsh, "twp" stands for "doof" and "pwp" for "Aa".
A National Assembly member of the Plaid Cymru party stated that the whole group was "not happy" and proposed alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said that his group was open to the change of name, but pointed out the great similarity between "MWP" and "Muppet".
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced similar to the letter u in the English spoken in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission (National Assembly Committee), which is currently drafting a law on name changes, said: "The final decision on the names of the members of the National Assembly is of course up to the members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act of 2017 authorised the Welsh National Assembly to change its name.
In June, the Board published the results of a public consultation on the proposals which gave wide support to the name 'Welsh Parliament' for the National Assembly.
With regard to the title of members of the National Assembly, the Welsh Parliament Members (WMPs) or the WMPs, while at a public hearing the option "MWP" was given the greatest support.
National Assembly members seem to propose alternative options, but the struggle for consensus could be a problem for President Elin Jones, who is due to present a draft law within weeks.
The Law on Reforms will include further changes to the functioning of the National Assembly, including rules on the disqualification of National Assembly members and on the organisation of the Committee system.
The members of the National Assembly may vote definitively on their names in their debate on the law.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on a change in the country name
The voters decide on Sunday whether the name of their country should be changed to 'Northern Macedonia Republic'.
The referendum was set to settle a decade-long dispute with the neighbouring Greece, which has a province with the similar name Macedonia.
Athens has been insisting for a long time that the name of its northern neighbour means that this claim is raised to the Greek territory and has repeatedly opposed its accession to the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the referendum on the change of name, said he would not accept the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change of name is the price to be paid for accession to the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's keep silent in the face of the difficulties of the churches in Harlem
"The old people I talked to said that in the past there was a bar and a church at every corner," said Adams.
"There is no more both of them today."
He said that the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
"People's social life looks different today," he said.
"Bars are no longer the living room of the neighborhood in which people regularly appear."
With the churches he fears that the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as the leaders of the churches assume and that they will "be back in the beginning sooner or later".
Churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment houses with condominiums where people live who do not support the remaining refuges.
"The overwhelming majority of people who buy condominiums in these buildings will be white," he said, "and thus speed up the complete closure of these churches, since it is unlikely that most of the people who move into these condominiums will become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white communities before Harlem became a black metropolis: Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original White Methodist community moved out in the 1930s.
A black community that held its services nearby became the owner of the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black community under Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, a large shopping street in Harlem who refused to hire or support blacks.
At a fire in 1939, the building was severely damaged, but when Johnson's parishioners planned to rebuild it, they ordered the bellplay.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor in St. Martin's, proudly described the bellplay as "the bells of the poor".
The expert who rang the bell in July used other words: 'A cultural treasure' and 'an irreplaceable historical instrument'.
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the world's first bell game played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who had changed to the larger bell game in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said he was not replaced by St. Martin's.
What has been happening in St. Martin's in recent months is a complicated story with architects and contractors, who have been attracted in part by the lay leaders of the Church and in part by the Episcopal Diocese.
In July, the municipal board of directors, consisting of lay leaders, expressed written concerns to the diocese that the diocese would try to pass the costs on to the municipal council, although it had not been involved in commissioning the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complain of a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark wounded in California 13-year-olds diving for Lobstern
In California, on Saturday, the first day of the Lobster season, a shark officially attacked a 13-year-old boy diving for Lobstern.
The attack took place just before 7:00 p.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
As Chad Hammel told the broadcaster KSWB-TV in San Diego, he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy's cries for help and paddled to the boy with several others to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel said he thought the boy was happy to have caught a praiser at first. But then he realized that the boy was screaming, "I was bitten!
I've been bitten!"
When hammel arrived at the boy, he noticed that his entire collarbone was torn apart.
“I shouted that everyone should come out of the water: ‘There is a shark in the water!’” added Hammel.
The boy was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and is in critical condition.
The type of shark responsible for the attack was not known.
Rescue swimmer Captain Larry Giles told the media that a few weeks earlier a shark had been seen in the area. However, it was concluded that it was not a dangerous shark.
Giles added that the victim had suffered traumatic injuries in the upper body area.
Officials blocked the access of Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Encinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security reasons.
According to Giles, there are over 135 sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's Plan to Advance the Cosmetic Market in the United Kingdom
Sainsbury's attacks with cosmetic departments that are looking for department stores, which are occupied with specialized assistants, boats, superdrugs and debenhams.
As part of a major advance to the UK's 2.8 billion UK pound comprehensive cosmetics market, which continues to grow as fashion and household goods sales decline, the larger cosmetics departments will be tested in eleven branches nationwide. If they prove successful, they will be expanded to further branches next year.
The investment in cosmetics coincides with the search of supermarkets for opportunities to use other store space previously used for television sets, microwaves and household goods.
According to Sainsbury's report, the scope of its cosmetic offering doubles for the first time to up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Also existing series of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees receive more space and brand areas similar to those in shops such as boats.
In addition, the supermarket is relaunching its “Boutique” makeup series, so that most of the products are vegan friendly – an aspect that is increasingly demanded by younger customers.
In addition, the perfume dealer Fragrance Shop will test in two Sainsbury's branch sales outlets. The first sales outlet was opened last week in Croydon in the south of London, and a second will be opened further this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Online shopping and the transition to the daily purchase of small food quantities in local grocery stores mean that supermarkets need to do more to get customers to visit them.
According to Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, the sales outlets will increasingly look like department stores, as the supermarket chain is trying to fight against the discounter Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food articles.
Since the purchase of the Argos and Habitat chains two years ago, Sainsbury's has established hundreds of Argos sales outlets and a number of Habitat sales outlets. This has increased food sales as well as the profitability of the acquisitions.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to reorganize its cosmetics and pharmacy departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with boats in the early 2000s, but ended after a dispute over the distribution of revenues from the drug dealer's branches in the supermarkets.
The new strategy follows Sainsbury's sale of its 281 branch pharmaceutical business to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million pounds three years ago.
The company indicated that Lloyds will play a role in the plan insofar as an extended range of luxury skin care brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy is added in four branches.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director at Sainsbury's, said: "We have transformed the appearance of our cosmetics departments to create a more attractive environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who are available as consultants.
Our brand range is tailored to all needs. Due to its seductive environment and low-cost locations, we are now an attractive destination for cosmetic purchases that challenge the previous type of shopping."
Peter Jones "angering" after Holly Willoughby's withdrawal from a business worth 11 million pounds
"Dragons" Den" star Peter Jones is "enraged" after TV moderator Holly Willoughby withdrew from a business worth 11 million pounds with his lifestyle brand company to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for the common homewear and accessory brand True.
The business of the two was compared to Gwyneth Paltrows brand Goop.
The "This Morning" modernist, 37, announced her withdrawal from Instagram.
Holly Willoughby angered “Dragons” Den” star Peter Jones by their very short-term withdrawal from their lucrative lifestyle brand company to focus on their own new connection agreements with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Jones is said to have been “angered” when the “Golden Girl” of television at a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, admitted to not being able to devote enough time to the common homewear and accessories brand True due to its new business – worth up to 1.5 million pounds.
The company was compared to Gwyneth Paltrows' Goop brand and would have probably doubled Willoughby's estimated assets of 11 million pounds.
While Willoughby, 37, announced her withdrawal from True at Instagram, Jones left Britain on the way to one of his holiday homes.
One source said: “Truly had by far the highest priority for Holly.
It should secure its future over the next decades for them in the long term.
Their decision to withdraw was completely surprising for all concerned.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, just before the launch of the market.
At the headquarters in Marlow, a warehouse full of goods is waiting to be sold."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of this Morning moderator, one of the most promising stars in the UK, could cost the company millions due to high investment in products from pillows and candles to clothing and homewear and possible further delays in market entry.
Moreover, it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, mother of three children, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded True in 2016 with Capp, and Jones, 52, was added as chairman in March.
The couples spend the holiday together, and Jones holds a 40 percent share in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby is to become a trademark ambassador for M&S and replace Ant McPartlin as a moderator of the I'm A Celebrity ITV broadcast.
A Jones-related source said last night: "We don't comment on his business affairs."
Hard words 'and then we fell in love'
He joked about the criticism he expected of the news media for a comment that some would consider to be 'non-presidential' and for such positive comments about the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said following the voice of a news moderator:
"I haven't given up anything."
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting, as the first meeting in Singapore in June was praised by Trump as a major step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
However, the denucleation negotiations have been stepped up.
Over three months after the June summit in Singapore, Ri Yong Ho, the top diplomat of North Korea, said to leading politicians from all over the world on Saturday at the UN General Assembly that the North does not see a "correspondent response" from the US to North Korea's first disarmament measures.
Instead, he noted that the United States was holding to sanctions to maintain the pressure.
Trump proved much more optimistic in his rallying speech.
"We are very successful with North Korea," he said.
“We were facing a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have this great relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim showed positive results: end of rocket tests, support in the release of hostages and return of the mortal remains of American military personnel.
He also defended his unusual way of talking about the relationship with Kim.
"It is so easy to be presidential, but instead of 10,000 people standing outside trying to get into this crowded arena, about 200 people would be standing here," said Trump, pointing out the crowd right in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquakes devastated an island in Indonesia and cost hundreds of lives
For example, after Lombok's earthquake, foreign non-governmental organizations were said not to be needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok were displaced, no national emergency was declared a condition for mobilising international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it very clear that they are not demanding international support, so that's a little difficult," said Sumbung.
While Save the Children is putting together a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet certain whether foreign employees can work on site.
Sutopo, spokesperson of the Civil Protection Authority, said that Indonesian officials assessed the situation in Palu as to whether international agencies should participate in the relief measures.
In view of the earthquakes that Indonesia has to contend with constantly, the country is still unfortunately badly prepared for natural violence.
While tsunami shelters were built in Aceh, these are not an everyday sight on other coastal strips.
The apparently missing Tsunami warning in Palu, despite a warning, has probably contributed to the deaths.
Travel between Indonesia's numerous islands is already a challenge in the optimal case.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A ship stationed in Lombok for the treatment of earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but will reach the place of the new disaster at the earliest in three days.
President Joko Widodo has made the improvement of the affected Indonesian infrastructure the core of his election campaign and has spent plenty of money on roads and railways.
However, the government of the Joko seeking re-election next year is suffering from financial deficits.
In addition, Joko is under pressure because of continuing religious tensions in Indonesia. Members of the Muslim majority there practice a more conservative form of faith.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were driven out of their homes and homes when bands from Christians and Muslims fought on the streets with macheter, arrow and bow as well as other primitive weapons.
View: Liverpools Daniel Sturridge achieves deep compensation against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool on Saturday at the London Stamford Bridge Stadium with a hit in the 89th minute before a Premier League loss against Chelsea.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri at 0:1 arrears of his team about 27 meters away from the gate of Chelsea.
He aimed the ball to the left and then shot it towards the rear post.
The shot sailed high above the penalty area and drifted into the upper right corner of the net.
Finally, the ball fell over the jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and then into the net.
“I just tried to get into this position and get to the ball. Players like Shaq always play as much forward as possible, so I just tried to make as much time as possible for myself,” said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante coming and had a contact with the ball. I didn’t think too much about it and just took the shot.”
After a hit in the 25th minute, Chelsea led by the Belgian star Eden Hazard to half time with 1:0.
The Blues storm gave a pass with the heel back to Mateo, then turned off near the middle field and sprinted into the Liverpool half.
Kovacic played a fast double pass in the middle field.
Then he shot a good steep pass so that Hazard got into the penalty room.
Hazard left the defenders behind and closed the net with a left shot at Liverpools Alisson Becker.
Liverpool plays at the group stage of the Champions League on Wednesday at 3:00 p.m. in the Stadium San Paolo in Naples.
Chelsea is facing the UEFA Europa League Videoton on Thursday at 3:00 p.m. in London.
The number of victims of Tsunamis in Indonesia increases to 832
The number of victims of the earthquake and the Tsunamis in Indonesia has increased to 832, as the Civil Protection Authority announced on Sunday morning.
Many people are said to have been trapped in the ruins of buildings that had been overthrown by the earthquake of magnitude 7.5 on Friday, which had triggered waves up to six metres high, reported the official spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho in a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered with the ruins of collapsed buildings.
Police arrest a man, 32, on suspicion of murder after a woman has been stabbed
After the discovery of a female body this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside, a murder investigation was initiated.
The 44-year-old was found at 7:55 with stab wounds in Grayson Mews on John Street. A 32-year-old man was arrested for murder.
The police ask the residents to report if they have seen or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in an early phase, but I would ask everyone who has stayed near John Street in Birkenhead and has seen or heard something suspicious to contact us.
I also ask all persons, especially taxi drivers, who may have taken something with a Dashcam to contact us. They may have information that is of the utmost importance for our investigation."
A police officer confirmed that the woman whose body was found lived in Birkenhead and was found in a building.
This afternoon, friends who believe in the woman have arrived at the crime scene to find out where she was found this morning.
The investigation was ongoing, and the police informed that she was in the process of informing the next members of the victim.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews just tried to get to his apartment, but was informed by the police that no one can enter or leave the building.
He was speechless when he learned what had happened.
The residents are now informed that it will take hours for them to re-enter the building.
It was heard that a police officer told a man that now the entire area is being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared in tears dissolved at the place of the event.
She repeats again and again, 'that is so terrible'.
At 2 p.m. there were two police vehicles inside the lockdown and another vehicle before the lockdown.
Within the lockdown were several police officers who monitored the housing block.
Persons who have information are asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call number 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously under number 0800 555 111 and refer to protocol entry 247 of 30 September.
The Cromwell statue in front of Parliament will be the newest monument to the dispute over the rewriting of history
Their exile would be poetic justice for the destruction of so many of England's cultural and religious art products by its fanatical Puritan supporters.
The Cromwell Society, however, described Crick's proposal as 'toreth' and 'trying to rewrite history'.
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of statues that Oliver Cromwell’s statue was the target of the palace of Westminster.
The picture tower in the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestral Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent portrayal of Cromwell is proof of the 19th century's opinion and part of the historical writing of a figure that many still think is worth celebrating.
Goldsmith said to the Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is seen by many, perhaps at the end of the 19th century more than today, as defending the parliament from outside pressure, in his case of course by the monarchy.
Whether this is an entirely true representation is the subject of ongoing historical debates.
It is certain that the conflict formed the subsequent development of our nation in the middle of the 17th century, and Cromwell is a single recognizable figure that represents one side of this gap.
His services as Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and remembering."
Killer pig bites Chinese farmers to death
According to local media reports, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in southwestern China.
The man, to whom only the last name was called "Yuan", was found dead with a blood-flowing artery near a pig stable on the market in Liupanshui in Guizhou Province, South China reported Morning Post on Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer in Xining, Qinghai Province, China, is ready to inject pigs vaccines.
He was reported to have arrived on Wednesday with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead and saw that a door to a neighboring pighouse was open.
He said that in the stable there was a large male pig with blood on the snout.
According to the report, a forensic investigation confirmed that the 250-kilo pig had bitten the farmers to death.
"The legs of my cousin were bloody and mutilated," was quoted by Guiyang Evening News, the cousin to whom the surname "Wu".
Photographs of a security camera showed how Yuan entered the market on Thursday at 4:40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was neither Yuan nor his cousin.
A market manager told the Evening News that the pig had been detained to prevent attacks on other people while the police at the crime scene collected evidence.
Yuan's family and the market authorities are negotiating reports of compensation for his death.
It is rare that pigs attack people, but such cases are known.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at her farm in Massachusetts. The man suffered serious injuries.
Ten years ago, a 290-kilo pig trapped a Welsh farmer between himself and a tractor until the farmer's wife could hide the animal.
After a farmer was eaten by his pigs in Oregon in 2012, a man from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs were not usually aggressive, but the taste of blood could act as a "trigger".
“They’re just playful.
They like to quiver and are very curious ... they are not bent on hurting someone.
You just have to treat them with the right degree of respect," he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa bring widespread strong rain in the southwest of the USA
As forecast, Hurricane Rosa is weakening on the way over the colder waters on the north coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will bring floods of rain in northern Mexico and the southwest of the United States.
On Sunday at 5:00 o'clock east coast time, Rosa recorded wind speeds of 136 km/h, corresponding to a Category 1 hurricane, and was 620 kilometers southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, over the Pacific, a trough begins to form that moves east to the west coast of the USA. When Rosa reaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, high tropical humidity is transported north to the southwest of the US.
On Monday, Rosa will cause precipitation in parts of Mexico up to 25 centimeters.
Then, in the days to come, the tropical moisture creates strong rainfall in the south-west by interacting with the absorbing trough.
Locally, 2.5 to 10 centimetres of precipitation can cause dangerous floods, flooding in the water, and possibly landslides in the desert.
High tropical humidity leads to precipitation rates of almost 5 to 7.5 centimetres per hour, especially in parts of the south of Nevada and Arizona.
In the southwest, especially in a large part of Arizona, up to 5 to 10 centimeters of precipitation is expected.
Due to the dispersion of tropical rainfall there is the possibility of floods with rapidly deteriorating conditions.
In the face of the threat of tropical rainfall, walking into the desert is strongly discouraged.
Strong rainfall can cause the canyons to become raging currents, and thunderstorms bring local wind and wind that brings the dust with them.
The nearby trough brings strong rain in parts of the coast of Southern California.
Total precipitation of more than one centimetre may be possible, which can lead to a small amount of water-moving debris and smooth roads.
This would be the first rainfall in this region.
The first isolated tropical rain showers reach Arizona on Sunday evening and Monday morning. On Monday evening and Tuesday it rains widely.
On Tuesday strong rain spreads into the Four Corners region and lasts on Wednesday.
In October, strong temperature fluctuations are possible throughout the United States, as the Arctic cools down while the tropics remain relatively warm.
This sometimes leads to drastic temperature differences over short distances.
On Sunday, there is a good example of dramatic temperature differences in the middle of the United States.
Between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, as well as between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, there is a temperature difference of almost 12 oC.
In the next few days, the continuous summer heat tries to develop and expand again.
For a large part of the middle and east of the US, a warm beginning of October is expected with widespread temperatures of 27 oC from the Southern Plains to parts of the Northeast.
New York City could reach 27 oC on Tuesday, which is about 6 degrees above the average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a high probability of above-average temperatures in the first half of October in the East of the USA.
Over 20 million spectators have seen the hearing of Brett Kavanaugh
Over 20 million viewers saw on Thursday at six television networks the captivating statements of the Board of Kavanaugh nominated for the Supreme Court and the woman, Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual abuse in the 1980s.
In the meantime, the political situation continued. On Friday, the TV stations interrupted their regular program due to a last-minute turn: an agreement negotiated by Jeff Flake, Senator from Arizona, according to which the FBI is to conduct a one-week investigation of the allegations.
Ford told the Senate's judicial committee to be 100% sure that Kavanaugh had been drunk at a high school party, harassed her and tried to remove her clothes.
Kavanaugh said in a passionate statement that he was 100% sure that this had not happened.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million spectators reported by Nielsen have seen the hearing.
The company determined the average audience numbers at CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
For other networks such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network that had broadcasted the hearing, the numbers were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen usually has problems measuring audience numbers in offices.
To get this into the right perspective: This is roughly equivalent to the number of spectators at a play-off football game or at the Oscar ceremony.
According to Nielsen, the Fox News Channel, whose opinion-oriented moderators strongly support the nomination of Kavanaughs, recorded the highest numbers of all networks with an average of 5.69 million spectators at the whole day hearing.
ABC came second with 3.26 million spectators.
CBS reportedly had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million spectators.
The interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in the drama of Friday.
After publishing a statement by the moderate Republican office that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was filmed on Friday morning by cameras from CNN and CBS, as protesters loudly urged him on the way to a hearing of the Justice Committee.
He stood for minutes with a lowered view while he was being trained. The scene was broadcast live at CNN.
"I'm right here in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you believe that he tells the country the truth?"
"They have power while so many women are powerless," said one woman.
Flake said his office had published a statement and supplemented it before the elevator concluded that he would have more to say at the hearing before the committee.
All cable and radio networks sent live hours later, when the Judicial Committee was to vote to vote on the nomination of Kavanaughs to the entire Senate.
Flake said, however, that he would do this only on condition that the FBI, as requested by the democratic minority, investigate the accusations against the candidate in the next week.
Flake is partly convinced by conversations with a friend, the democratic senator Chris Coons.
After an interview with Coons and then several senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision was of great importance because it was obvious that the Republicans would not have enough votes for the confirmation of Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has initiated an FBI investigation of the allegations raised against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of using Brexit for political purposes
In an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of their plans to leave the European Union of exploiting the future of Britain for political purposes and undermining the interests of the nation.
British Prime Minister Theresa May will meet on September 29, 2018 at the Conservative Party in Birmingham.
In a second interview with her on the front page of the newspaper, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson reinforced his attack on her so-called "Chequers Plan" for Brexit by calling a proposal that provides for the reciprocal imposition of customs duties by the UK and the EU as "absolutely absurd".
Deadly Shots on Wayde Sims: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson in connection with LSU player's death
The police have arrested a suspect in connection with the fatal shootings on Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at Louisiana State University (LSU).
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and detained for killing, according to Baton Rouge police.
The authority published video footage of the conflict between Sims and Simpson. According to the police, Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
As reported by the CBS partner station WAFB, the police secured the glasses at the scene of the crime and said that the glasses had found DNA from Simpson.
After a poll with Simpson, the police reported that he had confessed to the fatal shots on Wayde.
The lawyer reports that the security deposit was set at $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coronar's Office published a preliminary report on Friday, according to which the cause of death was a gunshot wound on the neck.
The police thank the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Task Force, the Federal Police's forensic laboratory, the Southern University Police and the citizens of the area for their support in the investigation leading to arrest.
LSU sports director Joe Alleva thanked the regional executive for "their care and their pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 1.98-metre-large winger grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne had also played for the LSU Basketball.
In the last season, he scored an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said that the team was "deeply shaken" about Wayde's death and "were shocked".
"You're always afraid of something like that," said Wade.
Volcano rushes ashes on Mexico City.
Ashes cast out of the Popocatepetl volcano have reached the southern quarter of the Mexican capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned the Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after the activity had increased in the crater and within 24 hours 183 emissions of gas and ash were registered.
The Authority monitored numerous cases of crumbs and tremors.
Pictures in social media showed thin ash layers on the windshields of cars in neighborhoods of Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists noted that since September 2017 an earthquake of 7.1 Central Mexico has shaken strength, increased activity in the 72 km southeast of the capital.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Conflicts between police and Catalan separatists before anniversary of the independence vote
In Barcelona six people were arrested on Saturday after clashes between the parole police and pro-independence demonstrators. Thousands took part in other demonstrations to commemorate the first anniversary of the polarizing independence referendum in Catalonia.
A group of masked pro-separatists, held back by the standby police, threw eggs and also threw paint powder into the streets of dark dust clouds, usually populated with tourists.
In the course of the day, the police used their batons to curb the fights.
For several hours, pro-independence groups were 'not forgotten, not forgiven', while they were confronted by Unionists who called 'Long live Spain'.
As reported by the local press, fourteen people were treated for minor injuries in protests.
One year after the referendum of 1 October, which was seen by Madrid as illegal, but celebrated by separatist Catalans, the situation in the independent region is still very tense.
The voters had opted for independence by an overwhelming majority, although the turnout was low, as the split-offs largely boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year when the police tried to prevent the vote in violent clashes in front of the polling stations.
Per-independence groups had camped outdoors on Friday night to prevent a demonstration for the national police.
The demonstration took place, but was forced to take another way.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who took part with his wife in the protest of the separatists, said that he saw the prospect that Catalonia would gain independence, no longer with hope.
“Last year we experienced one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying for joy because they could choose, but now we hang fast," he said.
Despite an important, though scarce, victory in the regional elections last December, the Catalan pro-independence parties had difficulty maintaining the momentum this year. Many of their most famous leaders are either in exile imposed themselves or in prison, where they are waiting for their proceedings because of their role in the organisation of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in favor of the police on his phone, said that the conflict had been waged by politicians on both sides.
"The situation is becoming ever more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been under investigation since the end of last year, announced his candidacy for the election to the European Parliament next year.
"As a candidate for the European elections, the best way to challenge the reduction of democratic values and the suppression by the Spanish Government is to oppose it," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after house was hit by car
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after a house in Londonderry had been hit several times by a car.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 19:30 after British summer time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building itself were damaged.
In addition, the car may have been shot with an arm chest.
Menga hits means for Livingston 1:0 win over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured the victory.
The rising Livingston FC surprised the Rangers and led to the first second defeat for Steven Gerrard in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox Association.
Dolly Menga's hits proved decisive for Gary Holt's team being able to match Hibernian in the second half.
This season, Gerrard's team will remain in the Premiership with no away victory and will face the eight-point hearts on the next Sunday.
Previously, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday in the Europa League.
Livingston can in the meantime increase his victory series in the division to six games, i.e., Chief Trainer Holt has not been defeated since his takeover of Kenny Miler since last month.
Livingston misses opportunities against generously playing guests
Holt's team should have been in the lead for a long time since his directness faced the Rangers with various problems.
Scott Robinson broke through, but slowed down in front of the gate. Then Alan Lithgow could only shoot far after he slipped in to hit Craig Halkett's head shot at the gate.
The hosts were content to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could hinder the guests in standard situations.
In this way the decisive goal came to pass.
The Rangers allowed a release, and Livingston prepared a chance for Declan Gallagher and Robinson to launch Menga together. This shot the gate with a ball contact from the middle of the penalty room.
At this stage, the Rangers had dominated the ball ownership but could not overcome the hosts' defenses, and gatekeeper Liam Kelly remained largely unwelcome.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly once to defend himself.
Scott Pittman was defended by Rangers janitor Allan McGregor with his feet, and Lithgow slid the ball out of another standard situation of Livingston.
Flanks repeatedly entered the penal area of Livingston and were regularly taken out of the danger area, while two required offenses – one by Halkett against Glenn Middleton and one by hand – were denied.
Livingston’s “phenomenal” – Analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland in the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and a strong result for Livingston.
They were invariably excellent and have exceeded expectations in this upward trend again.
Their style of playing and their team have hardly changed since their return to the top teams, but Holt deserves great praise for the way in which he has woken up the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was great and led an excellently organized defense, while Menga Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall held on to the trombone throughout the game.
The Rangers, however, lacked inspiration.
As well as they were temporarily under Gerrard, they could not reach this standard.
Their last ball was inadequate – only once they could penetrate the host team – and this is something like a wake-up call for the rangers in the middle of the table.
Erdogan with mixed reactions received in Cologne
On Saturday (29 September), smiling faces and blue sky prevailed when the heads of government of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany to help repair relations between NATO allies.
There had been disputes about issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then traveled to Cologne to open a large new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police mentioned security reasons for keeping a 25 000 people from gathering in front of the mosque. However, many supporters were nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan demonstrators – many of them Kurds – also heard. They condemned Erdogan’s policy as well as the decision of the German government to welcome him to the country.
The opposing protests reflect the polarizing effect of the visitor, who is praised as a hero by some German Turks and who is reproached by others as an autocrat.
Traffic accident in Deptford: cyclist dies in the event of a car crash
In London, a cyclist was killed in a car crash.
The collision occurred at about 10:15 in British summer time near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford in the southeast of the city.
The driver of the car stopped, and the paramedics took care of the man who died at the accident site.
months before the accident, another cyclist had been killed in an accident involving a driver's flight on Childers Street, about six miles from Saturday's accident.
According to the Metropolitan Police, officials were working to identify the man and inform his next relatives.
Roadblocks and diversions for buses are set up, and the drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long-Lartin Prison: Six Officers Injured in Distress
According to the Prison Office, six prison officers were injured in a men's high-security prison in the event of unrest.
The unrest broke out on Sunday at about 9:30 a.m. British summer time in HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire and continues.
Specialized "Tornado" officials were recruited to end the unrest involving eight inmates and limited to one wing.
Officials were treated on site for minor facial injuries.
A spokesperson of the Prison Service said: “Specially trained prison staff were used to fix an ongoing incident in HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and want to make it clear that police officers are being handed over and may be spending longer time behind bars."
In HMP Long Lartin there are more than 500 convicts, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison leader was treated by a prisoner in the hospital after an attack.
In October last year, security officers were called to the prison to deal with serious unrest involving the personnel being attacked with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with floods (dream areas may benefit)
It is rare that a tropical depression reaches Arizona, but that is probably what will happen at the beginning of next week when the remains of Hurricane Rosa cross the south-west marked by deserts and bring with them the risk of floods.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings against floods on Monday and Tuesday from the west of Arizona to the south and east of Nevada as well as to the southeast of California and Utah including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will approach with rain on Monday evening and head directly over Phoenix on Tuesday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix reported in a tweet that “since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have approached as a tropical storm or tropical depression of Phoenix as far as 200 miles [320 km]!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 64 kilometres of the Arizona border."
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 centimetres of precipitation with single up to 15 centimetres in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
In other areas of the south-west marked by deserts, including the central rockies and the Great Basin, 2.5 to 5 centimeters are likely and can be singled up to 10 centimeters in total.
For those who are not at risk of floods, the rainfall associated with pink can be a blessing due to the drought in the region.
Although floods are of great concern, this rain is likely to be useful in part, as there is currently drought in the southwest.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, in just over 40 percent of Arizona, at least extreme drought occurs, the second highest category," reported weather.com.
First, the path of the hurricane means that Rosa will meet on land on the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
On Sunday morning, Rosa will still have hurricane strength with maximum winds of 136 kilometres per hour and 620 kilometres south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico. Then the hurricane will move north at 19 kilometres per hour.
In the Pacific, the storm will hit colder water and weaken.
Therefore, Rosa is expected to meet on Monday afternoon or evening in Mexico with the strength of a tropical storm on land.
Precipitation may be severe in parts of Mexico, so there is a significant risk of flooding.
"From Baja California to the northwest of the Sonora Desert, precipitation amounts from 7.5 to 15 centimeters are expected, with up to 25 centimeters being possible," reported weather.com.
Then, as a tropical storm, Rosa will move north across Mexico, reach the border to Arizona on the early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression and then move up to the south of Utah by late Tuesday evening through Arizona.
"As the main danger, very severe rainfall is expected in connection with Rosa or her remains in Baja California, northwest of the Sonora Desert and southwest of the United States," the National Hurricane Center informed.
As a result of these rainfalls, floods and floods that threaten life in the desert are expected to be flooded and flooded in water, as well as landslides in mountainous areas.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four arrests for attempted murders
After the discovery of a 16-year-old with stab wounds in Somerset, three boys in their teens and a 20-year-old man were arrested under the suspicion of attempted murder.
The teenager was found injured on Saturday at 4:00 UK summer time in the Excelsior-terrace area of Midsomer Norton.
He was taken to a hospital and his condition is "stable".
According to the Avon and Somerset police, a 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old were arrested overnight in the Radstock area.
The officials asked all those who had records of events on a mobile phone to report.
Trump said that Kavanaugh suffered 'under the commonwealth, the wrath' of the Democrats.
"A voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice against the unscrupulous and unheard of tactics of the Democrats," said Trump at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh suffered 'under the commonwealth' of the Democrats throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh stated on Thursday before the Congress and rejected the accusation raised by Christine Blasey Ford that he had sexually harassed her decades ago when both were teenagers.
Ford also said at the hearing about her accusation.
The President said on Saturday that the American people had seen the brilliance, quality and courage of Kavanaugh on that day.
"A voice for the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh is a voice for the confirmation of one of the most experienced legal minds of our time, a lawyer with an excellent record in the service of the general public," he said the crowd of his followers in West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to the nomination of Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of the Republican voters' participation in the interim elections.
“Five weeks before one of the most important elections of our life.
I'm not going, but in reality I'm going," he said.
"That's why I'm fighting for great candidates everywhere."
Trump argued that the Democrats saw their mission in "resisting and blocking".
The first important procedural vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place at the Senate no later than Friday, said a high GOP leader against CNN.
Hundreds killed at earthquakes in Indonesia, number of victims rising
According to the authorities of Saturday, at least 384 people were killed. Many of them were flooded when a strong earthquake and a tsunamis hit the beaches on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi gigantic waves.
Hundreds of people gathered on Friday at a party at the beach of Palu, when the dark fell upon the beach up to six meters high, and many people broke into death and destroyed everything that stood in their way.
The tsunami was preceded by an earthquake of 7.5.
"When the threat of the tsunami arose yesterday, people still went to the beach and did not immediately run away, and they fell victim to him," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson of the Indonesian Civil Protection Agency BNPB at a conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come alone, he swam with cars, tree trunks and houses, he hit everything on land," Nugroho said. He added that the tsunami had moved over the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before he hit the coast.
Some people had climbed trees on their escape from the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated and accommodated in 24 centers in Palu.
Airviews published by the Civil Protection Authority showed numerous destroyed buildings and shops, arched and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday the coastal city was shaken by further aftershocks.
The earthquake series was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian authority BPPT (Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology) said in a statement that, at the massive earthquake of Friday, energy released was equivalent to the 200-fold energy of the nuclear bomb thrown at Hiroshima in World War II.
Because of the location of the city at the end of a long, narrow bay, the tsunami could have grown, said the authority.
Nugroho described the damage as "comprehensive" and indicated that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had collapsed.
According to his report, the bodies of some victims were found among the ruins of collapsed buildings. 540 people were injured, and 29 are missing.
Nugroho said that the number of victims and the damage along the coast could have been higher 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the quake.
Communication with Donggala was completely paralysed, according to Nugrohos, and there had been no information.
According to a Red Cross statement, more than 300,000 people live there, and its staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
'This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse', said the statement.
On Saturday, the authority was frequently criticized for not having informed that a Tsunami Palu had met, although the waves were reported to have occurred at the time of the warning.
In social media published amateur pictures show a man on the upper floor of a building who desperately warns the people on the street under him against the approaching tsunami.
Within minutes, a water wall forces onto the shore and swims buildings and cars from it.
Reuters could not verify the authenticity of the recordings immediately.
The quake and the tsunami caused a massive power failure that interrupted communication around Palu and made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate the rescue measures.
According to the authorities, the military has begun to send cargo aircraft with the support of Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuated still urgently need food and other vital goods.
The city airport remains closed until October and was only reopened for relief measures.
A visit of President Joko Widodo to evacuation centers in Palu was planned for Sunday.
The number of Tsunami victims has increased to more than 800.
The situation is very bad.
The employees of World Vision from Donggala have safely reached the city of Palu, where the employees are housed in the inner courtyard of their office, but, according to Dosebas, they passed scenes of destruction on the way.
"They told me they'd seen a lot of destroyed houses," he said.
The situation is very bad.
Even when the aid groups began to work hard to get disaster relief started, some people were warning that foreign experts would be prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian law, financial assistance, supplies and staff from abroad are only possible when the place of an accident has been declared a national disaster area.
This has not happened so far.
"At the moment it is still a disaster at the provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, spokesperson of the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the government says, ‘okay, this is a national disaster’, we can accept international support, but so far this status does not apply.”
While the second night since the earthquake and the tsunami fell on Palu from Friday, friends and family members of the still missing ones hoped for one of the wonders that lit up the sad stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of a sewer.
On Sunday, rescue forces liberated a woman who was trapped under rubble for two days next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian Paragliding National Team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian games that ended in Indonesia at the beginning of this month.
Other of the prisoners in the Roa-Roa-Hotel were, as Mandagi added, his students.
"As a senior in paragliding, I have to bear my own emotional burden," he said.
Gendon told how he had made the rounds in the hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa-Roa hotel among the paragliders, despairing whatsApp news sent to the contestants from Palu who attended the beach festival.
His news, however, led to only grey question marks rather than blue ticks.
"I think that means that the news has not been delivered," he said.
Thieves steal 26,750 U.S. dollars while filling a ATM in Newport on the Levee
According to a Newport police press release, on Friday morning in Newport on the Levee, a Brink’s employee stole 26,750 US dollars from filling up a ATM.
The driver of the vehicle had emptied a ATM in the entertainment complex and wanted to deposit more money, wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy in the press release.
While he was busy, “a man came running behind the staff of Brink’s” and stole a bag of money that was destined for the vending machine.
According to the press release, witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but the police did not indicate how many people were involved in the incident.
Persons who have information about the identity of the suspects are asked to contact the Newport police under 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name in Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name – in Ye.
When announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The being formally known as Kanye West" (The officially known as Kanye West).
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for some time and has used it as the title of his eighth album released in June.
The change precedes his performance at Saturday Night Live, where the release of his new album "Yandhi" is expected.
He is a substitute for the singer Ariana Grande, who, according to the producer, has resigned for 'emotional reasons'.
The word is not just an abbreviation of his current professional name, but, according to his own statement, it has a religious meaning for the West.
“I think ‘ye’ is the word most commonly used in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you’,” said West this year in a conversation about his album with radio moderator Big Boy.
“So I am you, I am us, it is us.
From Kanye, which means ‘the only’, only ‘Ye’ – simply a reflection of our good, our bad, our confused, of everything.
The album rather reflects what we are."
He is one of several famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who used to work with West, has already written his name with and without hyphen and capital letters.
Mexico's AMLO pledged not to use the military against the civilian population
The elected Mexican president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised never to use military violence against the civilian population during the 50th anniversary of the bloody repression against students in his country.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at the Tlatelolco Plaza that he would "never use the military to oppress the Mexican people".
On October 2, 1968, soldiers fired a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing 300 people. At that time, left-wing student movements were establishing themselves in all of Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised to support young Mexicans through monthly support for students and the opening of other free public universities.
He said that unemployment and the lack of training opportunities led to criminal gangs among young people.
US should double the financial resources for artificial intelligence
In view of China's increased activity in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double its spending on research in this area, says investor and AI practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments follow AI announcements from various areas of the U.S. government, even if the US generally lacks a formal AI strategy.
In the meantime, China presented its plan last year: The country intends to become the No. 1 in the field of AI innovation by 2030.
"The doubling of the budget for AI research would be a good start given the fact that all other countries are so much further behind the US. We are looking for the next AI breakthrough," said Lee.
The doubling of the financial resources could double the chances that the next great AI success would be achieved in the US, Lee said this week in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of the company Innovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the most prominent AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an AI system that defeated the highest-ranking American Othello player. Later he was head of Microsoft Research and president of the Google branch in China.
Lee appreciated previous US government technology competitions such as the Robotics Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and asked about the time of the next competition because he wanted to help identify the next visionaries.
According to Lee's words, researchers in the USA often have to work hard to obtain state subsidies.
"Not China takes the academic leaders away, but the companies," said Lee.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have been hiring Koryphae from universities to work at AI.
According to Lee, a revised US immigration policy could also be conducive to the US AI efforts.
"I think Greencards should be offered automatically in the field of AI promotions," he said.
In July 2017, China's State Council presented its plan for the development of the next generation of AI technologies (Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan).
According to Lees Word, the National Natural Science Foundation of China finances people from academic institutions similar to the National Science Foundation and other government organizations who donate money to US researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower.
At the beginning of this year, the US Department of Defense founded the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, to which partners from industry and science should be involved. In addition, the White House announced the formation of a special committee for artificial intelligence.
In addition, this month, DARPA announced the investment of USD 2 billion in the AI Next initiative.
The National Science Foundation (NSF) is currently investing more than $100 million a year in AI research.
In the meantime, nothing has happened in US laws regarding the formation of the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on a change in the country name
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on whether to change the country's name to 'Republic of Northern Macedonia', which would settle a decades-old dispute with Greece which blocked Macedonia's applications for accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbour means that this claim is raised to the Greek territory. Greece has therefore imposed a veto against the admission of Macedonia to NATO and the EU.
The two governments concluded an agreement in June on the basis of the proposed new name. However, nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum. A boycott campaign doubts that the turnout reaches the 50 percent required for the validity of the referendum.
The question on the ballot was: are you in favour of membership of NATO and the EU by adopting the agreement with Greece?
Supporters of the change of name, which includes Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that Macedonia, one of the countries resulting from the collapse of Yugoslavia, is worth the price of inclusion in organisations such as the EU and NATO.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, as it means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the result of the vote is not legally binding, enough Members of Parliament have said that they would stick to the outcome so that it is decisive.
The change of name would require a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The state electoral commission said there had been no reports of irregularities by 13.00.
However, the turnout was only 16 percent compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, in which 66 percent of registered voters cast their votes.
"I am here for my children to vote, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital of Skopje.
Macedonia's Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko gave their vote on 30 September 2018 in Strumica, Macedonia, in the referendum on the change of the country name, which Macedonia would open the way to accession to NATO and to the European Union.
Before the Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, presented a small stage and presented chairs in front of tents set up by people who wanted to boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join the raised head, not through the back door," said Kavadarkov.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of the integration between Europe and Asia."
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will result in urgently needed investments for Macedonia, whose unemployment rate is more than 20 percent.
"I believe that a large majority will be in favour because more than 80 percent of our citizens are for the EU and NATO," said Zaev after his vote.
In his words, a 'yes' result would be a 'confirmation of our future'.
According to a survey published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research, between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum.
Another survey conducted by Macedonian broadcaster Telma TV found that 57 percent of respondents are planning to vote on Sunday.
Seventy per cent of them said they would vote 'yes'.
In order for the referendum to be successful, the turnout must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A failure of the referendum would be the first severe blow to the policies of the pro-Western government since their takeover of power in May last year.
View: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City maneuvered through the entire Brighton defense to reach the goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling overcame the Brighton Defense at Manchester City's 2:0 win on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
Aguero made his hits look ridiculously simple in the 65th minute.
At the beginning of the sequence, the Argentine attacker received a pass in the middle field.
He ran between three Brighton defenders and then ran into the open field.
Aguero then saw himself surrounded by four green jerseys.
He played around a defender and then overtaken several other defenders at the edge of Brighton's penal area.
He then shot a pass to the left to Sterling.
The English attacker used his first ball contact in the penalty room to play the ball back to Aguero, who overcame the ball with his right shoe Brighton guard Mathew Ryan and shot into the right side of the net.
"Aguero fights with problems in his feet," said City Manager Pep Guardiola to reporters.
“We had talked about him playing 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he had scored a goal at this moment."
It was Sterling, however, who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League duel.
This gate fell in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball on this train far on the side of Brighton.
He shot a good steep pass along the left flank to Leroy Sané.
Sané needed a few trains to steer Sterling to the long corner.
The Sky-Blues attacker aimed the ball into the net shortly before he slipped out.
City plays in the Champions League group game on Tuesday at 12:55 in the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim against Hoffenheim.
Scherzer wants to destroy the rockies the game
Since the Nationals have been eliminated from the Playoff competition, there was little reason to force further deployment.
The ever-performing joke, however, hopes to stand against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday on the hill, but only if this is relevant to the rockies that have a lead in the NL West in front of the Los Angeles Dodgers for which playoffs are relevant.
The Rockies achieved at least one wild card with a 5:2 victory over the Nationals on Friday evening, but still want to secure their first division title.
“Although we play for nothing, we can at least throw because we know the atmosphere of the audience here in Denver and the other team would probably play at the highest level that would meet me this year.
Why should I not want to participate in this competition?"
The Nationals have not yet announced a starting player for Sunday, but are inclined, according to reports, to throw jokes in such a situation.
Scherzer, for whom this would be the 34th bet as a starting player, practiced in Bullpen on Thursday and would throw on Sunday on his normal day of rest.
The Washington Lawyer has this season a statistics of 18-7, an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings.
Trump is holding a rally in West Virginia
The President referred indirectly to the situation relating to the Kavanaugh board he chose for the Supreme Court when he spoke about the importance of the Republican voters' participation in the mid-term elections.
“Everything we have done is at stake in November.
Five weeks before one of the most important elections of our lives.
That's one of the big, big ones – I don't get involved, but in reality I'm getting involved, so I'm fighting for great candidates everywhere," he said.
Trump continued, “You see this terrible, terrible radical group of democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they are determined to take power again by all means, you see the commonness, the abhorrence.
It doesn't matter to them who they hurt, who they have to pass over, to gain power and control, that's what they want, power and control, we won't give them."
The Democrats, he said, saw their mission in 'resisting and blocking'.
"And you have seen this in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats 'enraged and mean and hideous and dishonest'.
He named the highest-ranking democrat in the Senate's Committee of Justice, Senator Diane Feinstein, which caused loud bulwarks in the audience.
“Do you remember your answer?
Did you let the document go outside?
Uh, uh, what.
No, no, I'm waiting for you – that was a really bad body language – the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour no longer allows all opinions to be expressed.
The party is intolerant to those who say their opinion.
When the Momentum activists in my local party voted to blame me, this came as little surprise.
Finally, I am the last of a number of Labour Members to be told that they are not welcome – just because we say our opinion.
My colleague Joan Ryan was treated in a similar way, as she had strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized with the blasphemy that I had a different opinion from Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically on similar issues, Jeremy did not agree with previous top politicians.
The announcement of the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday said that 'the meetings should all be inclusive and productive'.
Most of the Friday evening GC sessions in my eight years as a local Labour Member were just that.
Today, unfortunately, most meetings are not marked by this tone, and the promised 'friendlyer, more careful' policy has long been forgotten if it has ever begun.
It is becoming increasingly clear that dissenting views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that any opinion is judged by whether it is accepted by the party head.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a party leader. Colleagues with whom I previously believed to share similar political views now expected me to turn around and take positions with which I would not otherwise have agreed – whether in terms of national security or in terms of the European internal market.
Whenever I speak in public – while it doesn't matter what I say – a smack-tirade in the social media that calls for my election is following the political center and saying that I shouldn't be a member of the Labour Party.
And with this experience, I'm not alone.
In fact, I know that I am doing better than some of my colleagues, as the comments I have addressed are mostly political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of colleagues, who daily face a flood of sexist or racist insults and yet never give in to small amounts.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political age is that insults have become normality.
Jeremy Corbyn demanded last week that the Labour Party promote a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we are no longer allowing all opinions to be expressed, and with every motion of censure and any change to the electoral rules, the party is becoming more rigid.
In the last two years, I have often been advised to pull my head in and not to express my opinion so clearly, and then I would have 'no problems'.
But I didn't go into politics for that.
Since I was a student 32 years ago, caused by the neglect of the Thatcher government, because my classroom literally broke up in the whole school, who joined the Labour Party, I have fought for better public services for those who most need it – as a municipal council as well as as as a cabinet minister.
I have never made a big deal out of my political views, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could in any way be confused about my political positions and about areas in which I do not agree with the current leadership.
I would just like to say to the supporters of Friday's request: given that the country will rest on Brexit, harm the households, businesses and our public service, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leadership of the Labour Party.
In fact, however, I am sending this message not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my voters, regardless of whether they are Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that so many electoral threats or political considerations will not stop me from acting in my opinion to the best interest of all of you.

Ayr vs Melrose 38:17: Unbeaten Ayr team rises to the top
Two late attempts may have distorted the final result somewhat, but there is no doubt that Ayr earned the victory in this extremely entertaining game of the day in the Tennent's Premiership.
They are now the only one of the ten teams unbeaten at the top of the table.
In the end, the success of the home team was due to their superior defenses as well as to their better use of opportunities, and Coach Peter Murchie had every reason to be satisfied.
"We have been put to the test in our games so far, and we are still unbeaten, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "Recognition for Ayr, they have made better use of their opportunities than we have."
Grant Anderson’s 14th-minute attempt, which was raised by Frazier Clima, led Ayr. However, Melrose was able to speak the numbers because of a yellow card for the Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who had been released from the game by the Warriors, and Jason Baggot took an unrelenting attempt.
Climo expanded the leadership of Ayr with a penalty strike before reaching a hit in the middle of the day and then made an increased attempt alone, so that it stood for break 17:5 for Ayr.
Melrose started the second half well, however, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, which was increased by Baggot, reduced the distance to five points.
Then there was a longer interruption due to a severe injury to Ruaridh Knott, which was worn by the field. After the continuation, Ayr expanded its lead by an attempt by Stafford McDowall, which was increased by Clima.
Then, as captain of Ayr, Blair Macpherson received a yellow card, and again, at the end of a phase, Melrose made enormous pressure pay the additional man by an unincreased attempt by Bruce Colvine.
However, the home team came back, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for strikers without a ball against Clima, MacPherson obtained a touchdown from the Strait Street behind the advancing Ayr package.
Like almost since the break, Climo increased after Kyle Rowe captured David Armstrong's boxkick and sent flanker Gregor Henry off for the fifth attempt by the home team.
"Still Game" star seems ready for new career in gastronomy
"Still Game" Star Ford Kieran seems to be ready for a change to the restaurant business after it turned out that he was called the manager of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, whose screenplays he writes and in which he plays one of the leading roles together with his long-time comedy partner Greg Hemphil.
The two have announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last of the show, and Krun seems to be planning a life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is Managing Director of Atrivmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although a source of the Scottish Sun indicated that Krun was interested in entering Glasgow's "flowering restaurant business".
"The sea belongs to us": The Bolivian, which is included by land, hopes that a court will open the way to the Pacific Ocean.
Sailors patrol in front of the sea headquarters decorated with ropes in La Paz.
On public buildings a sea blue flag blows.
Fleet bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon bear the motto: “The sea is our legitimate property.
Reclaiming it is a duty."
Throughout Bolivia included in the country, the memory of the coastal section lost in a bloody conflict over resources in Chile in the 19th century is as vivid as the desire to cross the Pacific again.
These hopes may not be as strong as they have been for decades, as Bolivia awaits a judgment by the International Court of Justice, which is due to be adopted on 1 October after five years of discussion.
"Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity and expects the result, of course, with a positive attitude," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Throughout the country, many Bolivians will follow the IGH's ruling on large screens, hoping that the Court of Justice in The Hague will decide in favour of Bolivia's claim. According to this, Chile is obliged to negotiate a sovereign access of Bolivia to the sea after decades of sporadic talks.
For Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president, who next year is facing a controversial fight for his re-election, there is also much at stake in the Monday judgment.
"We are about to return to the Pacific," he praised at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will decide in favour of Bolivia, and believe that this would also change little.
The UN body based in the Netherlands is not entitled to address Chilean territory and has stated that it will not decide on the outcome of any discussions.
According to Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law, that the case was "not complicated".
Far from supporting Bolivia's case, the last four years could also mean a setback.
"The current Bolivian government has taken the issue of access to the sea to itself," said Zárate.
She suggested that Morales' war rhetoric suffocated any remaining good will of Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will eventually continue their talks, but after these events this will be extremely difficult.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the view that the court's decision had been made unusually quickly.
On Monday, Bolivia has "an exceptional opportunity to initiate a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "end the 139 years of dispute to the mutual benefit", he said.
Calzadilla also argues that Morales – still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America – uses the theme of the sea as a political crutch.
"Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific," he added.
"The verdict is an opportunity to see that we have to overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament takes place only if it can trust the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never disarm their nuclear weapons until they can trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday before the General Assembly of the United Nations.
He called on the United States to implement the promises made during a summit between the state leaders of the rivals in Singapore.
His comments come at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be about three months after the summit with North Korean head of state Kim Jong-un in Singapore to relaunch the endangered nuclear diplomacy.
Ri described the idea that further sanctions and resistance of the United States against a declaration to end the Korean war would ever force the North to kneel, as "brainspin".
Washington is sceptical and does not want to agree to the declaration without Pyongyang taking substantial disarmament steps first.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is widespread scepticism that Pyongyang is serious about the abandonment of an arsenal in which the country probably sees the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo is planning a visit to Pyongyang next month to prepare a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris show the latest collections for huge headgear that will soon be available in the shopping streets near you
If you want to expand your hat collection or completely shield the sun, you no longer need to search.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne showed a range of crazy oversized headgear for their summer 2019 collection, which fascinated the fashion world during the Paris fashion week.
Extremely impractical hats have flooded Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their eye-catching creations across the trail.
Valentino's most outstanding piece was an extravagant beige hat with a feather-like wide edge that almost crushed the heads of the models.
As other oversized accessories, watermelons, a magic hat and even a pineapple were shown with jewels. However, these are not intended to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a number of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks were lined with sewn lips and were more similar to Hannibal Lecter than to Haute Couture.
One creation resembled a diving equipment, including snorkel and scuba goggles, while another looked like a melted icebag.
And if you want to put another huge fashion statement, you're lucky.
Fashion observers predict that the huge headgear could find its way into shopping streets near you.
The oversized hats follow directly on "La Bomba", the straw hat with a width of 60 centimetres, all of which are worn from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the extremely unpractice hat, which struck great waves in the social media, sent another great creation over the running ladder: a beach bag made of straw that was almost as large as the model wearing a swimsuit that held the bag.
The bass bag in reddish orange with bass fringes and a white leather handle was the outstanding piece of Jacquemus' summer 2019 collection "La Riviera" at the Paris fashion week.
Prominent stylist Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: "I expect large hats and beach bags to be available in the shopping streets for the next summer. The designer has so much interest that the demand for oversized accessories will hardly be ignored."
John Edward: Knowledge of languages for world citizens is essential
Scotland’s independent schools continue to be distinguished by academic excellence. This has continued with further outstanding test results in 2018 and is only supported by individual and joint successes in the fields of sport, art, music and other joint ventures.
With more than 30,000 students from all over Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), aim to provide the highest possible level of care for their students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further education and higher education, the profession of their choice and their place as a world citizen.
As an educational sector, which can design and implement a tailor-made curriculum, we see that modern languages are still popular and popular in schools as elective subjects.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to someone in a language he understands, you reach his head.
If you speak with him in his own language, you will reach his heart."
This is an impressive reminder that we cannot rely only on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
The current audit results of this year show that languages with the highest existing rates are at the top of the rankings of independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who learned foreign languages achieved grade A in the higher examinations.
From the data collected from 74 SCIS member schools, 72 percent of students in Mandarin achieved grade A in higher education, while 72 percent of students who learned German, 69 percent of students who learned French, and 63 percent of students who learned Spanish also achieved grade A.
This illustrates that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important knowledge that will undoubtedly need children and young people in the future.
Languages are today regarded as elective subjects as well as STEM subjects (natural sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curricula of independent schools and elsewhere.
According to a survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014, 17 percent of the reasons employers mentioned for the problems of filling open jobs were related to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly necessary when it comes to preparing young people for their future career.
As more and more open jobs require languages, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the chosen profession, young people who have learned a second language will have a real advantage through such a lifelong ability in the future.
To be able to communicate directly with people from other countries, multilingual people will automatically give a head start to competitors.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to conduct a conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage (15 percent).
For this reason, it is important for today's children that we now invest in language teaching.
Children who speak several languages, especially languages of developing countries, will have a better chance of finding meaningful employment.
In Scotland, different languages are taught in all schools.
A number of schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while other languages will be taught, which are considered by 2020 to be the most important ones for the United Kingdom, for example Mandarin or Japanese.
Wherever the interests of your child lie, in independent schools there will always be a number of languages with appropriately specialized teachers.
Scottish independent schools are committed to creating a learning environment that prepares the children and equips them with the skills necessary for their success, whatever the future may look like.
At this time, in a global economic environment, it cannot be denied that languages are still of fundamental importance for the future of the country. This must therefore be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should actually be regarded as 'international communication capability'.
Independent schools will continue to offer young people in Scotland this choice, diversity and excellence.
Il fout bien le faire.
John Edward is the head of the Scottish Council of Independent School.
LeBron before the Lakers debut on Sunday in San Diego
For fans who want to see LeBron James start for the first time for the Los Angeles Lakers, waiting will soon end.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday in the opening game of the preseason.
How many minutes he will play, however, is not yet clear.
"It will be more than one and less than 48" Walton said on the official website of the Lakers.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James will probably play only a few minutes.
At the beginning of this week James was asked for training according to his plans for the six-game preseason schedule of the Lakers.
"I don't need preseason games at this stage of my career to prepare me," he said.
Time for Trump's rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia, a series of election campaigns.
This is the first of Trump's five conferences planned for the next week, including places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
In view of the pending vote on the confirmation of his election for the vacancy at the Supreme Court, Trump wishes to build up support for the forthcoming half-time elections in November, as Republicans are in danger of losing control of Congress.
When will Trump's rally take place in West Virginia tonight, and how can you watch online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for today, Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 19:00 (East Coastal Time).
You can track Trump's rally in West Virginia below as live stream on YouTube online.
Trump is likely to address the hearings of the Board of Kavanaugh nominated for the Supreme Court on accusations of sexual misconduct conducted this week in a tense atmosphere. The expected Senate vote on the confirmation remains suspended for up to a week while the FBI is conducting investigations.
However, the main objective of this series of demonstrations is to support Republicans who have to make a difficult choice in a November.
President Trump's campaign team told Reuters that these five demonstrations were intended to "mobilise volunteers and supporters, while Republicans are trying to maintain and expand their majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives".
"The control of Congress is so important to his plans that the president will travel to as many states as possible, while the active campaign season is near," said a Trump campaign spokesman who did not want to mention his name to Reuters.
According to the West Virginia Metro News, supporters of "Ohio and Pennsylvania and media from Pittsburgh" could participate in the rally planned for tonight at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling.
The visit on Saturday is Trump's second visit this month to West Virginia, the state he won with more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to support the Republican Senate candidates from West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, in polls.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to try to boost him in the polls," said Simon Haeder, political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The team of the USA is showing willingness to fight to maintain the hope for individuals on Sunday
After three one-sided rounds, the four games on Saturday afternoon may have been exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging pendulum of the moment is a pure invention as a sport concept, but one that the players really believe in, especially in competitions like this.
So where is the moment in their opinion now?
"They were in the lead with six points, and now there are four, so I think that means a small moment for us," said Jordan Spieth when leaving the venue.
Europe, of course, is in the advantage and is ahead of four points, while twelve more follow.
According to Spieth, however, the Americans feel some wind in their sails and have reason to feel encouraged, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have played together all day long and can each show three out of four points.
Spieth was incredibly strong from the turnoff to the green and goes ahead with a good example.
The guttural enthusiasm screams became louder in the course of his round when he lowered an important pit to decide the fourth match with four points for both of them after he and Thomas had returned two holes with two points.
His putt, which decided the match for them on the 15th hole, triggered a similar scream that suggests that the American team is not yet out of the game.
"I really need to kneel in and take care of my own game," said Spieth.
That's all that's left for the individual players.
18 holes to put a sign.
Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood have scored more points in the last two days than Spieth and Thomas and have no doubt written the history of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's unequal, but sympathetic duo is four out of four points and can do nothing wrong.
"Moliwood" was not the only couple who had not beaten a bowey on Saturday afternoon, but they had also avoided Bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the nine holes on Friday morning.
This series and the apparent amount of flowing energy between them and the out of the way underpin that they are the players to hit on Sunday. Fleetwood and Molinari would be the most popular players who seal a possible European victory at the setting of the sun over Le Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time on different holes.
However, speaking of European fame would be premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made a brief trial with Sergio Garcia, the four heroes of the morning who played with Alex Noren.
A bowey and two doubles on the front nine holes brought the Spaniard and Sweden into a clamp that they could not nearly overcome.
On Sunday, however, no one can help them out.
The four and four pairs are so fascinating to look at from close up because of the interactions between the couples, the advice they give or do not give, and the way in which a strategy can change as quickly as possible.
The Europeans have so far played better as a team and are clearly in the lead on the last day. However, this round of four has also shown that the US team is ready to fight, which some, especially in the US, had doubted.
Europe takes the lead on the last day of the Ryder Cup with 10:6
Europe is ahead of the fours and fours from Saturday to the USA at 10:6 and goes with a solid lead in the last day of the Ryder Cup.
The brilliantly playing duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari went ahead with two victories over the hard-hitting Tiger Woods and was thus able to score four points in Le Golf National.
The European team led by Thomas Bjørn, who wants to regain the trophy lost two years ago in Hazeltine, dominated the four in the morning against the flawed American team and won the series with 3:1.
In the four parties, the US resisted more and won two matches, but could not pick up the residue.
Jim Furyk's team required eight points in the twelve individuals played on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood won four points in a row as the first European rookie, while he and Molinari, who were baptized after a sensational weekend "Molliwood", won four points only as the second duo in the history of the Ryder Cup in their four opening matches.
After beating Woods and Patrick Reed in the fours, they perfectly harmonized and beat the enchanted Woods and the American newcomer Bryson Decambeau with an even more powerful 5&4.
Woods, who had dragged himself through two matches on Saturday, had his brilliance flashed occasionally, but now has lost 19 of his 29 matches in fours and fours and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who had rested during the four in the morning, returned and played the four games as partner of Henrik Stenson. They won 2&1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the number one and three of the world.
For Europe, however, on this pleasant windy day south-west of Paris, not everything ran according to their ideas.
The triple major winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the measuring bar for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
In the four, they won a tough 2&1 victory over the Spanish-playing Jon Rahm and Ian Paulter and beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy in 4&3 after losing the first two holes.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, it has only occurred twice that a team returned after it had gone into the individual with a backwardness of four points. However, as the title holder for Furyk’s team, an indecisive decision is sufficient to keep the trophy.
After they have been in second place for only two days, it does not look as if they could launch a counterattack on Sunday.
North Korea rejects unilateral disarmament without confidence
North Korea's Foreign Minister said on Saturday before the United Nations that continued sanctions would deepen their mistrust of the United States and that under these circumstances the country would not unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho said to the annual General Assembly of the World Organisation that last year North Korea had taken significant action on the basis of “good will”. For example, it stopped nuclear and rocket tests, dismantled the nuclear test site and committed itself to not increasing nuclear weapons and technologies.
"However, we do not see a corresponding response from the United States," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States there is no confidence in our national security, and under these circumstances we will by no means unilaterally disarm ourselves first."
While Ri confided in North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "phase-wise" approach to denuclearization in which North Korea was rewarded for successive steps, his statement seemed to be significant in that it did not reject unilateral denuclearization from the outset, as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first summit between a US President-in-Office and a North Korean leader on 12 June in Singapore. In this one Kim had pledged to work on the "Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula", while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea is seeking an official end to the Korean war that took place between 1950 and 1953, while the United States said that Pyongyang had to give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington also opposes demands for a relaxation of the strict international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insists on 'first denuclearization' and increases the pressure by sanctions to achieve its goal by force, and is even against the 'declaration of the end of the war'," said Ri.
“The assumption that sanctions can force us to kneel is a brain-pink of people who don’t know anything about us.
The problem, however, is that the continued sanctions deepen our mistrust."
Ri did not address plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. sovereign had highlighted at the United Nations at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the Minister pointed out three meetings between Kim and the South Korean Head of State Moon Jae-in in the past five months and added: "If South Korea were the other party in the denucleization issue instead of the USA, this would not have been the end of the denucleated Korean peninsula."
Nevertheless, the tone of Ris Speech was enormously different from his speech last year when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to target North Korea's missiles on the mainland of the United States after "the evil president" Trump Kim had called "the rocket man" on suicide mission.
This year, Trump, who had threatened with the "full destruction" of North Korea last year, praised Kim at the United Nations for his courage in the face of disarmament. However, he said that there was still a lot of work to be done and that the sanctions would have to remain in force until the denuclearization of North Korea.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he had no time frame for it: “Whether it takes two years, three years or five months – it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council must reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo, however, said to the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The enforcement of the sanctions of the Security Council must in any case be continued vigorously until we have achieved complete, final and verified denucleation."
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously strengthened the sanctions against North Korea to financially dry out Pjongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met Ri at the edge of the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not successful.
In July he said on his departure from Pyongyang that progress had been made only to be accused by North Korea hours later that he had made "walking-like demands".
North Korea praised this month at a meeting with Moon to dismantle a rocket base and an atomic complex when the United States took "respective measures".
He said that Kim had told him that the desired "corresponding measures" were security guarantees given by Trump in Singapore, as well as steps to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn in a course to sleep enough
A new course at Harvard University ensures that all students get more sleep in primary school this year. This is a measure against the spreading macho culture to stay awake with caffeine and learn about the whole night.
One scientist has found that students at the world's leading university are often unnecessary when it comes to paying attention.
The course was designed by Charles Czeisler, Professor of Sleep Medicine at Harvard Medical School and Specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital and is, in his opinion, the first such course in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a lecture on the effects of sleep deprivation on learning.
“In the end, a girl came to me and asked, ‘Why am I only learning about it now, in my last year?’
After their words no one had ever told her how important sleep is. That surprised me," he said to The Telegraph.
This year's first course explained to the students how the basics of good sleep habits contribute to academic and sporting performance and also improve general well-being.
Paul Barreira, Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Managing Director of the University's Health Services, said that the university decided to introduce the course after she found that students suffered from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section, the students see the picture of a room in a residential home and click on coffee cups, curtains, training shoes and books. They get information about the effect of caffeine and light as well as about the effects of sleep deprivation on the sporty performance and the importance of a sleep routine.
In another section, participants learn that long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes and cancer.
They are then encouraged to reflect on their daily routine by means of an interactive symbols map of the university site.
“We know that it will not change the behaviour of students immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know this – just as you have the right to know how smoking affects your health," Czeisler added.
The pride in pushing a "night shift" is still widespread, he said, adding that modern technologies and the ever-growing pressure on students made sleep deprivation a growing problem.
Sufficient sleep should be the "secret weapon" of all students against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said. Furthermore, weight gain could be avoided as sleep deprivation puts the brain in starvation mode, so that they are constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student from California studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to design the course. He had completed one of his courses in Harvard last year.
He said that the course opened his eyes and encouraged him to press for a university-wide course.
He hopes that in the next step all postgraduate students will be asked to complete a similar study programme before they begin their studies at the competitive university.
At Professor Czeisler's recommendation, students should be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light", which is based on electronic screens and LED lighting and can remove the circadian rhythm.
Livingston vs Rangers 1:0: Menga-Tor forces Gerrard's players
The Rangers lost another away game when Dolly Menga's hits for Steven Gerrard's disunited team meant a 0:1 defeat at Livingston.
The Ibrox team wanted to record their first away victory at St. Johnstone since the 4-1 Triumph, but Gary Holt's team added Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as a manager, so his team was eight points behind the leading hearts in the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga met seven minutes before the mid-term, and the low-inspired Rangers seemed to have no chance of compensation.
While the Rangers now fall to the sixth place, Livingston rises to the third place and lies behind Hibernian at the top of the score line.
The Rangers also threaten further trouble after Line judge Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound by an object apparently thrown out of the guest block.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that overtaken Ayr and reached the half-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, stayed with the same eleven Livingston players who dropped the Hearts in the last week, and should be thrilled as his well-trained team kept their opponent under pressure on step and step.
The Rangers dominated the ball ownership, but Livingston reached more if they had the ball.
They should have achieved a goal after only two minutes when Menga's first release led Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's Gate. However, the middlefield player missed his chance and shot next door.
Then a long release of Keaghan Jacobs reached Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner Alan Lithgow could only shoot past the back of the post.
The Rangers took control, but their game seemed more hopeful than convincing in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos was obviously of the opinion that after a quarter of an hour after a clash between him and Steven Lawless, he should have been punished, but arbitrator Steven Thomson did not allow the complaints of the Colombian.
The Rangers only reached two goals in the first half of the year, but the former Ibrox Gatekeeper Liam Kelly had little difficulty with Lassana Coulibaly's headball and a tame shot by Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livingston's hit in the 34th minute may not have been the result of the game, it is not to be denied that they had earned him alone for their hard work.
Once again, the Rangers could not deal with a ball shot by Jacobs in a standard situation.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher shot the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained calm and chose Menga for a simple graduation.
Gerrard traded for half time and exchanged Coulibaly for Ryan Kent. The change almost immediately showed effect when the winger put Morelos in position, but the impressive Kelly ran off his line to block the ball.
However, Livingston continued to get the guests to play exactly the game they are playing, with Lithgow and Halkett getting a long ball after each other.
Holt's team could have expanded their leadership in the last phase, but McGregor stood up and defended Jacobs before Lithgow shot a headball from the corner.
The Rangers exchange player Glenn Middleton also late demanded a penalty after a mix with Jacobs, but Thomson looked away again.
Almanach: The inventor of the violinist
And now a page from our Sunday Morning Almanac: On September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as the violin counter.
The violinist who has since become the standard element of science has also become a standard element of pop culture, for example in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado" with apparently unusual cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What is that all over the world?"
Rogers: “This is a violinist used to search for radioactive minerals such as uranium.
If you set up these headphones, you can hear the effects of radioactive radiation in the minerals."
Evans: ‘Actually, I hear a crack!’
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
However, the invention that bears his name lives on.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" degenerate cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" degenerate cells and destroy them.
The vaccine helps the immune system to detect degenerate cells as part of the treatment.
In the method, immune cells are taken from a patient that are modified in the laboratory.
These cells can "see" a lot of cancerous types of common protein and are then re-injected.
A test vaccine shows promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
The ovarian cancer of a woman treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to detect degenerate cells disappeared for more than 18 months.
In the method, immune cells are taken from a patient, which are modified in the laboratory so that they can "see" the many cancers common protein HER2. Then the cells are re-injected.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute of the United States in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "promotes the growth of various types of cancer", including breast, ovary, lung and intestinal cancer, as Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar method in which patients are taken from immune cells and taught to attack cancer cells has helped to treat a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West released a Pro-Trump-Tirade after his appearance at SNL and carried a MAGA cap ("Make America Great Again").
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was sunk at Saturday Night Live in the studio after he praised Donald Trump for a long time and said he wanted to take office as a presidential candidate in 2020.
After singing his third title of the evening, "Ghost Town", while wearing a Make-America-Great-Again cape, he continued with a skimp canonade against the Democrats and again stressed his support for Trump.
“I’m so often asked by whites, ‘How can you like Trump? He’s a racist.’
So if I were to worry about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
SNL started the show with a sketch with Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's statement before the Senate's judicial committee on the charges of sexual harassment raised by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although the recording of West's chimpetirade was not sent, it was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is not clear whether Rock wanted to make fun of the publication about West.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he had difficulty behind the stage because of his head covering.
“They harassed me behind the stage.
You said don't go out with the cap.
You harassed me!
And then they say I'm in a submerged area," he said according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see the sunken area?" He said that he would "put on my super-mancape, because that means you can't tell me what I have to do. You want it to go ahead with the world?
Try it with love."
His comments triggered at least twice the calls from the audience, and SNL contributors were embarrassed, Varyty reported. One person said the magazine: "It was dead quiet in the studio."
West was late to replace the singer Ariana Grande, whose former friend, the rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days before.
West confused many with a talk entitled "I Love it", in which he was dressed as a perrier bottle.
West received support from Candace Turner, the head of the conservative group TPUSA. She tweeted: "To one of the bravest spirits: THANK YOU TO HAVE THE MASS AGAINST YOU."
However, talkshow moderator Karen Hunter tweeted that West was just him and that was absolutely wonderful.
“But I do NOT want to reward anyone who, in my opinion, makes an ideology harmful to my community and gives of himself (by buying his music or his clothes or supporting his ‘art’).
He's free.
The same is true of us.", she added.
Before the show, the rapper had announced to Twitter that he had changed his name and was now "The being formally known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His rapper brother Snoop Dogg bore the name Snoop Lion, and of course Prince, the late music legend, changed his name to a symbol and then to "The Artist Formerly Known As Prince".

The charges will be reviewed by the Procuratorate.
"Game of Thrones" Star Kit Harington Attacks Toxic Manhood
Kit Harington is known for his role as a sword swinging Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series "Game of Thrones".
The 31-year-old actor, however, attacked the macho hero’s stereotype. He said that such roles on the screen would result in boys often feeling that they had to be strong to be respected.
In conversation with "The Sunday Times Culture", Harington said that he believed that something had gone wrong and asked how to solve the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo age.
Harington, who recently married Rose Leslie, who also participated in "Game of Thrones", 31 years ago, admitted that the solution to the problem was "very important".
"I personally find the question very important at the moment, what has gone wrong with the masculinity," he said.
"What have we taught grown men about the problem we are now observing?"
Harington believes that because of the very masculine characters, television may be partly responsible for increasing toxic masculinity.
He continued: “What is born, and what is learned?
What is taught on television and on the street that gives the boy the feeling of having to embody this particular side of a man?
I think this is really one of the big questions of our time: how do we change that?
For something has clearly gone wrong with the young men."
He also admitted in the interview that he would not participate in Prequels or Sequels of "Game of Thrones" after the end of the series next summer.
From November, Harington will be shown in a new edition of Sam Shepard's "True West", the story of a film producer and his brother, a robber.
The actor recently told him that the best thing for him was "Game of Thrones" was that he met his wife Rose.
"I got to know my wife on this show, so this way I got to know my future family and my life from now on," he said.
Rose Leslie played in the fantasy series Ygritte, the beloved of Harington's character Jon Snow, which was awarded with many Emmys.
In June 2018, they married Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced an increase of 14°% in the number of citizens living with HIV or AIDS.
According to health officials, more than 820,000 people are affected in the country.
Some 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
In contrast to the past, the transfer took place in the vast majority of new cases through sexual intercourse.
Up to now, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way had almost been reduced to zero, reported Chinese health officials at a conference in Yunnan Province.
In comparison, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS has increased by 100,000 in China.
The transmission of HIV through sex is an acute problem in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalised in China in 1997, but discrimination against members of the LGBT community should be widespread.
Due to the conservative values of the country, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry women.
Many of the disease transmissions are due to insufficient protection in sexual intercourse in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised, among other things, general access to HIV medicines to address the problem.
Maxine Waters argues that employees had the GOP Senators' data leaked, criticises "hazardous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
Maxine Waters, member of the U.S. House of Representatives, argued on Saturday that a member of her staff had published the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on the Members' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat believed that the claims of "ultraright-oriented" experts and websites would be spread.
"Lies, lies and even more horrible lies," said Waters in a statement on Twitter.
The information published is intended to include the private addresses and telephone numbers of the U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina as well as Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday. They were published during the hearing of a Senate Committee on the allegations of sexual misconduct raised against Supreme Court candidates Brett Kavanaugh by an unknown person in the government district.
The publication took place after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pondit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the contributions was assigned to Waters’ Office and published the information of a member of Waters’ staff, reported The Hill.
"This unfounded accusation is completely wrong and an absolute lie," continued Waters.
“The member of my staff – whose identity, personal data and security were compromised by these fraudulent and false accusations – was in no way responsible for the security of this information.
This unfounded accusation is completely wrong and an absolute lie."
Waters’ statement quickly triggered criticism online, also by Ari Fleischer, a former White House press spokesman.
"This dementia is angry," wrote butcher.
“This suggests that she does not have the right temperament to be a congressman.
People who are accused of something they have not done must not be angry.
They must not be defiant.
You must not question the accuser's motives.
You must be calm and quiet."
Butcher seemed to compare Waters’ response with the criticism of the Democrats against Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of having been too angry during the hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who takes part in the mid-term elections to replace Waters, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Great thing, if that's true," he tweeted.
Waters stated in her statement that her office had informed the competent authorities and law enforcement authorities of these fraudulent claims.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed," she continued, "and that they are held accountable for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to all members of my staff".
Criticism about "Johnny English – You live only three times" – weak espionage parody with Rowan Atkinson
It is now a tradition to look for Brexit references in every British-coloured new film. This also seems to be true for this revival of the "Johnny English" action comedy franchise, which began in 2003 with "Johnny English – The Spy, who published it" and in 2011 with "Johnny English – Now right" stutteringly revived.
Will an ironic self-parody on the subject of how obviously stupid we are, become a new export opportunity for the nation?
In any case, the license of the glamorous, Grimasse-cut and incompetent Johnny English was extended for the second time. His name signals more than anything else that he is a general comical creation for cinema visitors in the non-English-speaking world.
Of course, he is once again the clumsy secret agent, who thinks himself to be cool and worldly, while in reality he is made up of some clouseau, a pry Mr. Bean and a cliché of this boy, who contributed a single note to the title melody of "The Hour of the Winner" at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games in London.
In addition, the figure was originally based on the chaos of renegade travelers and international secret agents who Atkinson played in the now forgotten Barclaycard television commercials.
The last adventure of Johnny English has one or two nice moments.
I liked the way Johnny English approached a helicopter in a medieval armor and the rotor blades briefly tilted to his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comics is emerging, but the humor seems rather weak and strangely superfluous, especially because the "serious" film series such as "007" and "Mission Impossible" now offer self-confident comedian elements.
The humor seems to focus more on children than on adults, and for me Johnny English's crazy mischief is not as inventive and focuses like Atkinson's silent film game in the role of Bean.
The ever-present premise is that Britain is in great danger.
A cyber hacker infiltrated the super-secret British spy network and revealed the identities of all British agents in use, much to the miscarriage of the serving agent, a sadly small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last straw for the Prime Minister, an inflated and distressed figure who is already facing the complete collapse due to her political unpopularity: Emma Thompson gives her best with this quasi-teresa-May character, but the script doesn't give much of what she can work with.
Your secret service advisors inform her that all active spies have been deflected and therefore she has to get someone out of retirement.
This includes Johnny English himself, who is now working as a teacher on a trendy institution, but gives unofficial teaching in his work as an undercover agent. There are a few Gags here, as English offers an espionage academy reminiscent of "School of Rock".
English is brought back to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and reunited with his former hard-tested buddy Bough, who is played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine commander, a nervous woman of the higher society, in whose role Vicki Pepperdine is somewhat wasted.
So Batman and Robin, who in the secret service of your Majesty always make everything terrible wrong, are back in action. They encounter Olga Kurylenko’s beautiful Femme Fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister is becoming dangerous in the face of a charismatic tech billionaire, the dark Jason Volta played by Jake Lacy, who claims to be able to solve UK computer problems.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of grotesque jokes: Dressed as a waitress, they put a chic French restaurant on fire, they cause chaos as they smuggle on board Volta's luxury yacht, and English triggers pure anarchy when he tries to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta's house using a virtual reality headset.
In this last sequence, all registers are drawn, but as sympathetic and funny as they are, the subject is already dealt with in detail on children's television.
Pretty moderate.
Like the other Johnny-English films, I had to ask myself, "Can't the British film industry Rowan Atkinson give a role that really suits his talent?"
Labour disputes to work on a plan after which the British work four days a week, but are to be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is supposed to consider a radical plan that provides that the British work four days a week, but are paid for five days.
According to reports, the party wants business leaders to pass on to employees the savings made by the AI revolution (artistic intelligence) in the form of an additional day off.
This would have meant that employees would have had a three-day weekend but would still receive the same payment.
According to sources, the idea of the party's economic agenda and its plans to shift the balance in the country to the benefit of workers is 'fits'.
The transition to a four-day week was supported by the Trade Union Congress as an opportunity for workers to take advantage of the benefits of the changing economy.
A high - ranking Labour Party source told the Sunday Times: “A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
"A change will not occur overnight, but a four-day working week is an effort consistent with the Party's approach to restoring economic balance in favour of workers and with the Party's general industrial policy strategy."
The Labour Party would not be the first party to support such an idea. Already the Green Party promised the introduction of a 4-day week during the 2017 general election campaign.
However, the approach is currently not supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour Party spokesperson said: "A four-day week is not a party policy and it is not considered by the party."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell put his idea of a socialist revolution in the economy into practice at the Labour Conference last week.
McDonnell said he was determined to regain the power of "anonymous directors" and "profit makers" in public utilities.
The plans of the shadow chancellor also mean that the current shareholders of the water supply companies may not be able to retain their entire share, as a Labour government could carry out "deductions" because of alleged misbehaviour.
He also confirmed the corresponding plans to appoint employees to the boards of companies and set up Inclusive Ownership Funds to transfer 10 % of the equity of private companies to the employees who pay annual dividends of up to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy express themselves in the news magazine "60 Minutes", whether the investigation by the FBI in Kavanaugh could change their opinion
The FBI investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed a final vote on his appointment as Judge at the Supreme Court by at least one week and raises the question of whether the results of the authority could influence republican senators in order to gain their support.
In an interview on Sunday, 60-minute correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could reveal something that might eventually change her mind.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
“I informed the hearing that I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after that, this claim was made, and asked if he did.
He was determined, determined and unmistakable."
Graham's voice, however, seems to have been chiseled in stone.
"My opinion is clear as to Brett Kavanaugh, and it would have to burst a bomb," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett has disputed this vehemently," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And all those who called them could not confirm it."
It's 36 years now.
And I can't detect any changes."
What is the Global Citizens Festival and has been helped to reduce poverty in the context of this festival?
This Saturday, the Global Citizens Festival will be held in New York City, an annual music festival with an impressive line-up of stars and an equally impressive mission – to fight poverty in the world.
Tens of thousands will attend the Global Citizens Festival, which will take place this year for the seventh time, not only to experience the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the actual goal of the event: the fight against extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizens Festival, which took place for the first time in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project. As part of this project, an international interest group seeks to combat poverty by encouraging more and more people to participate actively in poverty reduction.
To get a free ticket for the event (the other option would be to buy a VIP ticket), you have to do a number of tasks. These include actions such as volunteering, communication with a leading politician worldwide (by email or telephone) or similar measures to raise awareness of the goal – the fight against poverty.
How successful is the project when you consider that Global Citizens will remain for 12 years to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of offering a cool free concert a sensible way to convince others that it is time to act, or just another case of so-called clickctivism – if you think you can change something by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Global Citizens announced that since 2011, the project has been able to record more than 19 million actions by its supporters and achieve various goals.
These actions should have helped to encourage leading politicians around the world to announce commitments and strategies worth more than 37 billion dollars, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the Group quoted 390 commitments and announcements resulting from its actions, of which at least USD 10 billion has already been paid out or contracted by fundraising.
According to the group's estimates, the secured funds have a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the most important commitments are the project The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and implementers based in the UK who have committed themselves to supporting children in their optimal development, and who have promised to help Rwanda with $35 million to combat malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the UK Government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history," said the Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The Group also announced that after more than 5,000 actions called on the UK to improve the nutritional situation of mothers and children, the government announced the financing of the project The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children and provide food interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the website, namely the question of why Global Citizens can fight extreme poverty,
they replied: “It will be a long and strenuous path with heights and depths.
But similar to the major civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will be successful, as we are stronger and more influential together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the artists who perform at this year's event in New York. Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman are also presenters.
The US could use the Navy for blockade purposes to obstruct Russian energy exports – Ministry of the Interior
According to Washington Examine, Washington can rely on the Navy if necessary so that energy from Russia does not reach the markets, including the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of State Ryan Zinke announced.
Zinc claimed that Russia’s use in Syria is a pretext to explore new energy markets. Russia is currently active at the invitation of the legitimate government in these areas.
"I think the real reason for Russia's use in the Middle East is the negotiation of new markets in the field of energy, just like in Eastern Europe," he said.
And according to the official, there are ways and means to deal with this.
"The United States, together with the Navy, can ensure that the sea roads remain open and block them if necessary to ensure that the energy from Russia does not reach the market," he said.
Zinc turned to the participants of the Consumer Energy Alliance event, a non-profit group that understands itself as the "voice of electricity consumers" in the United States.
He drew a comparison between Washington's approaches in dealing with Russia and Iran and noted that they are practically identical.
"The use and replacement of fuels is more or less the economic option in Iran and Russia," he said, while he referred to Russia as "One Trick Pony" with a fossil fuel-dependent economy.
The statements were made when the government under Trump was expanding the export of liquefied natural gas to Europe and thus replacing Russia, the far cheaper option for consumers in Europe.
To this end, the government officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" pipeline project Nord Stream 2, which, according to Trump Berlin, became the "capture" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North Stream 2 pipeline worth 11 billion US dollars, which is supposed to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is an exclusively economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's massive resistance to the project is due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we all believe that energy should not be used as a means of exerting pressure and that consumers can choose the suppliers themselves," said Russian energy minister Aleksandr Novak after a meeting with US energy minister Rick Perry in September in Moscow.
The USA has received counterwind from Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industrial organisation, the German Industry Association (BDI), has called on the US to stand out from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"It is a big problem if a third country interferes in our energy supply," says the BDI Board of Dieter Kempf after a meeting between Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren wants to "examine closely" a presidential candidate for 2020, says the Senator for Massachusetts
The Senator for Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren announced on Saturday that she would "examine" a presidential candidate after the mid-term elections.
During a Town Hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering a candidacy.
According to The Hill, Warren said it was time for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government, and that includes women at the top.
Warren plans to "examine" a presidential candidate after 6 November.
Warren said during the meeting that President Trump is leading this country in the wrong direction.
"I am extremely concerned about how Donald Trump deals with our democracy," she said.
In her criticism of Donald Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, Warren did not take a sheet at the mouth.
In a tweet on Friday, she announced that prior to the vote, of course, an FBI investigation is required.
However, a survey published on Thursday showed that the majority of the Warren electorate does not believe that it should run for 2020.
According to the poll of the Suffolk University Political Research Center and Boston Globe, 58 percent of the potential voters in Massachusetts said that the senator should not run.
32 percent of voters supported such a candidacy.
The survey showed more support for a candidacy of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent in favour of a potential candidacy, and 48 percent in favour.
Among the other names of prominent democrats eligible for a possible candidateship in 2020 are former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont, Bernie Sanders.
According to Associated Press, Biden announced that he would make an official decision by January.
Sarah Palin speaks on the Donald Trump-Ralley about post-traumatic stress disorder under which Track Palin suffers
Track Palin, 26, was in Iraq for a year.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
"What my son is going through, what he is going through, when he comes back, can imitate other families who feel the effects of PTBS and some of the wounds with which our soldiers return," she told the audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin referred to his arrest as an "elephant in space" and said about her son and other war veterans that they were coming back changed that they were coming back to breakers, that they were coming back and wondering if there was this respect for what other soldiers and pilots and any other member of the military had given to the country.
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, says Dan Bennett, a spokesman for Wasilla Police.
18 States and D.C. support a new asylum policy appeal
18 States and the District of Columbia support an appeal for a new US policy refusing asylum victims of gang activities or domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 states and districts filed a court expert statement on Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker who questions politics, reported NBC News.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace counter-session complaint filed by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy in August was not disclosed.
She announced that her partner "and his violent sons-in-law" abused her, but US officials rejected her application for asylum on July 20th.
She was arrested in Texas.
The prosecutors who support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where many people are applying for asylum in the United States, as nations struggling with great problems with criminal gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy lifted a decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals of 2014, which allowed illegal immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The Federal Advocate General of the District of Columbia, Karl Racine, said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "is ignoring decades of legislation at state, state and international level".
"The Federal Act requires that all asylum applications be assessed on the basis of the facts and circumstances of the application, and that court infringes this principle," was stated in the Court's expert statement.
Furthermore, the lawyers argued in the statement that the policy of refusing immigrants access to the country has an adverse impact on the economy in the United States, as immigrants could be more active as entrepreneurs and could provide the necessary labour.
In June, Federal Advocate General Jeff Sessions ordered that immigration judges no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and the violence of criminal gangs.
"Asylum exists for all those who leave their country of origin because they are persecuted or because of fear of race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political conviction," said sessions in his announcement of the policy of 11 June.
It was never the plan to defuse all problems by granting asylum, even all serious problems that people have to contend with every day worldwide.
Desperate attempts at rescue in Palu, as the number of victims of death in the race doubled over time
For the survivors, the situation became increasingly worse.
"It's all very tense," says 35-year-old Risa Kusuma, calming her little feverish son in a rescue center in the city center of Palu.
“Every minute a new ambulance comes with the dead.
Clean drinking water is scarce."
Residents returned to their destroyed houses to collect their wettest possessions and goods and to store everything they could find.
Hundreds were injured, and the hospital staff who were damaged by the 7.5-force earthquake were completely overwhelmed.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who took on vertebral fractures and a broken shoulder, remained outside the Palu military hospital, where patients were treated outside because of the continuing strong aftershocks.
With tears in his eyes, he told how the violent earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
“Everything went too fast.
I think I was trapped under the fallen walls," he told the Associated Press, adding that the reason for the stay in the city was a wedding.
“I heard the cries for help from my wife, but then there was peace.
I don't know what happened to my wife and my child.
I can only hope that they are in a safe place."
US ambassador accuses China of tyranny with 'propaganda claims'
A week after an official Chinese newspaper posted a four-page ad in an American daily newspaper announcing the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the U.S. ambassador in China accused Beijing of exploiting the American press for propaganda purposes.
USA Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to the paid supplement of China Daily in the Des Moines Register, the best-selling magazine in Iowa, after he accused China of interfering in the US Congressional elections on November 6, a charge that challenges China.
Trump's allegations that Beijing has tried to interfere in the US elections correspond to the announcement of US officials to Reuters; a new phase of an escalating campaign, triggered by Washington to exert pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to turn advertisements for the promotion of the economy, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in an extreme trade war, with tariffs on imports for both countries.
Chinese tariffs at the beginning of the trade war were to meet exporters in countries like Iowa who supported the Republican Party of Trump, said Chinese and US experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and former long-standing governor of Iowa, who exports large quantities of agricultural products to China, announced that Beijing has damaged workers, owners of agricultural holdings and companies.
China, according to Branstad in an opinion in the Sunday register of Des Moines, is now doubling this tyranny by posting propaganda ads in its own free press in the USA.
"With the spread of its propaganda, the Chinese government claims the American tradition of free expression and the independent press by switching paid advertising into the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, you will find only a limited number of votes against the newspaper-scene here in Beijing and will not find any real reflection of the different opinions that the Chinese might have about China's disturbing economic development, given that the media are firmly in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that one of China’s most famous newspapers did not accept the offer to publish his article. However, he did not mention the name of the newspaper.
Republicans smear voters from the mid-term elections with the debacle around Kavanaugh, warn observers
Since many of the most influential Republicans support and defend the candidates for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, in the face of several accusations of sexual violence, observers have warned of a counter-reaction during the forthcoming interim elections, which could in particular be based on women.
The mood in this regard was extremely tense, and most Republicans have already mentioned that they are continuing with a vote.
"These things cannot be undone," said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said that he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake's last-minute advance (R-Arizona) was sufficient for an FBI investigation to calm angry voters.
"Women do not forget what was yesterday, they do not forget it tomorrow, nor in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, the first consultant and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, according to the daily newspaper in Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, protesters in the hall area of the Senate called 'November is coming!' when the Republicans who controlled the Judicial Committee decided to hold Kavanaugh's nomination and, despite the statement made by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, reported Mic.
Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are an extremely important topic, said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political observer on the news page.
“People say it’s already high, that’s true.
But it could be higher, especially for voters in the suburbs and in younger voters, people between 18 and 29 who, although they do not like the president, often do not choose."
Even before Ford’s public statement detailing its allegations of sexual assault against the candidates of the Supreme Court, observers indicated that a counter-reaction could result if the Republicans advanced the confirmation.
"This situation is a mess for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former Chairman of the Republican National Committee at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It is not just about the vote of the body, the final vote or the review of Kavanaughs; it is also about the way the Republicans dealt with it and how they dealt with it," said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that supports the election of Democrats, to the news channel.
However, the Americans seem to disagree with whom they should believe on the basis of Ford and Kavanaugh's statements, with a slightly greater share on the latter's side.
A new survey by YouGov showed that 41% of the respondents were definitely or probably convinced of Ford's statement, while 35% indicated that they definitely or probably gave Kavanaugh faith.
Furthermore, 38% indicated that they believe that Kavanaugh was likely or definitely lying to his statement, while 30% indicated the same thing about Ford.
Following Flake's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford and at least another plaintiff, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford issued an oath last week before the Senate Justice Committee that she was attacked by the drunken Kavanaugh at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the candidate to the Supreme Court had exposed his genitals to her when she was at a party during her studies in Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to counter Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is currently launching a startup to establish a competition with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company based on the open-source Solid platform of Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to select where their data is stored and who gets access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee suggested that the intention behind Inrupt be the "world domination".
"We need to become active now," he said on the topic of startup.
"It is a historic moment."
The app uses Solid's technology so that users can create their own personal online data storage or a POD.
It can include contact lists, to-dos lists, a calendar, a music library and other tools for the private and corporate sector.
Similar to Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, all content is available in a browser and at the same time.
The special feature of the personal online data storage is that the user can decide only who can access which data.
The company describes this concept as personal strengthening and development of data.
According to the CEO of the company John Bruce, the idea behind Inrupt is that the company uses resources, processes and corresponding capabilities so that Solid is available to all.
The company currently includes Berners-Lee, Bruce, some developers who have been hired to work on this project, as well as a community of volunteer programmers. Furthermore, a security platform acquired by IBM is used.
At the beginning of this week, technology developers worldwide can create their own decentralised apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee announced that he and his team will not exchange views with Facebook and Google on whether a comprehensive change is to be made in order to completely reshape their entire business models overnight.
"We are not asking for their permission."
In a contribution on medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt has the task of providing commercial energy generation and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new, solid-based web.
In 1994, Berners-Lee redesigned the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been a major player in the debate on net neutrality.
Even with the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely confident about this new era of the Web," he added.
Priest Bernard Vann, wearer of the Victoria Cross during World War I, was honored
The only clergyman of the Church of England, who was awarded the Victoria Cross during World War I, was honored in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel and Priest Bernard Vann won the award because of his commitment to attack Bellenglish and Lehaucourt on September 29, 1918.
However, he was killed four days later by a sniper and never learned that he had won the highest British war award.
His two grandsons revealed a memorial stone at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Sunday.
One of the grandsons, Michael Vann, said that this act was full of symbolic power, since the memorial stone was revealed exactly 100 years after the heroic act for which his grandfather was awarded.
According to The London Gazette, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin on September 29, 1918; through dense fog and under heavy fire from field cannons and machine guns.
Later he pushed to the fire line and led the line forward with the "greatest courage" before he rushed ahead with a field weapon alone and turned off three of the military units.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was shot by a German sniper on October 4, 1918; a little more than a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were something he could never be justified, and at the same time something that makes you humble.
Together with his brother Dr. James Vann, he laid a wreath after the parade under the direction of the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann stated that he felt very honored to be able to participate in the parade, and added that the bravery of a real hero became visible mainly through the support of many people.
MMA fans stayed awake all night to watch Bellator 206, instead there was Peppa Pig
Imagine you stayed up all night to watch an exciting Bellator 206, and then you can't watch the main event.
The bill of San Jose contained 13 fights, including 6 on the main map, and was broadcast live all night in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6:00 p.m., just when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for their fight, the audience in the United Kingdom did not marvel when suddenly Peppa Pig was seen.
Some remained untouched after waking up to the early morning hours to see the battle in particular.
On Twitter, a fan described the change to the trick movie character as some kind of bad joke.
"Due to a government regulation, this content is not rated as youth-free, so it had to be changed to a children's broadcast at 6 a.m.," said Dave Schwartz, Senior Vice President of Marketing and Communications at Bellator when he was questioned about the transmission.
"Peppa, the pig, exactly."
The CEO of Bellator, Scott Coker, announced that the company will work out the schedule to take future UK viewers into account.
"I think the problem could be solved already in the repeat game," he said.
“But it is 6 a.m. on a Sunday at the audience in the UK, and we will not solve the incident until Sunday our time, Monday local time there.
But we'll stay on it.
There was a lot of communication at the time of the change. It was quite messed up and it wasn't always all nice.
We have tried to solve the problem and have assumed that it is a technical disturbance.
What was not the case was a problem on the part of the government.
I promise it won't happen again.
We will reduce it to 5 instead of 6 fights, as in the normal case, and we have tried to offer the fans the best possible experiences.
The whole situation is quite regrettable."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels "underlying" on the subject of sexuality
Tom Daley, who participated as a water jumper in various Olympic games, says that he grew up feeling that he was under the influence of everyone else because of his sexuality. But this feeling had motivated him to become so successful.
The 24-year-old said that he had only realized in the secondary school that he is different from others.
On the first radio 4 Desert Island Discs with Lauren Laverne, he said that he had voted on gay rights to encourage others.
He also thought that since he became a father, the victories at the Olympic Games are no longer so important to him.
The actual moderator of the long-term show, Kirsty Young, pauses for some months due to illness.
In the first show of Laverne he said that earlier he considered himself inferior compared to others, because love for boys and girls was socially totally unacceptable.
He said: "To date, feeling inferior and different from others is the reason for my power and strength and ultimately for my success."
He wanted to prove that he was a very special personality, not to disappoint anyone when his sexual orientation became known.
The two-time bronze medal winner at the Olympic Games is today a prominent LGBT activist and used his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to advance the decriminalization of homosexuality in other countries.
He said that he had spoken on this subject because, fortunately, he can live without restrictions and without discrimination and wants to give courage to others.
The three-time world champion fell in love with the US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013. Knowing to fall in love with a man was an absolute surprise to him.
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar winner in the previous year, but he shared that the age difference has never been a topic.
He thinks that if you had to go through so much as a child and adolescence – he took part in the Olympic Games for the first time with 14 and his father died of cancer three years later, it is hard to find someone of the same age with similar experiences.
Since June, the couple have a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley believes that his whole view has changed since then.
Last year, everything had turned out to be gold medals.
But for him there are now more important than Olympic gold medals.
His son Robbie is now his main winner.
He bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after the diagnosis of brain tumor.
Daley said that his father did not accept the approaching death, and one of the last things he asked for was the tickets for London in 2012, as he wanted to be there in front.
"I couldn't tell him he wouldn't be there anymore," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only after that did I finally realize that he was not invincible," he continued.
The following year, Daley won the bronze medal at the 2012 Olympics.
"I only knew that it was always my dream to dive in front of the local audience at Olympic games – that was madness," he said.
His first song selection – Proud von Heather Small – was also influenced by it. He heard the song in the run-up to the Olympic Games and still cared for goose skin.

Mickelson, who is currently not in shape, sits at the Ryder Cup on Saturday at the Replacement Bank
The American Phil Mikkelson will set a record for his 47th Ryder Cup game on Sunday, but he has to make a lot of effort so that the whole thing doesn't turn into a debacle.
Mickelson, who plays for the 12th time at the event, was sent to the reserve bank by Captain Jim Furyk for the Fourballs and Foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being at the center of the event as usual, the five times major winner spent his day in inciting others and working on his game, hoping to solve the problems that burden him.
Even at the height of his career, the 48-year-old Mikkelson was never the most direct golfer and thus no ideal occupation for the narrow Le Golf National golf course, where misguided balls are regularly punished.
And as if the place itself would not be discouraging enough, Mikkelson meets the perfectionist British open champion Francesco Molinari in the ninth game on Sunday, who joined Tommy Fleetwood, newcomer at these tournaments to win all four games this week.
If the Americans with four points left behind in the 12 single games put a hot start, Mikkelson's game could prove absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in Mikkelson and could not add much to it.
"He was completely aware of his role today, gave me a slap on my back and put his arm around me and thought he was ready for tomorrow," said Furyk.
“He has quite a lot of confidence.
He is one of the world's well-known personalities and has done so much for these teams in the past and this week.
I didn't think he was in two games.
I had imagined more, but that's how it went, and that's what we expected.
He wants to be there like anyone else."
Mikkelson will reach the Nick Faldos record for most Ryder Cup games played on Sunday.
It could mean the end of a Ryder Cup racetrack that never quite corresponded to the highlights of its personal record.
Mickelson can record 18 victories, had 20 defeats and reached seven half-times, although Furyk announced that his presence alone had enriched the team.
"He's funny and sarcastic, original and likes to make a few jokes, and he's a great person who's popular with the whole team," he said.
“I think the younger players were happy to get to know him a little more this week. It was fun to watch them.
He is a really interesting person who gives many impulses."
Captain Thomas Bjørn knows that it can soon be over with the lead
Thomas Bjørn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a great advantage that leads to the final single games in the Ryder Cup can quickly become an unpleasant situation.
The Dane debuted in 1997 in Valderrama, where a team led by Seve Ballesteros had a lead of five points compared to the Americans, but only barely crossed the finish line and led the lowest possible lead and won a win of 141⁄2–131⁄2.
“The idea remains that we had a big lead in Valderrama, we had a big lead in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but that was scarce,” said Bjørn (pictured in the photo), after seeing the 5–3 of the Class of 2018 both on Friday and yesterday to lead 10-6 at Le Golf National.
The experience shows me and all the team members that it's not over.
It's going to be all right tomorrow.
Get on the ground and do the right thing.
The whole thing's not over until the points are on the scoreboard.
We have a goal. We want to win this trophy, and right there our focus lies.
I've always said it, I'm concentrating on the 12 players on our side, but we're fully aware of what we're facing on the other side: the best players in the world."
Happy about the performance his players have performed on a difficult golf course, Bjorn continued: “I would never overstep that.
Tomorrow's gonna be another caliber.
Tomorrow the individual performances are in the foreground and that is a completely different thing.
It's great to work with a partner when things are going well, but if you're out there alone, you'll be tested to the limits of your skills as a golfer.
You have to make this clear to the players: get the best out of you tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind you and he must also get the best out of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his versus Jim Furyk will make sure that his players cut out better individually than in the team, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Furyk himself stood on both sides of those great turnarounds on the last tournament day. He stood in Brookline on the winner's side before standing on the losers' side after Europe's 'miracle of Medinah'.
"I remember every damn word," he answered the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain of the team in 1999, motivated his players before the last day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you’d like to take off the quick start you’ve seen in Brookline and Medinah.
When the momentum strikes in one direction, it puts the middle games under a lot of pressure.
We set up our team accordingly and send our boys out as we feel, you know, we're trying to enchant tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned the task of picking up the fight, he must play in the top game against Rory McIlroy, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Paulter as other Europeans in the upper half of the ranking.
"I chose the boys in this order, because I think it covers everything," said Bjorn about his selection for the individual meetings.
Germany's new warship again delayed
The newest frigate of the German Navy should have been put into service in 2014 to replace warships dating back to the time of the Cold War. However, according to local media, it is only delivered at the earliest next year due to faulty systems and rapidly growing costs.
The launch of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the flagship of the brand new frigates of the "Baden-Württemberg" class, was now postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the time that a military spokesperson was called.
The ship should have been put into service already in 2014, but the ambitious project was plagued by worrying problems after delivery.
The four ships of the Baden-Württemberg class ordered by the Navy in 2007 are to replace the old frigates of the Bremen class.
They should include a powerful cannon, a range of anti-flying missiles and target missiles as well as cover technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic reflection.
Another important feature is longer maintenance periods. It should be possible that the latest frigates do not have to return to their home ports for up to two years.
However, the ongoing delays can cause the state-of-the-art warships, which are supposed to represent Germany as a sea power, to be outdated at the time of their commissioning, says Die Zeit.
Last year the frigate F125, pursued by misfortune, got into the headlines when the German Navy officially refused to take off the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy returned a ship after its delivery to the yard.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media mentioned a number of significant "software and hardware errors" which would have rendered the new ship unusable in a combat situation.
Software problems are particularly serious, as ships of the Baden-Württemberg-Class are served by a crew of only 120 sailors, only about half as many as on the older frigates of the Bremen-Class.
It has also been known that the ship is far too heavy, which leads to performance losses and prevents the marine from carrying out upgrade measures in the future.
The 7000 tonnes of 'Rhineland-Pfalz' was apparently twice as heavy as ships of a similar class used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the costs of the entire project, including crew training costs, became a problem.
It seems that costs rose to stunning €3.1 billion, compared to the originally planned €2.2 billion.
The problems with the latest frigates are particularly important given the recent warnings that Germany's sea power is shrinking.
At the beginning of the year, Hans-Peter Bartels, German Bundestag's army officer, confirmed that the navy was "going out of the employable ships".
Bartels said that the problem got bigger over time, as old ships were taken out of service but no replacement ships had been provided.
He complained that none of the frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class could be taken from the Navy.
National Trust listens to the secret life of bats
In a property in the Scottish Highlands, new research will be carried out to show how bats use the landscape in food search.
It is hoped that the results will provide further insights into the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help to guide future nature conservation activities.
The study conducted by researchers at the National Trust for Scotland will track dwarf and mosquito bats as well as the brown Langohr and aquatic bats in Inverewe Garden in West Ross.
Special recording devices are placed at key positions on the plot to record the activities of bats throughout the season.
Employees of the NHS and volunteers will also conduct mobile investigations with portable detectors.
In a sound analysis of all recordings by experts, the frequency of bat calls is determined and the species is determined.
Next, a map and a habitat report are created to create a detailed picture of their behaviour at the landscape level.
Rob Dewar, nature conservation consultant for the NTS, hopes that the results will show which areas of the habitat are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
These data will help to determine the benefits of habitat management measures, such as the creation of meadows, and show how to obtain forest areas for bats and other related species.
The bat stocks in Scotland and the whole of the United Kingdom have decreased significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects sleeping places and leads to loss of living space.
Windwheels and lighting can also pose a risk, as can flycatchers and chemical treatment of building materials or attacks by house cats.
Bats aren't really blind.
However, their ears are more useful because of their nocturnal hunting habits than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echolocation to detect insects and obstacles in their trajectory.
The NTS responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout Scotland takes the theme of bats very seriously.
He has 10 trained experts who carry out regular examinations, inspections of sleeping places and sometimes rescue measures.
The organization has even set up Scotland's first and only bat reserve in the Threave plant in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's 10 bat species.
Property manager David Thompson explains that the property is the ideal habitat for them.
"Here in Threeave we have a great area for bats," he explains.
“We have the old buildings, many old trees and an excellent habitat.
But there are many things we do not yet know about bats, so here and on other goods we are doing these works that will help us learn more about what bats need to feel comfortable."
He stressed the importance of excluding the presence of bats before maintenance work in the goods, since it was possible that the unwanted destruction of a single nesting area could kill up to 400 females and juveniles and destroy the entire population on site.
Bats are under protection and it is illegal to kill, harass or destroy them or their nesting grounds.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish official of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the population to help.
She explains: 'We still have to learn a lot about bats and in many of our species we do not know how their populations are.'
Ronaldo fights rape charges while his lawyers want to sue the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo referred to rape charges against him as "fake news" and said that people want to be "famous" by using his name.
His lawyers are planning to sue the news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the accusations.
The stormer of the national team of Portugal and Juventus Turin was accused of having raped an American named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He allegedly then paid her $375.000 to buy her silence on the incident, says Der Spiegel on Friday.
In a Instagram live video about his 142 million followers, the 33-year-old Ronaldo named the reports "Fake News" only hours after their release.
“No, no, no, no, no.
What they reported today: Fake News," said the five-time winner of the Ballon d’Or in the camera.
“They want to make a profile by using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous with my name, but that's part of the job.
I am a happy man and everything is good," the player added smilingly.
Mr Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue the mirror for the accusations they have made, according to Reuters, as 'inadmissible reporting on suspicions in the field of privacy'.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player claimed compensation for "moral damage at a level equivalent to the severity of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident is said to have occurred in 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After they met in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went to the player's room, where he allegedly raped them anal according to documents filed with Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo went to his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was "99 percent a good guy" who was "one percent" dead.
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the two had sex, but say it had been agreeable.
Mayorga also claims that she had gone to the police and had her injuries taken in a hospital, but later opted for an out-of-court agreement, because she had "anxiety for retribution" and was concerned about being "publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old said that she is now trying to cancel the agreement, as she is still traumatized because of the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to change from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged incident, and this summer he made a 100 million Euro deal with the Italian giant Juve.
Brexit: The United Kingdom would “repent forever” the loss of car manufacturers
The United Kingdom would "repent forever" if, after Brexit, it lost its status as a world leading car manufacturer, said Minister of Economy Greg Clark.
He also said that it was "disquieting" that Toyota UK told the BBC that it would temporarily interrupt production at the plant in Burnaston at Derby, should Britain leave the EU.
"We need a deal," said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer stated that the influence of delays at the border in a no-deal Brexit could lead to job losses.
Last year, the plant in Burnaston, where Toyota's product lines Auris and Avensis are produced, produced almost 150,000 vehicles, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"I am convinced that we will experience production stops at our plant at the end of March with an uncontrolled Brexit," says Marvin Cooke, Toyota's Managing Director in Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also raised concerns about a hard EU exit without agreement and its impact on cross-border trade.
BMW says, for example, that it will close its mini factory in Oxford after Brexit for a month.
The main concerns, according to car manufacturers, are related to risks within the supply chain of a hard Brexit.
Toyota's manufacturing plant is operated on a "just-in-time" basis, which means that the parts are delivered every 37 minutes by suppliers from both the UK and the EU to manufacture the cars on order.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there could be interruptions to the borders that could lead to delays and bottlenecks in the parts according to the industry.
It was impossible for Toyota to maintain a stock at the Derbyshire plant that would last longer than a day, the company explained why production had to be interrupted.
Clark stated that Theresa Mays Chequers plan on the future relationship with the EU is "exactly designed to avoid such controls at the border".
"We need a deal. We want the best deal, which, as I said, allows us not only to enjoy the current success, but also to seize this opportunity," he said in the BBC Radio 4 show today.
"The findings not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers show that we must be able to continue the very successful supply chains so far."
Toyota could not indicate how long production would have to be interrupted, but warned in the long run that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and eventually lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and who is the highest official of the Unite union, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “My experience of these jobs will never come back once they are gone.
One government speaker said: 'We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU'.
Trump's planned meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again according to the White House
Donald Trump's important meeting with Deputy Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein could be 'moved for another week', while the dispute over the candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, continued, it was called from the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein has overseen the work of the Special Investigator Robert Mueller, who investigates the elections by Russia, links between Trump's consultants and Russia, and a possible judicial barrier by the president.
The question of whether Trump would fire the Deputy Minister of Justice, thereby jeopardizing Mueller's independence, has been the subject of rumors in Washington for a month.
At the beginning of the month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was addressing the possibility of secret record of his talks with Trump and the resignation of the president by means of the 25th Constitutional Supplement.
Rosenstein denied the report.
However, he went to the White House last Monday, while new reports on his alleged resignation became known.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was present at the UN General Assembly in New York at that time, was announced for the next Thursday,
Trump stated that he would prefer not to release Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to prevent it from colliding with the hearing before the U.S. Senate Justice Committee, in which both Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who had accused him of sexual abuse, said.
On Friday, Trump arranged a one-week FBI investigation of the allegations against Kavanaugh, thereby delaying the full vote of the Senate.
Trump's press spokeswoman Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
She replied to a question about the meeting with Rosenstein: “A date has not yet been set for this, it may be this week, but I can also imagine that it will be postponed for another week, given all the things that are going on with the Supreme Court.
But I always like to keep the press up to date."
Some reporters would probably contradict this claim: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since 10 September.
Moderator Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders explained that the low frequency of press conferences was not due to a disapproval of the TV reporters' 'effect hashing', but admitted: "I would not deny that they are acting in an effective manner."
She then claimed that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
The President made more question-and-answer rounds than any President before him," she said, without providing precise evidence: 'We have looked at these figures.'
There will still be press conferences, according to Sanders, but it is “if the press has the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, but far better than to talk to me.
We often try to do this and you have seen that we have done this often in recent weeks, and that will take the place of the press conference if you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly accepts questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Press conferences with him alone are rare.
In New York, the president may have shown why this is the case when he made a rowing and sometimes bizarre appearance in front of gathered reporters.
Minister for Health writes about Brexit concerns about EU workers in the Scottish NHS
The Minister for Health addresses people from EU countries working in Scotland's National Health Service (NHS) to express the country's gratitude and to express their wish that they remain in the country after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before the UK left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already declared itself ready to bear the cost of applications for residence permits for EU citizens working in the decentralised public service of Scotland.
Freeman wrote in her letter: “During the summer, the exit negotiations between the UK and the EU were continued and decisions are expected this fall.
However, the UK government has also reinforced preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I am aware of the distressing times this must be for all of you.
That is why I wanted to express once again how much I value the contribution of each and every employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from all over the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health care and thus benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is fully your home and we would be very happy if you would stay here."
Christion Abercrombie was subjected to an emergency surgery after a head injury
According to Mike Organ of Tennessee State, the linebacker of Tennessee State Tigers Christion Abercrombie was subjected to an emergency operation on Saturday at the 31-27 defeat against Vanderbilt Commodores.
Rod Reed, the head coach of Tennessee State, explained that the injury occurred shortly before the mid-term break.
"He came to the sideline and just collapsed there," said Reed.
Trainers and medical staff supplied abercrombie on the sideline with oxygen before he was placed on a carrier and transported for further investigations.
A spokesperson from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had left the surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "no details of the type or extent of the injury are yet known" and Tennessee State tries to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a so-called Redshirt, plays with Tennessee State in his first season after switching from Illinois.
Before leaving the game on Saturday, he recorded a total of 5 Tackles, increasing his total to 18 Tackles in the season.
Foreign investors will have to pay higher stamp tax for the property purchase in the United Kingdom
Investors from abroad will have to pay a higher stamp tax for the purchase of real estate in the UK in the future.
This step is to curb Jeremy Corbyn's campaign for young voters
The increase in stamp duty will affect all those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The Ministry of Finance expects additional revenue of up to 120 million pounds per year to help homeless people
Theresa May will announce today that foreign investors will have to pay a higher stamp fee if you buy real estate in the United Kingdom, with the additional income to benefit homeless people.
This step represents an attempt to curb Jeremy Corbyn's success among young voters, who promises to provide more affordable living space and to take top earners in line.
The increase in stamp duty is levied on individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom and the additional revenue is to be allocated to the government campaign against homelessness.
The surcharge, which is charged in addition to the current stamp tax and including the increase introduced two years ago to second apartments and residential properties left for rent, could amount to up to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance calculates by the step with additional revenue of up to 120 million pounds per year.
An estimated 13 percent of newly built properties in London are purchased by investors who are not based in the United Kingdom, thereby increasing prices and making it more difficult for first-time buyers to take a foothold in the real estate business.
Many prosperous areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become "spirit cities" due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the United Kingdom.
The new strategy will follow only a few weeks after Boris Johnson has voted for a reduction in stamp taxes to allow more young people the first home.
He accused construction companies of keeping up real estate prices by buying land without using it, and urged Theresa May to give up quotas on affordable housing to end Britain's 'housing shame'.
Opposition leader Corbyn announced a striking series of proposals for housing reforms ranging from a lease price commitment to a ban on housing without a reasonable reason.
He also wants to grant city councils more powers in the construction of new apartments.
May said: “Last year I said that I would devote my time as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream, according to which life should be improved from generation to generation.
And that means repairing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who live and work here and want to build a life.
However, it may not be right for people who do not live in the UK, as well as for companies based abroad, to buy real estate as well as for hardworking British citizens.
The dream of home has become too distant for too many people and the unworthiness of homelessness remains too great a problem."
Jack Ross: ‘My biggest goal is to manage Scotland’
Jack Ross, the head of Sunderland, says that it is his “greatest goal” to become the manager of the Scottish team at some point.
The 42-year-old shooter enjoys the challenge of immersing the club from the north-east of England's new life, which is in third place in League One and is missing the top three points.
He moved to the stadium of Light this summer after taking St. Mirren back to the first Scottish league in the last season.
“I wanted to play as a player for my country.
I made it to the bank and that was it," said Ross of the BBC Scotland Sports Sound show.
“But as a child, I have often seen Scotland playing in Hampden with my father, and that’s something that always drags me back.
However, this option would only come if I were successful in club management."
Ross' predecessors in the role of manager of Sunderland include Dock Lawyer, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Alloa Athletic stated not to be afraid to step into the footsteps of such established names at such a club after he previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
At the moment, my success will be measured by whether I can take the club back to the Premier League.
In view of the structure and possibilities of this club, he is no doubt a member of the Premier League," he explained.
"It is not an easy task to get him there, but I would probably only consider my time here as a success if I brought the club back there."
Ross can have a first three-year management career, after a phase as Deputy Head of Dumbarton and a 15-month position as a coach in Hearts.
Then he helped Alloa recover from the delegation to the third league and helped St. Mirren from the edge of the delegation to win the championship in the following season.
Ross says that he now feels more comfortable than ever before in his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"This was probably a real scapegoat," he recalls when he assumed the responsibility of Alloa.
“I really think management was the right thing for me, more than games.
It sounds funny, as I didn't do bad things, could live well and experienced some very pleasant high stages.
But playing can be hard.
There's a lot of things you have to go through every week.
I still do this through the stress and pressure in my job, but management feels right.
I've always wanted to manage and now I'm doing it. I've never felt so comfortable in my skin all my life as an adult."

The perfect time for a glass of beer is Saturday at 17:30, so a study
The heat wave in the summer has missed the revenue of Britain's criss-crossing pubs, while restaurant chains have come under greater pressure.
Pub and bar companies recorded sales growth of 2.7 percent in July. According to statistics, revenue at restaurants fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin of the CGA Business Advisory Board, which compiled the figures, said: “Anhalting sunshine and England’s longer than expected participation in the World Cup meant that July followed a similar pattern as the previous June, where Pubs were able to record sales increases of 2.8 percent. However, the restaurant met even harder.
The decrease of 1.8 percent recorded by the restaurant industry in June continued to increase in July.
Pubs and bars with a focus on drinks showed by far the best performance, with a land-adjusted sales trend that increased higher than it did at the restaurants.
Pubs with focus on food also suffered in the sun, but not as drastically as the restaurant operators.
It seems like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In the managed pubs and bars, sales of drinks rose by 6.6 percent in the month, while sales of food fell by three percent."
Paul Newman, of the analysts for the recreational and restaurant industry RSM, said: “These results continue the trend we have been able to observe since the end of April.
The weather and the influence of important social or sporting events remain the main factors for sales in the out-of-home market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to face problems, but sales losses of 4.8 percent will be particularly painful compared to the previous year in addition to continuing cost pressure.
The long, hot summer could not have come at a worse time for companies with a focus on food, and it remains to be seen whether the more temperate temperatures in August will provide the urgently needed resuscitation."
Total sales growth for pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 percent in July and reflected the decline in brand rollouts.
The industry sales monitor Coffer Peach Tracker for the pub, bar and restaurant sector in the UK collects and analyzes performance data from 47 active companies with combined sales of over 9 billion pounds and is the recognized industry benchmark.
One in five children has secret accounts with social media that hide it from their parents
A study shows that every fifth child, some just 11 years old, has secret accounts on social media that keep it secret from parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 students in secondary schools has found an increase in so-called "Fake Insta" pages
The message sparks fears that sexual content will be posted
Twenty percent of the students said they had a "main account" to show it to their parents
One in five children, some just 11 years old, creates accounts on social media that can keep it secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 students in secondary schools showed a rapid increase in so-called "Fake Insta" accounts, a link to the Photo-Sharing website Instagram.
The message sparks fears that sexual content will be shared.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a clean "main account" that they could show their parents, but also own private accounts.
A mother who ran into the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who called on the other to "rape me."
The study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference (HMC) of Independent Schools found that 40 percent of 11 to 18 year olds had two profiles, half of which admitted to own private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, chairman of the HMC, said: "It is disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eilidh Doyle becomes "voice of athletes" in the Scottish Sports Council
Eilidh Doyle was elected as a non-executive member of the Council of Scottish Athletics Association at its annual general meeting.
Doyle is Scotland's most excellent athlete, and Chairman Ian Beattie described the election as a great opportunity for sports officials to benefit from their extensive international experience over the last decade.
"Eilidh is respected in the athletics community of Scotland, Great Britain and the world and we are sure that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly from their choice of council," says Beattie.
Doyle said: "I am looking forward to acting as the voice of the athletes and hope that I can make a real contribution and conduct sports in Scotland."
The American, who won the distance of more than 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, named four Olympic gold medals in total and who now often appear as a BBC expert, could no longer run after a temporary bleeding disorder.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk anymore.
The doctors say that no one can tell if or how far I'm going to be healed.
It was hard work, but I completely recovered, learned to run again and do mobility exercises today!
Thank you for the encouraging news!"
An advertisement for milk pumps that compares mothers with cows provides excitement in the net
A manufacturer of milk pumps provided excitement in the network with an advertising clip in which nursing mothers are compared to the milking of cows.
In order to market the 'first low-noise portable milk pump worldwide' according to its own specifications, the manufacturer of consumer technology Elvie published a non-serious music video to emphasize the freedom which gives the pump to nursing mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn filled with hay with cows in the background to a song that contains lines of text such as: "Yes, I'm milking, but you don't look at me" or "if you haven't noticed, these are not udders but my breasts."
The chorus continues: "Pump it out, pump it out, I feed the babies, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my ladies."
However, the advertising published on the company's Facebook page has triggered a controversy on the network.
With 77,000 accesses and hundreds of comments, the video encountered mixed reactions among the audience, many of whom say that it is harmless to the "fears" of the dairy industry.
“It was a very bad decision to apply for this product with cows.
Like us, they must become pregnant and bear a calf in order to produce milk, with the difference that their boys will be taken away within a few days of birth," said a comment.
Elvie's milk pump fits discreetly into a still bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment was: “Explainably traumatic for mother and baby.
But hey, why don't we use them to apply for a milk pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Another person added: "Such a foreign advertising of reality."
Others defended the advertising and a woman admitted that she found the song "urcomic".
“I think that’s a brilliant idea.
I would have bought one if I were still breast-feeding.
When I was pumping, I felt just like a cow.
The clip is a little crazy, but I'm not trying to overinterpret it.
This is a brilliant product," wrote one person.
Another person commented: 'This is a funny advertisement directed at mothers who use milk pumps (often at the workplace or on toilets) and feel like 'cows'.
This is not advertising for or against the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, the group reveals to women that everyone has danced with the discreet pumps in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the realization that many women who use milk pumps indicate that they feel like dairy cows.
Elvie's pump, however, is completely silent, has no wires or hoses and fits discreetly into a still bra, giving women the freedom to move, keep their babies or even go out during the pumping process.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother, said: “The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a daring and provocative market launch.
By comparing breast-feeding mothers with dairy cows, we wanted to put milk pumps and all the related challenges at the centre of our lives, while at the same time presenting in a entertaining and understandable way the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump allows.
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump got into the headlines.
During London Fashion Week, designer Marta Jakubowski released a double mother on the Catwalk while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children were quietly taken to a tent town on the Texan border
The number of immigrant children interned is as high as never before, although the number of border crossings per month has remained relatively similar, including as intensified rhetoric and measures by the Trump government have made it more difficult to accommodate children with caregivers.
Traditionally, most caregivers themselves were illegal immigrants and are now afraid to become even the target of an expulsion when they sign up to take up a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential caregivers and other adult members of their households would have to give their fingerprints and share these data with immigration authorities.
Last week Matthew Albence, a high-ranking official of the Customs Office Immigration and Customs Enforcement, declared before Congress that the Authority had arrested dozens of people who had applied for the care of unaccompanied minors.
The authority later confirmed that 70 percent of the arrested persons had no prior records in the criminal record.
“Nearly 80 percent of people who are either self - carers or members of a caretaker’s household are illegally staying in the country and a large proportion of them are punishable foreigners.
That is why we will continue to follow these people," said Albence.
In order to deal more quickly with children’s cases, officials introduced new rules, which according to the staff of the accommodation of some children required to appear in court within one month instead of 60 days after the detention, which was the standard before.
Many will appear by video and not personally in order to stand in front of an immigration judge for their legal status.
If negative decisions are made, the person is quickly expelled.
The longer these children remain in custody, the more likely it is, according to the data provided by the accommodation staff, as well as reports that have become known from the system over the last month, that they become fearful and depressed, which can lead to violent outbursts or outbreak attempts.
Defenders say that these concerns are heightened by a larger facility such as Tornillo, as there are signs that a child has problems being more easily overlooked due to the size.
They also explained that it could strengthen the trauma that many of the children already suffer if they were taken to a tent town without emotional preparation or enough time to say goodbye to friends.
Syria calls on American, French and Turkish ‘crew troops’ to withdraw immediately
In a speech before the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on the Syrian refugees to return home, although the civil war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, said that the foreign forces were illegally on the Syrian soil with the pretext of fighting terrorism and were "treated accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he explained to the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where since 2011 more than 360,000 people have died and millions more have been expelled from their homes.
He said that Damascus "will continue to fight this sacred battle until all Syrian territories are cleared" both by terrorist groups and by 'any illegal foreign presence'.
The United States has stationed about 2000 soldiers in Syria who mainly train and advise both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1000 ground troops in the war-torn country.
Regarding the refugees, Moualem stated that the conditions for their return were given and he accused "some Western countries" of "promoting irrational fears" of deterring refugees from going home.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to enable return," he said.
"They are actually politicizing a purely humanitarian matter."
The United States and the European Union warned that no aid would be granted for Syria as long as there was no political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats stated that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on a buffer zone in the last major Rebellenhochburg Idlib represents the opportunity to advance political talks.
The deal between Russia and Turkey turned a broad-based offensive of the Syrian forces supported by Russia to the province where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed his hope that military action against jihadists, including fighters from the Nusra Front, allied to Al-Qaeda, would be "extinguished".
UN representative Staffan de Mistura hopes to be able to convene soon the first meetings of a new committee consisting of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem called the terms of the Syrian government for participation in the committee and stated that its work should be limited to the "revision of the articles of the current constitution" and warned of interference.
Why Trump Will Win His Reelection
With this logic, Trump would win his re-election in 2020, should not, as many liberal spectators probably hope, terminate his presidency prematurely or a scandal.
This would undoubtedly be 'the most dramatic finale of a presidency of all time'.
So far, there are no signs that the audience would be tired.
Since 2014, CNN has more than doubled its commissioning rates to 1.05 million at the best transmission time and almost tripled it to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News averages 2.4 million viewers at the best broadcast time, compared to 1.7 million four years ago. MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” led the turn-on rates to 3.5 million viewers on evenings with important news.
"It's like a fire that magically attracts people, because it's something we don't understand," says Neal Bear, showrunner of the drama series "Designed Survivor" on the TV channel ABC about a cabinet member who will be president after an attack destroys the capitol.
Nell Scovell, an old comedy writer and author of the book "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club" has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the election in 2016.
The driver told her he'd pick Trump.
She asked him why.
“He said, ‘because he’s making me laugh’” Scovell told me.
The chaos is entertaining.
Of course, the stories from Washington, unlike anything on television, can determine the future of the fundamental decision on abortions Roe v. Wade, the possible merger of families and the health of the global economy.
Disabling is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can afford.
And yet it is also a matter of being an informed citizen when one becomes aware of having already six hours of an expert round that discusses about Bob Woodward's use of sources from the so-called "Deep Background" for his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's 15,000 dollar expensive bomber jacket made of ostrich leather (according to Washington Post a "piece of clothing rich in self-esteem") or the effects of Stormy Daniel's ripple description of Trump's, um, anatomy.
For my part, Super Mario will never be able to see again with the same eyes.
"A part of what he does can be felt like a reality show he sets out to do every night," says Brent Montgomery, chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the series "The Three of the Pfandhaus", about Trump's rotating occupation and daily actions (break a dispute with the football league NFL from the fence, Kim Jong-un praises).

When I reached Fleiss this week, it was sunny 27 degrees in front of his house on the north coast of the Hawaiian island of Kauai, but he crept in and looked at MSNBC while recording CNN at the same time.
He simply could not get away from the screen, not if judge candidate Brett Kavanaugh was about to testify before the Senate's Committee on Justice and the future of the Supreme Court was at stake.
“I remember when we did all these crazy shows back then and people said, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization’,” Fleiss told me.
"I thought that was some kind of joke, but it turned out they were right."

Donation money floods the tightest race for seats in Congress at the mid-term elections
It is hardly surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania is flooded with donations, thanks to the new borders of the electoral district, which led to two members in the race to the same seat.
The recently redrawn suburb district in Pittsburg has led the Democratic Conor Lamb who won his seat in another district during a special election in the previous spring.
Lamb is taking action against another official, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is in sharp overlap with the new 17th district.
The cards were redrawn after the Supreme Court of the State of Pennsylvania decided in January that the old districts were violated the Constitution and manipulated to the benefit of Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district triggered an exchange of electoral funding between the major financial weapons of the parties, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a tight victory in a well-respected special election in March around the 18th constituency of the state.
This seat was held over a decade by a Republican and Trump won the lead there with 20 percentage points.
Politexperts give the Democrats an easy lead.
The US tested El Salvador's punishment for its support for China, but then turned back
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama Beijing had already recognized without encountering great resistance from Washington.
Trump made a friendly meeting with the President of Panama Juan Carlos Valero in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until partners threw out the management team of the Trump Organization.
Officials of the US Ministry of Foreign Affairs have decided to withdraw the heads of all American foreign representations from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of 'the recent decisions to cease recognising Taiwan', says Heather Nauert, Minister for Foreign Affairs, in an opinion at the beginning of the month.
However, only in the case of El Salvador was consideration given to penalties, which in 2017 received an estimated $140 million in American aid, including for drug control, development and economic assistance.
The proposed sanctions, including cuts in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high levels of unemployment and murder.
As internal meetings progressed, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity, which should follow a similar meeting in the previous year and represented a step forward in their efforts to stop migrants from moving towards the United States.
In mid-September, however, high government officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place and so effectively ended the consideration of sanctions for El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now scheduled to speak at the conference that was set up in mid-October, in order to provide, according to diplomats, a sign of the importance that the Government of the Assembly has given.
The three American diplomatic representatives have returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and to the Dominican Republic, without new sharp messages or penalties from Washington.
A government spokesperson from John Bolton rejected an opinion on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed on the condition of anonymity, to comment on the internal discussions.
Their comments were confirmed by a government-related external analyst who also spoke under the condition of anonymity.
Learn From History
The next big surprise could be the report by Special Investigator Robert Mueller on Trump's possible legal disability, for which there is now sufficient evidence in the public domain.
Mueller now allegedly also investigates whether Trump's campaign team has conspired with Russia in his attack on the American elections.
Should the majority of Congress change, Trump sees himself confronted with an organ that forces him to account, precisely at the time when he comes by to stand before the voters again; and possibly before a jury.
These are many ‘if’ and I do not want to say that the Donald Trump case, or the one of his European counterparts, is inevitable.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we have to make decisions that will affect how long the battle will last.
In 1938, German officers were prepared to perform a coup d'état against Hitler if the West had only resisted him and supported the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We failed, and missed a way to avoid the years of barbarism that followed.
The course of history revolves around such turning points and the unstoppable march of democracy is either accelerated or delayed.
The Americans are facing several such turning points.
What if Trump releases Deputy Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein, that is, the man who decides on the future of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in Devil's kitchen since this newspaper last year reported that he proposed to record the president secretly and speculated on whether he was unfit for office.
Rosenstein denies the representation of the New York Times.
“How will we respond if the newly ordered FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair or is confirmed despite credible accusations of sexual abuse and false statements in the office?
And above all, are we going to vote in the mid-term elections for a congress that is forcing Trump to answer?
If we fail in these tests, we will have a long winter ahead.
But I don't think we're going to fail because of what I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same regime that once occupied my embassy home.
She survived, immigrated to America and sent me off 60 years later to light Sabbath candles on the table with the hook cross.

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers optimistic before the match against Vienna
The Rangers receive Rapid Vienna on Thursday knowing that a victory against the Austrians after the impressive rems against Villareal in Spain at the beginning of the month will put them in a good position for the qualification of the Group G of the European League.
Due to a knee injury, Graham Dorrans could not appear up to 2-2 equal to Villareal, but he believes that the Rangers can use this result as a jumpboard for bigger ones.
"This was an important point for us because Villareal is very good," said the 31-year-old.
We went into the game with the conviction that we can do something about it and we drove home with one point.
Perhaps we could have won in the end, but overall a decision was probably a fair result.
They probably dominated in the first half, but we worked in the second half and then were the better team.
Thursday will be another big European evening.
Hopefully we will get three points, but this will be a heavy game, as they have achieved a good result in the last game. But I am sure that we can get through this with the audience behind us and achieve a positive result.
Last year was definitely difficult, with everything that happened to my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now there is some kind of well-being factor.
The team is good and the boys are really good at it; the training is good.
Hopefully we can look forward now, leave the last season behind us and be successful."
Fear of old age leads to sleepless nights in women.
Although the survey participants knew exactly how to care for them, only a few spoke about it with their family members.
About half of the participants in the Nationwide study reported talking to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said to talk to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but don't take the necessary steps to conduct the conversation," says Holly Snyder, vice president of the National Life Insurance Division.
You should start with this.
Talk to your spouse and the children: You cannot prepare your family to take care of you if you do not express your wishes in time.
Work with your advisor and your family to discuss where and how you want to be cared for, as these decisions can be an important factor in determining the costs.
Bring your financial advisor on board: Your consultant can also help you find a way to finance these expenses.
Your financial decisions for long-term care can include a traditional care insurance, a hybrid capital-forming life insurance to help cover these costs or self-insurance with your own assets - as long as they have the money.
Work out your legal documents: Avert legal disputes at the last minute.
If you set up a health care authority so that you instruct a trusted person to monitor your medical care and ensure that health professionals comply with your wishes, you should be able to express them yourself.
Consider also a proxy for your finances.
You select a trusted person who makes financial decisions for you and ensures that your bills are paid, you should not be able to do so.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your older parent has a medical emergency and is on her way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medication or allergies?
Note these details in a written plan so that you are ready.

Man in Ilfracombe shot several times with air gun
A man was shot several times with an air gun when he went home from work with friends.
The victim, a man in the forties, was in the Oxford Grove area in Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Officials described the shots that took place around 2:30 a.m. as "willful act".
The victim didn't see the attacker.
His injuries were not life threatening and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a strong earthquake and a tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to the authorities. The number of deaths is expected to increase.
Because of the failure of communication systems, relief forces were unable to obtain information from the Donggala government district, an area north of Palu, which is closer to the earthquake epicenter with the strength of 7.5.
In Palu, over 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city just celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and the tsunami took place.
Donggala is a district of government located in the north-west of the island of Sulawesi, over 300 km (180 miles) in length.
In the government district, an administrative unit below the province, there were an estimated 299,200 people living in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main sources of economic activity in Central Sulawesi, in particular the Donggala coastal region.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but it focuses mainly on Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesis.
According to Indonesia's Civil Protection Authority, Palu and Donggala have been victims of earthquakes and tsunamis several times over the last 100 years.
In 1938, over 200 people were killed by a tsunami that destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
West Donggala was hit in 1996 by a tsunami where nine people died.
Indonesia is located on the seismic Pacific fire ring, and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A strong earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in the north of Sumatras triggered a tsunami on 26 December, which killed 14 countries and killed 226,000 people in the coastal areas of the Indian Ocean, almost half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes shook the west coast of Sumatras between the end of March and the beginning of April.
Hundreds of people died on the Nias Islands off Sumatras coast.
2006: An earthquake of magnitude 6.8 shook the south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island and triggered a tsunami that hit the south coast and claimed nearly 700 deaths.
2009: An earthquake with the strength 7.6 struck the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
Over 1,100 people were killed.
2010: An earthquake with the strength of 7.5 shook one of the Mentawai islands in front of Sumatra and triggered a tsunami of up to 10 meters in height, which destroyed dozens of villages and claimed about 300 lives.
2016: A slight earthquake shook Pidie Jaya's government district in Aceh, causing destruction and panic when people were reminded of the destruction of the deadly earthquake and tsunamis in 2004.
This time no tsunami was triggered, but more than 100 people died from a collapse.
2018: Heavy earthquakes hit the Indonesian island of Lombok, which was popular with tourists, and claimed more than 500 deaths on the north side of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily stranded on the island.
Sarah Palin's son arrested for accusations of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former Governor Alaskas and former candidates for the Vice-President's office, was arrested for accusations of body injury.
The 29-year-old Palin from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on the grounds of suspicion of domestic violence, the impediment to the reporting of domestic violence and the resistance to state power, a report published by Alaska police on Saturday.
According to the police report, he picked up the phone from a friend when they wanted to get in touch with the police.
According to KTUU, Palin is under investigation in the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and a deposit of $500 was raised.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where when he was asked for his plea he answered with "Not guilty, quite sure," the network said.
Palin is accused of having committed three class A crimes of order, which can be punished with up to a year's imprisonment and a fine of up to USD 250,000.
He is also being burdened with a class B disorder, which can be punished with a day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
It's not the first time Palin's charges have been filed against him.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently being negotiated before the Veteran’s Court of Alaska.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, of obstructing the reporting of a crime and possession of weapons under anesthetic influence in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of beating her face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran organizations in 2016 after she traced her son's behavior to a post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of his time in Iraq.
Tsunami after earthquake in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died after an earthquake that shook the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The quake with a strength of 7.5 triggered a tsunami that destroyed thousands of houses.
Electricity and communication networks are interrupted and the number of deaths is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred just off the coast of Central Sulawesi, located northeast of Indonesia's capital Jakarta.
On the social networks, videos circulate from the time the wave hit the land.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the Tsunami met on the coast.
Federal Prosecution Demands Rare Death Penalty for Suspects in New Yorker Terrorist Attack
The Federal Attorney General in New York claims the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the accused in the terrorist attack of New York City, which cost eight lives. This is a rare punishment that has not been imposed in the state since 1953 for a federal crime.
The 30-year-old Saipov is accused of having used a rented pick-up of the construction market chain Home Depot for a terrorist attack, as he crashed on a bicycle path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan in October, transferring pedestrians and cyclists.
In order to justify the death penalty, the plaintiffs must prove that Saipov killed the eight of them "targeted" and added "consciously" serious body injuries, as stated in the Memorandum of Understanding for the request for the death penalty filed in the southern district of New York.
Both charges could be punished with death, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a Federal Prosecution Tribunal Saipov filed an appeal in 22 points involving eight charges of murder in the context of the organized crime normally used by state prosecutors in cases of organised crime, as well as an accusation of the violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack requires 'basic planning and intention', the accusers who described the way in which Saipov carried out the action as 'disgusting, cruel and corrupt'.
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov added to Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleveland, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco damage, pain and loss," the explanation explains.
Five victims were Argentine tourists.
For over a decade, the southern district of New York has not pursued a case with the aim of demanding the death penalty.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was accused of murdering two drug suppliers and finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in New York during a federal offense was in 1953 in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who two years earlier were accused of conspiring to spy on the Soviet Union.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on 19 June 1953 with the electric chair.
Saipov, who was born in Uzbekistan, witnessed a lack of repentance in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
He said before investigators that he felt good about what he did, the police said.
Saipov explained to the authorities that he was inspired to do so after watching videos of ISIS on his phone, according to the prosecution.
He also requested, according to police records, to hang the flag of ISIS in his hospital room.
He declared himself not guilty in all 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the public defenders representing Saipov, said that she was "of course disappointed" by the decision of the prosecutor.
"We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty will only prolong the trauma suffered by all parties in exchange for a life sentence without the possibility of being released," said Patton.
Saipov's defense team had filed the charges in advance not to demand the death penalty.
A Conservative Party member requests that NIGEL FARAGE be transferred to the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage vowed to mobilize "the power of the people" today during a protest action in the context of the Tories Conference.
The former party leader of Ukip stated that politicians must "feel the pressure" of the Eurosceptics, while a member of Theresa May's Party suggested that Farage should lead the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backbenchist Peter Bone told protesters in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would be "ready outside" if Farage were Brexit ministers.
The challenge facing May in the reconciliation of its deeply disputed parties was exacerbated by the fact that members of your party, who are in favour of a stay in the EU, participated in a separate demonstration against Brexit that took place in the city.
The Prime Minister has problems keeping pace with his Chequer compromise plan despite attacks by Brexit supporters, Brexit opponents and the EU.
Allies insisted that, despite the counter-reactions, they should continue to try to negotiate a deal with Brussels and thus force Eurosceptics and the opposition Labour Party to decide between their package and the "chaos".
Bone explained at the Leave Means Leave demonstration in Solihull that ‘Chequers belong to the garbage’.
He proposed that Farage be appointed as a peer and that he be given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
'If he was responsible for it, we'd already be out there,' he said.
The Member of Wellingborough added: ‘I will stand for Brexit, but Chequers is listening to the garbage.’
He stressed his opposition to the EU: ‘We have not fought in World Wars to be submissive.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.’
Bone rejected allegations that public opinion had changed since the referendum in 2016: ‘The idea that the British people had changed his mind and wanted to stay in the EU is completely wrong.’
The Brexit advocate of Conservative Andrea Jenkys was also on the demonstration and stated to reporters: ‘I'm just saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
‘The compromise is unpopular in public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular in our own party and with our activists, who actually go through the streets and make sure that we are elected.
Please give up Chequers and start listening.’
In a brief message to May, she continued: ‘Prime Minister will keep her jobs if you keep her promises.’
Farage stated in a speech that politicians must ‘feel pressure’, they should be in the process of deceiving the decision of the 2016 referendum.
‘This is now a question of trust between us, the people, and our political class’, says Farage.
‘They are trying to cheat the Brexit and that’s why we are here today to tell them, ‘you’re not getting away with it’.
Before an enthusiastic crowd, he continued: ‘I want you to feel the pressure of our political class, which is about to betray Brexit.
“We are mobilizing the power of this country’s people, who will help us to win the referendum and never come to rest, as long as we are not an independent, self-managing, proud United Kingdom.”
At the same time, Brexit opponents marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A few activists waved banners from the Tories Against Brexit group, a group of Brexit opponents within May's party that was launched on the weekend.
Lord Adonis, Peer of the Labour Party, made fun of the Tories who had security problems with a party app at the opening of the conference.
“These are the people who tell us that they can make sure that the IT systems, as well as all the technology for Canada Plus, are available for the smooth border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” said Adonis.
‘This is a farce.
It just doesn’t have the good Brexit,” he added.
Warren plans to ‘examine closely’ the presidential candidate
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said that after the November elections she would "examine the presidential candidate".
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts democrat spoke about her future at a meeting with voters in Western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a prominent critic of President Donald Trump, is currently in the race to re-elect the Senate against the Republican MPs in the Parliament of Massachusetts Geoff Diehl, who was Vice-Chairman of Trump's campaign team in Massachusetts in 2016.
She was the center of speculation that she could challenge Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke has been her 36th meeting with voters in the so-called Town Hall format since Trump's inauguration.
One of the people present asked her if you would like to run for the presidency.
Warren replied that it would be time for women "to go to Washington and repair our broken government and that includes women at the top."
Arrest after death shots on LSU player Sims
The Baton Rouge police, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that a suspect in the case of fatal shootings on LSU basketball player Wayde Sims was arrested on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced at a press conference that it had arrested the 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at 11 a.m. Eastern Time.
They had released a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help in identifying the man to see on the shots.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot on Friday morning near the campus of Southern University.
"Wayde Sims suffered a head injury and died as a result of this injury," according to the sports media portal 247sports of police chief Murphy J. Paul explained to the media on Saturday.
Wayde wanted to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to having been at the scene and possession of a gun and shot at Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested and detained in the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
The two-metre-large Sims grew up in Baton Rouge and played in 32 games with 10 starting positions in the last season and could have an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Great Prize of Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaches the World Championship title after his team has given him the victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the time Valtteri Bottas landed in qualifying in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was clear that Mercedes's stable order would play a major role in the race.
From the pole position Bottas made a good start and it was almost as if he were leading Hamilton when he defended his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his teammates.
Vettel first went into the box and had Hamilton hit the traffic at the end of the driver's field, a decision that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes later went into the box and landed behind Vettel, but overtaken Hamilton after a tight wheel-on-wheel manoeuvre, in which the Ferrari pilot resisted to release the inside, risking two movements to defend the third curve.
Max Verstappen began in one of the back seats of the field and was in seventh place on his 21st birthday after the end of the first round.
He was then the fastest for most of the race, as he held to his tires to finish quickly and overtake Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He finally entered the box in the 44th round and failed to add a step in the remaining eight rounds, while Raikkonen finished fourth.
It was a difficult day when Valtteri brought an excellent performance all weekend and how a real gentleman acted when he was supposed to leave me.
The team has done excellent work to achieve a double victory," said Hamilton.
A Case of Really Bad Body Language
President Donald Trump made fun of himself on Saturday at an election campaign about Senator Diane Feinstein, who insisted not to pass on the letter of Christine Blasey Ford, in which she accused the candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse to the press.
At the event in West Virginia, President Ford's statement to the Senate's Committee of Justice did not directly address, but commented that the proceedings in the Senate showed that people were "common, vicious and dishonest".
"One thing that could happen and the wonderful thing that has happened in the last few days in the Senate is when you see the anger when you see people who are angry and mean and mean and dishonest and dishonest," says the President.
“When you look at the Leaks and then say, “Oh, I wasn’t.
It wasn't me."
Do You Remember?
Diane Feinstein, were you responsible for the Leak?
Thinking of your answer... did you publish the document - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't publish it."
Okay, just a minute.
Did we... no, we didn't publish it," he added by imitating the Senator's voice.
Feinstein was credited with Ford's accusations against Kavanaugh in July and he was released in early September. However, Feinstein argues that the Leak comes from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't publish your story," Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
"She asked me to keep the letter secret and I responded to her request for secrecy."
Your dementi did not seem to arrive well with the president, who said on Saturday evening at the election event: “I tell you one thing, that was a very bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
In his continuous defense of the judge candidate accused of sexual abuse by three women, the Democrats claimed that they would use the accusations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain power by all means.
One sees the commonness, the evil, they don't care who they hurt when they fall under the wheels to gain power and control," said the president, according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars made up for the defeat on Friday in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants by a 5:3 win back in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants were led by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier at an early stage with two goals.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the home team the balance before Dwyer restored the lead of the Giants.
Francois Bouchard was equal to Dundee before Lukas Lundvald won the victory with two goals.
This was unexpected for the men of Adam Keefe, who struck Dundee on Friday evening 2-1 in Belfast, the third defeat in the Elite League in the season.
This was the fourth match of the season between the two teams, where the Giant won the three previous games.
Dwyer’s opening gate took place in the fourth minute after 3:35 minutes after a presentation by Kendall McFaull. Four minutes later, David Rutherford delivered the template when Beauvillier expanded the lead.
In this exciting opening phase, Sullivan brought the home team back to the game after 13:10 minutes before Matt Marquardt Cownie made it to his compensator after 15:16 minutes.
Dwyer ensured the leadership of the Giants before the mid-term break when he reached his second gate of the evening shortly before the end of the first half.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard regrouped with a power-play hit in the 28th minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time in the game late in the second half. Nielsen then won his team with a fifth goal after almost half of the second half.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will play at the Milton Keynes Stadium next Friday.
Air traffic controllers died after he made sure that hundreds of people in an airplane escaped the earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is celebrated as a hero after he found death to have a plane with hundreds of people on board safely.
Over 800 people died and many are missing after the island of Sulawesi was shaken on Friday by a devastating earthquake that triggered a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks are still felt in the region and many people are trapped in ruins in the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues fled to save their lives, the 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the strongly fluctuating control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He stayed to be sure that the flight 6321 from Batik Air, which was on the runway at the time, could safely depart.
He jumped out of the tower when he thought he was going to crash.
Agung died later in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, spokesperson of the Indonesian Air Safety Service, explained that this decision could have saved hundreds of lives, says Australia's ABC News.
“We have provided a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
We are deeply affected by this news," he added.
At the same time, the authorities fear that the number of deaths could increase to several thousand. The country’s Civil Protection Authority stated that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The number is expected to increase, as many bodies are still among the ruins, while others cannot be reached," said the spokesman for the Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves up to 6 meters in height have devastated Palu, who will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring relief and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute a new ambulance comes with the dead.
Clean drinking water is scarce.
Supermarkets are looted everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, Head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, CNN said: “The Indonesian Red Cross is hurrying to help survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could get even worse."
Indonesia’s President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and said in a speech to the military of the country: “I ask you to work all day and night to accomplish all the tasks associated with the evacuation.
Since you've been ready?" says CNN.
Indonesia was already shaken by earthquakes in Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
Aircraft crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now reports a missing person after plane crash in lagoon
The airline that operated the flight, which crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, now reports of a missing person after first claiming that all 47 passengers and the crew had been safely evacuated from the sinking aircraft.
Air Niugini stated in a communication that by Saturday afternoon they cannot say anything about a passenger's whereabouts.
The airline stated to work with the local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew members after the plane had crashed into the water when trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials were told that seven people had to be taken to a hospital.
The airline stated that six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday, but were in a stable condition.
The cause and exact course of the accident remained unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both explained that the plane landed just before the runway in the lagoon.
Some witnesses thought the plane was flying out of the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was flying very flat.
"This is a very good thing," says Jaynes.
Jaynes explained that he and others could wade through hip deep water to the emergency exits on the sides of the sinking plane.
He said that the flight attendants panicked and screamed and suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy indicated that sailors working near improving a landing site rushed to help with an inflatable boat to bring people to the coast before the plane sank in about 30 meters (100 feet) of deep water.
The data from the Aviation Safety Network can be seen that 111 people were killed in crashes by airlines registered in Papua New Guinea, but none of them concerned Air Niugini.
Analyst reconstructs the course of the night in which a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the charges closed their demonstration in the renegotiation of a case in which a man is accused of having exiled a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
The analyst of the US Department of Justice Paul Rowlett said that he was an expert in the field of information evaluation for hours.
He explained to the jury how he reconstructed the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on her night of death on cell phone calls.
Rowlett said to have received position data from various mobile phones that showed that Tellis was together with Chambers in the evening of her death. This contradicts his previous statements, according to the Clarion Ledger newspaper.
When the data showed that his phone was at Chambers during the time he reported having been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police talked to Sanford.
Sanford got into the stand on Saturday and said that he had not been to the city that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis had told the truth when he said he was in Sanford's pick-up that night, Sandford said that he had lied, "because my pick-up was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was that Tellis reported knowing Chambers at the time of her death for two weeks.
But cell phone records showed that they knew each other for a week.
Rowlett explained that some time after Chamber's death, Tellis got rid of their messages, calls and contact information from his cell phone.
"He took them out of his life," says Hale.
The defense is expected to begin their pleas on Sunday.
The judge assumes that the trial will then take place before the jury that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious Hip Hop?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling its music with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol claims that Hip Hop has distanced himself from its roots in the political message and social commitment.
They want to go back to its roots and make socially conscious hip hop again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently experienced a renaissance by artists such as Akala and Lowkey in the UK.
Another black one?!
New Yorker nanny sues couple for a release after "racist" SMS
A New York nanny sues a couple for a discriminatory dismissal after receiving a misguided message from the mother in which she complained that she was "another black".
The couple disputed to be racist and compared the dispute with a "oppressive".
The two-time mother Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman expressed her dismay when she found out that the new mother, Giselle Maurice, was black when she entered her first working day in 2016.
"No, no, no, no." Plasco-Flaxman wrote her husband in a text message.
Instead of sending this to her husband, however, she sent the message to Maurice twice.
After she recognized her Fauxpas, Plasco-Flaxman Maurice, who was "spoiled" and claimed that the open African-American day-mother had done bad work and instead expected a Philippine, said the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for her working day and then sent home with a Uber.
Now Maurice sues the couple for compensation for the dismissal and claims compensation for the 350 dollars a day that she should have spent over six months on the job for which she had originally been booked, but without a contract, and for which she had lived with the couple.
"I want to show them, look, you don't do that," she said the newspaper on Friday, "I know that is discrimination."
The couple rejected the racist accusations, arguing that the release of the reasonable step was because they feared Maurice, after they had offended them, that they could no longer trust.
“My wife sent her something that she didn’t want to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists," explained Joel Pasco of the post office.
“But would you entrust your children to a person who was rude to them, even if it was accidental?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
Plasco compared the dispute with an "oppression" and stated that his wife was expecting a baby in just two months and was "in a difficult situation".
“You want to interest such a person?
This is not very nice," added the investment banker.
As the dispute progressed, the couple was quickly convicted in public and challenged the social media, where they were criticized for their behaviour and logic.
The publishers of Paddington feared that readers would not identify themselves with a talking bear, reveals a new letter
Karen Jankel, daughter of author Michael Bond, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: “It’s hard to get into someone who reads it for the first time before it was published.
Today it is very funny with our knowledge of Paddington's huge success."
She said that her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before he was inspired by a small toy bear to write the children's book, had no problem with it, had been rejected and added that the 60th anniversary of his publication after his death in the last year was "bitter sweet".
She explained that her father was secretly proud of Paddington's success, which she described as "very important family member".
"He was a very quiet man and did not boast," Jankel said.
“Because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child who does something special: you’re proud, even if it wasn’t really your own performance.
I think he saw Paddington's success this way.
Although he invented and created him, he always gave Paddington himself responsibility for his success."
My daughter died and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
After the landing, her daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where the doctors tried in vain to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to say that it really looks bad and that the doctors gave her little chance," says Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I received the call from Nad, in which he told me that she would die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And that's what I did.
I told her, "Tashi, I love you so much, my dear."
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications that gave her the doctors to keep her heart on pumping sounded slowly and left her body.
She had died just before and this was the moment when everything went down.
I could do nothing but wait while I knew what was going on.
I could not cry or cry because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and other people.
I really had to pull myself together."
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, who now mourned the loss of her daughter, went on board the plane with the other passengers who did not get any of what she had been through.
"No one knew," she said.
I had lowered my head and tears ran over my cheeks all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight when I felt this overwhelming feeling of sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Mourning women hang cards to prevent suicides on bridges
Two women who have lost relatives through suicide try to stop others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelley Humphreys hung up on a bridge in Wales with inspiring messages and telephone numbers for consulting points.
Davis's son Tyler was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and was just 18 when he started Suizid.
"I don't want parents to feel the way I feel every day," she said.
The 45-year-old Davis, who lives in Lydney, explained that her son was facing a promising career as a cook and he had a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him for his smile.
Everyone said his smile could brighten a room."
However, he announced his job before his death, as he was “in a really dark place”.
In 2014, Tyler's body was found after the suicide by his 11-year-old brother.
Davis said: "I always fear that this could have an effect."
Davis designed the cards to “show people that there are people you can go to and talk to, even if it’s a friend.
Don't keep quiet: you have to talk about it."
Humphreys, who has been friends with Davies for years, lost her partner Mark, with whom she was 15 years old, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say he felt depressed or depressed," she explained.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
On Christmas Day, he was at the bottom of it. When the children unpacked their gifts, he didn't see them in their eyes or anything."
She said that his death was a great trauma to her, but that it had to come through: “There is a huge hole in the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we must all continue and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future hovering while the FBI starts investigating
'I thought that if we could actually get something like that he asked for, i.e. a time-limited and limited investigation, we might be able to get a little agreement,' said Flake on Saturday.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an investigation by the FBI?
Their reluctance can be attributed to timing alone.
The interim elections on November 6 are only five weeks away. If the Republicans cut off badly as expected, they would be significantly weakened in their attempts to elect their husband to the highest court of the country.
George W. Bush took the phone to call Senators and convince them to support Kavanaugh. He had worked in the White House for Bush and met his wife Ashley, who was Bush’s personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI presents its report?
There is a vote in the Senate, in which there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can unite at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the Vice-President, to vote in an equal vote, and to confirm him to the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean overflows “sink” under Kim
The number of North Korean overruns to South Korea has fallen to power since Kim Jong-un seven years ago, according to a South Korean politician.
Park Byeong-seug, based on data from the South Korean Reunion Ministry, stated that last year 1127 overflowers were registered, compared to 2706 in 2011.
Park mentioned stricter border controls between North Korea and China as well as higher prices of human smugglers as main factors.
Pyongyang did not make a public statement.
The vast majority of the outflows from the north are finally offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul states that since the end of the Korean War in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally.
Most flee across China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Korean states.
China sees the invaders as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often brings them back with violence.
Relations between the north and the south, which are still technically in war conditions, have improved considerably in recent months.
At the beginning of the month, the two Heads of State met in Pyongyang for talks that focused on the set-up of denuclearization negotiations.
This was the result of the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June, where they generally agreed to work on a denucleated Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the American sanctions for the lack of progress.
"Without being able to trust the United States, we have no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances it is impossible for us to disarm ourselves unilaterally first," says Mir Ri in a speech before the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he is not suitable for the office at the Supreme Court
The minority leader at the Nancy Pelosi House called Judge Candidate Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said that he was indisposed to the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I could not resist the impression that a woman who had acted this way had been called ‘hysterical’,” Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh’s statement before the Senate’s Committee on Justice on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied all allegations that he had sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when both were teenagers.
During his opening speech Kavanaugh was very emotional. Sometimes he screamed almost and stood in tears shortly before when he spoke about his family and his high school time.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the Committee and called the accusations against him a "great and coordinated assassination" organized by liberals, who were angry about Hillary Clinton's lost presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said that she believes that Kavanaugh's statement proves that he could not serve at the Supreme Court, as she showed that he was prejudiced against democrats.
"I believe that with these statements and the way in which he brought about the Clintons and the Democrats, he himself declared himself unfit," she said.
Pelosi hesitated when she was asked if she would try to elevate Kavanaugh to the Office, he should be confirmed and the Democrats should win the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I will say so much: if he does not tell the Congress or the FBI the truth, then he is not only unfit for the Supreme Court, but also for his current judge position," says Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington, D.C.
Pelosi further said that she was concerned as a democrat about possible decisions by Kavanaugh against the Affordable Care Act or the abortion basic decision by Roe v. Wade, since he was considered a conservative judge.
In his hearings Kavanaugh ruled out whether he would revise certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“We don’t need a hysterical, biased person who goes to this court and expects us to say, ‘Ah, that’s not wonderful’,” says Pelosi.
Women have to use it as a weapon.
It's a sincere hate speech, months and years of boiling anger and she doesn't get it out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's rare, do you?"
She continued: “I was helped a lot by a woman who was a manager somewhere and said that she also cried when she became angry, but developed a technique. When she gets angry and starts crying, she says to the person to whom she said: “You may think that she is sad because I cry.
I'm angry."
And then just keep talking.
I found that brilliant."
Tears are allowed as a valve for anger, partly because they are completely misunderstood.
One of my most clear memories is of a former job, in a male-dominated office, where one day I cried because of an indescribable anger and an older woman, a cold manager, who I was always a little afraid of, was packed at the collar and dragged into a stairwell.
"Never let them see you cry," she told me.
"They don't know you're so dirty.
They believe that you are sad and will be satisfied with yourself, as they believe you have gone to the substance."
Patricia Schroeder, then a congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidates.
In 1987, when Hart was caught aboard a ship called Monkey Business in an extramarital affair and then withdrew his candidacy, the deeply frustrated Schroeder thought that there was no reason not to consider the idea of the presidential candidate himself.
"That was not a well thought out decision," she told me 30 years later with a laugh.
There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called the situation ‘Snow White and the Seven Dwarves’.
As the campaign had already advanced, it was at the back of the fund procurement and she vowed not to run if she could not get $2 million together.
It was a hopeless fight.
She found out that some of her supporters who gave men $1,000 supported their campaign only with $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she asked.
In the speech in which she announced not to launch an official campaign, she was so overwhelmed by her emotions, gratitude for her supporters, frustration over the system that made the media procurement and direct addressing of voters rather than delegates so difficult, as well as the anger over sexism, that she was close to tears.
"One could have assumed that I had suffered a nervous breakdown," Schroeder recalls the press reactions.
“One could have believed that the handkerchief manufacturer Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember wondering what they'd write on my tombstone.
"She cried"?
Why Beijing could benefit from the trade war between the US and China
The opening ointments of the trade war between the USA and China were deafening. Although the battle is not over for a long time, Beijing could benefit from a long-term digging between the countries, my experts.
Donald Trump, the U.S. president, fired the first warning at the beginning of the year when he imposed penalties on important Chinese exports, including solar cells, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation took place this week with new penalties for goods worth 200 billion dollars, effectively affecting half of all goods imported into the US from China.
Beijing struck in the same way each time and recently imposed fines of five to ten percent on American goods worth 60 billion dollars.
China has sworn to respond to any measure taken by the United States and it is unlikely that the world's second largest economic power will soon stumble.
Moving Washington to interfere would mean yielding. However, a public intrusion towards the US would be far too shameful for China’s President Xi Jinping.
Nevertheless, experts believe that if Beijing plays out its cards well, China could benefit from the effects of the trade war in the long term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a rapid political decision could create the conditions for economic turbulence in both countries either in Washington or Beijing is actually much more dangerous than many observers have previously recognized," says Abigail Grace, a scientific assistant who focuses on Asia at the Center for New American Security.
Syria is 'ready' for the return of refugees, says the Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for help to rebuild the country that has been devastated by the war for more than seven years.
In a speech before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem stated that the situation in the country is improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government rebuilt the areas destroyed by terrorists in order to reverse normality.
All conditions were now given for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the start of the war in 2011.
A further six million people still living in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian government welcomed assistance in rebuilding the devastated country.
However, he stressed that it would not accept conditional assistance from countries that had supported the uprising.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europa won the 2018 Ryder Cup and defeated Team USA with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 in the Le Golf National near Paris.
The US has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup since 1993 in Europe.
Europe won the crown back after the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn reached the 14.5 points it needed to defeat the United States.
The American star Phil Mikkelson, who had problems over most of the tournament, lowered his drop on the 16th course (par 3) in the water and lost against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari was able to shine in all his rounds and became one of four players who scored a 5-0-0 since the tournament began in its current format in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was beaten 5:4 by the player with the lowest ranking in the team Europe, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The player with the world's best ranking, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 to 1 against the Englishman Ian Paulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
The Spaniard Sergio Garcia, veteran from eight Ryder Cups, became the best European Ryder Cup player of all time with 25.5 career points.
“Normally I don’t cry, but today I couldn’t hold back.
It was a difficult year.
I am so grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I'm so infinitely happy to win back the trophy.
It's about the team and I'm happy to have contributed," says the emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He passed on the torch to his compatriot John Rahm, who won the singles against the American golf legend Tiger Woods on Sunday 2:1.
I am so incredibly proud to have beaten Tiger Woods, whom I have been following on television since my childhood," says 23-year-old Ramm.
Woods lost all his four games in France and now has a Ryder Cup balance of 13-21-3.
A strange statistic for one of the biggest players of all time who has won 14 important titles and is only surpassed by Jack Nicklaus.
The team USA had all weekend problems finding the fairways, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who have performed high-quality performances throughout the tournament.
American captain Jim Furyk said after a disappointing performance of his team: “I’m proud of the boys, they’ve fought.
There was a time this morning when we put Europe under pressure.
We didn't do anything about it.
Take care of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All of his 12 players made a good performance.
We will regroup, I will talk to the PGA America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we will look forward.
I love those 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to pull the hat.
We were defeated."
