Members of the Wales National Assembly are concerned that they will be ‘compared to Muppets’
There is a stir among the members of the Welsh National Assembly by a proposal that would change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament - Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The proposal is a consequence of the plans to change the current name ‘Welsh Assembly’ to ‘Welsh Parliament’.
Members of the National Assembly of various political parties are concerned that the new name is ridiculous.
A member of the National Assembly of Wales of the Labour Party said that MWP ‘grown on Twp and Pwp’.
For readers outside Wales: twp is Welsh for crazy and pwp is Welsh for poop.
A member of the National Assembly of Wales of the Plaid Party said that the group as a whole was ‘dissatisfied’ and proposed alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said that his party is ‘open’ for the name change, but notes that the words MWP and Muppet are very similar.
In this context, the Welshe letter W is pronounced as a short you.
The Commission of the National Assembly of Wales, which is currently preparing legislation to implement the change of name, said: 'It is of course the members of the National Assembly of Wales themselves who take the final decision on their new title.'
With the Government of Wales Act 2017, members of the Wales National Assembly were given the right to change the name of the Assembly.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which showed that most people felt that the National Assembly should be renamed Parliament.
As regards the title of members of the National Assembly, the Commission proposed ‘Welsh Parliament Members’ or ‘WMPs’, but the MWP option received most support in the public consultation.
At present, the members of the National Assembly would propose alternatives, but President Jones will find it difficult to reach a consensus, and in a few weeks' time she will have to table a bill on the changes.
The reform legislation also includes other changes to the way the National Assembly operates, including rules on the suspension of members of the National Assembly and the structure of the committee system.
Members of the National Assembly will be able to vote permanently on their new title when they debate the legislation.
People of Macedonia vote in a referendum on the change in the name of their country
On Sunday voters vote whether they want to change the name of their country in ‘Republic of Northern Macedonia’.
The popular referendum was organized in an attempt to resolve an ongoing dispute with neighbouring Greece, which itself has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that the name of its northern neighbour means that the country would claim its territory and has repeatedly objected to Macedonia's requests to join the EU and NATO.
The Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the referendum on the change of name, has said that he will not take into account the outcome of the referendum.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change of name is simply the price to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
The bells of Saint Martin's silence, the bells of Harlem are hard
“The older people I talked to said that in the past there was a café and a church on every corner,” said Mr. Adams.
Today there is neither a café nor a church to be detected."
He said it's understandable that cafes have disappeared.
"People now have social contacts in a different way," he said.
“Cafes are no longer the living room of the neighborhood, where people regularly visit.”
However, he is concerned that the proceeds of selling the church's assets will be less long if the leaders expect, "and sooner or later they will be back at the beginning."
Churches, he adds, could be replaced by apartment buildings with apartments where the kind of people would live that would not help in the remaining resorts of the neighborhood.
‘The vast majority of the people who will buy apartments in such buildings will be white,’ he says, ‘which will lead to these churches being closed even more quickly, because it is unlikely that the people who move to these apartments will become members of the church community.’
Both churches were once built by a white church community, before Harlem became a black metropolis: the metropolis community in 1870, Saint Martin's 10 years later.
The original church assembly of white Methodists left in the 1930s.
A black church community nearby took over the building.
Saint Martin's was taken over by a black church congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott from the shopkeepers on 125th Street, an important shopping street in Harlem, where blacks could rarely get a job or be promoted.
In 1939 the building was seriously damaged by fire, but when the parishioners of Reverend Johnson made plans to rebuild the church, they also bought a carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Reverend Johnson and his successor in Saint Martin's, proudly called the carillon 'the bells of the poor'.
The expert who played the carillon in July referred in another way to the instrument: 'a cultural treasure' and 'an irreplaceable historical instrument'.
The expert, Tiffany Ng, of the University of Michigan, also noted that this was the first carillon in the world ever played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger carillon of the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said Saint Martin's hadn't replaced him.
The events of the last months in Saint Martin's are a complicated story of architects and contractors, some hired by the lay leaders of the church, others by the diocese.
The consistory (the governing body of the parish, consisting of lay leaders) wrote the diocese in July to express her concern that the diocese would "calculate the costs" to the consistory, although the consistory had not been involved in hiring the architects and contractors who had sent the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency of the diocese.
Shark wounded 13-year-old who dived to lobsters in California
On Saturday, on the first day of the lobster season, a shark attacked a 13-year-old boy who docked for lobsters in California. The boy suffered injuries, it says.
The attack took place just before 7 in the morning near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends on Saturday about half an hour when he heard the boy screaming for help. Together with some others he paddled to the boy to pull him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought the boy was crying because he had caught a lobster, but then he realized ‘that the boy was shouting, ‘I am bitten!
I'm bitten!"
His collarbone was completely open,' Hammel saw as he approached the boy.
‘I shouted that everyone had to go out of the water: ‘There is a shark in the water!’.
The boy was taken by helicopter to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is said to be at risk of life.
It is not known which shark species is responsible for the attack.
Coast Guard Captain Larry Giles told us in a press conference that a shark had been spotted nearby a few weeks earlier, but that it had been concluded that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim was seriously injured by the upper body.
The authorities closed the access to the beach of Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours for research and safety.
Giles noted that more than 135 shark species live in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's wants to break through the British beauty market
Sainsbury's compete with Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams and set up beauty departments where specialized assistants work, such as in supermarkets.
The initiative is part of a strategy to conquer the British beauty market, which is worth £2.8 billion and continues to grow, while sales of fashion and household goods continue to decline. The larger beauty departments are being tested in 11 shops throughout the country. If they prove to be successful, they will be introduced in even more shops next year.
The investment in the beauty market is also a result of the fact that supermarkets want to fill with other products the racks where TVs, microwaves and interior products ever stood.
Sainsbury's wants to double its beauty offer and offer 3,000 products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Also the existing range of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees gets more space, with tableau per brand, as in shops like Boots.
The supermarket also brings its boutique make-up back to the market, as most products are suitable for vegans, something that younger shoppers increasingly demand.
In addition, perfumery the Fragrance Shop will test concessions in two shops of Sainsbury's. The first one is previously opened in Croydon, in the south of London, the second one will be opened later this year in Selly Oak, in Birmingham.
As more and more people shop online and increasingly buy small amounts of food on a daily basis in local supermarkets, supermarkets need to make more effort to convince people to shop with them.
Mike Coupe, Chief Executive of Sainsbury's, says that the stores will look more and more like storehouses, as the supermarket chain takes it up against discounters Aldi and Lidl, with more services and non-food.
Sainsbury's integrated Argos sales points into hundreds of stores and has also opened a number of Habitats since both chains were taken over two years ago. According to the company, the sales of food have increased and the acquisitions have yielded more efficiency.
The last time the supermarket tried to give its departments Beauty and Pharmacy a make-over, it became a flop.
Sainsbury's tested cooperation with Boots at the beginning of 2000, but the cooperation was terminated when a conflict arose over the distribution of revenues from the pharmacy department in the supermarkets.
This is a new strategy since Sainsbury's were 281 pharmacy departments in the shops three years ago sold to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain for an amount of 125 million pounds.
Lloyds would also play a role in the plan, by adding an extensive range of skin care luxury brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director of Sainsbury's, said: ‘We have completely changed the decor of our beauty department so that it is more pleasant for our customers.
We have also invested in the specialized training of our employees, who will be ready to give advice.
With our range of brands, we offer something for everyone, and thanks to the attractive environment and convenient locations, we ensure that our customers like to buy their beauty products from us, and no longer shop in the old way."
Peter Jones 'enraged' after Holly Willoughby withdraws from 11 million pounds deal
Peter Jones, one of Dragons Den's stars, is 'enraged' because TV presenter Holly Willoughby has withdrawn from a £11 million deal with his lifestyle company. She wants to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for True, their brand for homewear and accessories.
The company of Jones and Willoughby is once compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old presenter from This Morning announced on Instagram that she is leaving.
Peter Jones van Dragons Den is furious at Holly Willoughby, because she has recently withdrawn from their profitable lifestyle company to focus on her contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones was ‘enraged’ when Willoughby announced on Tuesday at a difficult meeting at the company’s headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire that she did not have enough time for True, their brand for homewear and accessories due to her new contracts (with a value of £1.5 million).
The company is sometimes compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow and is expected to double Willoughby's fortune of an estimated 11 million pounds.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she would leave True, Jones left for one of his holiday homes abroad.
One source said: ‘Truly was one of Holly’s top priorities.
It would ensure its long-term future, and provide enough for the next decades.
Everyone was stunned when she decided to withdraw.
No one could believe his ears last Tuesday, because the launch was scheduled for soon.
The warehouse of the main establishment in Marlow is full of products that are ready for sale.'
Experts believe that the departure of the presentatrice, one of the most profitable stars in Great Britain, could cost the company millions, as a result of the large investment in products from pillows and candles to clothing and homewear, and because the launch could now be further delayed.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin, who have three children, have been friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby started in 2016 with Capp, and Jones, 52, became president of the company in March.
The two teams often go on vacation together and Jones has a 40% share in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will soon become the brand ambassador of M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as the presenter of the I'm A Celebrity programme on the UK ITV.
A source from Jones' entourage said last night: ‘We have no comments on his business affairs.’
Hard language “and then the love was between us”
He joked about the criticism he would get in the media for a remark he made that some people would find ‘unprecedented for a president’, and for his positive view of the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump imitated a news anchor when he said:
"I didn't give up anything."
He added that Kim was interested in a second meeting. Trump described their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards the dismantling of nuclear weapons in North Korea.
But the negotiations on the removal of nuclear weapons have been under way.
More than three months after the Singapore Summit in June, top diplomat Ri Yong Ho of North Korea told leaders of the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea does not see a 'correspondent response' by the United States after the first disarmament initiatives of North Korea.
Meanwhile, the United States continues with its sanctions to keep pressure on the boiler, he says.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech during the election rally.
'We're doing very well in North Korea,' he said.
‘We were close to a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a fantastic relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim have resulted in positive results: rocket tests have ended, hostages have been liberated and the material surpluses of American soldiers have returned to their own country.
He also defended his unusual approach to his relationship with Kim.
‘It’s as easy to behave as a president, but instead of 10,000 people trying to access this busy arena, there would be about 200 people standing here,” said Trump, pointing to the audience before him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia destroyed an island, killing hundreds of people
In the aftermath of the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign NGOs were told that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10% of the population of Lombok no longer had a home, no national disaster was announced, which is a prerequisite for launching international aid.
'In many cases, it is unfortunately clear that they are not seeking international aid, which is difficult for us,' said Mrs Sumbung.
Save the Children is setting up a team to travel to Palu, but it is not certain that the relief workers from abroad can work on site.
Mr Sutopo, spokesperson of the National Disaster Relief Agency, said that Indonesian officials were still evaluating the situation in Palu to see if international organisations would be allowed to help.
Although Indonesia is constantly plagued by earthquakes, the country is still particularly badly prepared for the anger of nature.
In Aceh, hiding places were built to hide at tsunamis, but on other coasts you rarely see them.
That there were no warning sirens for tsunamis in Palu, even though a warning was in force, has probably contributed to the number of deaths.
Also in ideal circumstances it can be difficult to travel from one Indonesian island to another.
National disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that was stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is now on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days for the ship to reach the place of the disaster.
The improvement of the stateless infrastructure of Indonesia was one of the key points of President Joko Widodo's election campaign, and he has already spent a great deal of money on roads and railways.
But President Joko's government has a shortage of funding, and that while hoping to be re-elected next year.
President Joko is also being pressured by continuing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Islamic majority today follow a more conservative form of their faith.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands had to leave their homes because Christian and Islamic gangs fought on the streets, with machetes, arrows, bows, and other primitive weapons.
Look at: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool provides impressive equalizer against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge guarded Liverpool last Saturday for loss against Chelsea in the Premier League, with a goal in the 89th minute, during a match in Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge got a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri when he was about 30 meters away from the target of Chelsea, at the time his team was left with 1-0.
He tapped left against the ball and then kicked in the direction of the farthest pole.
The ball flew high above the penalty area, towards the right upper corner of the net.
He developed the jump of Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
‘It was very difficult to reach that position, to reach the ball, and players like Shaq always play forward as much as possible,’ said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante approach and dared to try. I didn’t really think about it, I just kicked the ball.”
Chelsea was at peace with 1-0, after a target of the Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The top of The Blues kicked the ball with his heel to Mateo Kovacic, after which he hurried through the middle field to Liverpool's playing half.
Kovacic did a quick one-two in the middle field.
Then he gave a nice pass, allowing Hazard to reach the penal court.
Hazard was faster than the defense and kicked the ball with his left foot past Alisson Becker of Liverpool in the net, next to the back pole.
Liverpool is playing on Wednesday at 15:00 in the group stage of the Champions League against Napoli, in the Stadium San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea competes in the UEFA Europa League against Videoton on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
Death rate of tsunami in Indonesia is up to 832
The death toll of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, said the Agency for Assistance in National Disasters on Sunday morning.
Many people were trapped in the ruins of buildings that had collapsed as a result of the earthquake with a force of 7.5 of last Friday, with waves also rising from 6 m high, said spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at a news conference.
The city of Palu, where more than 380,000 people live, is full of ruins of collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after women have been stabbed
This morning a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, after which a murder investigation was opened.
The 44-year-old woman was found in Grayson Mews, John Street, where the body showed stab wounds, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police ask local residents to report if they have seen or heard anything.
Police inspector Brian O'Hagan said: ‘The investigation has just begun, but I want everyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead and who has seen or heard something suspicious to contact us.
I would also like to ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, to contact them if they may have filmed something through a dashboard, because they can have information that is essential to our research."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a local resident of Birkenhead and that she was found in a building.
This afternoon, friends who thought they knew the woman on the spot came to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and the police have confirmed that they are currently informing the victim's family.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has tried to enter his apartment but was told by the police that no one is allowed in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he found out what happened.
The residents are now told that it will take hours for them to return home.
A policeman would have told someone that the area is being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared crying on the spot.
She keeps repeating, 'What a shame!'.
At 14:00, two police cars were inside the prison, and a third was just outside.
Within the custody, a number of officers were watching the apartment building.
Anyone who has information is asked to send a message to @MerPolCC, to call 101 or anonymously contact Crimestoppers on the number 0800 555 111, with log 247 of 30 September.
The statue of Cromwell to the British Parliament is the latest victim of the 'rewriting history'-rel
The banishment of the statue would be a poetic justice for the Taliban-nacht destruction of the many cultural and religious art objects carried out by his fanatical Purity followers.
But the Cromwell Society described the suggestion of Mr. Crick as ‘stupid’ and ‘an attempt to rewrite history.’
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: ‘It was inevitable that the current debate on the removal of statues would lead to the showing of the figure of Oliver Cromwell just outside the Houses of Parliament.
The iconoclasm of the English civil wars was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the last century.
The magnificent image of Cromwell, made by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, testifies to the opinion that prevailed in the 19th century and is part of the history of a figure that many believe still needs recognition.
Mr. Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: ‘Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case of course the monarchy.
Whether that is a completely correct presentation is still being debated.
What is certain is that in the middle of the 17th century the conflict has shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individually recognizable figure that represents one side of that gap.
His achievements as Lord Protector must also be recognized and remembered."
Murderful pig kills Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China, according to reports in the local media.
The man, of whom only the surname ‘Yuan’ was known, was found dead at a stable on the market in Liupanshui in the province of Guizhou. His artery was pierced and he was under the blood, reported the South China Morning Post Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing to inoculate pigs at a pig farm in Xining, Qinghai Province, China, on 30 May 2005.
He was said to have left Yunnan County with his cousin on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead and found a door open to a neighboring pighouse.
According to the cousin, there was a large male pig with blood on its mouth in the pig’s mouth.
Forensics revealed that the pig had killed the farmer, according to the report.
'My cousin's legs were bloodshed and mutilated', said the cousin with the surname 'Wu', according to the newspaper Guiyang Evening News.
On images of surveillance cameras, it can be seen that Yuan arrived on the market on Thursday at 4.40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal the man killed wasn't Yuan's or his cousin's.
A market manager told the Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking others, while the police collected evidence on the spot.
It is said that the Yuan family and the market authorities are currently negotiating compensation for his death.
It happens rarely, but there have been cases of pigs attacking people before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts, causing the man to be seriously injured.
Ten years earlier, a 300 - pound pig pushed a farmer from Wales against his tractor until his wife took the animal away.
When a farmer from Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer at CBC News testified that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood can provoke aggression.
“They’re just playful.
They're like kids, very curious... they're not looking to hurt people.
You just have to show them the right amount of respect," he said.
The tail of Hurricane Rosa brings heavy rain to the southwest of the U.S.
As predicted, weak Hurricane Rosa descends after reaching the cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
In the coming days, however, Rosa will bring heavy rains to the north of Mexico and the southwest.
At a wind speed of 135 km per hour, Rosa was a Category 1 hurricane on Sunday morning at 5 a.m. and was 620 km from Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a trough begins to form above the Pacific Ocean, which is heading east toward the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, tropical humidity is pushed northward, to the southwest of the U.S.
Rosa will bring 10 centimeters of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Next, tropical moisture that reacts with the approaching trough will cause widespread heavy rainfall in the southwest over the coming days.
Locally, 2 to 10 cm of rain will cause dangerous floods, waste streams and possible earthslides in the desert.
Tropical moisture will lead to precipitation from 5 to 8 cm per hour, especially in parts of the south of Nevada and Arizona.
Only 5 to 10 cm of rain is expected in parts of the southwest, especially above most of Arizona.
There are sudden floods with rapidly deteriorating conditions, as tropical rain can fall very widely.
It is strongly advised to enter the desert on foot when the tropical rain threatens.
The heavy rainfall can be tangled in wild rivers, and storms will produce local winds and dust.
The approaching trough brings local heavy rain to parts of the southern California coastline.
There is rain of 1.5 cm possible, which could lead to small debris currents and smooth roads.
This would be the first rainfall of the region in the rainy season.
Scattered tropical rains will approach Arizona on Sunday evening until Monday, after which the rain will be scattered more on Monday at the end of the day and Tuesday.
Heavy rainfall will spread over the Four Corners on Tuesday and will continue to fall until Wednesday.
In October, the temperature in the US can fluctuate strongly, because the North Pole is getting cooler, but the tropics remain quite warm.
This sometimes leads to large differences in temperature over short distances.
There is a beautiful example of impressive temperature differences in the middle of the U.S. on Sunday.
The temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, is almost 20 degrees.
In the coming days, the continuous summer heat will try to build up and expand again.
In much of the middle and east of the US, October is expected to start hot, with temperatures fluctuating around 30°C from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
In New York it can become 27 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees warmer than the average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows that until mid-October there is a high chance of above-average temperatures in the eastern United States.
Over 20 million people attended Brett Kavanaugh’s hearing
On Thursday, over 20 million people watched one of the six television networks at Brett Kavanaugh’s intriguing testimony, candidate for the U.S. Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of an assault reportedly taking place in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political impasse continued, while broadcasters interrupted the regular programming for Friday's surprise: an agreement arranged by Jeff Flake, Senator of Arizona, to investigate the charge for a week.
Ford told the Senate Committee on Justice that she was 100% sure that a drunken Kavanaugh touched her and tried to strip her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh stated in an inspired testimony that he was 100% sure that this had not happened.
It is likely that more than 20,4 million people reported by Nielsen looked at on Friday.
The company counted the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
There were no immediate figures available for the other networks that broadcast the hearing, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble counting people who look in an office.
In comparison: that's about like a play-off of a football match or for the Oscar show.
Fox News Channel, which gives all support to the appointment of Kavanaugh, had most viewers during the hearing day: an average of 5.69 million viewers, according to Nielsen.
ABC followed with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC had 2.94 million viewers, MSNBC had 2.89 million viewers, and CNN had 2.52 million viewers, according to Nielsen.
After the hearing, the audience remained very interested.
Flake was the central figure of the events on Friday.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that he would support Kavanaugh with his voice, the cameras of CNN and CBS recorded on Friday morning that protesters were shouting at him when he tried to take the elevator to a hearing of the Commission on Justice.
He stayed with his eyes down for a few minutes while he was being scolded, live on CNN.
"I'm right here in front of you," said one woman.
‘Do you think he's telling the people the truth?
Someone shouted, "You have power, while so many women are powerless."
Flake said that his office had issued a statement, and just before the elevator closed, he added that he would say more at the hearing.
The various channels broadcast everything live when the judicial committee had to vote on the appointment of Kavanaugh in the Senate hours later.
But Flake said he would only vote in favour with the understanding that the FBI would investigate the allegations against the nominee by next week, something the Democrats of the minority insist on.
Flake was convinced, among other things, by his friend Chris Coons, senator and democrat.
Flake made his decision after a conversation with Coons and several senators.
Flake's choice was important because it was clear that the Republicans would not have the necessary votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of 'a political game' around Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper, Prime Minister Theresa May accused politicians who criticized her plans to leave the European Union from a ‘political game’ with the future of Britain and undermine national interests.
Premier of Britain Theresa May will be attending the Conference of the Conservative Party in Birmingham, Great Britain, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, on the same front page of the newspaper, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson stressed his attack on her so-called Chequers plan for the Brexit. He said that her proposal that Britain and the EU should collect each other's taxes was 'absurd'.
Shooting Party Wayde Sims: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson as suspect of LSU player's death
The police arrested a suspect for the shooting in which Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU, was shot.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, is arrested and in prison on suspicion of murder, said Baton Rouge police.
The authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson and the police said that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police found the glasses on the crime scene and found Simpson's DNA on the glasses, reports WAFB, a CBS television station.
The police interrogated Simpson and later declared that he had confessed that he had shot Wayde with death.
His bail is set at $350,000, reports the Advocate.
On Friday, the coroner of the East Baton Rouge municipality published a preliminary report stating that the cause of death is a gunshot wound in the neck.
The report states that the Fugitive Task Force of the Louisiana State Police, the State Police Crime Lab, the Southern University Police and local residents have all contributed to the investigation that led to an arrest.
Sports director Joe Alleva of LSU thanked the local police for his ‘action and striving for justice.’
Sims was 20 years old.
He grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He scored an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per match last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said that the team was ‘capped’ and ‘in shock’ by Waydes.
‘This is an event you always hope it will never happen’, says Wade.
Volcano spits ash on Mexico City
The ash spewed out by the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern districts of the capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned the Mexicans last Saturday to stay away from the volcano, after activity was picked up in the crater and 183 gas and ash emissions were registered for a period of 24 hours.
The center detected several times rumblings and vibrations.
On social media, photos of a thin layer of ash appeared on car windows in neighborhoods of Mexico city, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in activity in the volcano, which is located 72 kilometres southeast of the capital, the first time since September 2017, when an earthquake with a force of 7.1 hit the Richter Central Mexico scale.
The volcano, called ‘Don Goyo’, has been active since 1994.
Police flash with Catalan separatists on the eve of the anniversary of the vote on independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence activists hit the riot police, while thousands of people participated in rival demonstrations on the occasion of the first anniversary of the vote on independence in Catalonia, which divided the region into two groups.
A group of masked pro-separatists who were held back by the riot police emboldened the officers with eggs and powder paint, causing dark dust clouds to form in the streets that are usually filled with tourists.
Later in the day, skirmishes broke out with the police, and the officers took their clubs upstairs to stop the fighting.
For more than an hour, pro-independence groups sang: ‘Don’t forget, don’t forgive’, while their opponents shouted ‘Long live Spain’.
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries they suffered during the protests, reported the local press.
The tensions remain high in the region of independence, one year after the referendum of 1 October, which is considered illegal by Madrid but is celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The voters spoke overwhelmingly to become independent, although the rise was low and the people who are against separation are the voting boys.
According to the Catalan authorities, last year nearly 1,000 people were injured after the police tried to stop the vote in the polling stations in the region, with violent skirmishes.
Pro-independence groups had camped the night of Friday on Saturday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration continued, but they were forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist protest with his wife, said that he was no longer hopeful about the prospects of Catalonia for independence.
‘Last year we had one of our most beautiful moments.
I saw my parents crying for joy because they could vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Although the Catalan pro-independence parties won an essential victory in the regional elections in December, even if that was the point, it was difficult for them to build on their success this year, for many of their best-known leaders are absent, either in exile or in captivity, pending a trial about their role in organising the referendum and calling for independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who filmed the protest in support of the police on his phone, said that the conflict had been fueled by politicians on both sides.
"The tensions are rising more and more," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been in temporary detention since the end of last year, declared that he was taking part in the European Parliament elections next year.
'A candidacy for the European elections is the best way to denounce the decline in democratic values and repression that we have seen from the Spanish Government,' he said.
Londonderry: men arrested after the house was rammed with a car
Three men of 33, 34, and 39 years of age were arrested after a car was repeatedly dragged into a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place on Thursday at 7.30 p.m. local time in Ballynagard Crescent.
Detective Bob Blemmings said that the gates and the building themselves had been damaged.
At some point a crossbow may also be fired on the car.
Livingston wins 1-0 against Rangers thanks to Menga's goal
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston gave them the victory
The promoted Livingston surprised the Rangers and worried Steven Gerrard of his second defeat in a series of 18 games since he was manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's goal made the difference, and Gary Holt's team came up at the same height as Hibernian.
Gerrard's team failed this season to win a competition during the Premiership. They have to take the Sunday against leader Hearts, who stands for eight points on them.
But first the Rangers receive Rapid Vienna on Thursday in the Europe League.
In the meantime, Livingston remains undefeated. The team has already won six consecutive games in his department, and coach Holt hasn't won a single defeat since he had Kenny Miler replaced last month.
Livingston misses opportunities against strong visitors
Holt's team had long been able to make a head start for the first goal, because their direct way of playing caused all kinds of problems with the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but failed to finish with a goal. Then Alan Lithgow, who won Craig Halkett's baseball, kicked the ball above the goal.
The home team let the Rangers play with great pleasure, and waited for his chances quietly and confidently.
And that eventually led to the crucial goal.
The Rangers allowed a free staircase and Livingston provided an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson worked together to create an opportunity for Menga, who scored from the penalty field.
At that time, the Rangers had a lot of ball ownership, but the defense of the home team was unswerving and goalkeeper Liam Kelly didn't have much to do.
That pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos made Kelly avoid a target.
Scott Pittman shot the ball at the feet of Rangers target Allan McGregor and Lithgow missed the goal after a proposal by his colleagues from Livingston.
The penal court of Livingston continued to be reached, but they were rejected every time. Twice a penalty was refused, one after Halkett's attack on invader Glenn Middleton and one for handball.
Livingston's Phenomenal Analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland in the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
They played excellently without exception and continue to exceed expectations in their race to the top.
Their playing style and the composition of their team have hardly changed since their return to the highest regions, but Holt in particular deserves much recognition for the way he has raised the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was fantastic, with an excellently organized defense, while Menga Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall ran on the tops of their toes throughout the game.
However, the Rangers did not know how to break through.
Even though they have often played very well under Gerrard, this time they did not reach their usual level.
Their final stage was not good enough (they only managed once to disguise the home team) and the Rangers will now realize that they have to play better, because they are somewhere in the middle of the classification.
Erdogan is received with mixed feelings in Cologne
Under a radiant blue sky and with a broad smile, the leaders of Turkey and Germany went to breakfast together in Berlin on Saturday (29 September).
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, aimed at restoring relations between NATO allies.
They do not agree on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then left for Cologne for the opening of a gigantic new mosque.
Cologne is the home of the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police called for security reasons when they harassed the crowd of 25,000 people to gather for the mosque, but many sympathizers came around to see their president.
Hundreds of demonstrators, many of them Kurds, also voiced their voices, condemning both Erdogan's policy and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
The rival protests reflect the division over a visitor praised by some German Turks as a hero and accused by others as an autocrat.
Traffic accident in Deptford: cyclist dies after car collision
In London, a cyclist died in a collision involving a car.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, in the southeast of the city, at about 10.15 local time.
The driver of the car stopped and the ambulance staff were present, but the man died on site.
A few months ago, another cyclist died in an accident involving a flight crime on Childrens Street, about a mile from Saturday's accident.
The Metropolitan Police said that officers were in the process of identifying the man and his immediate family.
The road is closed in different places, buses are diverted and motorists are advised to avoid the area.
Prison of Long Lartin: six jailers injured in order disturbance
Six cipiers were injured in an order disturbance in a heavily secure prison for men, according to the prison office.
The riots broke out at about 9.30 a.m. on Sunday in HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire and are still ongoing.
Specialised ‘Tornado’-cipiers are used to resolve the situation involving eight prisoners in one department.
The cipiers were treated there for slight facial injuries.
A prison spokesman said: ‘Specially trained prison personnel have been deployed for a current incident in HMP Long Lartin.
Six personnel have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and those responsible are at least referred to the police and may have to stay behind bars longer.'
In HMP Long Lartin lives more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison director was treated in the hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year the riot police were called to prison for a serious order disturbance in which staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with sudden floods (with possible positive effects on drought zones)
It rarely happens that a tropical depression reaches Arizona, but that is exactly what is likely to happen at the beginning of next week, because the remaining energy of Hurricane Rosa moves across the southwest of the desert area, resulting in flood risks.
For Monday and Tuesday, the National Weather Service has issued warnings for sudden floods for the west of Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, and the southeast of California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to hang right above Phoenix on Tuesday. Monday evening it will be raining already.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted in a tweet that since 1950 only ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or depression status in the region of 200 miles of Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the border of Arizona.'
The most recent models of the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 centimeters of precipitation, with isolated amounts up to 15 centimeters in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
Other parts of the southwest of the desert area, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, will probably get 3 to 5 cm rain, and here and there is 10 cm possible.
For areas that are not at risk of flooding, the rain of Rosa can be a blessing because the region is affected by drought.
Although floods are very worrying, some of this rainfall is likely to be beneficial because the southwest is currently experiencing a drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, the map on which current drought areas are identified, slightly more than 40 percent of Arizona suffers at least extreme drought, the second highest category of weather.com reported.
The route of Hurricane Rosa reaches the mainland through the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa is still on hurricane strength on Sunday morning at a maximum wind speed of 140 km per hour, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moves north at a speed of 20 km per hour.
The storm strikes cooler waters in the Pacific, weakening them.
Therefore, it is expected that she will arrive in Mexico on Monday afternoon or evening with the power of a tropical storm.
There may be heavy rain in parts of Mexico, which entails a significant flood risk.
‘A total of 8 to 15 cm is expected from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, with up to 25 cm possible,’ reported weather.com.
Rosa moves north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border on Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, which will then pass through Arizona late on Tuesday evening and in the south of Utah.
'The greatest danger expected from Rosa or her tail is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwest of Sonora, and southwest of the desert area' said the National Hurricane Center.
This rain is expected to lead to life-threatening sudden floods and floods in the deserts and earthslides on mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton attack: four arrests on suspicion of attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old with stab wounds was found in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured on Saturday at about 4 o'clock local time in the Excelsior Terrace district in Midsomer Norton.
He was taken to the hospital and his condition is 'stable'.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested at night in the Radstock area, according to the Avon and Somerset police.
The police are asking anyone who may have filmed something about what happened to report.
Trump says that Kavanaugh 'has suffered under the commonwealth, the anger' of the Democratic Party
'A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to reject the ruthless and scandalous tactics of the Democratic Party', said Trump during a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that during his appointment procedure Kavanaugh constantly 'suffered from the common, anger' of the Democratic Party
Kavanaugh witnessed to Congress on Thursday and strongly and emotionally denied the charge of Christine Blasey Ford that he had sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified to her accusation during the hearing.
The president said on Saturday that the ‘American people saw the wonderful and incredible character, the quality and courage’ of Kavanaugh that day.
‘A voice to recognise Judge Kavanaugh is a voice that recognizes one of the most full legal opinions of our time, a lawyer with an excellent record of service,’ he told the crowd of advocates in West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to the appointment of Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of the Republican rise in the mid-term elections.
‘In five weeks’ time, one of the most important elections will take place in our lives.
I don't participate, but actually I do participate," he said.
‘That’s why I stand up for great candidates everywhere.’
Trump stated that the Democrats are on a mission to "offer resistance and hinder us".
The first important procedural vote in the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh is expected to take place by Friday at the latest, said a top member of the GOP leadership to CNN.
Hundreds of deaths by Indonesian earthquake, tsunami, and the toll is increasing
In a major earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, at least 384 people were killed, many of whom were wiped off the ground when gigantic waves fell on the beach, the authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered on Friday for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu, when waves of up to six metres high hit land at the time of twilight. Many people fell to pieces and the waves destroyed everything on their way.
The tsunami was the result of an earthquake with a force of 7.5 on the Richter scale.
“When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, there were still people on the beach. They did not immediately walk away and thus became the victim of the tsunami,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman of the Indonesian Bureau for Assistance in Natural Disasters BNPB during a briefing in Jakarta.
'The tsunami also led to other dangers: he towed cars, tree trunks, houses, he hit everything on the land,' Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had traveled over the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coastline.
Some people climbed a tree to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
In aerial photographs released by the Natural Disaster Help Office, many buildings and shops have been destroyed, bridges have been twisted and collapsed and a mosque has been surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastal city continued to be shaken by aftershocks.
The range of earthquakes was felt in an area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) stated in a statement that the energy released from the massive earthquake of Friday was about 200 times the power of the atom bomb that had fallen on Hiroshima in the Second World War.
It is possible that the geography of the city, which lies at the end of a long, narrow bay, has further enlarged the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as ‘significant’ and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had collapsed.
Some fatal victims were trapped under the debris of collapsed buildings, he said. Some 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the number of victims and the damage could be even greater along the coastline 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communication with Donggala ‘is completely flat, we have no information at all’, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living there,” said the Red Cross in a statement. The staff and volunteers of the Red Cross are on their way to the affected areas.
'This is already a tragedy, but it can get even worse,' said the Red Cross.
The organization received many criticisms on Saturday because she had not said that a tsunami had hit Palu, although employees said that the waves had reached the country within the time the warning had been given.
In amateur images shared on social media, a man on the upper floor of a building in panic screams at people down the street to warn them that a tsunami is coming.
Minutes later a wall of water falls on the coast and buildings and cars are dragged along.
Reuters could not verify the images immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power failure that cut off communication around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army is currently sending cargo aircraft with supplies from Jakarta and other cities, said authorities, but the evacuations still need food and other basic needs.
The city airport is only reopened for assistance and remains closed to the public until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
Dodentol of tsunami rises above 800.
It's very bad.
The employees of World Vision from Donggala have arrived safely in the city of Palu, where workers in the courtyard of their office are looking for shelter in tents of deck sails, but passed on the road scenes of destruction, said Dosaba.
"They told me they saw a lot of houses that were destroyed," he said.
It's very bad.
Even when relief groups began the difficult task of launching emergency aid, some complained that certain foreign aid providers could not travel to Palu with a great deal of expertise.
According to the Indonesian regulations, financing, goods and staff from abroad can only be allowed if the location of a disaster is declared a national natural disaster area.
That hasn't happened yet.
‘It’s still a provincial disaster,’ said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
‘As soon as the government says, ‘OK, this is a national disaster’, we can provide international assistance, but that status has still not been declared.’
When the second night after the earthquake and tsunami of Friday fell on Palu, friends and family of the missing people hoped that they would find their loved ones alive, as in the miracles that people like to hear in terrible natural disasters like this.
On Saturday, a boy was taken out of a sewer.
On Sunday, helpers freed a woman who had been under the rubble for two days with her mother’s body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which had taken place earlier this month in Indonesia.
His students were also detained at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi.
"As a veteran in the paragliding world, I carry my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon told us that the news that the Roa Roa Hotel had collapsed had spread into the paragliding community and that in the hours that followed he had sent desperate WhatsApp messages to the athletes in Palu, who attended the beach festival.
However, in his messages, only one grey tick appeared instead of two blue ticks.
"I think that means that the messages have not been delivered," he said.
Thieves steal 26,750 dollars while supplying ATM in Newport on the Life
Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who was filling a ATM in Newport on the Life, according to a Newport police press release.
The driver had just emptied a ATM in the entertainment complex and wanted to fill it with money, so Inspector Dennis McCarthy wrote in the message.
When he was busy, another man walked from behind Brink's staff and stole a bag of money that was ready to deliver.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing, according to the press release, but the police did not say how many people were involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about the identity of the perpetrators is requested to contact the Newport police on number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name in Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name in Ye.
Last Saturday he announced the change on Twitter with the words: ‘The being that is formally known as Kanye West’.
The 41-year-old West has been called Ye for a short time and used this nickname as the title for his eighth album, which came out in June.
The name change was announced in the run-up to his performance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled her performance during the show for 'emotional reasons', says the show's creator.
You are not just an abbreviation of his present artist name. Earlier, West told us that the word has a religious meaning for him.
I believe that ‘ye’ is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you’, said West earlier this year, when he told about the title of his album to radio presenter Big Boy.
‘So I’m you, I’m us, it’s us.
I've moved from Kanye, which means 'the only', to just Ye, a reflection of the good in us, the bad, the confused, everything.
The album is rather a reflection of who we are."
He's not the only famous rapper to change his name.
Sean Combs used to be known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who used to work with West, has already worked with and without the link and the capital letters.
Mexican President promises not to use forces against civilians
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the elected president of Mexico, has promised never to use military force against civilians, and the country is on the eve of the 50th anniversary of a bloody reprisal against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would ‘never use military violence to oppress the Mexican people.’
On October 2, 1968, military troops fired a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing 300 people. In that period, left student movements emerged throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to help young Mexicans by providing monthly grants to students and opening more free public universities.
He said that young people often become members of criminal gangs because of unemployment and a lack of opportunity to study.
United States should double the funding of A.I.
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount they spend on A.I. research, says investor and A.I. specialist Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for all Google, Microsoft and Apple.
He says this in response to the announcements of A.I. that come from various departments of the U.S. government, despite the fact that the U.S. does not have a formal strategy for A.I.
In the meantime, China announced its plan last year: the country wants to be the number 1 in the field of A.I. innovations by 2030.
‘double the budget for research into A.I. would already be a good start, given that all the other countries are so far behind the US, and we are looking for the next breakthrough in A.I.’, said Lee.
A doubling of the funding could lead to a doubling of the chances of the next major achievement for A.I. in the US, said Lee this week in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book ‘AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order’ was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Innovation Ventures, which has invested in Face++, one of China's most important A.I. companies.
In the 1980s he worked in Carnegie Mellon University on an A.I. system that defeated American Othello's best player, and later he was manager of Microsoft Research and President of the Chinese division of Google.
Lee expressed his appreciation for technology competitions organized by the U.S. government, such as the Robotics Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when the next contest would take place, because it would help to discover the following visionaries.
In the US, researchers often have to work hard to get government subsidies, said Lee.
"China doesn't pick up our best academics, the companies do that," said Lee.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have been recruiting the best forces of universities to work on A.I.
Lee said that American efforts in the area of A.I. would also benefit from a change in immigration policy.
‘Whoever is a doctor in A.I. should automatically be offered a green card’, he said.
The Chinese National Council issued its development plan for artificial intelligence of the next generation in July 2017.
The Chinese Foundation for Natural Sciences provides financial support to academic staff, just as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations give money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, said Lee.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defence set up a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to involve industrial and academic partners in the initiative, and announced to the White House the formation of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced that $2 billion would be invested in the AI Next initiative.
The NSF is currently investing more than $100 million in research into A.I.
However, the US legislation that should lead to the setting up of a national safety committee for artificial intelligence has been running out for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on the possible name change of their country
Last Sunday, the Macedonian people voted in a referendum on the possible change in the name of their country in the Republic of Northern Macedonia, which would resolve a dispute with Greece that has been dragging on for decades and would no longer hinder the Macedonian application for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province also called Macedonia, and says that the name of its northern neighbour means that the country claims Greek territory, so Greece vetoed the accession of Macedonia to the European Union and NATO.
The two authorities concluded an agreement in June on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalists believe that the change of name would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he is not going to vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign is not sure that the required rise of at least 50% will be achieved, so the referendum may not be valid.
The question on the ballot is as follows: ‘Are you in favour of membership of NATO and the EU with acceptance of the agreement with Greece?’
‘Promoters of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that the price to be paid is worth trying to join bodies such as the EU and NATO. Macedonia is one of the countries that emerged when the former Yugoslavia split up.
‘I am coming today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because that will lead to a safer life for all of us,’ said 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska in Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, enough Members have indicated that they will respect the outcome, making it decisive.
The change of name would require a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The National Election Committee said that there had not been any reports of irregularities at 1 p.m.
However, the rise was only 16% at the time, compared with 34% at the previous parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of registered voters came to vote.
‘I come to vote because it’s important to my children. Our place is in Europe, said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, a voter in the capital of Skopje.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev of Macedonia, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted on 30 September 2018 in Strumica, Macedonia, during the referendum on the change of name of the country that would open the way for membership of NATO and the European Union.
For the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov set up a small stage and placed chairs for tents placed by people who boycotted the referendum.
‘We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to participate as a full member, not through a back gate,’ said Kavadarkov.
‘We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they do not accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries, such as China and Russia, and become part of European-Asian integration.'
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO's membership will generate much-needed investment for Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20%.
'I am convinced that the vast majority is in favour, because more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO,' said Zaev after his vote.
He said that a ‘yes’ as a result would be ‘a confirmation of our future’.
An opinion poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Policy Research Institute revealed that between 30 and 43% of voters would participate in the referendum, less than the required turnout.
Another poll, conducted by the hot Macedonian TV station Telma TV, concluded that 57 percent of the respondents were planning to vote on Sunday.
Of that, 70% would vote in favour.
If the referendum is to be successful, then the rise must be 50% plus one vote.
A failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government's policy since it came to power in May last year.
Look at: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City passes full defense of Brighton and score
Last Saturday, Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling made short hits with Brighton's defense in the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England. Manchester City won the 2-0 match.
It seemed like a penny whistle, how Aguero scored in the 65th minute.
The Argentinian peaks were first played in the middle field.
He ran through three Brighton defenders, right into the open field.
There Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He managed to pass a defender and was also too quick for some others at the edge of Brighton's penal court.
Then he gave a pass to the left, where Sterling was waiting.
The English attacker used his first action in the penalty court to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right shoe to defeat goalie Mathew Ryan with a shot in the right side of the net.
‘Aguero is having trouble with his feet,’ coach Pep Guardiola of Manchester City told the press.
‘We decided to have him play for 55 to 60 minutes.
And that's what happened.
We were lucky he scored a goal at the time."
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the first advantage in the Premier League.
That target arrived in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball when he was standing deep in Brighton's playground.
He sent a beautiful pass along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane held the ball for a while and then sent Sterling to the second pole.
The Sky Blues player tapped the ball into it just before it was too far.
City will compete against Hoffenheim on Tuesday at 12:55 in the Champions League Group Phase. The match will take place in the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in the German Sinsheim.
Scherzer wants to play along and not make it easy for the Rockies to reach the play-off
Now that the Washington Nationals have been eliminated for the play-off, there wasn't much reason to force a new start.
However, the ever-competitive Scherzer hopes to play against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if there are still consequences for the Rockies' participation in the play-off. They are currently one match for the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies have at least acquired a game card for the play-off due to their 5-2 victory against the Nationals last Friday, but now they want to do everything they can to secure their first section title.
‘Although there’s nothing left for us, we can at least pitch with the knowledge that the atmosphere here in Denver will be optimal with this audience and the other team is likely to play at the highest level that I would meet this year.
Why wouldn't I want to play in that?"
The Nationals still have to announce who will be on Sunday but are reportedly inclined to set up Scherzer as a pitcher in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th start, was standing in the pitching field on Thursday and would still pitch next Sunday, although that is normal his rest day.
The right-handed pitcher of Washington stands at 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strike-outs in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump organizes meeting in West Virginia
The President referred indirectly to the situation surrounding Brett Kavanaugh, his candidate for the Supreme Court, while he spoke about the importance of Republican attendance at the mid-term elections.
‘Everything we have already achieved is at stake in November.
In five weeks' time, one of the most important elections in our lives will take place.
This is one of the really big elections. I don’t participate, but actually I do. That’s why I stand up for great candidates everywhere,” he said.
Trump continued: ‘We see a terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, we see it happening now.
And they're determined to take power back, no matter what they have to do for it.
It doesn't matter to them who they hurt, who they have to push away to gain power and control. That's what they want: power and control, but we won't give them that.'
The Democrats, he said, are on a mission to "offer resistance and hinder us".
'And we've seen that in the last four days,' he said, calling the Democrats 'boss and mean and false and lying'.
He named the Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein, who sits in the Senate Committee on Justice, which led to loud outrages from the public.
‘Do you remember what she answered?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh, no, I'm waiting for one... that was really a bad body language, the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer a broad church.
The party is intolerant to people who say what they think
When the activists of Momentum voted in my local party to censor me, that was no surprise.
Finally, I am the newest in a whole series of Labour Members who got to say that we are not welcome, just because we say what we think.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received similar treatment because she was resolutely opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was punished with the censorship motion because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically, issues similar to those in which Jeremy did not agree with previous leaders.
The announcement of the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday stated: “We want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
And so it was during most of the GC meetings on Friday night during the eight years that I am already a local Labour Member.
Unfortunately, that is not the tone of many meetings today and the promise of a 'kinder, softer' policy has long been forgotten if it had ever begun.
It is becoming increasingly clear that a dissenting opinion is not tolerated in the Labour Party and any opinion is assessed as to whether it is acceptable to the party leadership or not.
This began shortly after Jeremy became leader. Colleagues who, as far as I knew, had a political outlook similar to mine, suddenly expected me to reverse and take a position that I would not otherwise have agreed to, from subjects such as national security to the European single market.
Every time I speak to an audience, whatever I say, there are protests on social media calling for my candidacy to be rejected as a Member of Parliament for the next elections, exposing the politics of the centre and telling me that I should not be a Labour Member.
And that's just what I'm going through.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my fellow Members, because my comments are generally political.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who each day have to deal with a flood of sexist or racist reactions, but do not be intimidated.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is that very abusive parties are apparently considered normal.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that broad church and with every ‘motivation of distrust’ or change of selection rules, the party becomes more petty.
For the last two years, I have often been advised to keep my mind down, not just to express my opinion loudly, and then to ‘do not get into trouble’.
But I didn't go into politics for that.
Since I became a member of the Labour School child 32 years ago, provoked by the neglect of the government of Thatcher, which literally caused my classroom to collapse, I have always advocated better public services for those who need them most, both in my role as a member of the municipal council and in my role as minister.
I never kept my politics hidden, not even in the last elections.
Everyone in Nottingham East had clarity about my policy positions and my contentions with the current leadership.
To those who have promoted the motion on Friday, I can only say one thing: when the country moves on to a Brexit that will harm families, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact, I have only one message, and it is not addressed to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to be able to serve you and I promise that threats to reject my candidacy as a Member of Parliament for the next elections or political opportunities will not stop me from acting according to what I think is in your interests.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unbeaten Ayr on the way to the top
Two late try's may have pulled the end result slightly, but there's no doubt that Ayr is rightfully triumphant in this wonderful game of the day in the Tennent's Premiership.
They are now at the top of the classification, the only undefeated team in the ten.
Eventually it was both their superior defense and their better chances that gave the home team the victory, and coach Peter Murchie was allowed to be satisfied.
“We’ve had a hard time in our games so far and we’re still unbeaten, so I’m a happy man,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose: ‘All honor to Ayr, they have taken better advantage of their opportunities than we have.’
Grant Anderson's try in the 14th minute, completed by Frazier Climo, led to an advantage for Ayr, but by a yellow map of Rory Hughes of the Scottish national team (which he got during the Warriors competition) Melrose was able to speak the numbers and Jason Baggot managed to break down a try.
With a penalty, Clio made an extra advantage for Ayr and scored a conversion after a soloty just before the rest. Thus it became 17-5 for Ayr after the first half.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's try, followed by a conversion of Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
The match was held for a long time for a serious injury by Ruaridh Knott, which was conducted on a Brancard, and once the game was reopened, Ayr could continue to run through a strike by Stafford McDowall followed by a conversion by Clima.
Then Ayr's captain Blair Macpherson got a yellow card, and again Melrose took off with the extra man when no conversion followed a try by Bruce Colvine at the end of a game where the pressure was very high.
However, the home team came back, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card because he was battling Clio without the ball, MacPherson was behind the rising Ayr mouth for a touch-down on the penalty line-out.
Clima took care of the conversion, and did so almost immediately after the restart, after Kyle Rowe caught the box kick of David Armstrong and halfbacked Gregor Henry off for the fifth home team strike.
Star of Still Game is ready for new career in the restaurant world
It looks like actor Ford Kieran from Still Game is going to the restaurant. Apparently he is appointed director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he writes and in which he acts together with his comedy partner Greg Hemphil.
The duo has announced that the upcoming ninth series will be the last in the series, and it seems that Krun's life after Craiglang is already in the planning process.
According to official data, he is the director of Astridmorn Limited.
The actor did not want to comment on the story, but a source from the Scottish Sun made it clear that Krun was looking for a way to participate in the ‘blossoming restaurant business’ in Glasgow.
'The sea is ours': the country-enclosed Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen the path to the Pacific Ocean
Seagulls patrol in a seagulled Navy office in La Paz.
In public buildings, an ocean - blue flag wafts.
On all the maritime bases of the Titicacamore to the Amazon, the motto is: ‘The sea is ours.
It's a duty to win them back."
Throughout Bolivia, the memory of the coastline that the country has had to give to Chile after a bloody nineteenth-century conflict of raw materials is still alive, just as it is the desire to preserve the Pacific once again.
That hope may have reached its highest point in the last few decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling by the International Court of Justice, which should be discussed on 1 October after five years.
‘Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity, and of course looks forward with positive prospects to the result’, said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians throughout the country will look at the ruling of the Court of Justice on large screens, hoping that the Hague Tribunal will plead in favour of Bolivia that Chile, after decades of heated talks, is obliged to grant Bolivia sovereign access to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who next year faces a controversial struggle for re-election, is also very much at stake with the verdict of Monday.
‘We are very close to the return to the Pacific,’ he swore at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court will probably not decide in favour of Bolivia, and even if it did, there would be little change.
The UN body established in the Netherlands does not have the power to grant the territory of Chile and has indicated that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
According to Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law, the judgment of the International Court of Justice falls only six months after the final judgment.
And the prospects for a positive outcome from Bolivia have certainly not improved, on the contrary, the situation may have gotten worse in the last four years.
'The issue of access to the sea has been hijacked by the present Bolivian government,' said Zárate.
The warlike rhetoric of Morales has all the good will that Chile might have been completely undermining, she claimed.
Bolivia and Chile will continue their talks at a certain point in time, but it will be extremely difficult to continue to talk next.
The two countries have not had an ambassador in each other's country since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, who represents Bolivia in The Hague, denies that the decision of the court has been taken unusually quickly.
On Monday, Bolivia will 'have an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of international relations with Chile' and an opportunity to 'end 139 years of disagreement, with mutual benefits', he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, used the maritime issue as a political crutch.
‘Bolivia will never give up his right of access to the Pacific,’ he added.
‘The verdict is an opportunity to see that we have to leave the past behind.’
North Korea says nuclear disarmament is only possible if it can trust the US
The North Korean Minister for Foreign Affairs Ri Yong Ho says that his country will never remove its nuclear weapons if it cannot trust Washington.
On Saturday, Mr Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to comply with the promises made at a summit between the rival leaders in Singapore.
He said this at the time that State Secretary Mike Pompeo seems to be about to relaunch nuclear diplomacy, more than three months after the summit in Singapore with Kim Jong Un of North Korea.
Ri says it is a 'utopia' that the permanent sanctions and US objection to a declaration ending the Korean war will ever get on the knees.
Washington is not inclined to agree to the declaration without Pyongyang taking important steps in the area of disarmament.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is skepticism and there is doubt that Pyongyang is serious when he says he would renounce an arsenal that the country probably sees as his only way to guarantee his safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris reveal the latest collection of huge headcovers, soon to be sold to you nearby
If you want to expand your hat collection or keep the sun completely out of your eyes, do not look further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne revealed a series of crazy oversized head covers for their SS19 collection on the catwalk, a striking move during the Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical hats were this summer not to think away from Instagram and these designers have sent their eye-blinding creations the catwalk on.
The striking piece of Valentino was a gigantic beige hat decorated with a feathery wide edge, which hung over the eyes of the models.
Other oversized accessories were watermelons filled with precious stones, a magic hat and even a pineapple, but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre masks, just in time for Halloween.
With many of the colorful masks the lips were stitched. They looked more like Hannibal Lecter than on haute couture.
One creation looked like diving equipment, complete with snorkel and glasses, while another looked like a melted ice cream.
And if you want to follow this bold fashion, you're lucky.
Style watchers predict that the huge hats will find their way to the clothing stores nearby.
The giant hats may be inspired by 'La Bomba', the straw hat with a two-meter-wide edge that everyone wears, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the very impractical hat that appeared everywhere on social media also provided another great creation on the catwalk: a straw beach bag that was almost as large as the model in the bathing suit that carried the bag.
The roodoran raffia bag, deflected with raffia fries and finished with a white leather pendant, was the most striking piece in the La Riviera SS19 collection of Jacquemus during Paris Fashion Week.
The famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: 'I expect to see big hats and beach bags in the shops next summer. Since the designer has made such a huge impact, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for extra large accessories.'
John Edward: Language Skills Essential for World Citizens
The independent schools in Scotland have an excellent state of academic excellence, and this has continued in 2018 with a series of excellent exam results, as well as individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other initiatives of the entire community.
With more than 30,000 students in Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), aim to provide the best service to their students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen career and their position as world citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a tailor-made school curriculum, we see that modern languages remain popular and desirable subjects outstanding within schools.
Nelson Mandela said: ‘If you talk to someone in a language he understands, you reach his head.
If you talk to him in his own language, you reach his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely only on English when we want to build relationships and a bond of trust with people from other countries.
From the recent exam results of this year, we can conclude that languages are at the top of the ranking, with the highest success rates within independent schools.
In total, 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages achieved a high score.
The data collected from 74 schools affiliated with the SCIS show that 72 percent of the students achieved a high score (‘A’) in Mandarin, while 72 percent of the students received German, 69 percent of the students received French, and 63 percent of the students received Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are now valued as a professional choice as STEM subjects (science, technology, technology and mathematics) in independent school programmes and elsewhere.
An investigation by the UK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 revealed that 17% of the obstacles to filling vacancies were attributed to a lack of language skills, according to employers.
Thus, language skills are becoming increasingly important in preparing young people for their future career.
Now that more and more job vacancies require language skills, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Whatever career a person chooses, if he has learned a second language, he will have a real advantage in the future with such a skill for life.
Direct communication with people from abroad automatically gives a multilingual person an advantage over competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75% were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation. French was the only language that surpassed the 10%, with a total of 15%.
This is why investing in language education is now important to today's children.
Several languages, especially those of emerging economies, will offer children a better chance of finding a meaningful job.
In Scotland, schools themselves choose which languages they teach.
A number of schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while other schools will teach languages that are most important for the United Kingdom when they look forward to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest is, there will always be different languages to choose from in independent schools, with teachers specializing in this field.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares children and gives them the skills needed to succeed regardless of the future.
At the moment, it cannot be denied that languages remain vitally important in a global business environment for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should actually be considered as 'international communication skills'.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
Il fout bien le faire.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron makes his debut on Sunday at the Lakers in San Diego
Fans waiting for LeBron James' first match at the Los Angeles Lakers, the wait is almost over.
Lakers-coach Luke Walton announced that James will be playing in the opening game before the season against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
We have to figure out how many more minutes he'll play.
‘There will be more than one, and less than 48,’ said Walton on the Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell said in a tweet that James is likely to play for a limited number of minutes.
After the training earlier this week, James was asked for his plans for the Lakers' schedule for the six matches prior to the season.
‘At this stage of my career, I don’t need competitions before the season to prepare me,’ he said.
Period of Trump election rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia, at a long series of election rallyes
It's the first of five scheduled Trump rallyes in the coming week, including stops in places that he likes, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that the vote on the appointment of the candidate he elects for the post in the Supreme Court has been put on hold, Trump intends to build up support for the forthcoming mid-term elections, because the Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when voting in November.
What time does Trump's rally start in West Virginia tonight and how do you look online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, starts tonight, Saturday 29 September 2018, at 19 o'clock.
You can view Trump's rally in West Virginia online via the live stream on YouTube.
Trump will probably be talking about the hearings for candidate Supreme Judge Brett Kavanaugh this week, which were extra loaded now that Kavanaugh is accused of sexual misconduct and the Senate may wait a week to vote on his appointment while the FBI is investigating the case.
But the main objective of this series of rallyes is to help the Republicans who are candidates for the November elections to get more money.
President Trump's campaign leadership said that these five rallyes next week are intended to 'stimulate volunteers and supporters, while the Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and House of Deputies', says Reuters.
“Controlling Congress is so important to its programme that the president travels to as many states as possible now that the campaign season is starting,” said a spokesman for the Trump campaign who did not want to be mentioned by name against Reuters.
Tonight's rally at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could attract fans from Ohio and Pennsylvania and be discussed in Pittsburgh media, said West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state he won by over 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who remains in the polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to give him a boost in the polls,” said Simon Haeder, political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA is willing to fight to keep the hope alive in the run-up to the singles of Sunday
After three one-sided sessions, the foursomes of Saturday afternoon may have been just what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging swing of chances is a fully invented sport concept, but one that players really believe in, and especially in competitions like this.
So who's getting the best chances right now?
'They had a six-point lead first, and now that's only four more, so we find that happiness is on our side at the moment,' said Jordan Spieth before he left at the end of the day.
Europe, of course, has the advantage that they stand for four points, while there are twelve remaining in the game.
The Americans find, as Spieth said, that they have a little wind in their sails, and there are many things that give courage, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have played together all day long and each one has scored three points of the four.
Spieth has been a fearable opponent from tea to green and he gives the good example.
The typical throat sounds he makes when he plays well became louder as his round progressed and he realized a crucial pit with which four races became a success when he and Thomas were behind two points after two games.
His well with which they won the game at 15 was followed by a similar scream, the kind from which you can conclude that he believes that the American team has not yet been defeated.
‘You have to dig deep and worry only about your own game’ said Spieth.
That's all these players can do now.
18 holes to press your mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undeniable story of the Ryder Cup.
This remarkable but wonderful European duo has four to four and can do nothing wrong.
'Moliwood' was the only duo that didn't play a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the back nine on Friday morning they avoided bogey's.
As a result of that series, and the way they seem to exchange energy with their noisy audience, they are the players who have to be defeated Sunday. If Fleetwood or Molinari wins, he will be the most popular player ever to win a European victory when the sun sets above Le Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
However, it is premature to speak of a European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made short encounters with Sergio Garcia, the four-ball hero of that morning, when he formed a duo with Alex Noren.
A bowey and two doubles on the front nine led to a backlog for the Spaniard and the Swede that they no longer got over.
On Sunday, however, there is no one who can help to catch up with you.
The four-balls and foursomes are so fascinating to see through the interactions between the duos, the advice they give, the advice they don't give and the way a strategy can change in a blink of an eye.
So far, the European team has played the best and has a good advantage in the run-up to the last day, but this foursome session has also shown that Team USA is willing to fight, something that some, especially in the US, doubted.
Europe takes the lead with 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe begins with a beautiful lead on the last day of the Ryder Cup. After the four-balls and foursomes of Saturday they stand 10-6 in front of the United States.
The inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led their team with two victories more than Tiger Woods, who had difficulty making them four points ahead in Le Golf National.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who wanted to return the trophy she lost two years ago in Hazeltine, was stronger than the blustering Americans in the four-balls in the morning, with a score of 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the foursomes, where it won two matches, but could no longer catch up.
Jim Furijk's team must score eight points during the 12 singles games of Sunday in order to preserve the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European newcomer to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, who got the nickname ‘Molliwood’, after a sensational weekend, are the second duo in the history of the Ryder Cup that wins four points in their four opening games.
After putting Woods and Patrick Reed into the four-balls, they were beautifully played together and defeated a disappointing Woods and American newcomer Bryson Decambeau with a powerful 5&4.
Woods, who slid himself through two games on Saturday, occasionally showed a wonderful move, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 games in four-balls and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, equipped for the four-balls of this morning, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes and together they defeated Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the number one and three of the world, with 2&1.
Yet it did not run out of a pavement for Europe on this pleasant day with a breeze to the southwest of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, who already won the Major three times, and Justin Thomas set the standard for the Americans on Saturday with three points.
They won after a hard match with 2&1 of the Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Paulter in the four-balls and later defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy with 4&3 in the foursomes, after losing the first four holes.
It has only happened twice before in the history of the Ryder Cup that a team has been able to catch up with four points at the beginning of the singles, although the team of Furyk has plenty of equal play, as they currently have the trophy in their hands.
But now that they have been in second place for two days, a counterattack on Sunday seems too high.
North Korea says it will ‘in no case’ unilaterally disarm without trust
On Saturday, the Foreign Minister of North Korea told the United Nations that the continued sanctions lead to increasing mistrust in the United States and that under such circumstances the country could not unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told the UN Annual General Assembly that over the past year North Korea had taken ‘important goodwill measures’, such as the cessation of nuclear and rocket tests, the dismantling of the nuclear testing site and the promise not to spread nuclear weapons and technology.
"But we do not see a similar response from the US," he said.
‘Without any confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances we will not unilaterally disarm ourselves.’
Although Ri repeated the known North Korean complaints about Washington’s opposition to a ‘phased’ approach to denuclearization, in which North Korea would be rewarded as it continued, it was noted that he did not reject unilateral denuclearization a priori, as Pyongyang did in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the very first summit between an active American president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim promised to work towards the ‘denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula’, while Trump promised guarantees for the security of North Korea.
North Korea is seeking a formal end to the Korean war from 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to ease the harsh international sanctions against North Korea.
"The US insists on 'denuclearization first' and increases the pressure by means of sanctions to achieve their goal in a coercive way and even by objecting to the 'declaration of the end of war'," said Ri.
‘The perception that sanctions can bring us to our knees is an air castle of the people who are ignorant of us.
But the problem is that the constant sanctions only strengthen our mistrust.'
Ri made no mention of plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, something that the American leader had raised earlier this week at the United Nations.
Instead, the Minister stressed three meetings between Kim and the South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: ‘If the other party on this issue of denuclearisation was South Korea and not the US, the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula would not have come to such an impasse.’
Nevertheless, Ri's speech was considerably different from last year's when he told the United Nations General Assembly that it was inevitable that North Korean missiles on the continent of the United States would be directed after 'Mr Evil President' Trump Kim called a 'missile man' on a suicide mission.
Trump, who threatened to destroy North Korea completely last year, praised Kim to the United Nations this year for his courage to take steps to disarm, but said that much still needs to be done and that sanctions should remain until North Korea denucleates.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he had no timetable for this: ‘Whether it takes two years, three years or five months, that doesn’t matter.’
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
On Thursday, however, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council: ‘The enforcement of the sanctions of the Security Council must continue vigorously and surely until we have achieved the complete, final, verified denuclearisation.’
Since 2006, the Security Council has implemented unanimous sanctions against North Korea in order to significantly reduce funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo had a meeting with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and said he would go back to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not go well.
Nearly a few hours after he left Pyongyang in July and said that progress had been made, North Korea accused him of making 'course-like demands'.
This month, during a meeting with Moon, North Korea promised to dismantle a missile site and also a nuclear complex if the United States were to take ‘similar measures’.
He said that Kim had told him that the ‘corresponding measures’ he wanted were security guarantees that Trump had promised in Singapore, and were moving towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students attend a course on the importance of adequate rest
A new course at Harvard University this year ensures that all students get more sleep, in an effort to combat the growing macho culture in which it seems cool to study all night and drink a lot of caffeine.
One professor found that the students of the world's largest university often have no idea of the basic principles of self-care.
Charles Czeisler, Professor of Sleep Medicine at Harvard Medical School, a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, set up the course. As far as he is aware, this is unique in the U.S.
He got the idea to start the course after giving a talk about the influence of sleep deprivation on learning.
"At the end of my speech, a girl came to me and said, "Why am I only hearing this now, in my last year?"
She said that no one had ever told her how important sleep is, which surprised me," he said to The Telegraph.
The course, which will be organised for the first time this year, will explain to the students the basic principles of how good sleep habits help improve academic and athletic performance and how they also promote their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to organise the course when it was found that students had a serious sleep shortage during the week.
The course takes one hour and includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one of the parts, the students see an image of a dorm, where they click on coffee cups, curtains, exercise equipment and books to learn more about the effects of caffeine and light and the way sports performance is affected by sleep deprivation, and the importance of a routine when sleeping.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
With the help of a map of the campus, with interactive icons, participants are encouraged to think about their daily routine.
‘We know that this will not change the behaviour of the students immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know all of this, just as people have the right to know the consequences of the choice for cigarettes on their health, added Czeisler.
The culture of nightlife study still exists, he says, and because of modern technology and the growing pressure on students sleep deprivation is an ever greater problem.
Ensure sufficient sleep, of good quality, the student's 'secret weapon' must be to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said, and even to avoid weight gain, because sleep deprivation causes the brain to give them a constant hunger feeling.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old from Calfornia who is studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to prepare the course because he had attended the professor's class last year when he studied at Harvard in his first year.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to make the course available to everyone on campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all students to follow a similar study programme before they come to the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler advises students to set an alarm for their bedtime, and not just an alarm to get up. They must also be aware of the harmful effects of the 'blue light' of electronics screens and LED lighting, which can disrupt your circadian rhythm, which can cause you to have trouble falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal is to destroy Gerrard's men
The Rangers saw their competition again disappointing when Dolly Menga scored and Steven Gerrard's weak team defeated 1-0 in Livingston.
The team of Ibrox hoped for a first victory during a competition since they defeated St. Johnstone with 4-1 in February, but Gary Holt's team won the defeat, hardly Gerrard's second manager in 18 games. His team is now eight points behind Hearts, which runs further to the top of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga scored seven minutes before the rest, and the Rangers failed to score the equalizer.
The Rangers now descend to the sixth place, Livingston rises to the third, with only a difference in number of goals compared to Hibernian.
And the Rangers could have another problem, since border judge Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound after apparently an object was thrown to him by the visitor team supporters.
Gerrard made eight changes to his team. They crossed Ayr and went to half the finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt stayed at the same eleventh for Livingston, who managed to prune the Hearts last week. He would have been delighted at the way his well-trained team managed to block the opponents at every move.
The Rangers may have had the most ball ownership, but Livingston did more.
They should have scored after two minutes, when Menga gave up the ball for the first time and Scott Pittman had the goal of Allan McGregor in sight, but the middle fielder couldn't finish it.
A deep free staircase of Keaghan Jacobs reached captain Craig Halkett, but his colleague-defender Alan Lithgow kicked against the back pole.
The Rangers did manage to take control, but they seemed to hope for a good outcome rather than really believe in it if they could approach the goal.
Alfredo Morelos found that he was entitled to a penalty when he and Steven Lawless collided after 15 minutes of playing, but referee Steven Thomson waved away the request from the Colombian.
The Rangers could only shoot twice to the goal in the first half, but Liam Kelly, who was formerly the target of the Ibrox, could easily stop the baseball of Lassana Coulibaly and the tame shot of Ovie Ejaria.
The Opener of Livingston in the 34th minute may not be in the extension of the general game course, no one can deny that they deserved this, even though it was only because of their hard work.
Again, the Rangers were unmatched by Jacobs' deep game pattern.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher passed the ball on to Scott Robinson, who remained cold-blooded and chose Menga, who easily stepped into the ball.
Gerrard made a break with Coulibaly/Ryan Kent. This move had almost immediate consequences when the winger Morelos passed, but an impressive Kelly racete off his line away to stop the ball.
But Livingston continued to force the visitors to play a kind of game that Livingston prefers to play, where Lithgow and Halkett keep escalating long balls.
Holt's team could have increased his lead in the final stage of the game, but McGregor kept up and blocked Jacobs, after which Lithgow came from a wide angle.
Invasioner Glenn Middleton of the Rangers requested at the end of the game a penalty kick after an attack with Jacobs, but Thomson looked the other way again.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from the almanac of our ‘Sunday Morning’: September 30, 1882, today exactly 136 years ago, for whom can TELLEN... the day on which the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm ‘Hans’ Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device called geiger counter.
Since then, the violin counter has not been able to think away from science, and also became an icon in pop culture, for example in ‘Bells or Coronado’, a 1950 film with the unlikely cowboy scientist Roy Rogers and Dale Evans at first sight:
Man: ‘What the hell is that?’
Rogers: ‘That’s a geiger counter. It’s used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
If you set up this headphones, you will hear the effect of the atoms emitted by the radioactivity in the minerals."
Evans: ‘It’s really banging now!’
'Hans' Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name remains relevant.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to ‘see’ malignant cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to ‘see’ and kill malignant cells
Vaccine learns immune system to recognise malignant cells in the context of treatment
The method includes the extraction of immune cells in a patient to transform them into a laboratory.
They can then ‘see’ a protein that often occurs in many types of cancer and then be re-injected
A test vaccine provides promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who was treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells saw her ovary anchor disappear for more than 18 months
Using the method, immune cells are removed in a patient, after which the cells in the laboratory are adjusted so that they can ‘see’ the protein HER2, which often occurs in all types of cancer. Then the cells are re-injected.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 ‘stimulates the growth of different types of cancer’, including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer and colon cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar way of removing immune cells from patients and ‘teaching’ these cells to treat cancer cells was already shown to be effective in treating a particular type of leukaemia.
Kanye West runs pro-Trump-tirad and wears MAGA-pet after his appearance in Saturday Night Live.
That didn't go as he had hoped.
Kanye West was released on a Saturday Night Live broadcast after an unscrupulous performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he became a presidential candidate in 2020.
After bringing his third song of the evening, Ghost Town, with a hat on his head with the text Make America Great Again, he turned a tyrant against the Democrats and repeated that he supports Trump.
‘Many times when I’m talking to a white person, he asks, ‘How can you now have sympathy for Trump? He’s a racist!’
When I was worried about racism, I had left America for a long time,' he said.
The broadcast of Saturday Night Live began with a parody in which Hollywood star Matt Damon stabbed the dragon with Brett Kavanaugh's testimony in the Senate Committee on Justice in connection with the alleged assault on which Christine Blasey Ford accuses him.
The tyrad of West was not broadcast, but comedian Chris Rock uploaded them to social media.
It's not clear if Rock wants to stick the dragon with West with his mail.
West also complained to the public that he had been taken backstage under fire for his cap.
“They teased me backstage.
They said, "Don't step on the stage with that hat."
They harassed me!
And then they say I'm apathetic," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: ‘Do you want to see how apathetic it looks?’ He said that he would dress her superman-cape, ‘because that means you can’t command me. Do you want the world to get better?
Give me some love."
At least twice came from the audience and the cast members of SNL seemed embarrassed, according to Variety. The magazine was told by one present: ‘The whole studio was suddenly quiet.’
West was guest as last-minute replacement of singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-friend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West surprised many with a performance of the number I Love it while he was dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West was supported by the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: ‘To one of our bravest spirits: DON’T YOU THE MASSA TROTSEERT.’
But talk show-presenter Karen Hunter tweeted that West was just ‘normally herself, and that’s beautiful.’
‘But I choose not to reward anyone who supports and spits out an ideology that harms my community (by buying his music or clothing or by supporting his ‘art’).
He's free to do whatever he wants.
We too, added them.
Before the show began, the rapper had announced on Twitter that he had changed his name. From now on, he says, ‘the creature that is formally known as Kanye West’.
He's not the first artist to change his name. He was preceded by Diddy Puff, also known as Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Colleague-rapper Snoop Dogg has also worn the name Snoop Lion and the late music legend Prince once changed his name to a symbol and then in The artist formally known as Prince.
Accusation of attempted murder after stabbing in restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was accused of attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, the police said.
The defendant is expected to appear before the police judge in Belfast on Monday.
The charge will be investigated by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Game of Thrones-star Kit Harington pulls out to toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role of sword fighter Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones of HBO.
But the 31-year-old actor goes out to the macho hero's stereotype and says that when young boys see such roles on the screen, they often think they have to be tough to get respect.
In a conversation with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that he felt that ‘there was something wrong’ and asked himself how the problem of toxic masculinity should be addressed in the age of #MeToo.
Kit, who recently married his co-star of Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, who is also 31 years old, admitted that he is strongly convinced that the problem needs to be addressed.
'This is really an important question for me personally at the moment: where has it gone wrong with our masculinity?' he said.
"What did we teach men when they grew up, which is why we are now facing this problem?"
Kit believes that television could be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity, due to its very male characters.
He continued: ‘What is born and what is learned?’
What is being taught on TV and on the street that makes young boys think they have to be a certain kind of man?
I think that is one of today's big questions: how do we change that?
'Cause obviously something went wrong for young men.'
In the interview he also admitted that he will not act in prequels or sequences of Games of Thrones when the series is over next summer, because he is ‘ready with battlefields and horses’.
From November, Kit will be playing in a revival of True West by Sam Shepard, the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he found his meeting with his wife Rose to be the most beautiful result of Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife during the show, so that's how I kept my future family and my life from now on," he said.
Rose played Ygrite, the great love of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the fantasy series that was crowned with an Emmy.
The couple was married in June 2018 on the estate of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports an increase of 14% new cases
China reports that the number of Chinese with HIV and AIDS has increased by 14%.
Health authorities say that more than 820,000 people are affected in the country.
Only in the second quarter of 2018, 40,000 new cases were reported.
In the vast majority of new cases, the diseases were transmitted through sex, which was not previously the case.
HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China through transfusions of contaminated blood in the past.
But the number of people who grow HIV in this way is now almost zero, said Chinese health officials at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, compared to the same period last year, the number of people with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people.
The transmission of HIV via sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality has no longer been punishable in China since 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is reportedly widespread.
According to studies, the conservative values of the country estimate that 70 to 90% of men who have sex with men would eventually marry a woman.
Often the diseases are transmitted through inadequate protection in sexual relations in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese authorities have promised universal access to HIV medication in the context of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that staff member has leaked data from Republican senators and exclaims “hazardous lies” and “complot theories”
U.S. Congressman Maxine Waters is opposed to the allegations that one of her staff member has posted the personal data of three U.S. Republican senators on the Wikipedia page of the legislators.
The Democrats from Los Angeles claim that the allegations are spread by ‘extremely right’ contestants and websites.
'Lies, lies and even more common lies', said Waters in a statement on Twitter.
The published data would include the private address and phone number of the U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The data appeared on Thursday online. They were posted by an unknown in Capitol Hill at a hearing of the Senate Committee on the allegations of sexual misconduct at the address of Brett Kavanaugh, candidate-judge to the Supreme Court.
The leak came after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
According to conservative websites such as Gateway Pondit and RedState, the IP address that indicates the source of the posts was linked to the Waters office and contained the information of a Waters employee, the Hill said.
"This unfounded accusation is completely false and a blatant lie," said Waters.
‘My employee, whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised as a result of these false accusations, was by no means responsible for leaking this information.
This unfounded accusation is completely false and a blatant lie."
The Waters statement soon encountered criticism online, including by former press officer of the White House Ari Fleischer.
'This denial sounds angry', wrote Butcher.
‘From this you can imagine that she does not have the temperament to be Congressman.
If someone is accused of something he didn't do, he shouldn't get angry.
He shouldn't be rebellious.
He should not question the prosecutor's motives.
He must remain calm and serene."
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters' response with the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of excessive anger at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who wants to take over Waters' place in the mid-term elections, also gave his opinion on Twitter.
"Great, if it's true," he tweeted.
In her statement Waters said that her office had informed the relevant services and law enforcement agencies of these false accusations.
"We will make the perpetrators known," she said, "and that they are legally held responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to my staff."
Review: Johnny English Strikes Again - weak spy parody with Rowan Atkinson
In every new film with a British impact, we are now traditionally looking for references to the Brexit, and that indeed appears to apply to this revival of the Johnny English franchise, the comical action films with a sloppy spy in the lead role, which started in 2003 with Johnny English and was created back in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Is this airy abstinence about how bad we are doing the latest export product for our country?
The incompetent Johnny English with excruciating eyes and flexible facial features manages at least to send everything in the hundred, also with his second comeback. From his name you can conclude that he is a common funny character that was conceived for cinemagoers in countries where one speaks a language other than English.
He is of course the foolish secret agent who, despite his bizarre claim to smooth glamour, has a bit of Clouseau, a touch of Mr Bean and a touch of that guy who contributed one note to the theme number of Charios of Fire during the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games in London in 2012.
He is originally based on the traveler and the international mysterious man that Atkinson once played in the TV spots of Barclaycard (which everyone has forgotten in the meantime) who always leaves behind a certain chaos.
His latest portrait of Johnny English contains one or two beautiful moments.
I loved how Johnny English is approaching a helicopter in his medieval armor and the rotor blades are ticking against his helmet.
Atkinson can well show in this film how much talent he has for physical comedy, but the humor comes rather faint and crazy enough excessive, especially now that the "serious" film series like 007 and Mission Impossible itself include comedy as an ingredient, and do well.
The humor seems more intended for children than for adults, and Johnny English's stupid disaster comes to me less original and focused than the jokes without the text of the character Bean that Atkinson plays.
The constant theme now is that Britain is in great difficulty.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated the super-secret spy network on the web, making the identity of all active secret agents of Great Britain known, to the great horror of the agent in function, a sadly small role of Kevin Eldon.
That is the drop that makes the bucket overflow from the prime minister, a pretentious woman with problems to her head and terribly unpopular as a politician. Emma Thompson does her utmost to remind Teresa May of this character, but the script does not offer much material to work with.
According to her advisers, she must employ a retired spy, since every active spy is compromised.
And that means the stunning Johnny English himself, who now works as a schoolmaster in a chic setting, but gives an unofficial lesson about undercover work. Here are fun jokes in the story, because the espionage of English reminds me of School of Rock.
English is quickly invited to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunited with his former pathetic help Bough, replayed by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man. His wife is captain of an submarine, a turbulent and jovial role that lies below Vicki Pepperdine’s level.
So the Batman and Robin of Her Majesty's Secret Service's disastrous conditions are back in action and meet Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister is unfortunately in favour of the charms of the charismatic technology billionaire who claims to be able to solve British computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin with their odyssey of clever fun: dressed as waiters they set fire to a transparent French restaurant, they kick noise on board the luxury yacht of Volta and English unleashes pure anarchy when he tries to use a Virtual Reality headset to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta's house.
For the latter, all the registers are opened, but no matter how well-meaning and turbulent the scene is, it reminds me of children's television.
It's not all very original.
And like Johnny English's other films, I wonder: can the British film industry really not think of a role that honors the talent of Rowan Atkinson?
Labour denies that the party is considering a plan in which British workers work four days a week but are paid for five days
The Labour Party of Jeremy Corbyn would consider a radical plan in which British workers work four days a week, but were paid for five days.
It is said that the party would like companies' managers to pass on the savings they make as a result of the Revolution of Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) to their employees by giving them an extra day's holiday.
For example, employees can enjoy a three-day weekend but still earn the same amount.
According to sources, the idea fits into the party's economic agenda and plans to shift the country's balance towards the workers.
The transition to a four-day working week was already approved by the Association of Trade Unions, which considers it a good way to ensure that workers can benefit from the changing economy.
A high-ranking Labour Party source told The Sunday Times: “It is expected that a policy review will be announced before the end of the year.
"It will not happen from one moment to another, but a four-day working week is an objective that fits in with the party's desire to make the balance in the economy more favourable to the workers and that also fits within the party's overall industrial strategy."
Labour is not the first party to support such an idea, given that the Green Party has already promised a four-day working week in the 2017 national election campaign.
However, the aim is not yet supported by the full Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "A four-day working week is not a policy of the party nor is it considered by the party."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour conference last week to clarify his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back the power of the "unfaced drivers" and the "profits" of utilities.
The Shadow Chancellor's plans also mean that current shareholders of water companies may not regain the full value of their share, as a Labour government could apply 'discounts' on the basis of perceived misconduct.
He also confirmed that there are plans to include employees in the boards of management of companies and to set up inclusive ownership funds (Inclusive Ownership Funds) which give 10% of the shares of private sector firms to employees who can earn up to £500 a year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell '60 Minutes' whether the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh can change their mind
The investigation by the FBI into allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least one week and raises the question whether the findings of the FBI could ensure that Republican senators withdraw their support for the candidate.
In an interview that is broadcast on Sunday at '60 Minutes', correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could discover something that could lead them to change their mind.
Kennedy seemed more open in this than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I told the hearing I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him, after this happened, after the accusation came out, and I asked him, "Did you do it?"
He was resolute, determined, unambiguous."
The voice of Graham, however, seems to be wall-resistant.
"My opinion on Brett Kavanaugh is solid and the accusation should contain dynamite," he said.
"As for Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett has strongly denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And no one named by her could verify it.
It was 36 years ago.
I don't see any new developments."
What is the Global Citizens Festival and has it contributed to reducing poverty?
This Saturday the Global Citizen Festival will be organized in New York, an annual music event where a very impressive line-up of stars will take place and which has an equally impressive mission: the end of poverty in the world.
For the seventh time again, tens of thousands of people for the Global Citizens Festival will come to the Great Lawn in Central Park. Not only to enjoy acts like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes but also to generate awareness for the real purpose: ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizens Festival, which was first organised in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, a group of international interest activists who hope to end poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting it.
Concertgoers who want to obtain a free ticket for the event (unless they were willing to pay for a VIP card), had to complete a series of tasks, or 'actions', such as volunteering, e-mailing a world leader, making a phone call, or in another significant way generating awareness for the goal: an end to poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizens Festival been, with another 12 years to go towards this goal?
Is it the idea to reward people with a free concert a suitable way to convince people to demand a call for action or is this just another form of 'clicktivism', giving people the feeling that they are making a real contribution by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, according to Global Citizens, more than 19 million 'actions' of supporters have been registered, aimed at a wide range of different goals.
According to Global Citizens, these actions have contributed to the efforts of world leaders and have made policy proposals worth more than 37 billion dollars to change the lives of 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the Group quoted 390 initiatives and declarations on the basis of the actions, of which at least USD 10 billion has already been paid out or brought together by sponsorship actions.
The group estimates that the funds obtained have so far had an impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
One of the most important declarations of intent is that of The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and executives from the United Kingdom with the aim of 'helping children realize their full potential'. This group has pledged $35 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the help of the British government, donors, other national authorities and Global Citizens like you, we can make a footnote to the history of social injustice that is malnutrition," said Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, the public at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also announced that, after more than 5,000 actions were sent in which the UK government was asked to improve the nutritional situation of mothers and children, the government announced to support a project, the Power of Nutrition, that 5 million women and children will reach with nutritional interventions.
In answer to one of the frequently asked questions on the Global Citizens website, "Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?"
said the group: "It will be a long and difficult way, sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the civil rights and anti-separation movements in front of us, we will ultimately succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are some of the artists who will be performing this year at the New York event presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States can use the marine for a 'blockade' to hinder Russian exports of energy - Minister of Home Affairs
Washington can 'if necessary' resort to the Navy to prevent Russian energy from entering the market, including in the Middle East, explained Ryan Zinke, the U.S. Interior Minister, as mentioned by the Washington Examiner.
Zinc claimed that Russia's involvement in Syria, where the country acts at the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe that they are only in the Middle East to be able to act in energy, as in Eastern Europe and the southern flank of Europe," he said.
And according to the official, there are ways and means to counter this.
"The United States has this possibility, with the Navy, to ensure that the shipping routes remain open and, if necessary, to block them to ensure that their energy does not enter the market," he said.
Zinc spoke for invited persons during an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that defies itself as the 'voice of energy consumption' in the US.
He went further and compared Washington's approach to Russia with Iran's approach and noted that these did not differ significantly.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less the use and replacement of fuels," he said, referring to Russia as a country that knows only a 'art', with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements come at a time when the government of Trump is trying to stimulate the export of liquid natural gas to Europe, thereby replacing Russia, a country which is by far the cheapest option for European consumers.
For this reason, officials of the Trump government, including President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw sight from the 'inappropriate' pipeline project Nord Stream 2, which, according to Trum van Berlin, has made Moscow's 'captive'.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, worth 11 billion dollars, will double its current pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is an economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's strong opposition to the project is directed only for economic reasons and that it is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we agree with the view that energy should not be used to exert pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers themselves," said Alexander Novak, Russian Minister for Energy, after a meeting with Rick Perry, US Minister for Energy, in Moscow in September.
The US position has prompted a reaction from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The Bundesverband der Deutschen Industrie (BDI), the leading industrial organisation in Germany, has called on the US not to interfere with EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third power interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Bundesverband der Deutschen Industrie (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren "considers it seriously" to participate in the presidential elections in 2020," says the Senator for Massachusetts
Elizabeth Warren, the Senator from Massachusetts said on Saturday that she was "deeply thinking about it" to participate in the presidential elections after the mid-term elections.
At a local meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was thinking about participating in the elections.
"It's time for women to go to Washington to repair the damaged government, and this also means that a woman in the top position," she said, according to the political newspaper The Hill.
"After November 6th, I will think seriously about making myself elected president."
Warren ran against President Donald Trump at the meeting in the town hall and said he was "turning this country in the wrong direction".
"I'm so worried about what Donald Trump is doing in our democracy," she said.
Warren has been frank in her criticism of Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, his candidate for the Supreme Court.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course, we have to wait for an investigation from the FBI before we vote on this."
However, an opinion poll published on Thursday revealed that a majority of Warren's own supporters believe that it should not be elected by 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the 'probable' voters in Massachusetts said that the senator should not stand for election, according to an opinion poll by the Political Research Center of Suffolk University and the Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent were in favour of her being elected.
The study showed that there was more support for former Governor Deval Patrick, 38% before a possible candidacy and 48% against it.
Other names of leading Democrats associated with possible participation in the presidential elections in 2020 are former Vice President Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, Senator from Vermont.
Biden said he would make an official decision in January, according to an Associated Press report.
Sarah Palin talks about PTSS by Track Palin at an election meeting of Donald Trump
Track Palin, aged 26, spent a year in Iraq after serving in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
"By what my own son must experience, what he is experiencing now that he is back, I understand other families who experience the consequences of PTSS and the injuries with which some of our soldiers return," she told the audience who attended a meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said about her son and other veterans "they come back a little differently, they come back and have become harder, they come back and wonder if there is respect for what their fellow soldiers and the pilots and all the other soldiers have given to the homeland".
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and was charged with domestic violence and assault on a woman, interfering in a report on domestic violence and possession of a weapon under influence, according to Dan Bennett, police spokesman in Wasilla.
Washington D.C. and 18 states support the protest against a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal protest against a new policy in the US that denies asylum to victims fleeing violence from gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 states and Washington D.C. submitted a statement last Friday as a 'friend-of-the-court' to the Washington court in support of an asylum seeker who is fighting this policy, NBC News reports.
The full name of the complainant in the Grace versus Sessions case that the American Civil Liberties Union brought against federal policy in August has not been disclosed.
She says that her partner "and his violent sons who are members of a gang" abused her but that American officials rejected her application for asylum on July 20.
She's under arrest in Texas.
The lawyers of the states that support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of people apply for asylum in the United States, as countries with major problems in the field of gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy has reversed a decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals in 2014, which allowed immigrants without documents fleeing domestic violence to seek asylum.
Karl Racine, the Attorney General of Washington, D.C., said on Friday in a statement that the new policy "neglects ten years of state, federal and international legislation".
"Federal legislation requires that all asylum applications be assessed on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application and such an obstacle is contrary to that principle" is stated in the statement of the "friend of the court".
The lawyers further argue that the policy of denying immigrants access to the US is damaging the economy of the US, because these immigrants are likely to become new entrepreneurs and the country 'provides the necessary labour'.
Jeff Sessions, the Minister of Justice, ordered judges no longer to grant asylum to victims of domestic and gang-related violence in June.
"Association is available to those fleeing their country because of persecution or fear based on race, religion, nationality or membership of a specific social group or political opinion," says Sessions in its announcement of 11 June of the policy.
Asylum was never meant to alleviate all problems, even if these problems are serious, with which people are confronted every day, everywhere in the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu while the number of deaths doubled in the race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was also getting worse.
"It feels very tense," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, trying to comfort her feverish baby in an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute new bodies arrive in ambulances.
And clean water is scarce".
Residents returned to their destroyed homes and searched in their watery possessions for valuables they could still use.
Hundreds of people have been injured and hospitals have been overpopulated, as far as they have not been damaged by the 7.5 earthquake on the Richter scale.
Some injured, including Dwi Haris, who had a broken back and shoulder, rested outside the military hospital in Palu, where patients were treated outside because of the risk of severe aftershocks.
Tears filled his eyes when he told of his feelings when the devastating earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was pressed against the remnants of a wall," Haris told a correspondent of the Associated Press and added to this he was with his family in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife cry for help, and later I heard nothing.
I don't know what happened to her and to our child.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador accuses China of 'intimidation' with 'propaganda ads'
One week after an official Chinese newspaper placed an advertisement of four pages in an American daily, in which the mutual benefits of trade between the US and China were highlighted, the US ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump recently referred to the paid annex of China Daily in the Des Moines Register, the most sold newspaper in Iowa, after he accused China of interference in the U.S. Congressional elections of 6 November, an accusation denied by China.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere with the US elections marked, according to U.S. officials quoted by Reuters, a new phase in an escalating campaign by Washington to put China under pressure.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in an escalating trade war, in which they have imposed increasing import rates on each other.
China's retaliation rates early in the trade war were specifically aimed at meeting exporters in states like Iowa, who support the Republican Party of Trump, as Chinese and American experts have said.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and for a long time governor of Iowa, an important exporter of agricultural products to China, said that China had hit American workers, farmers and businesses.
"China", as Branstad wrote in an opinion paper in the Sunday's Des Moines Register, "is now doubling the intimidation by publishing propaganda advertisements in our free press."
"By spreading this propaganda, the government of China makes use of the freedom of expression and of a free press, a long cherished tradition in America by placing a paid ad in Des Moines Register" wrote Branstad.
"In contrast, at a kiosk in the centre of Beijing you will find dissenting voices in vain and you will not see any true reflection of the diverse opinions that the Chinese people have possible about the difficult economic path, because the media are firmly under the thumbs of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers refused to publish his article," as he did not say in which newspaper this was.
By the Kavanaugh debacle the Republican alienated women voters from themselves just before the mid-term elections, analysts warn
Now many important Republicans flock around Brett Kavanaugh, the candidate for the Supreme Court, and defend him against various accusations of sexual violence, analysts warn that this will result in a setback, especially among women, during the forthcoming mid-term elections.
The emotions on this subject have grown enormously and most Republicans have already informed that they want to continue voting.
"These things cannot be reversed," said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, to The Hill for an article that appeared on Saturday.
Reeher said he was wondering if Senator Jeff Flake (Republican, Arizona)'s attempt to argue for an FBI investigation at the last moment would be enough to satisfy the angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, they will not forget it tomorrow and they will not forget it in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn on Friday according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, demonstrators called out "November is coming!" during their demonstration in the Senate Hall, while the Republicans who controlled the Justice Committee chose to approve Kavanaugh's candidacy, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, reported Mic.
"The enthusiasm and motivation for the Democrats will reach a record height," said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst, to the news site.
"People say it's already high, and that's true.
But it can go even further, especially among floating female voters in the outlying areas and among younger voters, from 18 to 29 years of age, who often do not vote even though they do not agree with the president."
Even for the public testimony of Ford, in which she further explained her accusation of sexual harassment against the candidate for the Supreme Court, analysts suggested that a setback could follow if the Republicans were to press through the appointment.
"This has become a confused mess for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, former party president of the Republican Party, earlier last week according to NBC News.
"It is not only about the vote in committee, or about the final vote or Kavanaugh sitting in court, but also about the way the Republicans handled this and how they dealt with it," says Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps Democrats to be elected, clearly on the news channel.
However, the Americans seem to be divided over the question of who they believe after the Ford and Kavanaugh testimonies, with a small majority on the side of the latter.
A new opinion poll by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents believe Ford’s testimony, and that 35 percent believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that they thought Kavanaugh had certainly lied or probably lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After Flake's proposal, the FBI is currently investigating Ford's charges and at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford declared to the Senate Committee on Justice last week that Kavanaugh had assaulted her under the influence of alcohol when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court showed her his genitals at a party during the time they both studied at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plant a new internet to address Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, starts a startup that wants to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the latest project of the technology legend, is a company based on the open source platform Solid of Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which persons have access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that 'world domination' is the leading idea behind Inrupt.
"We have to do this now," he said about the startup.
"This is a historic moment."
The app uses Solid technology to enable people to make their own 'personal online data storage' or POD.
This allows you to store lists of contacts, activity lists, an agenda, a music library and other personal and professional tools.
It is as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available together via one browser and all at the same time.
What makes POD unique is the fact that it totally depends on the user who has access to which information.
The company calls this "personal empowerment through data".
The idea behind Inrupt is according to CEO John Bruce that the company provides the resources, processes and skills needed to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some developers who have been contracted to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
From this week on, technology developers around the world can make their own decentralised apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not going to have conversations with "Facebook and Google about introducing or not introducing a complete transformation that puts all their business models on their heads at once."
"We're not asking for their permission."
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "the mission (of Inrupt) is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new web, which is built on Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Even after the start of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain as founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about this new era for the web," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Spiritual and supporter of Victoria Cross from World War I honored
The only clergyman of the Church of England who acquired a Victoria Cross during World War I as a military officer is honored in his birthplace 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel, Reverend Bernard Vann received the award following the attack on 29 September 1918 by Bellenglish and Lehaucourt.
However, four days later he was killed by a sniper and never knew that he had received the highest British military honor.
A memorial stone was revealed by his two grandsons during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of the grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was 'brilliant symbolic' that the stone was revealed exactly 100 years after the fact that his grandfather was distinguished.
According to the London Gazette, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion on 29 September 1918 over the Canal de Saint-Quentin "in a very dense mist and under heavy fire from fielders and machine guns".
He later stormed through to the fire line and led the line forward before running alone to a field ranger and shut down three members of the station.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "something I know I can never tap into, but something that makes me feel humble."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid a wreath after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he "felt very honoured to play a role in the parade" and added that "the bravery of a real hero is evident from the support he receives from a large number of people".
MMA fans stayed up all night to see Bellator 206 and got Peppa Pig instead
Imagine, you've stayed up all night to watch a full-blown Bellator 206 and you won't see the most important moment.
There were 13 battles on the San Jose bill, including six in the main section, and this was broadcast all night in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6:00 in the morning, at the very moment that Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were getting ready for their fight, viewers in the United Kingdom were dissatisfied when the transmitter switched to Peppa Pig.
Some were indignant because they had stayed up all night especially for this fight.
A fan described the transition to the children's program on Twitter as "a bad joke".
"According to government regulations, after 6:00 a.m., no content should be shown that is not suitable for children, and that is why we had to switch to the children's programme," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president for marketing and communication at Bellator, when he was asked for the broadcast.
""Pep the pig," "Yes."
Scott Coker, CEO of Bellator, said that they are going to adjust their programming to ensure that viewers in the United Kingdom will also have a chance in the future.
"I think, in view of the back game, that we can solve this problem," said Coker.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning here on a Sunday and we can't discuss anything until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
We're working on it.
When I made the switch, there were a lot of text messages going back and forth and believe me, these weren't all as friendly.
We tried to solve it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was a government problem.
I can promise that this will not happen a second time.
We limit the broadcasts to five nights instead of six, as we normally did, we tried to make it even better for the fans, but we just went too far.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt 'inferiority' because of his sexual nature
The Olympic swimmer Tom Daley says he felt inferior during his youth because of his sexual nature, but this gave him the motivation to succeed.
Twenty-four-year-olds said that until he went to secondary school, he didn't realize that 'not everyone is like me'.
In a conversation at Desert Island Discs on Radio 4 with Lauren Laverne he said he had spoken about gay rights to give others hope.
He also said that the parenting had helped him to lower his value in winning during the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the regular presenter of the long-term show has taken a few months off because of illness.
Appearing as a spoiler on Laverne's first program, Daley told me that during his youth he felt 'less' than others because it was 'socially not accepted to like both girls and boys'.
He said, "To this day those feelings, the feeling of being less and the feeling of being different, really existing facts have given me the strength to be successful."
He wanted to prove that he was 'someone', so that he wouldn't disappoint people if they finally found out about his nature.
The winner of two bronze Olympic medals has become a prominent campaigner for the LGBT community and used his presence at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he spoke out because he was happy that he could live openly without further consequences and that he wanted to give others hope.
The three-time world champion said that the fact that he fell in love with a man, the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Back, whom he met in 2013, 'has completely surprised me'.
Daley married the Oscar winner last year, who is 20 years older than he, but said that the age difference had never been a problem.
"When you have to endure so much so young," he took part in his first Olympic Games at the age of fourteen and his father died of cancer three years later, it is difficult to find someone in your own age group who has experienced the same highs and lows.
The couple became parents of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley in June, and Daley said that his "whole perspective" had changed.
"If you had asked me this question last year, I would have answered that it was all about winning a gold medal," he said.
"But you know what, there are more important things on earth than winning gold Olympic medals.
My gold Olympic medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father who died in 2011 at the age of 40, after he had been diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father had not accepted that he would die and one of the last things he had asked was if they had already received the tickets for London in 2012, because he wanted to sit in the first row.
"I couldn't get it about my heart to say, you won't be there to sit in the first row, Dad," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and not until his breathing actually stoked and he died, I could finally admit that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I knew that I had dreamed about this all my life. Diving for a home audience during the Olympic Games, there is no better feeling," he said.
It was also the inspiration for his first choice of music, Proud by Heather Small, that had strongly attacked him on his way to the games and from which he still got chicken skin.
Desert Island Discs is to listen to BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mikkelson, not in shape, at the bank during the Ryder Cup on Saturday
The American Phil Mikkelson will set up a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th match in the Ryder Cup, but he must find his shape to make it no sad milestone.
Mikkelson, who participates for the 12th time in the biennial event, a record, was placed on the bench by the team captain Jim Furyk for the fourballs and foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being at the centre of the action, as he has often done for the United States, the winner of five majors divides the day between supporting his teammates and practicing the driving range, in an attempt to find out what it's about.
Because he was never known even on the peak of his career for his straight drives, the 48-year-old is not the ideal choice for the narrow fairways of Le Golf National, where the long grass of the roughs wandering balls routinely punishes.
And if the job itself is not terrifying enough, Mikkelson comes in the ninth match on Sunday the always accurate Francesco Molinari, winner of the British Open, against which is linked to newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans behind four points at the start of the 12 single games, start well, the match of Mikkelson can be absolutely crucial.
Feary has shown confidence in this man, although, frankly, he could not do otherwise.
"He fully understood the role he had today, slapped my back, slapped his arm around me and said he was ready for it tomorrow," said Furyk.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He was recorded in the Hall of Fame and he has contributed so much to these teams, in the past, but also this week.
I probably didn't expect him to play just two games.
I expected more of it, but it is the way it is and it is the way we had to act in our opinion.
He wants to be there, just like everyone else."
Mickelson can improve Nick Faldo's record on Sunday for the highest number of Ryder Cup matches played.
It can also mean the end of a Ryder Cup career in which he has never fully matched the highlights of his personal career.
Mikkelson has won 18 games, 20 lost matches and 7 equal games on his name, but Furyk said his presence had a certain unassailable influence on the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's taken, he likes to take jokes with people and he's a great guy to have on the team," he explained.
"I think the younger players liked to fool him once in a while last week, that was funny to see.
He has so much more to offer than just his game."
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows that great advantage can quickly disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that the comfortable advantage before the single matches on the last day of the Ryder Cup, can easily be turned into a less comfortable situation.
The Deen made his debut in the race in Valderrama in 1997, where the team with captain Seve Ballesteros had a lead of five points on the Americans, but eventually the finish line passed with the lowest possible margin: 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a big lead in Valderrama; we had a big lead in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but just," said Bjorn, calling here, after seeing the 2018 lighting win with 5-3 on Friday and yesterday, good for a 10-6 lead at Le Golf National.
So history shows me and everyone else on the team that this isn't a game yet.
Everyone will have to make a full commitment tomorrow.
Get on with it and get the plan done.
It's not over until the points are on the board.
We have a goal, and that's this trophy winning, and we need to keep focusing on that.
I keep saying, I focus on the 12 players we can have, but we are also aware of the people on the other side, some of the best players in the world."
Rejoicing at the performance of his players on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never anticipate things in this area.
Tomorrow will be another challenge.
The individual achievements will be discussed tomorrow, and that is another very different discipline.
It's great to be out there running with a partner when it's going well, but when you're alone, your golfer's capabilities are really tested.
That's the message you have to tell the players, try to get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
So now let your partner go and he must also get the best out of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent, Jim Furyk, expects his players to perform better individually than as partners. The exceptions are Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas who won three of the four points.
Fürijk himself has experience with both sides of this kind of turnaround on the last day, as a member of the winning team in Brookline and as a loser when Europe realized the 'Miracle of Medinah'.
"I remember every damn word of that speech," he said in answer to the question how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had picked up his players for the last day.
"We have 12 important matches for the bow tomorrow, but let's try to get off to a good start, as in Brookline, or as in Medinah.
When we have the momentum, there will be a lot of pressure on the games in the middle.
We have aligned our line-up to this and send the men on their way in the order that we think is the best and, you know, we're going to try something out of the high hat tomorrow."
Thomas has the task of trying to lead the counter-offensive and sets Rory McIlroy in for the first match, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are the other Europeans in the first half of the battle.
"I have chosen this group in this order, because I think we are so constantly covered," said Bjorn of his selection of single players.
The new warship of Germany is again delayed
The latest frigate of the German Navy should have been deployed in 2014, replacing the obsolete warships of the Cold War, but it will take at least one year before it is ready, due to faulty systems and rising costs, local media reported.
The launch of the 'Rheinland-Pfalz', the leading ship in the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg class frigates, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which quotes a military spokesman.
The vessel should have been part of the navy in 2014, but the worrying problems after delivery have plagued the fate of the ambitious project.
The four vessels of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ordered by the Navy in 2007 are intended to replace the obsolete frigates of the Bremen class.
As far as we know, they have a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles and a form of stealth technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic characteristics.
Other important features are longer maintenance cycles, it should be possible to use the latest frigates up to two consecutive years, far from home ports.
The constant delays, however, mean that the advanced warships, which are intended to allow Germany to project its power overseas, are outdated by the time they are put into operation, notes Die Zeit.
The fatal frigate F125 made the headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to put the vessel into service and sent it back to the shipyard Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy sent a ship back to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons behind this return, but German media quoted a number of crucial 'software and hardware failures' that would make the warship useless if it were deployed in a combat mission.
Software defects were particularly important because the boats of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class are served by a crew of about 120 sailors, half the manpower on the frigates of the older Bremen class.
It also became clear that the ship is seriously overweight, which will reduce its performance and limit the ability of the marine to carry out further upgrades.
The 'Rheinland-Pfalz' weighs 7,000 tons, twice as much as ships of a similar class used by the Germans in the Second World War.
In addition to the defective hardware, the price card for the entire project, including the training of the crew, will also become a problem.
It is said that this has reached a staggering €3.1 billion compared to the original €2.2 billion.
The problems that the latest frigates have in their grip are becoming particularly important because of the recent warnings that the power of the German Navy is diminishing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliamentary Defence Committee, acknowledged that the marine actually has "a shortage of usable ships".
The official said that the problem over time as a snowball has grown, because old ships were taken out of business but no replacement vessels were delivered.
He complained that none of the frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class were yet available for inclusion in the Navy.
National Trust listens to the secret life of bats
New research carried out on an estate in the Scottish Highlands is trying to reveal how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
The hope is that the findings will shed new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and contribute to future conservation activities.
The study carried out by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland follows the ordinary and the small dwarf bat, the brown large bat and the water bat at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment is placed in key locations around the estate to track the activities of bats throughout the season.
Staff of the NTS and volunteers will also conduct mobile research using hand detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of the bat's cries and what kind of actions.
Next, a map of the habitat and a report is produced to make a detailed picture of the landscape of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, nature conservation advisor to the NTS, hopes that the results will show which habitat areas are the most important for bats and how they are used by the species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management, such as making meadows and how we can best maintain the forests for bats and similar species.
Bat populations in Scotland and the rest of the UK have decreased significantly over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development activities affecting sleeping places and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lightning can also pose a risk, as can fly catchers and certain chemical treatments of building materials and domestic cat attacks.
Bats are not really blind.
However, their nightly hunting habits make their ears more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching a prey.
They use an advanced echo-location technique to determine the position of insects and obstacles in their flight path.
With the NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares ashore in the country, bats are taken very seriously.
The NTS has ten trained experts, who conduct regular investigations, sleep site inspections and sometimes rescue operations.
The organization has even set up the first and only reservation for bats in Scotland at the Threeave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight of the ten species of bats in Scotland live.
Landscape manager David Thompson says the estate is the ideal territory for bats.
"Here in Threeave we have a great environment for bats," he said.
"We have the old buildings, many very old trees and the right habitat.
But so much about bats is not yet known and therefore the work we do here and in other locations will help us to understand better what they need to thrive."
He stressed the importance of monitoring bats before maintenance activities were carried out, as the possible unconscious destruction of a sleeping area could lead to the death of 400 female bats and their young, potentially eliminating a full local population.
Bats are a protected species and it is illegal to kill, harass or disturb them or to destroy their sleeping places.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish official for the Bat Conservation Trust, has asked the public to make a contribution to help.
She said, "We still have to learn a lot about our bats and of many of our species we just don't know how their populations are."
Ronaldo rejects charges of assault while his lawyers prepare to prosecute a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo accused of assault qualified as 'fake news' and said that people want to 'promote themselves' by using his name.
His lawyers are about to file a complaint against the German weekly Der Spiegel, in which the allegations were published.
The tip of Portugal and Juventus is accused of assaulting an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is also accused of having paid her $375.000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Through a video for his 142 million followers on Instagram Live, Ronaldo, 33 hours after the charges were reported, called the reports 'fake news'.
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they say today, fake news," says the winner of five Golden Balls on camera.
"They want to promote themselves by calling me by name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous by calling my name, but that's part of the trade.
I'm a happy man, and through and through" the footballer added to this, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing a trial in which they want to prosecute Der Spiegel for the accusations they called 'an inadmissible report of suspicions in the field of privacy', according to Reuters.
Christian Schertz, lawyer, said that the footballer wants compensation for the 'moral damage for an amount corresponding to the seriousness of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years'.
The alleged incident was reported to have occurred in June 2009 in a suite of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After they met in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the footballer's room, where, according to the accusation, he raped her anal, as can be read in the charge filed with the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and that he told her that he was a good guy for '99 percent', but that he is sometimes abandoned that 'one percent'.
The documents state that Ronaldo confirms that the couple had sex, but that this was mutually agreed.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that pictures were taken of her injuries in a hospital, but that she later agreed to an extra-judicial arrangement because she was 'afraid of the consequences' and because she was concerned about the 'public humiliation'.
The 34-year-old now says she wants to have the scheme annulled because she is permanently traumatised by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to go from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged assault and this summer left for the Italian giant Juventus in a €100 million deal.
Brexit: the United Kingdom 'will regret it forever' when car manufacturers leave
The United Kingdom 'will regret it forever' if it loses its position as world leader in car production after Brexit, said Greg Clark, Minister of Economic Affairs.
He added that it was 'careful' that Toyota UK had said to the BBC that if Britain would leave the EU without a deal, the company would temporarily shut down production at the plant in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of delays at the border would cost jobs in the case of a 'no-deal Brexit'.
Last year, the Burnaston plant, where the Auris and Avensis of Toyota were made, produced almost 150,000 cars, of which 90% were exported to other countries in the European Union.
"My vision is that if Britain crashes from the EU at the end of March, we will see production shut down in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Managing Director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other car products in the UK, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also expressed their fears about the consequences of leaving the EU without agreement on the functioning of cross-border trade.
For example, BMW has already announced that it will close the Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
Most of the concerns concern car manufacturers about risks in the supply chain in the case of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line runs on the basis of the 'just-in-time' principle, whereby every 37 minutes parts arrive from suppliers in the UK and in the EU for cars made on order.
If the UK leaves the EU on 29 March without a deal, there may be unrest at the borders that industry believes can lead to delays and defects in parts.
Toyota cannot store more than one day in stock in the Derbyshire factory, so the company informed, and therefore the production would be discontinued in that case.
Clark said that the Chequers plan of Theresa May for the future relationship with the EU is 'exactly aligned to avoid those checks at the border'.
"We must have a deal. We want the best deal, which will not only enable us to continue the current success, but also to seize this opportunity," he told the listeners of the BBC Radio 4 today program.
"The evidence, not only from Toyota but also from other producers, is that we must be able to continue with this very successful set of supply chains."
Toyota could not say how long production would be shut down, but warned in the longer term that the additional costs would affect the competitiveness of the company and that this would eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years, and who is a representative of the union Unite at the factory, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, once these jobs have been lost, they never come back again.
A public spokesman said: "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Meeting Trump and Rosenstein can be delayed again, says the White House
The crucial meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein can be postponed for another week while the fight on the candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, continues, said the White House on Sunday.
Mr Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, who is investigating the Russian influence of the elections, links between Mr Trump's assistants and Russia and possible obstruction of the President's judicial process.
The question of whether Trump is going to fire the Deputy Attorney General and thereby jeopardize Mueller's independence has been going on for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of wearing a microphone to record conversations with Trump and to dismiss the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied this report.
But when he went to the White House last Monday, rumors made the round that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then with the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said that he wanted to "do not like" Rosenstein, but then the meeting was moved to avoid a conflict with a hearing of the Senate Justice Committee, in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, would both testify.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to conduct a one-week investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, delaying the vote in the full Senate.
On Sunday, Sarah Sanders, Trump's press director, appeared on Fox News.
Asked for the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "There is no date for that, it could be this week, but it could also be postponed for another week, considering all the other things that are going on with the Supreme Court.
But we will see and I always want to keep the press informed."
Some reporters had difficulty with this claim: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since 10 September.
The host Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said that the shortage of press conferences was not caused by the disgust of the 'dark' TV journalists, though, she added: "I will not deny that they are trying to attract attention."
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president does more question-and-answer sessions than any president for him," she said, without giving evidence, "we've looked at the figures."
Press conferences will still take place, said Sanders, but "if the press has the chance to ask the President of the United States directly, that is infinitely better than talking to me.
We try to do a lot of that and you have seen us do that often in recent weeks and that will take the place of a press conference when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in public sessions or at press conferences with dignitaries who are visiting.
Press conferences with only the president are rare.
In New York this week the president may have demonstrated why, he made a frank and at times bizarre appearance to the collected reporters.
Minister of Health writes a letter on Brexit to employees of NHS Scotland from other EU countries
The Minister for Health has written a letter to the EU staff working in the NHS Scotland to express the country's gratitude and the wish that they continue to work at the NHS after the Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent a letter of less than six months before the UK withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish authorities have already expressed their willingness to bear the costs of applying for a permanent status for EU citizens working for the decentralised public services.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer negotiations between the UK and the EU continued, and this autumn the expected decisions will be taken.
At the same time, however, the UK government has also called for preparations for a possible scenario in which no deal is reached.
I know this must be insecure times for all of you.
I would therefore like to stress once again how much I appreciate the contribution of all staff, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring with them valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the NHS and provide benefits for the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we would like you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes an emergency operation after head injury
The linemaker of the Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, underwent an emergency operation yesterday after he suffered a head injury in the 31-27 lost match against the Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Rod Reed, the head coach of Tennessee State, told reporters that the accident took place shortly before rest.
"He came to the sideline and dropped more or less," said Reed.
The trainers and the medical staff gave Abercrombie direct oxygen on the sideline, before they put him on a stretcher and took him with them for further research.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had come out of the operating room at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there are 'no details yet about the type/size of the injury' and Tennessee State tries to find out when the injury has occurred.
Abercrombie, a 'redshirt sophomore', is in his first season at Tennessee State after a transfer from Illinois.
He was set up five times on Saturday before he left the field, making him a total of 18 times this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher blanks when buying a home in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher blanks when buying a home in the UK and the proceeds are used to help the homeless according to new conservative plans
This action will have to neutralise Corbyn's success in attracting young voters
The increase in emptying is levied on persons who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Ministry of Finance expects this to bring in £120 million a year to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher emptys when they buy a house in the UK and the extra proceeds are used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
This action is seen as an attempt to neutralise Jeremy Corbyn's success that attracts young voters with promises to provide more affordable homes and to tell this to many-earners.
The increase in unemployment is levied on persons and firms who do not pay taxes in the UK, with the additional income being paid in an attempt by the government to combat homelessness.
The premium, which comes on top of the current lows, including the higher levels introduced two years ago for second houses and houses purchased for rentals, may amount to up to three percent.
In this way, the Ministry of Finance expects to raise up to £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of the new construction in London is purchased by people who do not live in the UK. This increases prices and makes it difficult for starters to get a foot on the house ladder.
Many prosperous areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become practically 'strange cities' because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
This new policy comes just a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the empty to help young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping prices high by buying up land and not using it, and he called May to abolish quotas on affordable houses in order to restore the 'housing shame' in Great Britain.
Corbyn has announced a striking series of housing reforms, including rental ceilings and an end to disfellowshipping 'without neglect'.
He also wants to give local authorities more opportunities to build new houses.
May said: "Last year I said that I wanted to spend my time as prime minister restoring the 'British Dream', that life is getting better for every new generation.
And that means that our defective housing market needs to be restored.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live here, work and build a life.
However, it cannot be as simple as it is for people who do not live in the UK, and for foreign companies, to buy houses here as it is for hardworking British residents.
For too many people the dream of having a house has ever become too vague a dream and the humiliation of life without a roof above the head is too real."
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate ambition is the management of Scotland'
Jack Ross, Sunderland's boss, says it's his ultimate ambition ever to become a manager of Scotland.
The Schot, 42, enjoys the challenge of resuscitating the club from the northeast of England, which is currently third in League One, on three points of the first place.
He went to the Stadium of Light last summer after returning the previous season to the Scottish Premiership.
"As a footballer, I wanted to play for my country.
But I was selected for the B-team and that was the end of the line," Ross told Sportssound on BBC Scotland.
"When I was a child, I often watched my father Scotland play in Hampden Park and it's something that keeps attracting me.
However, this option would only come if I am successful in managing a club."
The predecessors of Ross as managers of Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former boss of Alloa Athletic says that he was not intimidated to become the successor of these established names at a large club, before he had refused advances from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Successes for me are being measured right now by "can I have this club returned to the Premier League?"
Because of the structure and facilities of this club, it should undoubtedly be in the Premier League," he says.
"It's not a simple task to achieve this, but I can't see myself as successful until I bring the club back there."
Ross is only working on his career as manager for three years, after a period as assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months in the coaching group of Hearts.
He then helped Alloa to recover from degradation to the third division and transformed St Mirren from on the edge of degradation to winning the Championship in the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did during his career as a footballer at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a crossroads," he remembered the moment he took the lead at Alloa.
"I really believed that management was the right choice for me, much more than playing.
It sounds weird, because I did it pretty well, I did pretty well and I knew a few reasonable highlights.
But football can be hard.
There are many things you are confronted with every week.
I still have that, considering the stress and pressure of the profession, but management just feels good.
I've always wanted to be a manager and now that I'm real, I'm as good in my skin as I've never felt in my adult life."

The perfect time for a pint is 17:30 on a Saturday, revealing research
The heat wave in summer has increased the income of British pubs who have difficulty surviving, but has also put more stress on restaurant chains.
Groups with pubs and bars saw sales rise by 2.7 percent in July, but the revenue in restaurants was 4.8 percent lower, showing figures.
Peter Martin, of the CGA Business Advisory Office, who collected the figures, said: "Continuous sunshine and the fact that England participated in the world championships longer than expected, meant that July showed a similar pattern as June, when pubs had 2.8% more turnover, with the difference that the restaurants were now getting even harder.
The decline of 1.8 per cent in the turnover of restaurants in June only worsened in July.
Pubs and bars aimed at selling drinks were by far the best, with a better LFL growth (like-for-like) than restaurants went down.
Pubs that are also aimed at selling food also members of the sun, but not as dramatic as the restaurants.
Looks like people just went out to drink.
In pubs and bars under management, drinking sales were 6.6 percent higher for the month, while food sales were 3 percent lower."
Paul Newman of RSM, analyst for the leisure and hospitality industry, said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the main factors for the turnover in the outdoor market.
It is therefore no surprise that restaurant groups continue to struggle, although a 4.8% annual-year turnover is particularly painful in view of the constant cost pressure.
The long, hot summer could not have come at a worse time for the operators focusing on food and only the time will learn whether the more temperate temperatures of August could give the necessary relief."
The total turnover growth in the pub and restaurant industry, including new openings, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the decline in the introduction of new brands.
In the Coffer Peach Tracker, the sales monitor for the pub, bar and restaurant sector in the UK, the performance data are collected and analysed by 47 operational groups, with a combined turnover of £9 billion. This is the established benchmark of the industry.
One in five children has a secret social media account, which they keep hidden from their parents
One in five children, some not older than 11 years, has a secret social media account, which they keep hidden from parents and teachers, reveals a survey
Survey among 20,000 high school students revealed growth in 'false Insta pages'
This news has heightened the fear that sexual content will be posted
Twenty percent of students say they have a 'main account' that they also show their parents
One in five children, a few not over 11 years of age, makes accounts for social media that they keep hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed rapid growth in the 'false Insta accounts', a reference to Instagram, the site for sharing photos.
This news has heightened the fear that sexual content will be posted.
Twenty percent of the students say they use a clean 'main account' that they show to their parents, while they also have personal accounts.
A mother who happened to be on the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter discovered a teenager there who asked others to 'rape' her.
The study, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and HMC (Headmasters and Headmistresses' Conference) of independent schools, discovered that 40 percent of 11 to 18-year-olds had two profiles and that half admitted to keeping personal accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of HCM, said, "It is disturbing that so many teenagers are lured into creating online spaces where they are not found by their parents and teachers."
Eilidh Doyle becomes the 'voice of the athlete' in the Scottish athletics council
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Board of the Scottish World of Athletes, as non-executive director at the general annual meeting of the Board of Directors.
Doyle is the most decorated athlete in Scotland on the job and in the field and President Ian Beattie described her election as a great opportunity for sports drivers to learn from her extensive experience at an international level over the past ten years.
"Eilidh enjoys a lot of respect in the athletic community of Scotland, the UK and the world and we are sure that the athletics in Scotland will greatly benefit from her election in the council," said Beattie.
Doyle said, "I am happy to be able to serve as a voice for the athletes and I hope that I can make a contribution and help run the sport in Scotland."
The American who won the 200 meters and the 400 meters during the 1996 Games in Atlanta, two of his four gold Olympic medals, and who now regularly gives comments on the BBC, could no longer walk after a TIA.
He wrote on Twitter: "Today a month ago I had a TIA.
I couldn't walk anymore.
The doctors told me that only time will learn or I will recover and to what extent.
It has been very hard work, but I have now fully recovered, I have learned to walk again and do my flexibility exercises again today!
Thank you for all the support!"
Advertisements for breast pump in which mothers are compared to cows divide online opinion
A company that makes breast pumps has divided the online opinion with an ad in which nursing mothers are compared to cows that are milked.
To mark the introduction of what is called 'the quietest portable breast pump in the world', Elvie, a consumer technology producer, has released an ironic ad inspired on music videos to illustrate the freedom that this new pump has to offer to bats.
Four real mothers dance in a hay-filled barn on a song that contains lyrics like: 'Yes, I'm milking myself, but you can't see it' and 'In case you didn't see it, these aren't uddies, these are my breasts'.
The chorus continues with: 'Pumps, pumps, pumps, I feed the babies, pumps, pumps, pumps, I milk the lady's'.
However, the ad, which was published on the company's Facebook page, has directly caused an online controversy.
The video has been viewed 77,000 times and has attracted hundreds of comments, especially mixed reactions from viewers, in which many people say that it condones the 'horror' of the dairy industry.
"A bad choice to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they must be expected and give birth to produce milk, but in their case the babies are taken away within a few days of delivery" is written in a response.
Elvie’s breast pump fits discreetly into a diet (Elvie/Mother).
Someone else said, "This is of course traumatic for mother and baby.
But yes, why don't we use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their babies?"
Another person added: "This ad is so far from reality."
Others defended the ad and a woman admitted that she found the song 'hilarious'.
"I think this is a brilliant idea.
I'd buy one if I was still breast-feeding.
That pumping made me feel like a cow.
The ad is a little weird, but I haven't been looking too much for it.
This is a brilliant product," someone wrote.
Someone else said, "This is a funny ad, aimed at mommy's who bumps (often at the workplace or in a toilet) and then feel like being a cow.
This advertisement is not at all positive or negative about the dairy industry."
At the end of the video you see the group of women who are all dancing with the pump discreetly hidden in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the understanding that many women who collide sometimes feel like cows.
The Elvie Pump, however, is completely silent, has no wires or hoses and fits discreetly into a diet, so that women have the freedom to move, hold their babies and even go out while they are on pistons.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother says: "The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a tough and provocative introduction.
By comparing bats and dairy cows, we wanted to put the piston and the associated challenges in the spotlights and at the same time show in an entertaining and understandable way how the new pump will provide an incredible sense of freedom.
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump gets the front page.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on Marta Jakubowski's catwalk while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly move to a tent camp on the border with Texas
The number of immigrant children in detention has reached a peak, although the number of border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, partly because the harsh rhetoric and harsh policy introduced by the Trump government makes it more difficult to accommodate children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors themselves are undocumented immigrants and are afraid to put their own chance of staying in the country at risk by registering for a child.
That risk was increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households would have to give their fingerprints and that these data would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week Matthew Albence, a senior officer of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified to the congress that his organization has arrested dozens of people who have signed up as sponsors of unaccompanied minors.
The organization later confirmed that 70 percent of the arrested had no prior criminal record.
"Nearly 80 percent of the people who are sponsors or family members of the sponsors are illegal in this country and a large part of them are criminals.
We're persecuting these people," said Mr. Albence.
In an effort to speed up the processing of children, officials have introduced new rules, requiring some of them to appear before the court within 60 days, which was the standard, according to the personnel at the shelter.
Many of them will stand in court through a video conference, rather than in person, to advocate their application for a legal status for an immigration judge.
Those who are deemed not to be eligible for aid will be deported quickly.
The longer the children remain in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which may give rise to violent outbursts or attempts to escape, according to the personnel at the shelter and according to reports coming out of the system in recent months.
Lawyers said that these concerns are stronger in a larger facility, such as Tornillo, where the signs that a child struggles are more often ignored because of the size of the camp.
They added that moving the children to the tent camp without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to friends can contribute to the trauma many of them are already struggling with.
Syria is ordering the immediate withdrawal of the US, France and Turkey's occupying power
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Mr Walid Al-Muallem also called for the return of Syrian refugees, even when the war in the country is in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, said that the foreign troops are illegally on Syrian soil, under the pretext of combating terrorism and that 'this will be dealt with accordingly'.
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he told the Assembly.
According to Moualem, the "war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more have been displaced and displaced from their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue with "this sacred struggle until we have liberated all Syrian territories" from terrorist groups and from "possible illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, who are mainly engaged in training and advising the Kurdish troops and the Syrian Arabs who are fighting against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the war - torn country.
With regard to refugees, Moualem said that the conditions are favourable for their return and he pleaded 'to spread irrational fears to some Western countries', leaving most refugees out.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate this return," he said.
"They are politicizing a case that should only be a humanitarian problem."
The United States and the European Union have warned that no reconstruction aid will be available for Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
United Nations diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in Idlib, the last major bulwark of the rebels, has created the opportunity to start political talks.
The deal between Russia and Turkey has a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian troops on the province, where three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that this agreement had 'clear deadlines' and said that he hoped that the military action would focus on jihadists, including fighters from the Al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, who 'will be exterminated'.
Staffan de Mistura, the UN representative, hopes to convene the first meeting of a new committee consisting of members of the government and the opposition to draft a constitution for post-war Syria and to pave the way for elections.
Moualem made it clear what the terms of the Syrian Government's participation in the committee were and said that the work of the panel should be limited 'to reviewing the articles of the current constitution' and he warned against interference from outside.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Term
According to that logic, Mr. Trump would win the elections in 2020 unless, as many 'liberal' viewers are likely to hope, his presidency is prematurely terminated by a settlement procedure and scandals.
In what would undoubtedly be 'the most dramatic finale of a presidency ever'.
At the moment, however, there are no signs of vision fatigue.
Since 2014, the viewing rates at prime-time at CNN have more than doubled to 1.05 million and almost tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers during 'prime-time', compared to 1.7 million viewers four years ago, and 'The Rachel Maddow Show' of MSNBC stands at the top of the reviews for cable programs with 3.5 million viewers on evenings with important news.
"This is a fire that attracts people, because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, the responsible behind the ABC drama 'Designed Survivor' a series about a minister who becomes president after an attack has destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an experienced writer of comedy and author of 'Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club' has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston for the 2016 elections.
The driver told her he was going to vote for Trump.
Why? She asked.
"He said, "Because he's making me laugh," Scovell told me.
There's entertainment value in the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the storylines that come from Washington can influence or determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can reunite or influence the status of the world economy.
Disabling is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, it goes beyond wanting to be a well-informed citizen, when you realize that you've been sitting for six hours looking at a panel of experts discussing the use of sources from the 'deep background' by Bob Woodward in his book 'Fear', who talk about the jack of Paul Manafort's pauper's doctrine that cost $15,000 ('a piece of clothing full of pride' according to The Washington Post) and discussing the implications of the colorful description by Stormy Daniels of the, uh, Trump anatomy.
At least I'll never be able to look at Super Mario in the same way again.
"What he does to give you the idea that it's about a reality show is that he stops you something new every night," said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of 'Pawn Stars', about the rotating role-sharing of the Trump show and the daily sudden changes (combating a fight with the N.F.L., Kim Jong-un praise).
You can't afford to miss an episode or you have the idea that you're behind.
When I reached Fleiss earlier this week, it was sunny and 26 degrees outside his house on the north coast of Kauai, but he was inside watching MSNBC while he was recording CNN.
He could not get away from the screen, with Brett Kavanaugh, who had to appear before the Senate's Committee of Justice and the future of the Supreme Court at stake.
"I remember doing all those strange shows, not so long ago, and that people said 'this is the beginning of the end of Western civilization'," Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but now it turns out they were right."

Money from outside flows into the most exciting mid-term elections for the House of Deputies
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania sees an influx of money, thanks to a redeployment of a constituency which requires two sitting representatives of the people to fight for the same seat.
The recently reorganized district of Pittsburg meets the Democratic People's Representative Conor Lamb, who acquired his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb must take it against another sitting representative, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which has a lot of overlap with the new 17th district.
The cards were reclassified after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionalally divided ('gerrymandation') in favour of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district has led to a fighting party in the field of campaign financing between the financial arms of the two major parties, the DCCC (Democrat Campaign Congressional Committee) and the NRCC (National Republican Campaign Committee).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a snap victory in a well-viewed special election for the 18th constituency of Pennsylvania.
This seat had been occupied for more than ten years by a Republican and President Donald Trump had conquered this district by 20 percentage points.
According to political experts, the Democrats have a small advantage.
The US considered punishing El Salvador for aid to China and has refrained from doing so
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama Beijing had already recognised and received little negative response from Washington.
Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and he held a hotel in Panama until his partners put out the Trump Organization management team.
Officials of the United States Department of Foreign Affairs have decided to recall the American heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the 'recent decision not to recognise Taiwan', said Heather Nauert, the spokesperson of the Ministry, in a statement earlier this month.
But only penalties were considered in the case of El Salvador, because the country received $140 million in US aid in 2017, for control of narcotics, development and economic support.
The penalties proposed, including reductions in financial support and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country with high unemployment and high murder rates.
As internal meetings continued, North American and Central American officials held a high-level conference which would focus on security and economic prosperity as a follow-up to a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step forward in preventing migrants from leaving for the United States.
In mid-September, however, some top officials from the government announced that they wanted the conference to continue, making all possible sanctions against El Salvador impossible in advance.
The plan now is for Vice-President Mike Pence to give a speech at the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance that the government attaches to the meeting, say diplomats.
And the three U.S. envoys have returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any hard messages about sanctions from Washington.
A White House spokesman on behalf of Mr Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by three American officials, including two diplomats, who have agreed to discuss the internal debate subject to anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an external analyst who is also close to the government and who also spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Study History
The next step may be the report by Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller on the possible counter-justice by Trump, for which serious evidence has now become public knowledge.
Mueller is also likely to focus his research on interlinking Trump and Russia's campaign in an attack by Russia on our elections.
When Congress changes colors, Trump has to answer for that institute, just as he is getting ready to turn to the voters again, and perhaps he has to answer for a jury in a court of law.
These are a lot of assumptions, and I do not want to suggest that Trump's fall is inevitable or that of his equivalents in Europe.
We will all have to make choices, on both sides of the Atlantic, which will determine how long the battle will take.
In 1938, German officers were ready to run a coup d'état against Hitler, but only if the West had resisted and Czechoslovakia had supported in Munich.
We failed and thus missed an opportunity to prevent the years of bloodshed that followed.
The course of history revolves around such bending points and this speeds up or slows down the inexorable march of democracy.
Americans are currently confronted with several of these types of bending points.
What will we do if Trump releases Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who holds the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult position since the time this magazine reported that he had, last year, suggested that he take talks in secret with the president and that he had speculated on the suitability of the president for his office.
Rosenstein says the Times report is not correct.
"How will we react if the new investigation requested by the FBI into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or unfair, or if he is appointed to the Supreme Court despite credible charges of assault and an unfair testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the mid-term elections for a Congress that will call Trump to account?
If we fail in these tests, democracy waits for a very long winter.
But I don't think we're going to fail by the lesson I've learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my home of ambassadors.
She survived, immigrated to America and, 60 years later, sent me away to light candles for the Sabbath on the table on which a swastika was depicted.
With that as my legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans from Glasgow Rangers is optimistic about the race against Rapid Vienna
Rangers receive Rapid Wien on Thursday and know that a victory on the Austrians, after the impressive match play in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, puts them in a strong position to qualify in Group G of the Europe League.
Due to a knee injury, the middle fielder Graham Dorrans could not play his first game of the season until the 2-2 match game at Villarreal, but he believes that the Rangers can use that result as a springboard for better results.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal really has a good eleven," said the 31-year-old.
"We went into the game with the idea that something could be won and came out the game with a point.
Maybe we could have even won at the end, but over the entire game seen an equal game is probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half, but when we came out in the second half, we were the better team.
Thursday is a new big European evening.
Hopefully we can get three points but it's going to be a tough game because they also had a good result in their last game. But when the audience gets behind us, I'm sure we can push through and get a positive result.
Last year has certainly been hard, of everything that happened to my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now there is a feeling-good factor on the club.
The team is good and the boys really enjoy it.
Hopefully we can push through now, leave the last season behind and be successful again."
Women can't sleep because of fear of their pension
Despite the fact that the survey participants had a clear idea of how they would like to receive care, few people discuss this with their relatives.
About half of the participants in Nationwide’s research said they were talking to their wives about the cost of long - term care.
And only 10% said they had talked to their children about this.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't take the steps necessary to have this conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
Here we go.
Talk to your spouse(o)t(e) and the children: You cannot prepare your family for caring if you do not make your wishes known in good time.
Work with your advisor and your family to discuss where and how you will receive care, as these choices can be a significant factor in determining the costs.
Take a financial adviser in your arm: Your adviser can also advise you on how to pay these expenses.
Your long-term financing options for long-term care can include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with cash value to help cover these expenses, or use own funds as insurance, as long as you have money.
Create your legal documents: Avoid legal battle when the insurance must be used.
Take care of a health care proxy so that you can identify a trusted person who can overlook your medical care and ensure that the professionals adhere to your wishes in case you can no longer communicate.
Consider also a proxy for your financial affairs.
In that case, select a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and make sure that the invoices are paid if you can't do this yourself.
Do not forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly father or mother encounters a medical emergency and is on its way to the hospital.
In that case, can you answer questions about medication and allergies?
Record these details in a written plan, so that you have the information at your fingertips.
"It's not just the financial matters that matter, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What medicines are being used?
Who's taking care of the dog?
Make sure that plan comes along."
Man shot several times with air pressure gun in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air pressure gun when he walked home after a night out.
The victim, forty plus, was in the Oxford Grove neighborhood of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was touched in his chest, abdomen and hand.
Agents described the shooting, which took place around 2:30 BST, as an "arbitrary act."
The victim didn't see who attacked him.
His injuries are not life-threatening and the police have called witnesses to report.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and a tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, said officials, and the expectation is that the death toll will continue to rise.
As the means of communication have been switched off, the official authorities have not yet received information from the Donggala Regentship, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the quake with a force of 7.5 on the Richter scale.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people have been evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Celebes and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Celebes, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th birthday when the tsunami struck.
Donggala is a regentship that extends over 300 km along the coast of northwest Celebes.
The regency, an administrative region just below a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the most important activities in the economy of the province of Central Celebes, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but they are mostly located in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Celebes.
Palu and Donggala have been regularly hit by tsunamis in the last hundred years, according to the Indonesia Disaster Prevention Agency.
In 1938 a tsunami claimed more than 200 lives and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck in the west of Donggala in 1996, with nine deaths.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific Ring of Fire and is often affected by earthquakes.
Here is a list of some of the most severe earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Atjeh on northern Sumatra on 26 December caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries and claimed a total of 226 000 lives along the coasts of the Indian Ocean, more than half of this in Atjeh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes took place on the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and the beginning of April.
Hundreds of people were killed on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake with a force of 6.8 on the Richter scale took place south of Java, the most densely populated island of Indonesia, and caused a tsunami that struck the south coast and claimed nearly 700 lives.
2009: An earthquake with a force of 7.6 on the Richter scale struck the city of Padang, capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people found death.
2010: An earthquake with a force of 7.5 on the Richter scale struck one of the Mentawai islands off the Sumatra coast, causing a tsunami of more than 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and claimed about 300 lives.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the Regent Pidie in Atjeh and caused destruction and panic, because the people were reminded of the destruction of the deadly earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
There was no tsunami this time, but more than 100 people found the death of falling buildings.
2018: Several earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, where more than 500 people were killed, mostly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and caused thousands of tourists to be temporarily stranded.
Oldest son of Sarah Palin arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of Sarah Palin, the former governor of Alaska and candidate for the vice-presidentship, was arrested for domestic violence.
Palin, 29 from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfered with a report of domestic violence and offering resistance during the conviction, according to a report released by the Alaska State Troopers on Saturday.
According to the police report, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took the phone off her.
Palin is held in custody in the house of conservation Mat-Su with a bailout of $500, reported KTUU.
He appeared before the judge on Saturday and declared himself 'innocent, sure,' when he was asked this, the network reported.
Palin is charged with three Class A offenses, which means he can be sentenced to one year in prison and up to a fine of $250,000.
He is also charged with a class B offense, which is punishable by a day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
It is not the first time that Palin has been charged with criminal offences.
In December 2017, he was accused of mistreatment by his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, then called the police to report the alleged abuse.
This case is now for the Alaskan Court of Veterinary Affairs.
In January 2016, he was accused of mistreatment in the domestic atmosphere, interfering with a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon under influence in relation to the incident.
His girlfriend claimed he hit her in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by a veteran group, having linked the violent behavior of her son to PTSS, which he would have retained to his duty in Iraq.
Indonesia, earthquake, tsunami: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday.
The earthquake with a force of 7.5 on the Richter scale has led to a tsunami and has destroyed thousands of houses.
Electricity and communications networks have been switched off while the number of deaths is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake took place just next to the center of Celebes, located northeast of Jakarta, the Indonesian capital.
There are videos on social media that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami reached the coast.
Federal prosecutors demand a rare death penalty for suspects of a terrorist attack in New York City
Federal prosecutors in New York demand the death penalty for Sajfoello Sajpov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York City, where eight people have been killed, a rare punishment that has not been executed in this state since 1953.
According to the charges, Sajpov, 30, used a hired truck from Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bicycle path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, where he drove pedestrians and cyclists who came on his path in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors will have to prove that Sajpov 'wilfully' has killed the eight victims and 'wilfully' has caused serious physical injuries, according to the declaration of intent in which the death penalty is demanded, filed in the Southern District of New York.
For both charges, the death penalty is possible, according to the document submitted to the Court.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury has approved the charge with 22 charges, including eight charges of murder for a racket, typically a charge used by federal prosecutors against organized crime, and a charge of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required 'substantial planning and preparation' according to the prosecutors and they described how Sajpov carried out the attack as 'cruel, cruel and corrupt'.
"Sajfoello Habiboellajevich Sajpov has caused injury, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleveland, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco" is in the statement of intent.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It is more than ten years ago that in the Southern District of New York, there was a case in which the death penalty was demanded.
The suspect, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who had been executed two years earlier for spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
The Rosenbergs were both executed by means of the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Sajpov, from Uzbekistan, did not show any remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to the judicial documents.
He let the detectives know he felt good about his act, the police.
Sajpov told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching videos of ISIS on his phone, according to the charges.
He also asked to hang the flag of ISIS in his room in the hospital, told the police.
He pleaded not to be guilty of the imposition of 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Sajpov, said he was "naturally disappointed" with the decision of the prosecutors.
"We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty instead of accepting a confession of guilt in exchange for a life imprisonment without the possibility of release, will only prolong the trauma of these events for all concerned," said Patton.
Sajpov's defense had previously asked the prosecutors not to demand the death penalty.
Conservative MEP says that NIGEL FARAGE should lead the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised today to mobilize a 'people's army' during a protest at the Conference of the Conservative Party.
The former leader of Ukip said that the politicians should feel the "hotness" of the Eurosceptics, while one of the own MEPs of Theresa May proposed to lead him in the negotiations with the EU.
The conservative backbencher Peter Bone told the participants on March in Birmingham that the UK 'would be out already' had been Mr. Farage Brexit Minister.
But the challenge facing May in reconciling the strongly divided ranks is underlined by two conservatives who are pro-Remain and who participate in a separate protest meeting against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister struggles to keep her Chequers compromise on the road while being attacked by Brexitians, Remainers and the EU.
Competitors insisted that she would continue and will try to make a deal with Brussels despite the setbacks, forcing Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and 'chaos'.
Bone said at a meeting of Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wants to throw 'Chequers in the trash basket'.
He proposed that Farage be knighted and should be given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he left the service, we'd be out of it now," said Bone.
The Member of Parliament for Wellingborough added: "I will support Brexit, but we have to throw Chequers in the trash basket."
To clarify his opposition to the EU, he said: "We have not fought in two world wars to be inferior.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Bone suggested that public opinion had changed since the 2016 referendum: "The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay in the EU is completely untrue."
Conservative Brexitist Andrea Jenkyns also participated in the march and told reporters: "I'm just saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chequers is unpopular with the general public, the opposition is not going to vote, it is unpopular within our party and with our activists who go from door to door and make sure we are elected.
Drop Chequers and listen."
In a directed message for May, she added: "Premisters keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Farage told the meeting that politicians should feel the "heat" if they want to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them, "We won't let you get away with this."
In a message to the enthusiastic masses, he added: "I want you to light the fire on our political class, which is about to betray Brexit.
We are mobilizing the national army of this country that has given us the victory in the Brexit referendum and we will never rest until we have become an independent, sovereign, proud United Kingdom again."
In the meantime, Remainers marched through Birmingham and closed this March with a two-hour meeting in the city centre.
A small group of activists waved with flags to Tories Against Brexit, after the formation of this group during the weekend.
Lord Adonis, a member of the Labour House, joked about the security problems of a Party app of the Conservatives at the beginning of their conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can provide IT systems and for all technology for Canada plus, for the frictionless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
It's a complete farce.
There's nothing like a good Brexit," he added.
Warren's plan to "think well" about candidacy for presidency
Senator Elizabeth Warren says she's going to "think well about her candidacy for the presidency" after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrats told about her future during a meeting in a town hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, wants to be re-elected in November against Geoff Diehl, Republican delegate who was co-chair of the Trum campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
She has been the center of speculation that she might engage in the fight with Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters in a town hall since Trump came to power.
Someone in attendance asked her if she would stand up for the presidency.
Warren replied that it is time for women to go to Washington to repair our defective government and that includes a woman at the top."
Arrest after killing Wayde Sims of LSU
The Baton Rouge police, Louisiana, reported on Saturday that a suspect was arrested after the kill of Wayde Sims, LSU basketball player on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at an ET press conference at 11:00.
They gave a video of the shooting incident on Friday and asked for help in identifying the man in the movie.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims got a gunshot wound in his head and died of the consequences," police commander Murphy J. Paul told the press on Saturday, according to 247 sports.
Wayde stepped forward to defend a friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson has been questioned and has known to have been present at the crime scene, to be in possession of a gun and have shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without further incidents and is detained in the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims was a junior player of 1.98 meters who grew up in Baton Rouge. He played in 32 games and started the last season in 10 games. He had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per match.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title after Sebastian Vettel has let him win after team orders
When Valtteri Bottas qualified for Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that team orders from Mercedes would play a role in the race.
Bottas knew a good start from pole position and almost left Hamilton in the cold when he defended his position and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Fattel went into the pits and let Hamilton drive in the crowd's tail, something that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes went into the pits a round later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton came on the head again after a wheel-on-wheel action which meant that the Ferrari rider had to leave space on the inside with reluctance after a double movement in the third turn.
Max Verstappen started from the last place and was seventh after the first round on his 21st birthday.
He was then the leader of the race for some time, because he remained in his choice of tires and aimed for a quick finish, so that he could catch up with Kimi Raikkonen for the fourth place.
Eventually he went to the pits in the 44th round, after he could not increase his speed in the remaining eight rounds, so Raikkonen became fourth.
It's a difficult day because Valtteri did his best all weekend, and he was a real gentleman and left me.
The team has done its best for places one and two," said Hamilton.
That wasn't a good body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein at an election meeting on Saturday about not being the source of the leaked letter from Christine Blasey Ford, in which the candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, was accused of assault.
Speaking at an election meeting in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly of the testimony given by Ford to the Senate's Committee on Justice. Instead, he indicated that what happened in the Senate showed that people could be "congregated, unkind and untrue"."
"The only thing that can happen and the beautiful show that takes place in the Senate in the last days, when you see the anger, when you are the people who are angry and mean and mean and unkind and untrue," he said.
"When you look at the press releases and the leaks and then they say 'oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you leak?
Do you remember her answer? Did you leak the document?
Oh, no.
I haven't leaked."
Well, wait a minute.
If we leaked... no, we didn't leak," he added, in an imitation of the senator.
In July the letter mentioning the allegations made to Kavanaugh was sent to Feinstein by Ford and it was leaked in September, but Feinstein denied that her office was the leak.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't leak her story," Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
"She asked me to go with it confidentially and I treated it confidentially, as she had asked."
But the president proved not to believe her denial and he made comments during the Saturday night meeting: "I'll tell you something, that wasn't a good body language.
Maybe she didn't, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
Further to his defense of the candidate for the Supreme Court, accused by three women of sexual misconduct, the President suggested that the Democrats used the accusations for their own purposes.
"They are determined to regain power, with all necessary means.
You see the meanness, the unkindness, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to drive about to seize power and get control back," the president would have said, according to a report by Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars vs Belfast Giants: 5-3
Patrick Dwyer made two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars has made up for the loss of Friday in the Elite League against Belfast Giants by winning the return match with 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants were led by scores by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie took the home team side by side before Dwyer brought the Giants back to power.
Francois Bouchard made the equalizer for Dundee, before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory with two goals.
It was the third loss in the Elite League this season for the men of Adam Keefe, who had to make up for a backlog on Friday night and then defeat Dundee with 2-1 in Belfast.
It was the fourth time this season that the two teams met, where the Giants won the previous three matches.
The opening goal of Dwyer came in the fourth minute at 3:35 on an assist from Kendall McFaull. David Rutherford gave the assist with which Beauvillier doubled the lead, four minutes later.
In a busy opening period, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game at 13:10, before Matt Marquardt gave the lead for Cownie's equalizer at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure that the Giants took the first rest, when he made his second goal of the evening at the end of the first period.
The home team recaptured and Bouchard brought them back to an equal position with a power-play-goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran then combined well to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time in the game, late in the second period. He made the victory with the fifth goal for his team, half way in the last period.
The Giants, who have now lost four of the last five matches, play at home against Milton Keynes in their next match on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies while making sure that hundreds can escape the earthquake in an airplane
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is honored as a hero after he died because he made sure that a plane with hundreds of people could board safely.
More than 800 people have been killed and many are still missing after a severe earthquake struck the island of Celebes on Friday; an earthquake that then caused a tsunami.
Powerful aftershocks still plague the area and many are buried under the tip of the city of Palu.
Despite the fact that his colleagues fled for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the wild-to-go traffic towers of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu airport.
He remained to ensure that flight 6321 from Batik Air, who was at the time ready to take off safely.
Then he jumped out of the traffic tower when he thought it was collapsing.
He died later in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, a spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said that his decision may have saved hundreds of lives, reported ABC News from Australia.
We had arranged a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"It breaks your heart when you hear it," he added.
In the meantime, the authorities fear that the death toll may rise to the thousands and informed the country’s disaster response agency that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"It is assumed that the death toll is still rising because many bodies were under the rubble and have not yet been reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesperson of the agency.
Waves reaching 60 feet [6 m] have destroyed Palu, where a mass funeral ceremony will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute bodies are brought in by ambulances.
Clean water is scarce.
The minimarkets are looted everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is entangled in a race to help survivors, but we do not know what they will find.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse."
President Joko Widodo of Indonesia arrived in Palu on Sunday and he said to the present military: "I appeal to all of you to work day and night so that all tasks necessary for the evacuation are completed.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia was already affected by earthquakes in Lombok earlier this year, where more than 550 people died.
Aircraft crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says that one man is missing after a crash in the lagoon
The airline that operated the flight crashed in a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says that one more man is missing, after they had previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew members had safely left the sunken plane.
Air Niugini said in a press release that one male passenger is missing on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said they worked with the local authorities, hospitals and detectives to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to the questions for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew members, after the plane had been watered during the landing at the Chuuk Islands airport.
The authorities announced on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday and that everyone's condition was stable.
What caused the crash and what the exact order of the events is remains unclear for the time being.
The airline and the US Navy both say that the plane has landed in the lagoon and missed the runway.
Some witnesses believe the plane has been shot across the runway.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said the plane was approaching the airport very low.
"That's good news," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and some others succeeded by wading the water that came to their aid to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He also said that the stewardesses were panicking and screaming and that he had a non-serious head injury.
The U.S. Navy announced that seamen who were near to work in a yard also helped in the rescue work by taking people to the coast by inflatable boat, before the plane continued to sink into about 30 feet [30 m] of water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network show that over the past 20 years 111 people have been found dead in crashes of air carriers registered with the PNG, but none of them relate to Air Niugini.
Analyst determines the timeline of the night on which a woman was burned alive
The prosecutor closed his claim on Friday in the reopening trial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, analyst of the U.S. Department of Justice, gave a one-hour witness as a witness expert in information analysis.
He made it clear to the jury how he had used the phone records of mobile phones to capture the movements of the 29-year-old suspect, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, in the night she died.
Rowlett explained that he had received location data from various mobile phones that showed that Tellis was at Chambers on the night of her death, which contradicted his previous claims, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was at Chambers during the time he claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police spoke to Sanford again.
Sanford was standing in the witness bench on Saturday and told me he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he told him he was at Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "lie because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis had told me that he knew Chambers about two weeks when she died.
The cell phone records said they only knew each other one week.
Rowlett said Tellis knew the text messages, calls and contact details of his phone some time after Chambers died.
"He knew her from his life," said Hale.
The defense starts on Sunday with the final arguments.
The judge said he expected the jury to start the deliberations later that day.
The High Width: What's conscious hiphop?
A hiphoptrio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol states that hiphop is alienated from its origins with political opinions and the incitement of social problems.
They want to return to the roots and make 'conscious hiphop' popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently experienced a revival in Great Britain by artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
A nanny from New York is daring a couple in court because of a 'racist' text
A New York nanny sues a couple in court for dismissal for discriminatory reasons, after receiving a incorrectly sent text in which the mother complained about 'again so black'.
The couple deny being a racist and call the trial "oppression".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, showed her apprehension when she discovered that the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, turned out to be a Negro woman when she met her on her first working day in 2016.
'NOEEE WERE SO'N SWARTE', Lynsey wrote Plasco-Flaxman in a message to her husband.
Instead of sending it to her husband, however, she sent it to Mrs. Maurice twice.
According to the U.S. newspaper New York Post, Plasco-Flaxman, when she realized her blunder, lost her 'uncomfortably' feeling job, saying that her former wife, who was African-American, had done a bad job, and that she had therefore expected a Filipino.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for a working day and was then sent home by taxi.
Now Maurice takes the couple to court to get a compensation of $350 a day for the 6 months she was hired to work with the family internally, even without a contract.
"I want them to feel that you're not doing something like that," said Maurice in the New York Post last Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
With regard to the claim that she is a racist, the couple abstained by saying that it was reasonable to fire Maurice after she was afraid that she could no longer trust her.
"My wife sent her a message that she didn't want to send her.
She's not a racist.
We're not racists', told husband Joel Plasco at the New York Post.
'But would you leave your children to someone who had offended you, even if it was by accident?
Your newborn baby?
Get the fuck out of here."
Comparing the trial with 'oppression', Plasco said that his wife was expecting a baby in two months' time and was 'in a very difficult situation'.
"Are you going to prosecute someone like that?
That is not so sympathetic', added the investment banker.
While the trial is still in progress, public opinion is quick to chapter the couple on social media, where it is held up for their behavior and reasoning.
The publishers of Paddington feared that the public would not have much interest in a talking bear, reveals newly opened letter
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the approval of the book, said about the letter: 'It's hard to get in the shoes of someone who reads it for the first time, even before the first publication.
With what we now know about Paddington's enormous success, it's very entertaining."
She told me that her father, who, before being inspired to write the children's book about a small toy bear, worked as a cameraman at the British broadcaster BBC, was optimistic about whether his book would be rejected. She added that the 60th birthday of the publication of the book 'bittersweet' felt after his death last year.
About Paddington, who describes her as 'a very prominent member of the family', she told her that her father was secretly proud of the ultimate success.
She said, "He was a quiet, modest man."
'But because Paddington was so lifelike to him, it almost looked like a child's achievement; you're proud when you didn't do anything for it yourself.
I think he had about the success of Paddington.
Although Paddington was the creation of his own imagination, he praised the bear himself for its success.'
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye by phone.
Immediately after the landing, her daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where the doctors tried to save her life in vain.
'Nad had called several times to say that it looked very bad and that it was expected that she would not make it', said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
'Then Nad's call came to tell her that she would die in two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much.
We'll be back together soon.
Then I'll be with you again.
The drugs the doctors had given her to keep her heart pumping slowly got worked out and left her body.
She had died some time before, and this process eliminated everything.
All I could do was sit there knowing what was going on.
I couldn't cry, cry or cry, because I was in the middle of people and families.
I really had to keep myself big."
In the end, Mrs Ednan-Laperouse, who now mourned the death of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, who had no idea what test she was going through.
"No one knew," she said.
"I sat with my head down and the tears kept coming.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight I got an overwhelming feeling of compassion for Nad.
I felt he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Raw women paste messages on the bridge to prevent suicide
Two women who are loved ones lost by suicide make themselves strong to stop others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys paste inspiring messages and phone numbers that can call people in need for help on a bridge in Wales
Ms. Davis's son, Tyler, was 13 when he first became depressed and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day," she said.
Ms. Davis, 45 years old and resident in Lydney, Gloucestershire, reported that her son was a promising chef with an infectious grin.
"He was known for his smile.
They always said that his smile lit every room."
Yet he stopped working before his death because he was deep in the pit."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was then 11 years old, found him after he had robbed himself of life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I'm constantly worried about a chain reaction."
Mrs. Davis made the cards to let people know that there are others where you can go and what you can talk to, even if it's just a friend.
Don't keep quiet - talk about it."
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs. Davies for years, did not lose Mark, who was her partner for 15 years, long after his mother died.
"He didn't say he felt sad or depressed or anything like that," she said.
'A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
He was sitting all over the ground on Christmas Day - when the children were unpacking their gifts, he didn't look at them at all or anything."
She said that his death was a great trauma before she, but that they had to deal with it: "It's tearing the whole family apart.
It drives us apart.
But we all have to go on and keep fighting."

Brett Kavanaugh's future uncertain while FBI investigation starts
'I thought that if we could actually get what he is asking for; a study limited in time and size, we might be able to create a little more unity again', said Mr. Flake last Saturday, to which he added, that he was afraid that the committee was falling apart, in the midst of a firmly anchored pat within the party.
Why did Mr Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance has everything to do with timing.
In five weeks' time, on 6 November, and if, as expected, the Republicans do badly, their efforts to get their husband elected to the highest court in the country are seriously hampered.
George W. Bush has already called with members of the American Senate to lobby for Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush, and thus his wife Ashley met, who was the Bush his personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI has the report ready?
Then there will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 republicans and 49 democrats are currently sitting.
It is not yet clear whether Mr Kavanaugh can count on at least 50 votes in the Senate, and that would allow Mike Pence, Vice-President, to cast the decisive vote in order to confirm the appointment of Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
Number of overruns in North Korea 'downside' under Kim
According to a South Korean legislator, the number of North Korean invaders has fallen to South Korea since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-suck, which quotes from data from the South Korean Ministry of University, explains that there were 1,127 robbers last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park notes that stricter border controls between North Korea and China, and higher penalties for traffickers, are the main factors in the decline.
Pyongyang didn't respond in public.
The vast majority of the victims from North Korea are ultimately offered South Korean nationality.
According to sources in Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them fled through China, which has the longest outer border with North Korea and where you can make the crossing easier than in the heavily protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ; Demilitarised Zone) between the two Koreas.
China sees the attackers as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often exposes them with violence.
Relations between North and South, which are still formally at war, have improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang, with particular reference to the stagnant negotiations on denuclearisation.
This meeting took place after the historic meeting between the President of the United States, Donald Trump, and Kim Jong-un, in Singapore in June, where they broadly agreed to work towards the nuclear dismantling of the Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, however, the North Korean Minister of Foreign Affairs, Ri Yong-ho, accused the US of the lack of progress in lifting American sanctions since then.
'Without faith in US action, there is also a lack of confidence in our national security, and under these circumstances there is no first step towards unilateral disarmament', says Mr Ri during a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh 'hysterical' and finds him unfit to serve in the Supreme Court
President of the House of Deputies, Nancy Pelosi, called the U.S. Supreme Court Judge Brett Kavanaugh 'hysterical' and finds him unfit to serve in the Supreme Court
Pelosi made the comments in an interview, Saturday at the 'Texas Tribune Festival' in Austin, Texas.
'I couldn't help thinking that if a woman behaved like this, they would call her "hysterical," Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Committee on Justice on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied the accusations that he would have sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional; he sometimes almost screamed and was particularly upset when he told about his family and his high school.
He also emphatically condemned the Democrats in the committee, calling the accusations against him 'grotesque and coordinated character murder' organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi stated that she found that Kavanaugh’s testimony showed that he was not fit to serve the Supreme Court because he was full of prejudices against the democrats.
'I think he disqualifies himself with his statements and the way he talks about the Clintons and the Democrats', says Pelosi.
Pelosi protested when she was asked if she would try to institute an impeachment procedure against Kavanaugh if he were appointed, and the democrats would get the majority in the House of Deputies.
'I can say this about it; if he does not tell the truth in Congress, or the FBI, then he is not only unfit for the Supreme Court, but also for the court where he serves now', said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Court of Justice of the District of Columbia (usually abbreviated D.C.) District Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that as a democrat she was concerned that Kavanaugh would vote against the 'Affordable Care Act or Roe v Wade'. Kavanaugh is known as a conservative judge.
Kavanaugh referred questions about the revision of certain decisions of the Supreme Court during the confirmation hearings.
'Don't expect us to stand up cheering if a hysterical, prejudiced person is now appointed to the Supreme Court', says Pelosi.
Women just have to admit to this.
It is a righteous tyrade of months and years of penetrating anger that overflows, and she can only cry to get it out.
"We'll cry when we get angry," said Mrs. Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't think that's weird, do you?"
She continued: 'I was greatly helped by a woman who was somewhere leading and who told me that she too was going to cry when she got angry. She developed a method, where she started crying when she got angry. To the one she was talking to, she said, 'You might think I'm sad because I cry.
I'm angry."
And then she just kept crying.
I just thought that was brilliant."
Tears are partly permitted as an expression of anger, because crying is essentially misunderstood.
One of my best remaining memories from an earlier job, in a men-dominated office, is when I had to cry awfully because I was very angry. An older woman, a cold company manager who was a little afraid of, grabbed me in my neck and dragged me into a stairwell.
"Never let them see you cry," she said to me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad, and they're glad they got you in the closet.
Patricia Schroeder, then a member of the Congress in Colorado for the Democrats, had worked for Gary Hart on his presidency candidacy.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was involved in an extramarital affair on board a boat called 'Monkey Business' (informally means 'kattenwåad' or 'apensträken') and withdrew from the race, the deeply disappointed Mrs. Schroeder felt that there was no reason why she would not put herself on the stand.
"It wasn't a well-considered decision," she told me, laughing 30 years later.
"There were already 7 other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone was talking about "Snow White and the Seven Dwarves."
As the campaign had already advanced, she was behind with fundraising, so she solemnly promised not to join if she could not raise $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters, who would give men $1,000, wanted to give her only $250.
"Do they think I'll get a discount?" she wondered.
When she gave her speech announcing that she would not start a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by feelings - of gratitude for the people who had supported her - of frustration because the system made it so difficult to raise money, and to reach voters instead of delegates, and of anger about sexism - that she choked in it.
'They will have thought I had a nervous breakdown,' Mrs. Schroeder recalled how the media reacted to her.
"They'll have thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they gonna put on my gravestone?
"She cried"?
How the trade war between the US and China can be beneficial to Beijing
The opening salvos of the trade war between the US and China were deafening, and although the battle has not been fought for a long time, experts believe that a gap between the two countries could well open up for Beijing in the long term.
Donald Trump, the U.S. president, gave the first warning earlier this year by increasing taxes on important Chinese export products, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation became known this week when new effective, increased tax rates were revealed for 200 billion dollars (150 billion euros) of goods; half of all goods coming from China came from the US.
Beijing has taken represailles in kind every time, most recently by increasing rates from 5 to 10% for 60 billion dollars in American goods.
China has promised to match the US every time, and the worlds on a second largest economy will probably not blink with the eyes.
In order to bend Washington, requests must be accepted, but publicly bowing to the US is far too painful for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts claim that if Beijing were to play smartly, the trade war with the US, China, could in the longer term give positive support, as the interdependence of the two economies diminishes.
'The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that could lead one of the two countries into an economic free fall is indeed much more dangerous than spectators have previously recognized', says Abigail Grace, a research associate of the 'Center for a New American Security', a think tank specializing in national security issues, which focuses on Asia.
Syria 'ready' to return refugees, according to Minister of Foreign Affairs
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for help to rebuild the country that has been devastated by a more than seven years of war.
During his speech to the UN General Assembly, Minister for Foreign Affairs, Walid al-Moualem, stated that the situation in his country is improving.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure, thanks to the progress made in combating terrorism," he says.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists and to normalise the situation on the ground.
All circumstances are now in place for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they have had to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that threatened their daily lives and existence.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled their country since the war began in 2011.
It is estimated that there are about six million people living in the country who need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime would welcome help in restoring the devastated land.
However, he stressed that Syria would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that had subsidized the uprising.
Europe wins the 'Ryder Cup' in Paris
The European team won the '2018 Ryder Cup' by defeating the American team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 on the golf course 'Le Golf National' to the southwest of Paris in France.
The US has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the title when the team of the Danish leader Thomas Bjorn won the required number of 14.5 points to defeat the US.
The star of the U.S. team, Phil Mikkelson, who was wrestling almost the entire tournament, allowed his long battle from the tea to end in water at par 3, hole 16, and admitted his loss of Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer, Molinari, excelled in all his rounds and became one of the four players who ever scored 5-0-0 since the tournament in its present form began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was thrown out by playing the lowest score of the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark, with 5 holes down and 4 holes.
The top ranked player on the world rankings, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 holes down and 1 hole to play by Ian Poulter from Great Britain, who possibly played his last match in the Ryder Cup.
The Spaniard Segrio Garcia, veteran with eight Ryder Cups, became the best European player of all tournaments ever with 25.5 points in his career.
"I don't cry so fast, but today I can't help it.
It's been a difficult year.
I am so grateful to Thomas that he chose me and believed in me.
I'm so glad we have the cup back.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I could help,' said an emotionalized Garcia after the European victory.
He passed the torch on to his compatriot, John Ram, who beat the American legend Tiger Woods with 2 holes down and 1 hole in the game for singles on Sunday.
"The enormous pride I feel because I've defeated Tiger Woods. I've always followed that guy as I grew up," says 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
A strange statistic of one of the biggest players ever; winner of 14 major championships, second only behind Jack Nicklaus.
The American team struggled the weekend to find the fairways, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level throughout the tournament.
The American captain, Jim Furyk, said after the disappointing performance of his team, "I'm proud of these guys, they've fought.
Shortly this morning, we made Europe a little harder.
We resisted.
All respect for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players in his team played very well.
We're going to regroup. I'm going to work with the American PGA (Professional Golfers' Association) and our Ryder Cup Committee and we're looking forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to take your hat off for the opponent.
We're overplayed."
Red glow update: Concentrations decline in the provinces of Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The most recent report by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (Florida Commission for the Conservation of Fish and Fauna) shows a general decrease in red glow concentrations in parts of Tampa Bay Area (located on the west coast of Florida in the US).
According to the committee, it is reported that there is a fragmentary increase in the red glow in the provinces of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier, which could indicate a decrease in concentrations.
The Red Glow covers an average of 200 km of coastline, from northern Pinellas to southern Lee County.
There are about 16 km off the coast of Hillsborough County spots, but in fewer places than last week.
Red glow has also been seen in Pasco County.
Medium concentrations have been reported off the Pinellas County coast over the past week, low to high concentrations off the Hillsborough County coast, background to high concentrations in Manatee County, background to high concentrations at or off the Sarasota County coast, background to high concentrations in Charlotte County, background to high concentrations at or off Lee County coast, and low concentrations in Collier County.
There are reports of respiratory irritation in the provinces of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee, and Collier.
In northwestern Florida, no mention was made of airway irritation in the past week.
