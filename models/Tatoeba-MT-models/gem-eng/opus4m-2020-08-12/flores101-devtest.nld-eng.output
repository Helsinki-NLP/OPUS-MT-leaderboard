This not only proves the already widespread theory that certain dinosaurs had feathers in any case, but also offers more details than fossils, such as color and three-dimensional placement.
According to scientists, the plumage of this animal was chestnut brown with a pale or carotenoid bottom.
The find also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
The researchers concluded that the rachis were probably a later evolutionary development, because dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, or a rachis, but have other features of feathers - as reflected.
The structure of the feathers seems to indicate that they were not used to fly, but to control the temperature or how it looked. The researchers suggested that this is the tail of a young dinosaur, but that this sample shows just mature feathers and thus not the downs of a chick.
The researchers suggested that, despite the tail of a young dinosaur, the monster had the plumage of an adult and not the down of a chick.

Four skiers from the women's group for the seated slalom could not finish their rides and 45 of the 117 skiers in the giant slalom did not manage to sit down during the race.
The stolen laptop and mobile phone have been recovered by the Madhya Pradesh police.
According to Deputy Inspector General D. K. Arya, five of the Swedish women's rapists have been arrested and found her mobile phone and laptop.
Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar are the suspects.
According to police commissioner Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the suspects had covered their faces when they appeared in court.
There were three people in the house when the car hit the house, but none of them got hurt.
However, the driver had serious head injuries.
The road where the accident took place was temporarily closed while the emergency services tried to free the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was originally admitted to Great Yarmouth, James Paget Hospital.
He was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been sentenced in Edinburgh Sheriff Court for killing her son.
She is in custody pending the charges and trial, but the eyewitness report may be concerned because her story has been published several times.
This is common practice in the rest of the UK, but justice in Scotland works differently and courts have described the publication of photographs as potentially detrimental.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that 'journalists play a dangerous game when they publish photos of suspects.'
The Crown Office is the overall leader of prosecutions and has informed journalists that no further statements are being made, at least until charges have been made.
According to sources, the document refers to a dispute settlement, something the Palestinians wanted to do on the basis of the borders for the war in the Middle East in 1967.
Other topics discussed were the future status of Jerusalem, a city holy to both peoples, and the problems in the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands that, after signing an agreement, there be a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years, but the PA is only prepared to be present for five years.
Shooters in the additional test for pest control had to be closely monitored by forest guards, because the test was followed and its effectiveness assessed.
In a collaboration between the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited for the sporting shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of park conservation and heritage at the NPWS, the four selected shooters for the first shooting operation had an extensive safety and training instruction.
Yesterday, Martelly swore a nine-headed new Provisional Electoral Council of CEP.
Martelly has achieved a CEP five times in the last four years.
Last month, the Presidential Committee recommended the resignation of the former National Election Council, which is part of a package of measures so that new elections could take place in the country.
The committee was set up by Martyly in response to the widespread protests against the government that have taken place since October.
The sometimes violent protests arose because of the absence of elections, some of which were supposed to have taken place since 2011.
Some 60 cases of defective iPods that get overheated have been reported. In total, this led to six burns and four people with light burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) reported that it was aware of the 27 accidents associated with the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported 34 additional overheating incidents that the company called 'not serious'.
'Very regrettable', said the Ministry's response to Apple's postponement of the report.
Mariana was affected by the earthquake at 07.19 local time (Friday 21.19 GMT).
The Northern Mariana Calamities Management Office stated that no damage was reported nationally.
In addition, the National Tsunami Warning Center reported that there was no tsunami warning.
In Manila, the Philippine capital, a former police officer from the Philippines hostageed tourists from Hong Kong by hijacking their bus.
With his M16 gun, Rolando Mendoza shot at the tourists.
Several hostages have been brought to safety and at least six fatal victims have been confirmed for the time being.
Six hostages were previously released, including the children and the elderly, and the Filipino photographers.
Later the photographers returned in exchange for an older woman who had to go to the toilet. Mendoza was finally shot.
Lyggins went to work in medicine, following the example of his father.
He was educated as an obstetrician in 1959 at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland.
When he was working at the hospital, Liggins researched early birth in his spare time.
His research showed that the maturation of the foetal lungs of babies was accelerated by the administration of a hormone.
Xinhua reported that government researchers found two black boxes with flight recorders on Wednesday.
Co-wrestlers also paid homage to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, 'Luna was the first 'Queen of Extreme'. My first manager. Luna died on the night of two moons. Just as unique as she was. A strong woman.'
Dustin 'Goldust' Runnels said that 'Luna was as weird as I... maybe even weirder... I love her and I'm going to miss her... hopefully she's in a better place'.
Of the 1,400 people polled for the 2010 federal election, the number of people who opposed Australia’s becoming a republic increased by 8% since 2008.
Demissionary Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the campaign for the 2010 federal elections that Australia should become a republic after the government of Queen Elizabeth II.
34% of the participants in this survey supported this position, and they want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last prince of Australia.
29 percent of respondents thought that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and in the end 31 percent said that it should never happen.
The Olympic winner of the gold medal swam the 100- and 200-metre freestyle and three Estafette matches during the Commonwealth Games, but his condition was called into question because of his complaints.
He couldn't take the drugs he needed to relieve his pain, because they were banned from the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a professor of mathematics and computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number at the moment on January 25.
Several people verified the discovery at the beginning of February using different hardware and software and this was announced on Tuesday.
Comets could have been a source of water on earth, along with organic material that makes proteins and supports life.
Scientists are hoping to gain insight into the way planets come into existence. They especially want to know how the earth originated, given that it has been a long time since comets came into conflict with the earth.
Cuomo (53) was installed as governor earlier this year and signed a law that legalizes marriages between people of the same sex last month.
He called the gossip "political nonsense and gossip."
It is speculated that he wants to stand as a candidate for the presidency in 2016.
According to the FAA, the NextGen system could allow aircraft to take shorter routes, saving millions of tonnes of fuel per year for lower carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology, unlike older technologies with ground radars, allowing air traffic controllers to locate aircraft much better, and to provide pilots with clearer information.
No extra transport is used and no underground trains stop at Wembley and parking spaces and the P&R are not available on the site.
A possible lack of transport made it more likely that the game would be played behind closed doors and without supporters.
A study published on Tuesday in the scientific journal Science focused on the formation of a new bird species on the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that new species evolved within two generations. It was thought that this process lasted much longer because the crossing of an indigenous Darwin finch, the Middle Mink, with an immigrated Cactus finch, the Española finch, lasted longer.
Gold can be transformed into many shapes. It can be rolled up into small shapes.
It can be drawn in a narrow thread that can be twisted and braided. It can also be forged or rolled into plates.
After it has been made very thin, it can be glued to another metal. It can even be made so thin that it was sometimes used for the decoration of hand painted illustrations in books called 'lightened manuscripts'.
This is called the pH value of a chemical. You already make an indicator using red carbon juice.
The colour of the carbon juice then changes based on the acidity (acid to basic or alkaline) of the chemical.
The pH value shall be indicated on the basis of the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the chemical tested.
Hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron, and hydrogen ions are protons without electrons.
Mix both dry powders, wet your hands and clean them and make a ball of them.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, which feels strange and forms a kind of shell.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjodaro, almost every house had a flush toilet connected to an advanced sewage system.
Drainage remains have been found in houses in the Minoan cities on the Greek islands of Crete and Santorini.
In addition, there were toilets in China, Egypt and Persia in ancient times. In the Roman era, toilets were often part of a popular bath house, where both ladies and gentlemen came together in a mixed group.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
As soon as the space satellite receives the call, it shall be returned immediately.
The satellite has been shot into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space, because the Earth’s vapour cycle distorts part of our light and image.
To operate a satellite or telescope in space, you must have a huge rocket that is more than 30 meters long.
The wheel has changed the world incredibly, and the most important thing the wheel has given us is an easier and faster transport.
The train, the car and many other means of transport are the result.
There are average-size cats between that medium-sized prey, from hares to antelope and deer.
In addition, there are many small cats (such as stray cats that are kept as pets) that hunt small prey on larger numbers, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
Their success comes from the idea of a niche, a special job that each cat has so that they won't compete with others.
Lions are the most social cats and live in large groups called troops.
Teams consist of one to three adult males who are related to each other and also have up to thirty females and cubs.
The women are usually closely related to each other and form a large family of sisters and daughters.
A pack of lions behaves almost the same as a pack of wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly much like lions (but not like other great cat-like ones), and that are very lethal to their prey.
The tiger is a versatile athlete and can climb (although not well), swim, jump large distances and have five times as much traction as a strong person.
The tiger belongs to the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cat-like ones are the only ones who can roar.
A tiger doesn't roar out of full power like a lion. It's more like he's grunting a whole sentence.
They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if they can. The oceanlot hunts almost exclusively animals that are much smaller than it is.
Scholars suspect that occlusives use their odor to hunt small animals (their prey) by smelling on the ground where they have been.
They can see very well through night vision in the dark and move very inconspicuously. Ocelotes hunt prey by making one with the environment and then jumping on their prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) escapes from the large population from which they originate (for example, by moving over a mountain chain or river, or when they are moved to another island, from where they cannot easily return), they are often in a different environment than before.
In this new environment there are other raw materials and other enemies, so the new population must change or adapt to cope with competition.
Because they still need the same adjustments as before, the original population has not changed at all.
As the new population began to adapt to the new environment, they also began to look less like the other population.
After thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will be so different from appearances that you can no longer call them the same species.
This process is called species formation and simply involves the formation of new species. Species formation is an unavoidable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that inhales people and they absorb carbon dioxide that exhales people.
By means of photosynthesis, the plants extract their nutrients from the sun and also provide shade.
Our houses and clothing are made of plants. We eat mainly plants. Without plants animals would not survive.
The Mosasaurus stood at the top of the food chain from that time. He had nothing to fear from anyone except other Mosasaurus.
His long jaws had more than 70 razor sharp teeth, plus an extra set in the palate, which means that nothing or no one could escape from him.
It is not certain, but perhaps his tongue was forked, eating turtles, large fish, other Musasaurians and perhaps even his own kindreds.
There was nothing safe from the attacks in water; also giant dinosaurs like the Tyrannosaurus Rex were no party to him.
Although most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans also had their portion of strange or unusual delicacies, including boars, peacocks, snails, and a kind of rodent called a sleeping mouse.
In addition, there was another difference: poor people and women were sitting on chairs while eating, but rich men liked to keep together a banquet where they were lounging on their side while eating.
Meals of Roman antiquity do not contain food that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they did not have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, cocoa, nor did any old Roman ever eat a turkey.
The Babylonians made for all their gods a primary temple. This temple was seen as the own house of that god.
Sacrifices were offered to the gods and the priests tried to meet the needs of the gods with the organization of ceremonies and feasts.
Each temple had a public courtyard and a backroom accessible only to priests.
Sometimes towers were built as part of the temples in the form of pyramids, called zigguratten.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
Houses were not of great importance in the warm climate of the Middle East.
The daily life of the Hebrew family often took place outside.
Women cooked in the garden; shops were no more than a counter along the street. Stone was used to build houses.
In the land of Canaan there were no large forests, so wood was enormously expensive.
Greenland still had few inhabitants. According to Norwegian reports Erik was exiled from Iceland for murder, found Greenland on its way west and gave it its name.
He made this discovery, but all Eskimo tribes lived there at the time.
Although they were all 'Scandinavian' countries, the people, the royal family, habits and history of Sweden, Iceland, Denmark and Norway were very different.
Perhaps after the movie National Treasure you think there's a treasure map on the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is based on a misconception; something is written on the back, but it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the American Declaration of Independence are the words 'Original American Declaration of Independence, July 4, 1776'. The text is upside down at the bottom of the document.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is certain that the large parchment (of 293⁄4 inches at 241⁄2 inches) used to be rolled up for storage.
So it seems that the label is simply added as a kind of label.
Thanks to the D-Day landings and the battles that followed, the north of France was liberated, but the south remained occupied.
It was ruled by Vichy-France. These were French who fought against them on the side of the Germans in 1940 and thus with the enemy.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded South France with Operation Dragon.
The Americans and the Free French had liberated South France within just two weeks and then went on their way to Germany.
Civilisation is a single culture shared by a large group of people who live and work together in a society.
From Latin civilism, which means civil, comes the term civilization, related to Latin civis, which then stands for citizens, and civitas, which means city or city state; and that also defines in a certain way the format of society.
City states are the forerunners of nations. A civilization with a culture suggests that knowledge is passed on over several generations, a lasting cultural footprint and balanced dissemination.
When minority cultures disappear, they often leave no relevant historical evidence, so they are not officially recognized as civilizations.
During the revolution, thirteen states formed a weak central government under the articles of the Confederation, consisting only of a congress.
It lacked the power to levy taxes because there was no national executive or judicial power and relied on government authorities who often did not want to cooperate in carrying out all the decisions.
Nor did it have the power to ignore tax laws and tariffs between states.
First, all states had to agree unanimously with the articles before they could be adapted, but the states did not take the national government so seriously that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, together with the German team worldwide, is the second most successful team and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, sword fights, rugby, bicycles, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are particularly popular in the northern regions, where Italians participate in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan consists of nearly 7,000 islands (with the largest island of Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world.
Because of the cluster/group of islands in Japan, Japan is often referred to geographically as a 'shelterland'
The history of Taiwan begins in the 15th century, when sailors from Europe traverse the island and named it Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch VOC established itself in the south-west of Taiwan as a base for failure, where the VOC addressed the indigenous grain production processes and put Chinese workers to work on rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683 the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan were conquered by men of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912), after which Taiwan was relegated to the province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
After the defeat of the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Shimonoseki Convention in 1895, transferring the sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan, which governs the island until 1945.
Built of three large structures, the Machu Picchu consists of Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Room with Three Frames.
Most of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex have been rebuilt so that tourists get a better picture of what they looked like before.
Thirty percent of Machu Picchu was restored in 1976, and the renovation is still under way.
For example, worldwide, the most common photo format for still images is 35 mm, which was the usual film format in the end of the analog film era.
These are produced to this day, even though it is mainly the ratio of the image that took over the image sensor of the digital camera.
Strange enough, 35 mm film is actually 36 mm wide, at a height of 24 mm.
The ratio of this size (part by 12 to get the simplest ratio of whole numbers) would be 3:2 in that case.
Many common classifications (e.g. APS-like classifications) are equal to or a close approach to this aspect ratio.
The rule of third parties, who are widely abused and who are found ridiculous by many, is a simple directive that makes the image dynamic and yet also clear.
The most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines. This way you divide the image vertically and horizontally into three (see example).
During this period in the history of Europe, the rich and powerful Catholic church was under fire.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity has united European states, despite language differences and differences in habits.
From the king to the ordinary citizen, his pervasive power influenced everyone.
One of the most important principles of Christianity is that prosperity must be used to combat suffering and poverty, and the church has money for this reason.
The church has been the central authority in Rome for more than a thousand years, and this relationship of power and money has led many people to question whether this principle was being observed.
Britain put a blockade at sea against Germany, just after the outbreak of hostilities.
The strategy turned out to be effective, because it was no longer possible to provide vital provisions to military and civilians, but this blockade did violate the generally accepted international law laid down in various international agreements over the past two centuries.
Great Britain has placed mines in international waters, so that ships could no longer sail in whole parts of the ocean, which was even dangerous for neutral ships.
Due to the limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to the unbridled underwater warfare of the country.
During the 1920s, most citizens and nations had a position of pacifism and isolation.
After the First World War, states wanted to prevent such horrors from ever occurring.
Tesla emigrated to the United States of America in 1884 to work at the Edison Company in New York City.
When he came to the United States, he had only 4 cents, a poem and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former boss) for Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of displaying different periods of time; every phase of China or every ruling family had a distinct dynasty.
Also between the various dynasties there was an unstable period in which the provinces were divided. The most famous was the era of the Three Kingdoms, which took place in the 60 years between the Han and the Jin Dynasty.
At that time there were fierce wars between various nobles who fought for the throne.
In the history of ancient China, the era of the Three Kingdoms is one of the bloodiest. Thousands of people died in the struggle for the highest place in the great palace in Xi'an.
The Revolution has had major social and political consequences, such as the use of the metric system, a shift from the absolute monarchy to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to its inhabitants rather than a single leader.
All male candidates were able to obtain post-revolutionary functions so that the most ambitious and suitable candidates could succeed.
The same is true of the army. The ranks are no longer based on someone's class but on the calibre of the person.
The French Revolution also inspired the oppressed working class into a revolution in other countries.
Muhammad was intensely concerned with supernatural issues. He often went to a cave which later became known as the Cave of Hira in the Mountain of Noer.
The cave itself, which has survived the tooth of time, gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spirituality.
The cave is located on one of the mountaintops on the north side of Mecca and is completely closed off from the rest of the world.
Even if it was known that the cave existed, it was not easy to find. Once inside the cave there is total isolation.
The only thing to see are the clear, beautiful air and the many surrounding mountains. There is very little to see or hear from the cave of this world.
The Great Pyramid of Giza stands as one of the seven wonders of the world.
The Great Pyramid was built in the third century BC by the Egyptians and is one of the numerous great pyramid structures in honor of a deceased Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau of the Pyramids of Giza in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead contains several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), several small tombs, a number of temples and the great sphinx.
The great pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu. Many of the smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built to honor the women and relatives of Khufu.
The upbow sign looks like a V and the downbow sign looks like a niece or a square whose bottom is missing.
Above means that you have to start at the point and push away the iron stick. Below means you have to start at the bow frog (the place where your hand holds the iron stick) and put on the iron stick.
An upward movement usually gives a softer sound, while a downward movement produces a stronger and more assertive sound.
Take the freedom to sketch your personal characters, but don't forget that the printed irons are there for a musical reason, so they usually have to be respected.
On 6 October 1789, a group of market women were behind the departure of the deathbang Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette and their two young children (Marie Therese of 11 and Louis-Charles of 4), and the sister of the king, Madame Elizabeth, from Versailles to Paris.
She drove back to the French capital in a carriage surrounded by yawning and threatening mobs threatening the King and Queen.
The actions of the multitude of people forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriage completely.
At one point, someone in the crowd held the head of a royal guard who had been murdered in Versailles before the eyes of a terrified queen.
The war costs of U.S. imperialism regarding the conquest of the Philippines have been paid by the people of the Philippines.
They were imposed on the U.S. colonial regime to pay taxes to finance a large part of the costs and the interest on bonds was issued via the banks on Wall Street in the name of the Philippine government.
American imperialism was largely based on the enormous profits of the long-term exploitation of the Philippines.
To understand the Templars, one must know the context that prompted the formation of order.
The era in which this happened is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, European history in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
After the early Middle Ages came the high Middle Ages, followed again by the late Middle Ages, which usually end around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term for a wide range of ideas in practice: from technology supply or the technological obligation to a strict sense that human fate is driven by an underlying logic that is linked to scientific laws and their appearance in technology.
Most of the interpretations of technological determinism have these two general concepts: the development of technology follows a course that goes far beyond cultural or political influence for the most part, and that technology in turn has 'effects' on societies inherent in it instead of being socially conditioned.
For example, some will say that the arrival of the car automatically leads to the construction of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically feasible for just a few cars, so new production methods are being developed so that the cost of car ownership can be reduced.
Massive car ownership also causes a greater number of road accidents, leading to the development of new health care techniques to restore the human body.
In Romance a large part of cultural determinism was included, which was derived from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In Romance, geography formed the individual and, in time, customs and cultures arose in connection with this geography, which formed a harmonious society and were better than the arbitrary laws.
Constantinople was seen as the fashion capital of feudal Europe, as Paris is the present fashion capital.
It was known as an epicenter of luxury from about 400 after Christ to about 1100 after Christ.
The status of the empire declined in the 12th century, mainly because the crusaders returned with silk and spices worth more than what the Byzantine markets could offer.
Around this time Paris also took over the title of fashion capital from Constantinople.
The Gothic fourth is the 10th, 11th and 14th centuries.
At first, clothing was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture from the east.
However, because of the slow communication channels, styles in the west were 25 to 30 years behind.
At the end of the Middle Ages a style of its own began to develop in Western Europe. One of the greatest developments was the result of the Crusades: people began to use buttons to confirm their clothes.
Self-sufficient agriculture is agriculture where sufficient food is produced to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Agriculture with the aim of sustaining life is a simple system, which is usually organic, using stored seed from the eco-region, which is combined with alternating crops or other relatively simple techniques to optimise yields.
In the past, most farmers worked in self-sufficient agriculture, which is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures ensure that similar people who feel neglected are brought together by social standards, thereby giving them the opportunity to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished by age, ethnicity, social class, location and/or gender of their members.
A subculture can be determined by the following types of qualities: linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or one or more of these factors combined.
Members of a subculture often show which group they belong to by means of a certain symbolic style in what they wear, in how they behave and the jargon they speak.
One of the most widely used methods of illustrating the importance of socialization was the few regrettable cases of children who were not socialised by neglect, setbacks or willful abuse during adulthood.
They are called 'wolf children' or 'wild children'. Some wolf children have been locked up by people (usually their own parents); sometimes this child was abandoned because the parents did not want to accept the child's serious mental or physical limitations.
Untreatable children may have experienced severe child abuse or severe trauma before they were abandoned or before they left.
Others are said to have been raised by animals, and some are said to have lived only in the wilderness.
A bewildered child who has not been raised by humans can show behavior similar to that of the animal the child has cared for (within the physical limits), such as fear of or indifference towards people.
Learning on a project basis needs to simplify education and make it more interesting, but scaffolding goes a little further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method but a tool to support individuals who are confronted with a new learning experience, such as a new computer program or who are starting a new project.
Support can be both virtual and real. For example, a teacher is a form of support, but the paper clipboard of Microsoft Office is also so.
There is a virtual scaffolding that is built into the software that asks questions, provides memory support and explains procedures that can be difficult to understand without help for students.
There are several reasons why children get into foster care, such as neglect, abuse and exploitation.
No child should grow up in an environment where they are not well cared for, where they are not cared for and where they cannot develop, but yet this happens.
We regard the nursing care system as a safe zone for these children.
Care is intended to provide a safe home, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
In nursing care must meet all the needs that have been neglected in the previous home.
On the Internet, parts of interpersonal and mass communication are merged.
The different characters of the Internet lead to new dimensions in the application of the Uses & Congratulations theory.
For example, 'Learning' and 'socialisation' are proposed as important reasons for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord (1998) introduced new motivational aspects such as 'personal involvement' and 'permanent relationships' when they examined public responses to websites.
Using video recordings led to remarkable findings in interpreting micro-expressions, which are facial movements that take a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is said that no one can recognize a lie by paying attention to micro-expressions only.
Oliver Sacks described in his essay The President's Speech how it can be that people who cannot understand speech because of brain damage can accurately assess their sincerity.
He even suggested that other species, such as domestic dogs, also have the ability to interpret human behavior.
Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two groups of genetic variants: hidden and visible.
Mutation adds new genetic variation; selection eliminates this variation from the pool of expressed variation.
For each generation, separation and recombination vary between the two groups.
A primate with a digestive system similar to that of man can easily extract the necessary amino acids from the plant sources that can be found there.
Furthermore, it cannot take seriously the consequences: growth retardation, malnutrition and, ultimately, even death.
The most easily found vegetable sources are the proteins in leaves and legumes, but unless they are cooked, they are difficult to digest for primates like us.
Not only is animal food (ants, termites, eggs) easily digestible, but it also contains a lot of proteins that contain all essential amino acids.
All in all, we should not be surprised if our ancestors solved their 'protein problem' in the same way that chimpanzees on the savannah solve this problem today.
Sleep break means that you wake up for a reason during your normal sleep period and fall asleep again within a short period of time (10–60 minutes).
This is quite easy by using a relatively soft alarm clock that brings you back to your consciousness without waking up at once.
When you put your clock out in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room. In this way you have to get out of bed to turn it off.
For example, other biorhythm-based options include drinking plenty of fluid before you go to sleep (and especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic).
The amount of inner calm that a person has is compared to the amount of stress that a person carries in his or her body and mind.
The less stress, the more positive the present life force. Every human being is able to achieve contentment and total peace.
Everyone can lighten his or her mind. Only your own stress and negativity will stand in the way of this goal.
Tibetan Buddhism has its basis in the teachings of Buddha. However, this form of Buddhism has been extended with the Mahayana path of love and with a large number of techniques from Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism consists of a relatively simple core of kundalini yoga, meditation and an imitation of universal love.
Yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualized images generate the energy of Kundalini yoga.
The core of Tibetan meditation is yoga with a deity as a focus. Using the visualization of different deities, energy channels are cleaned, chakras are activated and consciousness is brought into an enlightened state.
Because Germany was a common enemy in the Second World War, cooperation was established between the USSR and the United States. When the war was over, the conflicts between the system, process and culture made the countries quarrel.
The former allies faced each other two years after the end of the war, this was the beginning of the Cold War.
The war would take 40 years and there were battles with proxy armies in battlefields in Africa, Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
The Polish defence forces only maintained it until 17 September 1939, after which they had to withdraw and reorganize along the bridge head in Romania.
However, these plans were obsolete in one night, when 800,000 soldiers from the Red Army invaded the Soviet Union and formed the Latvian and Ukrainian fronts, after occupying the eastern parts of Poland, contrary to the peace of Riga, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression treaty and other international peace treaties that were both bilateral and multilateral.
Freight transport by ship is the most efficient way of transporting large numbers of people and goods across the ocean.
Traditionally, it is the task of the Navy to ensure that a country retains the possibility of transporting persons and goods, while the ability of the enemy to transport people and goods is hindered.
The US tried to get men and material across the Atlantic to the British and with this North Atlantic campaign by WOII this is one of the most remarkable recent examples.
At the same time, the German Navy tried to stop this traffic using mainly U-boats.
Like the rest of Europe, Britain probably had fallen into German hands if the Allies had failed.
It seems that the goats have been domesticated in the Iranian Zagros Mountains some 10,000 years back for the first time.
In ancient times, cultures and tribes began to keep them so that they could always come easily to hair, meat, milk and skin.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds on a hill or other pasture. They were then guarded by goat keepers, just like the more well-known shepherd often a child or younger. Today they are still guarded in the same way.
In the 16th century, horse tracks were built in England.
Although horse - drawn railways consisted only of a rail of planks, the horses had to run faster and increase in quantities than on the slightly difficult roads of that time.
Crossbeams were already used fairly early to keep the rails in place. Gradually, however, rails were realized to be more efficient if there was an iron tip on the top.
This soon became the usual practice, but the iron resulted in more wear on the wooden carriage wheels.
Iron wheels eventually replaced the wooden variants. In 1767 the first complete iron rails were constructed.
The first form of transport we know has been running. People began to walk upright two million years ago when the Homo Erectus came up (that means upright man).
Their predecessor, the Australopithecus, was less likely to walk upright.
In fossils of the Australopithecus of 4.2-3.9 million years ago, two-legged specializations are found, and the Sahelanthropus may have been running on two legs seven million years ago.
We can live more environmentally friendly lives, join an environmental movement or even take action to alleviate future suffering.
In many cases it is similar to symptomatic treatment, but if we want more than a temporary solution, we need to identify the cause of the problems and remove them.
The scientific and technological developments of human society have obviously changed the earth dramatically, and overpopulation and the extravagant human life-style have exacerbated the problems.
After the Declaration of Independence was adopted by the Congress on 4 July, a handwritten design was sent to John Dunlap's printery a few blocks away. This design was signed by the President of the Continental Congress John Hancock and Minister Charles Thomson.
Between 150 and 200 copies were made during the night. These are now better known as 'Dunlap Broadsides'.
John Nixon gave the public reading of the document for the first time on July 8 in the Garden of Independence Hall.
One copy was sent to George Washington on July 6, and read to his troops in New York on July 9, another one arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap flights are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists believe that there is still a dinosaur species today, and we call them birds.
Many people do not view them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still remind us of a dinosaur.
On their feet are claws and scales, they lay eggs and walk on their two hind legs, just like the Tyrannosaurus Rex.
The manipulation of data encoded in binary numbers is the basis for almost all computers used today.
A binary number can only have two values, 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary numbers (and in computer language 'bits').
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms such as vomiting are so common that a diagnosis cannot be made immediately.
The presence of open-dose medicines or toxic household chemicals is the best indication of internal poisoning.
Look at the label for specific EHBO instructions for that exact poison.
This group of insects is formally called "wants" by entomologists.
This term comes from an age-old agreement with bedbugs, which are insects that can parasite very well on man.
Both red barnacles and bedfellows are nest bound, they have adapted to live in the nest or the house of their host.
In the U.S., there are some 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the main neurological disorder in adults of both younger and middle age.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, including the brain, spine and eye nerve.
Studies have shown that women have twice as many chances of MS as men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their interest, or that of their child, to raise a baby.
These couples can choose to give up their baby for adoption.
When adopted, the parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
Discovering how the world works using the scientific method is the main objective of science. This method is the directive for most scientific research.
However, it is more than just experiments; a test is a test to rule out one or more potential assumptions, question and observe, as a guideline for scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and in particular on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on science, including psychology, were accepted.
The West understood Greek philosophy and science less and less because the knowledge of the Greek took away.
Physiological and behavioural observations of rhythms often have a strong dependence on endogenous processes and production via the biological clock.
Most creatures, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals, live by periodic rhythms. These are not just reactions to external periodic signals.
Biological clocks are self-sufficient oscillators that run a cycle for a certain period of time, even if no external signals are given.
Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the most important evidences that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteria or viruses to implant their own DNA in a bacterium.
Two experiments were carried out: one experiment marked the DNA in the pheasant with a radioactive phosphorus and the other experiment marked the protein of the pheasant with radioactive sulphur.
Mutations can have many different effects, depending on the type, the importance of the genetic material concerned and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only mutations in germ cells are hereditary. Other mutations can cause cells to die or cause cancer.
Natural tourism attracts people who like to visit nature areas because they want to enjoy the landscape, including the flora and fauna.
At the site you can hunt, fish, photograph, observe birds, go to parks and study the ecosystem.
An example is a visit to photographing and learning about the orang-utangs in Borneo.
Every morning people from small villages go by car to their workplace and pass people whose workplace is located in the village where they just came from.
Everyone in this dynamic transport shuttle is somehow in contact with and supports a transport system based on private cars.
Science shows that because of this enormous carbon economy, the biosphere is no longer in the stable state that allowed human evolution to take place over the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transport systems, and almost everyone complains about it.
In developed countries, water quality problems or collapsing bridges are rare compared.
How come there are so many complaints about transport systems, why is it going wrong every day? Are transport technicians simply incompetent? Or is it something more fundamental?
In the case of a traffic flow, the movements of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions between the individuals shall be considered.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to investigate the traffic flow, as the behaviour of drivers cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers behave fairly predictable, which means that traffic flows show some degree of consistency and that there is something to be said about this mathematically.
There were links between the three core characteristics to better reflect traffic resolution: (1) intensity, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships facilitate the planning, design and operation of road construction facilities.
Insects began to fly as the first animals. Thanks to their flying ability, they were able to escape enemies more easily and find more efficient food and mating partners.
The advantage of most insects is that they can fold their wings along the body.
This allows them to hide in a larger number of small places for predators.
At present, only dragonflies and mayflies cannot fold their wings.
A few thousand years ago, Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
There were some people who thought he was right, but many people believed the opposite; that the solar system moved around the Earth, and so did the Sun (and other stars).
This sounds pretty logical, because you don't feel the earth is moving, do you?
The Amazon River is the world's largest and on a second longest river and transports more than 8 times as much water as the second largest.
The Amazon is also the widest river on earth and has a width of six miles in some places.
Nearly 20% of all the water that flows into the sea via the rivers comes from the Amazon.
The main current of the Amazon River is 6,387 kilometres (3,980 miles) long. The water comes from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Reich, the pyramids of Giza remain unsurpassed as to the size and technical excellence of the construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the new kingdom admired the monument of their predecessors, who were already over a thousand years old.
About 800 people live in Vatican City, the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the lowest population.
Italian is the language of the official communications and laws of Vatican City.
Italian is the language most widely spoken by the people who work there, while Latin is widely used during religious ceremonies.
Everyone who lives in Vatican City is Roman Catholic.
People know the most basic chemical elements, such as gold, silver and copper from ancient times, because they are all found in nature and it is quite easy to dig them with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle speculated that everything consists of a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air and fire.
This looked more like what we know of the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, but he also theorized that they are going to become new substances to form themselves to what we see.
Alloys are simply a combination of at least metals. As you probably know, the periodic system contains many elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are included in the metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
Alloys can also contain a small amount of non-metal elements, e.g. carbon.
Everything in the universe is made up of matter. All matter consists of small particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that a trillion atoms fit into the point at the end of this sentence.
That's why the pencil was a loyal friend to many people when it was launched.
Unfortunately, the pen has been reduced in status as more recent writing methods have emerged and is much less used.
Today, messages are written on a computer screen without ever needing a scorer.
You can ask yourself what's going to happen to the keyboard as soon as there's anything new on the market.
The atom bomb works according to the principle that it costs energy to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like you're pushing a heavy car up a hill, and if the core is split up again, some of the energy is released.
Some atoms have an unstable nucleus, which means they fall apart at least or least.
The surface of the moon is characterized by dust and rock. The crust is the outer layer of the moon.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the nearest side and 100 km thick on the other side.
The crust is thinner under the maria and thicker under the high plains.
There may be more mares on the side, because the crust is thinner there. Lava could easily get to the surface there.
Content theories are aimed at finding out what moves people and what they address.
This theory suspects that people have certain needs and/or wishes that are interned as they grow up.
With these theories, they want to examine the reasons why certain people want to have certain things and what environmental factors influence them to do certain things or not.
Two popular content theories are the needs pyramid of Maslow and Hertzberg's Motivation-Hygiene theory.
In general, there are two ways of dealing when managers start to lead their former colleagues, and in one way or another they try to be equal.
This type of manager finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions and disciplinary measures, to conduct evaluation talks, to delegate and to address people to their responsibilities.
On the other side of the spectrum, it transforms into an unrecognizable individual. He or she gets the feeling of having to change everything the team has done so far, and wants to make everything their own.
In the end, the leader is responsible for the success and failure of the team.
Often this behavior leads to a gap between the leaders and the team members.
Virtual teams must meet the same standards of excellence as normal teams, although there are small differences.
In most cases, virtual team members are the first contact point for their direct physical group.
Often they are more independent than traditional team members, because their teams can meet according to different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management.
The idea of a truly 'invisible team' (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, pp. 109) is a unique element of a virtual team.
The 'invisible team' is the management team to whom each member reports. The invisible team also sets the standard for each member.
Why would an organisation want to start the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organisation? One of the objectives of implementing organisational learning concepts is innovation.
Creativity and ingenuity come to light when all available resources are effectively used within the functional departments of an organisation.
The result is that the process of an organisation working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet the needs of the customer.
In order to enable innovation in an organisation, management needs to stimulate a culture in which innovation, shared knowledge and organisational learning are at the heart.
According to Angel (2006), organisations can perform better with an approach based on the continuum model.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition, thereby reducing the area of research and collecting more accurate data.
The correlation between the pathology of the brain and behavior helps scientists in their research.
It has been known for a long time that different types of brain injury, trauma, wounds and tumors can affect behavior and can lead to changes in mental capacity.
As there are more and more new technologies, we learn more and more about the structures and processes in the brain.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to develop simulation models that give us more insight into the processes of our mind.
AI immediately reminds most people of science fiction, but it is also an essential part of computer science. It is used in research into machine behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation.
Developing machines to automate tasks for which intelligent behavior is required is under investigation for AI.
Some examples include management, planning, the ability to answer customer diagnosis and questions and recognition of handwriting, voice and face.
These have become separate disciplines for finding solutions to problems in real life.
Today, this artificial intelligence system is widely used in economic, medical, technical and military areas, as in various software applications for PCs and video games.
Many excursions are planned for each class. Often a teacher would take her students to places where a bus trip is not an option.
Thanks to technological developments, virtual excursions are now possible. This allows students from the classroom to view the artifacts in a museum, look inside in an aquarium or beautiful works of art.
Virtually sharing an excursion is also a fantastic way to look back on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, Bennet School students in North Carolina design a website each year about their travel to the state capital, which is redesigned every year and whose previous versions are stored online to serve as a notebook.
Blogs can also help students write better. Often their grammar and spelling are still bad in the beginning, but they change this quickly because they have an audience.
Because students are often the most critical audience, the blogger strives to improve writing and thus avoid criticism.
Blogging 'students are also forced to learn more about the world around them'. The need to keep the public interested inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to expand learning far beyond the traditional school day.
With good use, blogs 'students can help to develop analytically and to think critically; by actively engaging in discussions on the Internet, students can find their own place in the context of other people's material and at the same time determine their own position on certain issues' (Oravec, 2002).
Canada's bilingual capital is the charming Ottawa, full of art galleries and museums in which Canada is exhibited in the past and the future.
Further south you will find the Niagara waterfalls. In the north you will find the beautiful unguested Muskoka and more.
This kind of thing makes Ontario in the eyes of outsiders typical Canadian.
Further north, large areas are relatively sparsely populated and some of these areas are even almost uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that will surprise many: there are more African Americans living in the United States than the total population of Canada.
The East African islands are located along the east coast of Africa in the Indian Ocean.
Madagascar is by far the largest and in the field of fauna it is almost a separate continent.
Most of the smaller islands consist of independent countries or are connected to France and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also took with them the Islamic faith, after which it spread widely on the Comoros and Mayotte.
The Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the cape route from Europe to India, which marked the beginning of European influence and colonization in the 15th century.
The region borders south and west of the Atlantic Ocean and north of the Sahel region.
Women: Female travelers are advised to say that they are married, whether that is true or not.
It also helps to make rings (not too expensive looking rings).
Women should take into account that cultural differences can lead to behavior that they see as intimidating and that it is customary to be followed, to be held by the arm, etc.
Be clear when you reject a man and don't be afraid to stand your male (cultural differences don't speak well!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded in the 10th century before Christ by Berber fishermen. The city was used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merinides and was known as Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed the port and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca. After an earthquake in 1755 they left the city again.
The sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city and called it Daru l-Bayad. The Spanish traders who established their trading base here named it Casablanca.
In Morocco is Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop.
Around the old Medina you will find many places where you can buy traditional Moroccan stuff, such as tagines, pots, learning products, water pipes and other conditions, but it is just for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo. It is located near Rwanda, in the far east.
In 2002 Goma was destroyed by the Nyiragongo volcano spitting lava and was buried most of the streets of the city, especially the city center.
Although Goma is relatively safe yourself, for visits outside Goma you need to check the status of the fighting going on in the province of North Kivu.
In addition, the city is the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano and you will find some of the most affordable trips for Mountain Gorilla tracking in Africa.
With boda-boda (a motor taxi) you can move on Goma. The normal (local) price is about 500 Congolese Francs for the short drive.
'Timebooktoe' is relatively poorly accessible and is therefore used today as a metaphor for exotic, distant countries.
Today, Timboektoe is a pauper city, although the city's reputation makes it a tourist attraction and has an airport.
In 1990 it was added to the list of endangered world heritage due to desert storms.
It was one of the most important stoppages of the PBS exhibition Special Wonders from the African world of Henry Louis Gates.
The city differs from the other cities in the country, because it has a more Arabic appearance than an African.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and runs in the east along the border with Mozambique, in the north along the border with Zimbabwe and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
19,500 square kilometers is the park, divided into 14 different eco-zones, where various wild species are kept.
As a major attraction in South Africa, this park is the parade horse of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all South African national parks, there are daily maintenance fees and access costs.
It may also be useful to buy a Wild Card. These offer or access to certain parts of parks in South Africa or to all national parks in South Africa.
The whole territory of Hong Kong is named after the island of Hong Kong and that is considered by many tourists to be the most important place.
The large number of buildings made up of the Hong Kong skyline is already compared to a glistening bar graph that is visible thanks to the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best views of Hong Kong you leave the island and head towards the water side of Kowloon across the river.
The vast majority of the population of the island of Hong Kong live very closely on won land along the northern coast.
This is where the British colonists have settled, so if you're looking for evidence of the colonial past of the area, then you can start right here.
The Sundarbans are the largest mangrove forests in the world and stretch from the coast 80 km (50 miles) to Indian and Bengal inland.
The Sundarbans are now officially included on the UNESCO World Heritage List. The part within the Indian borders is called the Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are more than just mangrove marshes — they also have a few of the last mighty pieces of jungle that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, of which a third is peat and marshland.
The Sundarbans have been a wildlife reserve since 1966 and in the area there are now an estimated 400 Bengali tigers and about 30,000 axishes.
During the day buses depart from the station on the border of the districts (towards the river). Most depart between 6.30 and 7.30 hours, especially in the direction of the east and Jakar/Bumthang.
It is wise to buy a ticket a few days earlier, because the regional buses are often fully booked.
In most neighbourhoods, small Japanese Coaster buses are available that are comfortable and robust.
Shared taxis allow you to travel quickly and comfortably to nearby places, such as Paro (150 ngultrum) and Punakha (200 ngultrum).
The Oyapock Bridge is a cable bridge that crosses the Oyapock River to connect the Brazilian city of Oiapoque and the French-Guyanese city of Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock.
The two towers have a height of 83 meters. The building has a length of 378 meters and has two passageways with a width of 3.50 meters.
Below the bridge is the crossing height of 15 meters. In August 2011 the construction of the bridge was completed, but it only opened for traffic in March 2017.
According to the planning, the bridge is fully operational in September 2017. Brazilian customs posts are expected to be ready for use.
The Guaraní was the most striking indigenous group. They lived in the area that is now eastern Paraguay, lived as semi-nomadic hunters and also engaged in self-sufficient agriculture.
In Chaco Province, other indigenous tribes, including the Guaycurú and Payaguá, found their food by hunting, fishing, and collecting.
Paraguay, formerly called 'the great province of India', was born in the 16th century when Spanish colonists encountered the indigenous population.
There followed a three-century colonization period among the Spaniards.
Asunción was founded in 1537 and since then Paraguay has been able to retain much of its native character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
In December, the biggest tournament of the year takes place on the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
There are also smaller tournaments and competitions here at other times of the year.
Check the Asociación Argentina de Polo for more information about tournaments and buying tickets for polowed matches.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP).
On the islands there is only one bank, namely in Stanley opposite the FIC West store. Here you can exchange money.
Generally, British pounds are accepted everywhere on the islands and in Stanley you can also often pay with credit cards and US dollars.
On the remote islands you probably cannot pay with a credit card, but probably with the British and American currencies. Ask the owners in advance how you can pay.
Change your money again before you leave the islands, because the Falklands currency is very difficult to exchange.
Montevideo is below the equator, so when it is there in summer, it is winter on the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropes. In the summer months, temperatures above +30°C may occur.
The winter can be deceptively cold: the temperature almost never goes below zero, but the wind in combination with the humidity makes it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
The rain level remains approximately the same throughout the year, without recognizable 'wet' and 'dry' periods.
Many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, but wild animals are in the end just wild. Therefore they should not be fed or disturbed.
Keep in the park at least 100 meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 meters from all other wild animals.
Elks, bison, reindeer, bears and about all the other large animals can attack you, however tame they may seem.
Every year dozens of visitors get hurt because they don't keep a proper distance. These animals are large, wild and possibly dangerous, so give them the space.
In addition, you should be aware that scented bears and other wild animals attract, so avoid wearing or cooking fragrant food and keep the campground clean.
The capital of Samoa is Apia and the city with almost 40,000 inhabitants is located on the island of Upolu.
Around the year 1850 Apia was founded and it is the official capital of Samoa from 1959.
In 1889, seven ships from Germany, the USA and Great Britain did not want to leave the port. This later became known as the notorious patting.
With the exception of a British battleship, all ships were sunk, and almost 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
In the independence struggle of the Mau movement, the highest leader, Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III, was killed at an out-of-the-box non-violent meeting in the city.
There are many beaches, especially because of the two ports of Auckland. The most popular are located in three areas.
North Shore beaches in the North Harbour district stretch from north to south along the Great Ocean, from Long Bay to Devonport.
These are almost all sandy beaches where you can swim safely and most have pohutukawa trees that offer shade.
At Waitemata's harbour, in the luxury suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, located in Central Auckland, you will find the Tamaki Drive beaches.
These family beaches are sometimes busy and have a good choice of shops on the coast. Swimming is not unsafe.
'Number One' is the main local beer that is not complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer has the name 'Manta'.
There are many French wines to be found, but the New Zealand and Australian wines may be better suited for travel.
The local drinking water can just be safely drunk, but bottled water is also easy to find if you don't trust it.
A 'flat white' is a strange concept for Australians. Black coffee is 'espresso', cappuccino has a lot of coffee milk (without foam) and tea is served without milk.
The warm chocolate milk is of Belgian quality. Fruit juices are expensive, but great.
There are all year trips to the reef and injuries due to these trips to the reef are rare.
Nevertheless, ask for expert advice and follow up on all signs and safety warnings.
Kubuskwallen is located in the vicinity of beaches and estuaries north of Town or 1770 from October to April. Sometimes they also occur outside this period.
Sharks do occur, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of people and would just swim away.
The most important habitat of saltwater crocodiles is located in the river estuaries north of Rockhampton and they normally do not live in the ocean.
Pre-booking ensures peace of mind with the traveler, knowing that he has a place to sleep when he arrives at his destination.
Travel agencies often have deals with certain hotels, although you can usually book other accommodation such as a campsite via a travel agency.
Travel agencies often offer packages with breakfast and transportation to and from the airport and sometimes even packages with flight and hotel.
They can also hold your reservation if you want to think a little longer about the offer or if you need to obtain documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, if you have a request or wish to make a change, you must do so via the travel agency instead of the hotel.
For some festivals, the majority of those present at music festivals choose to camp on site and most visitors regard this as an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you must be early to obtain a campground near the music.
And remember this: even when the music on the main stage is over, music may be played on other parts of the festival area until the late hours.
For families whose children are still young, there are special campsites at some festivals.
Be careful where your hut is when you cross the Baltic in winter, because the trip through the ice makes a huge noise when you are too close.
Cruises to Saint Petersburg include time to explore the city. Passengers of the cruise are exempt from the visa requirements (check the conditions).
Casinos usually use to get the most out of the time and the money that guests spend. Rams and bells are usually not present and the exit is sometimes difficult to find.
They normally have special offers in the field of food, drink and entertainment to keep them in a good mood and to prevent them from leaving.
Some locations offer free alcoholic beverages. However, when people are drunk, that affects their judgment and all seasoned gamblers know that it is extremely important to stay sober.
If you go high into the mountains or drive across mountain passes, take into account that there can be snow or ice and the temperature can be extremely low.
On icy and snowy roads there is little friction and it drives differently from asphalt.
During snowstorms, enough snow can fall in a very short period of time to get stuck.
It can also be hindered by falling or blowing snow or by condensation or ice on the vehicle’s windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow are normal in many countries and this does not hinder traffic.
The largest tourist African attraction is safari, which is the highlight of their journey for many visitors.
The term safari refers in popular use to travel over land to see the beautiful African wild animals, especially on the safari.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, often come close to cars and standard equipment makes a good view possible.
If you want to see lions, cheetas and leopards, you need a binoculars, or you'll have a chance to see them.
A walking safari (also called a 'forest walk' or 'loopsafari') means that you walk for several hours or days in a row.
The Paralympics are from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some parts are played in other locations in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city where the Olympic Games took place twice. The first time was in 1964.
If you have already booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement, you can be in a plight.
The cancellation policy varies, but from the end of March most coronavirus-based cancellation policies are no longer valid until July 2020, when the Olympic Games were planned.
Most tickets are expected to cost between ¥ 2,500 and ¥ 130,000. Normal tickets will cost around ¥ 7,000.
You can dry damp clothes by ironing them. Many hotels have an iron and an ironing board available. You can borrow these things often, even if they are not in the room.
If there is no iron or if you do not want to wear coated socks, you can also use a hair dryer if available.
Make sure that the substance is not too hot (this may cause the substance to shrink or, in extreme cases, to evade).
You can clean water in different ways. Some ways are effective to counteract specific risks.
In some areas it is enough to cook water for a minute, in other areas water needs to be boiled for a few minutes.
Not every filter is just as effective. In case of doubt you can drink the best water from a closed bottle of a reliable company.
Travelers can be confronted with animal plagues that do not exist in their own country.
Pests can corrupt food, cause irritation or, in the worst case, cause allergic reactions, spread poison or transmit infections.
Usually, infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that violently hurt or kill people, are not considered vermin.
Tax-free shopping means that you can buy goods exempt from tax and excise duty at certain locations.
Travelers who go to countries with high rates of excise duty can sometimes save a considerable amount of money when it comes to products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
Point Marion and Fairmont are connected by the highway from Buffalo to Pittsburgh, you often drive through abandoned terrain and that makes this route one big challenge.
Aren't you used to driving on country roads? Keep your head in. You'll encounter many steep slopes, narrow streets and sharp bends.
The maximum speeds set are significantly lower than in previous and successive areas — usually about 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h — and it is even more important here to stick to them than elsewhere.
Surprisingly, you have much more range here than in other corners of the route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastry tastes great and in Bavaria the pastry is quite rich and varied, just like the pastry of the southern neighbor, Austria.
You see a lot of fruit cakes, and all year round they contain the pastries of apples, and in the summer months they also contain cherries and plums.
Many popular German pastries contain almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts, and taste great with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want a few small but powerful cakes, try some that are mentioned in the region of Berliner, Pancakes or Krapfen.

The Indonesian cuisine includes dishes from 17,000 islands and is an overarching concept for a variety of regional cuisines from all over the country.
But without additional information, the term refers to the food originally derived from the central and eastern part of the main island of Java.
The Javan cuisine is now available throughout the archipelago and offers various simple spicy dishes. The most common Javan flavormakers are nuts, peppers, sugar (mainly Javan coconut sugar) and various fragrant herbs.
Stitches support the rider's feet and hang on both sides of the saddle downwards.
They provide the rider with more stability, but can also bring with it problems with safety by allowing the feet of a rider to get stuck in it.
If a horse rider is thrown off but is stuck with the foot in the climb, they can be dragged with the horse. To reduce the risk, a number of safety measures have been taken.
Most riders first wear riding boots with a hook and a smooth, rather narrow sole.
Some saddles, and especially English saddles, are equipped with safety pins. This allows a jumper from the saddle to come loose if this is pulled backwards because a rider falls from the horse.
Cochamó Valley - This is the most popular climb destination of Chile. It is known as the Yosemite of South America, and has many different large granite walls and rocks.
The peaks offer breathtaking views. Climbers from all over the world are constantly discovering new routes on the rock walls that seem to have endless potential.
Winter sports where you descend, such as skiing and snowboarding, are very popular. You slide down on a snow-covered descent with skis or a snowboard at your feet.
Skiing is a popular travel activity with many fans, who are sometimes also called 'ski bums', who plan entire holidays around skiing in a particular location.
Skiing has existed for a very long time: there are cave paintings of skiers dating from 5000 B.C.!
The beginning of skiing dates back to at least the 17th century and in 1861 the first recreational ski resort in Australia was opened by Noren.
Backpacking with skis: this activity is also called off-piste skiing, skiouring or skiing.
It's not exactly the same, but it looks like alpine skiing or mountain climbing, which is done a lot on steep terrain. You need a lot of stiffer skis and boots for this.
You can see the ski route as a hiking route.
In good conditions, you can travel longer distances than walking, but it rarely happens that you reach the speed of cross-country skiing on laid slopes without a heavy backpack.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries.
However, the Schengen area operates almost as a single country in this area.
As long as you are staying in this area, you can usually cross the border without having to have another passport check.
When you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa for each Schengen country separately, which saves time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition indicating which produced articles are antique. Some tax offices give goods over 100 years of age the definition antique.
In North America, for example, the age limit is lower than in Europe.
It is possible to label craft products as antiques, although they are newer than similar mass products.
Among the Sámi, keeping reindeer is an important form of livelihood. Also, the culture around the trade is very important for many with other professions.
Even traditionally, however, not all Sámi were involved in large-scale reindeer farming. They engaged in fishing, hunting and such things. Reindeer were usually used as migratory animals.
Many Sámi work in modern professions today. In Sápmi, the Sámi area is tourism is an important source of income.
The word 'zigeuner' is used mainly by non-Roma. However, it is also often considered insulting because of the association with negative stereotypes and incorrect perceptions of the Roma.

For example, American citizens in the Middle East can be confronted with situations other than Europeans or Arabs.
Opinions include only a brief summary of the political situation in a single country.
They often give a fleeting, general and extremely simplistic picture compared to other, more detailed sources.
Emergency is the general term for any dangerous weather phenomenon that can lead to damage, serious social disruption or the loss of human lives.
Extreme weather conditions can occur all over the world. There are different types of weather conditions, which vary based on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
Symptoms and consequences of heavy weather include, for example, hard wind, hail, large amounts of precipitation and forest fires, but also thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterhouses and hurricanes.
Snowstorms, ice storms and dust storms include examples of regional and seasonal extreme weather phenomena.
Travellers are strongly advised to be aware of the risks posed by severe weather conditions in their environment, as they may also affect some travel plans.
Anyone who wants to visit a country that is considered a war zone should be trained professionally.
A search for 'cursus in hostile environments' on the Internet probably gives the address of a local company.
In a course, all the issues outlined here are usually dealt with in more detail, usually in combination with practical experience.
A course usually lasts from 2 to 5 days and consists of roll-out games, a lot of EHBO and sometimes weapons training.
There are many books and magazines with articles about survival in the wilderness, but there are few publications about war zones.
Travelers who have planned a sexual operation abroad should ensure that they have the correct documentation for their return journey.
It varies widely whether governments want to provide passports that do not mention gender (X) or to update a name or gender on documents.
There is just as much difference in the goodwill of foreign governments to recognise these documents.
Furthermore, security checks have become much more extensive since 11 September 2001.
Transgender individuals who have not yet undergone surgery can assume that they do not come through this scan with undamaged privacy and dignity.
Mui currents are the recurring flow of waves that break on a reef or something similar and flow on the beach.
Due to underwater topology, the return current is located in some deeper parts, where a rapid flow to deep water can occur.
Most of the dead fall as a result of fatigue by trying to swim against the current, which could be impossible.
When you've escaped from the strong current, backswims are so whipped.
Try to target yourself in a place where you are not caught again. Depending on your skills and whether you are noticed, you can also wait for help.
The shock of returning is worse than the cultural shock (you have a less severe 'marriage feeling'), it takes longer, and it can be more intense.
Travelers who easily adapt to new cultures sometimes find it difficult to adapt to their own culture.
If you have lived abroad and then return, you have adapted to the new culture and have lost some of your own culture.
Earlier when you went abroad, you noticed that people were patient and understanding, because they understood that travelers had to adapt to a new country.
Usually it is not expected that patience and understanding are needed for travellers returning home.
For children, the pyramid show with light and sound is one of the most interesting activities in the area.
You see the pyramids in the dark and you see them in all the silence before the show starts.
Often the sound of sellers and tourists is always audible here. The story of light and sound resembles that of a book.
The Sfinx forms the background and is the narrative of a long story.
The scenes appear as projection on the pyramids and the rest of the pyramids are illuminated.
The Southern Shetland Islands were discovered in 1819 and have since been claimed by several countries. They have most bases, with 16 active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is the King George Island with the settlement Villa Las Estrellas.
Others are Livingston Island, and Deception. Here you will find the streamed crater of an active volcano serving as spectacular natural port.
Ellsworth is located on the southern side of the peninsula, at the border with the Bellingshausen Sea.
Here the mountains of the peninsula pass into the plateau, after which they appear again to form the 360 km long mountain chain Mount Ellsworth, which is crossed by the Minnesotagletsher.
The northern part, also known as the Sentinel Range, includes the highest mountains of Antarctica, the Vinson Massif. Mount Vinson is the highest mountain with 4892 meters.
A satellite phone can be your only option in remote locations, where there is no reception for mobile phone.
A satellite phone is not really a replacement for a mobile phone, since you have to stand outside with free view on the satellite to be able to make a phone call.
This service is often used by shipping, including pleasure craft, and for expeditions where there is a need for external data and communication.
Your local phone service provider can provide you with more information about how to connect to this service.
It is becoming increasingly popular for people who plan to travel and learn in the middle of the year.
School leavers in particular make use of this to take an interim year before the university without adverse effects on their training.
A registration for a foreign education can often increase your chances of continuing to pursue higher education in your own country during an interim year.
In general, tuition fees should be paid for the registration of these educational programmes.
Finland is a fantastic destination to sail. The 'Land of a thousand lakes' also has thousands of islands, in the lakes and in the archipelagos off the coast.
Hunting is not necessary for the archipelagos or lakes.
The archipelagos on the coast and the largest lakes are indeed big enough for every yacht, but with smaller boats or even a kayak you get a completely different experience.
In Finland, so many people sail in their spare time, that the ratio of boats to people is one to seven or eight.
The figure is the same as that of Norway, Sweden and New Zealand. Furthermore, it is quite unique (in the Netherlands, for example, the figure is one in forty).
Most Baltic cruises include a long stay in Saint Petersburg, Russia.
So you can spend a few full days in the historical place and spend the night on the ship.
Since 2009, you do not need a separate visa if you are only going ashore during a boat excursion.
Some cruises include a visit to the German capital Berlin, but as you can see on the map, Berlin is not close to the sea. A visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Air travel can be scary for people of all backgrounds and ages, especially if they have never flown before or if they have had a traumatic experience.
It is not something to be ashamed of: it is no different than many fears that other people have.
If you know how planes work, this can help to remove a fear that comes from the unknown or from the fact that you have no control over the plane.
Courier companies get a generous fee to deliver items quickly. For business documents, merchandise or spare parts for a necessary repair time often plays a very important role.
Larger companies were able to use their own aircraft for certain routes, but for other routes and smaller companies it became more difficult.
If they send things through air transport, it may take days on some routes before they are unloaded and come through customs.
Only checked baggage could be processed more quickly. According to the rules of airlines, there must be an accompanying passenger, and so you are.
The most obvious way to fly in first or business class is to count a bag of money for this privilege (or even better, let your employer do it).
However, this is not cheap: the rule of thumb is that you pay about four times economy class for business, and about eleven times for the first class.
It usually doesn't make sense to search for discounts for business class or first class tickets on direct flights from A to B.
Air carriers are only too well aware that there is a group of pilots who are willing to count down a lot of money to fly somewhere fast and comfortable, and the airlines therefore charge appropriate costs.
Chişinău is the Moldovan capital. Here the Romanian language is mainly spoken, but also the Russian language is very common.
As a multi-ethnic republic, Moldova suffered an ethnic conflict.
In 1994 this conflict led to the creation of the self-appointed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognised by UN members.
Economic ties have again been established between these two parts of Moldova, despite the failure of the political negotiations.
Orthodox Christianism is the main religion in Moldova.
İzmir is the second largest city in Turkey with about 3.7 million inhabitants, the largest port next to Istanbul and a good traffic hub.
The once ancient city of İzmir is now a modern, developed and commercial center on a bay and is surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, the glass buildings and the modern shopping centres covered with red roof pans, the 18th century markets, the old mosques and churches, yet the city feels more like a Mediterranean, European city than traditional Turkish.
In the village of Haldarsvík you can enjoy views of the island of Eysturoy, which is nearby, as well as a special church with eight corners.
On a number of graves at the church are fascinating marble pigeon sculptures.

In the north you will find the well accessible, romantic and fascinating place of Sintra. Sintra became famous among foreigners after Lord Byron spoke with praise about the beautiful monuments there.
Scotturb bus 403 regularly drives to Sintra, with an intermediate stop in Cabo da Roca.
Also go north and look at the beautiful Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (a temple complex), where internationally renowned Maria has taken place.
Remember that you're actually just visiting a mass grave, but also a place that has a virtually immeasurable meaning for a large part of the world's population.
Many men and women who have survived their time here are still alive and many of them have loved ones who have been killed or worked there, both Jews and non-Jews.
During your visit show all applicable respect, solemnity and dignity. Do not trivialize the Holocaust or Nazism.
Do not damage the site by applying marks or graffiti to the buildings.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the population prefer to speak Catalan, the vast majority understand it, and almost everyone speaks Spanish.
However, most signs are in Catalan, because that is the first official language according to the law.

Normal announcements in the metro are only in Catalan, but unplanned interruptions are made by an automated system in different languages, including French, Arabic, Spanish, English and also in Japanese.
The inhabitants of Paris are known as selfish, rude and arrogant.
Although this is usually just an incorrect stereotype, it can't hurt to put your best leg in Paris and behave like someone who is 'been élevé' (well-educated). This will make it a lot easier to explore Paris.
The hard outside of the Parisians quickly disappears when you show that you are familiar with their way of doing.
The Plitvicemeren National Park is heavily forested and this wooded area consists mainly of beech, spruce and pine, and includes a combination of alpine and Mediterranean flora.
There are very many different plant communities, because of the different microclimates, the different soils and the varying heights.
This area is also the habitat of a very wide range of species of animals and birds.
There are rare animals such as the European brown bear, the wolf, the eagle, the owl, the lynx, the wild cat and the auerhoen, in addition to all kinds of more common species.
When women visit a monastery, they are obliged to wear a skirt all the way over their knees and must be covered with their shoulders.
Usually you get a handkerchief as a woman when you arrive unprepared at a monastery, but if you take your own copy with you, with nice shrieking colors, the monk or nun standing at the entrance will smile kindly at you.
On the other hand, men have to wear trousers to a minimum over their knees.
You can also borrow it from the stock at the entrance, but this clothing will not be washed every time, so you may not feel comfortable with it. One size fits all for men!
Like many other Mediterranean regions, Mallorcan cuisine is based on bread, vegetables and meat (in particular pork) and olive oil is widely used.
A simple and popular dish for dinner, mainly during the summer months, is the Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes and whatever is available to taste makers, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
Self-proprietary nouns, just like you mean, always have a capital letter at the beginning, even if they are in the middle of the sentence.
In this way you make a first name difference between a number of verbs and objects.
It probably also makes reading easier. Nevertheless, writing is more complicated, because you need to find out whether a verb or adjective should be used as a noun.
Most Italian words are written exactly as they are spoken, so the pronunciation generally poses few problems.
You have to pay most attention to the c and the g. The pronunciation depends on the sounder that follows.
You also have to pronounce the rr and rr differently: caro means love, while carro means carro means car.
The Persian language has a relatively simple and usually regular grammar.
Reading this introduction to grammar teaches you a lot about the grammar of Persian and helps you to understand sentences.
It's pretty logical that if you know a Romance language, it's easier for you to learn Portuguese.
But people who speak a little Spanish can quickly conclude that Portuguese looks so much like this that you don't have to learn it separately.
Premodern observatories are now obsolete, serving as museums or educational attractions.
Light pollution was not as big a problem as it is at the time, so they were often built in cities or on campuses, better accessible than those of today.
Most modern research telescopes are huge facilities built in remote areas with favourable atmospheric conditions.
Hanami is the sight of cherry blossom and this has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
In China, plum blossoms were the favorite flowers, and that's where the concept came from.
The first cherry blossom celebrations of Japan were organized by the emperor and were intended only for himself and other aristocrats at the imperial court.
Plants look best in a natural environment, which means you have to suppress the tendency to remove even 'only one' species.
When you collect samples during a visit to a landscaped garden, you will be denied access to the garden directly and without discussion.
Singapore is generally a very safe place to stay, very easy to navigate and almost everything is available after arrival.
But if you are in the 'high tropics', but a few degrees to the north side of the equator, you will experience both heat (always) and powerful sun (when the air is clear, this happens less often).
There are also some buses heading north toward Hebron, the transliterated cemetery of the Biblical patriarchs Isaac, Jacob, Abraham, and their wives.
See if the bus you are taking Hebron really goes in and not only to the nearby Jewish settlement Kiryat Arba.
Domestic waterways can be a good holiday destination.
For example, you can visit castles in the Loire Valley or the Rhine Valley, book a cruise to the interesting cities along the Danube or make a boat trip along the Eriekanal.
They also indicate popular hiking and cycling routes.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays of Christianity, celebrating the birth of Jesus.
Moreover, people who do not believe in Christian countries and non-Christians around the world have adopted many traditions that are part of the holiday.
There is a tradition where you stay all Easter night until you can see the sunrise at some point.
Of course, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may as well be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
In traditional churches a Passover wake is often held on the Saturday evening of the Easter weekend. Here the congregations often celebrate at midnight a feast in honor of the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally arrived at the islands have come here by swimming, flying or floating.
Because of the long distance from the continent, it was not possible for mammals to make the journey. This made the giant turtle the most common grazing mammal on the Galapagos Islands.
Since man set foot on the Galapagos, all kinds of mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats and dogs.
During the winter, the Arctic and Antarctic areas have a pool night, which means that the sun does not actually rise.
There is a good chance that you can see the aurora borealis, as the sky will be dark more or less day and night.
The areas are sparsely populated and therefore light pollution is not often a problem. That means you can also enjoy the starry sky.
The Japanese work environment is more structured and formal than in the Western world.
Packages are standard workwear and colleagues call each other by the last name or function name.
A consensus on the work floor is crucial. The focus is on group performances rather than the prices of individual work performances.
Employees often need permission from their directors before they can make a decision and are expected to follow the instructions of the directors thoughtlessly.
