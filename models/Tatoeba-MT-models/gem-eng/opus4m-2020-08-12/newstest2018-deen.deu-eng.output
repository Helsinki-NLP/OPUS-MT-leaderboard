Munich 1856: Four maps that change your view of the city
A madhouse where young people are supposed to meet today.
A tomb chapel where now is dug for the S-Bahn tunnel.
Small gardeners cultivate the former land of farmers.
The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories.
It's annoying when maps aren't up to date.
Anyone who had to get upset already knows this because the Auto-Navi showed a green meadow instead of a bypass road.
The historic maps of the digital Bayern atlas, an offer from the Bayern Geoportal of the state government, are everything but current – but that's why they are very informative.
Especially when you compare them with current online cards.
Then it becomes clear how cities and communities have changed in the spread of the Munich Mercury since the 19th century.
The digital Bayern Atlas is a patchwork that is not recognized as such.
More detailed maps, so-called original positioning sheets, were included in the large map.
According to the Bayerische Vermeinungsverwaltungsverwaltung between 1810 and 1864, these were produced from the first survey of Bavaria.
Your client: Napoleon.
The French army leader occupied Bavaria with Austria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War.
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographical recording of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.
Even though the French troops finally withdrew with the peace of Lunéville from February 9, 1801, it was the present-day neighbors who created the idea of a comprehensive Bayern map.
Elector Max IV Joseph moved the project forward, founded the "Topographical Bureau" - and thus the Bavarian survey administration.
The Urpositionsblatt for Munich dates back to 1856 and can be found on the website of the Bayerische Landesbibliothek.
The comparison Previous/Today is the most impressive example of the state capital.
The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.
An example of this is Untersendling, which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.
Sendling was included as Munich district 21 years after the map was created, i.e. in 1877.
Today, Untersendling is located in the middle of the city.
The houses Untersendlings concentrate around 1856 along today's Plinganserstraße, which was named only in 1878 after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the revolt of Bavarian farmers against Austria in 1705.
Where today is the Westpark, you can see nothing but fields - at first glance: When zooming in, a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers appears: hand-written numbered hallpieces from the so-called "reception", from which the land tax was derived.
Small plots no longer show farmers there today - but small gardeners of the "Land in Sun" plant.
A large green area is located north of Untersendling.
The Theresienwiese, since 1810 the scene of the Oktoberfest, was in fact still a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete desert.
On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.
In the Urpositionsblatt you can read in the area of today's district Au-Haidhausen not only the street name "am Gasteig" or from the height "On the air" - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt".
Yes, here on Auerfeldstraße, people were once locked up with delusions.
There, 1858/59 the Munich Kreis-Irrenanstalt "On der Auer Luften" was created.
From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden headed the institution - that psychiatrist who is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.
"He was progressive for his time and ended, for example, the chain of so-called error.
In addition, he has forbidden the staff to use violence against the inmates," says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen Museum, who has worked with the institute for an exhibition.
At first 280 patients had been accommodated, later 500 seats were expanded.
At some point this capacity was no longer enough - the reason for the construction of the Kreisirrenanstalt in Haar 1905.
Since 2006, the Isar-Amper-Klinikum Munich-Ost, one of Germany's largest psychiatry, has been located there.
On the site of the former Auer Anstalt young people now meet in Munich Salesianum.
The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with training companies.
West lies the football field of the TSV München East, east residential houses from the 1980s.
In 2015, the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" was built - in an architectural style based on the original construction of the Irrenanstalt, which had been destroyed by bombings in World War II.
The Marienplatz was recorded as "Main Square" around 1856, the Kaufingerstraße was called "Kaufinger Gasse".
A decisive change was brought by World War II also in the heart of Munich.
The bombs of the Allies broke many holes into the city center in December 1944.
A large one remained until today - at the Marienhof.
The English Institute, small business houses and a medieval tomb chapel once stood at the Marienhof, where these days the preliminary work and on 5 April 2017 the spatting stick for the second S-Bahn line took place.
With the slider you can compare the old Munich card with the aerial image of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.
Citizen's Rights Group publishes travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Promotion of Colored People has issued a warning for colored people who travel to Missouri due to the discriminatory policies and racist attacks of the state.
"The NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri, which is due to enter into force by 28 August 2017, calls on African-American travellers, visitors and Missourins to pay particular attention to travel through the state and to exercise extreme caution, since a number of questionable, racially based incidents have recently occurred and are noted throughout the state," says the Group's statement.
A recently passed law of Missouri, which makes it harder for people to win discrimination complaints, as well as the law enforcement authorities of the State, which aim at disproportionately minorities, prompted the group to issue the travel warning, said the NAACP.
"They have violations of civil rights that happen to people.
They are arrested for their skin color, they are beaten or killed together," said the president of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, Kansas City Star.
"We hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not yet heard."
It is the first such warning the organization has issued for a state in the United States.
The group cited incidents such as racist crimes against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no more gasoline during his trip through the state and was held in custody by the Missouri police without being charged with a crime.
The Council also draws attention to a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General's Office showing that black drivers in the state are 75 percent more frequent than whites.
"The recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and employees about what could happen in Missouri," said Chapel.
"People must be prepared to bring bail money or let relatives know that they are travelling through the state."
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI hate crime report that rank the state in terms of the number of such injuries to the 16th rank of the country.
The travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination.
Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the states passed immigration laws requiring local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for immigration offences, which the ACLU believes will contribute to further racial profiling.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but recently stakeholders have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States.
Weed fence project is elemental
The Fischerbach Weidezaun project is a success project and will continue next year.
The CDU-Bundestag members Peter Weiß and Kordula Kovac have taken a picture on site.
Representatives of the Fischerbach CDU-Ortsverband met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two MPs at the Rechtgrabenhof of the Svendemann family.
Markus Schwendemann first gave insights into his farm, where he manages 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, provides 40 dairy cows and as many young animals and accommodates guests in five apartments.
The "Black Forest Milk" is for him the alternative marketing route for the milk of his cows, says Schwendemann.
On the holiday guests' table comes exclusively regional.
Since he is also BLHV chairman of Fischerbach, he described the meadow fence project as "elementary important".
I can't make any profit on such steep areas.
The grassland area provides a lot of work, many things had to be worked with the motor sense.
"We have to fight with the conditions and topography here," said Svendemann.
In 2003, he took over the parental farm and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizers, even if he did not run a bio farm.
For Mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear: "The municipality has recognized the importance of the meadow fence project and is happy about the Leader funding".
For costs from 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare, farmers would have to be supported.
It is hoped that the reforestation of the areas could be extended for a long time.
"The greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how they carry on their business," said the mayor.
Farmers are often critical because of the promotion
In 2013, a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced over the meadow fence.
The open area is therefore 40 hectares, which must not be replanted until at least 2023.
Of the total cost of 71 500 euros, half was funded via Leader, one quarter was carried by the municipality of Fischerbach.
Thus, the farmers remained 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of pasture fence.
"The great advantage is the longevity of the fences," said Svendemann.
Kordula Kovac stressed: "You are doing a really good job without farmers and farmers."
Peter Weiß also stated: "This is where best food is produced".
The Landschaftspflege Directive (LPR) Baden-Württemberg allows for the state promotion of pasture fences.
The objective is to keep the Black Forest open.
A prerequisite is the presence of a conveyor environment designated by the LPR.
In addition, the area to be fenced must not be towable (restraint over 35 per cent) and must therefore be threatened by reforestation.
For the Fischerbach Weidezaun project 2018, the application is currently being made by eight participants with 24 plots who want to build almost 16 kilometres of fence.
The surface area is 35 hectares and the estimated cost is more than 112 000 euros.
Is nothing sacred anymore?
Now the White House of Trump is taking over the Statue of Liberty
The surest sign of a regime change is when they start attacking the statues.
The Americans appreciate this as well as any other - therefore the carefully staged fall of Saddam Hussein at Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he was doing when he took a symbolic axe in a heated dispute with Jim Acosta of CNN about the president's proposals to drastically restrict legal immigration to the status of freedom.
To stay fair, Miller didn't attack the statue himself.
A bunch of boat owners and Liberty Imitators would have lynched him if he had.
But he attacked their meaning, and in particular the meaning attributed to it when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus was added in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, his basis.
When Miller Acosta insulted: "I don't want to go into a complete thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.
The poem you refer to, which was later added and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty."
Miller is in the right place, but as he himself put it, it's not really about history.
It is about the contemporary response to the upsetting words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state invites not only some old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "Your tired, your poor, / your distressed masses who long to breathe freely, / the miserable waste of your rich coasts."
There was never a time when the "poor waste" was better seen on our screens.
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump's USA.
This conflict over the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural dispute: it is indeed a conflict over the meaning of America.
Lazarus - and their friends who were committed to placing their words at the base after their death - knew very well that they were doing a high-political act.
The sculpture should show the links between French and American republicanism by representing the female embodiment of freedom in a worn-out classical pictorial representation.
Lazarus changed this meaning: In her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.
And she gives herself a completely different name: the mother of the exiles.
The connection of the poem to the picture is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativeism.
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, people from the right wing wanted to change this for a long time.
Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for Trump's coming, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty is not inviting anyone, but rather an early neoconservative that brings the American flame to the night world: "Lady Liberty is moving ahead.
It is to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch should not illuminate the way to the United States."
Quite unusually, Limbaugh has come across something here.
The importance of the statue is entirely a question of the point of view of perception.
The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see them as seen by the exhausted, wretched, but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships.
In the truest sense, it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people, seeking refuge and an opportunity to improve their lives.
Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome that they must hear.
And of course, that's not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever want to acknowledge.
Their torch should not illuminate the path, but ignite the hatred that is their only source of power.
World Cup 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK team
Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots were part of the team of Great Britain
The UK's performance director Neil Black, says that the 16-member Scottish quota in the World Championships Framework will "contribute massively to the team".
A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London in 2017, which starts on Friday.
Black believes that "she's developing something special in Scotland" and the UK's athletics needs to learn something from it.
"We welcome it, and we try to understand it, and we will continue until we find out," said Black.
"I'm talking to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they've done.
The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done.
British athletics: It has something to do with what they have done.
And also with the guy on the street corner.
Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant."
Several of the Scottish athletes are medal candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track, while Eilidh Doyle was elected team captain.
"Eilidh is pretty modest.
Your captain's speech was incredible," says Black.
"A number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they lived or trained, went out of the room and felt very proud and very motivated.
The passion and the real feeling that Eilidh naturally brought in were great."
The Commonwealth Silver Medal winner, who will take part in their fifth world championships at the 400m-hours, says that it is "unbelievable" that 16 Scots are in the British team.
The best total number of athletes in Scotland at the World Championships was seven, reached in 1983 and 2015.
Muir, the medium-ranger, leads this way, and last year he recorded five British and two European records.
It will participate in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m races.
Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another shooter to watch after a great season, which included the victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers her first world championships when the only other shooter in the team was Lee McConnell.
The team captain says that she is "extremely proud" of the fact that many of her countrymen are not only part of the team, but in some cases will also be part of the medals and the finals.
"The special thing about being a team captain is that she was elected by the other members of the team, so it was a great honor anyway, but knowing that my teammates voted for me and chose me makes it something very special for me," she added.
"Of course, I'm very proud of all the scotches that belong to the team.
It just shows how far we've come.
And they're here as established athletes, athletes who want to climb to podiums.
As far as my speech as captain is concerned?
Yeah, I think she went well.
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation, as we have a home world championship.
It is therefore really important to rely on this home support and to benefit from the fact that we are back in the Olympic Stadium.
I get a second chance to go out there and compete and there will just be such a great atmosphere out there."
Block critics on Facebook: Do not apply for a public office if you cannot tolerate the heating of voters
The father of our country knew something about bad press.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long for the newspapers to beat him for everything, from internal politics to political principles.
He scolded at the criticism, sure.
But he didn't silence his critics.
Because in 1783, Washington said: "Free speech can be taken away - and, stupid and mute, we are led like sheep to battle."
This brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work on being more like Washington.
Hogan's staff have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on their official Facebook page.
And the American Civil Liberties Union sued him for that at the beginning of this week.
The governor's staff dismissed the complaint as frivolous, and the online comment was full of a counter-reaction with "Na, and?" .
"It's just Facebook," many people said.
But it's important.
And it's especially important when it's a guy like Hogan.
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is surprisingly popular.
He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.
Hogan's not a reactionary hothead.
He has shown a firm hand in leading his state and strict adherence to the principles.
He was also very skilled in using Facebook as a primary means of connecting with his voters and playing his hairless head to chemotherapy on his side.
Therefore, blocking people who come to the governor's side - which is a public forum called official and by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan's spokesperson Amelia Chasse defended the actions of the governor and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moderation.
But it is too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful people who swing the whip online.
The post office spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And these are only real people talking to their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a pastor, not a troll.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan’s Catholic faith.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hateful, but she asked about hate crimes.
"I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate crimes and other current news," she wrote in the comment area of the message "The Post".
"I don't appreciate this idea either, if a number of people take a position on the same topic, then they are ignored by some rather than a so-called collective commitment and not recognised as a large group of affected citizens."
What the governor's employees called a "concentrated spam attack" would probably call others a "presence".
The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than in the past if you had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials or to arrest and silence demonstrators.
But that's what happens digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticized for having abused Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is sued by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed.
One of the first milestones in this question fell last week in Virginia.
The chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Loudoun County violated the First Amendment, according to U.S. district judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banned a voter from her Facebook page.
And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.
That shouldn't be so hard.
At the time of Washington, the time of affordable Porto had a similar effect to the Internet.
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous writers appealed to his leadership.
And even then Washington had anonymous trolls.
The people who used pseudonyms such as "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius" wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington's decisions.
Petitions that criticized his position on the Treaty of Amity, trade and shipping with Great Britain overcame his office, according to the historical documents collected by the online papers of the George Washington Project.
But he didn't silence them.
Freedom of speech, dissent and discourse are among the foundations of our nation.
And true leadership means accepting it.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for domestic comfort at the Renaissance Club
The former European No. 1 Ronan Rafferty will hope for home comfort in the next three days, as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian will host the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
The Northern Ireland, which led to the final round next to the Archerfield last year, before losing against Paul Eales, is connected to the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador in the name of the club founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
"I have seen how the Renaissance club was built, and we see how it achieves its fame with this event," said Rafferty.
"The players will see this course from its best side, it is in a great condition.
Jerry did a great job setting up this place.
He is a zealous advocate of this game and is proud of his performance here.
This is a great showcase for this course."
The Englishman Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time, although he won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
"This feels really special," said the player in Southport.
"I have not been able to defend the Extremadura Open since it was removed from the program in the year after I won it.
Coming back to this part of the world is magical.
It is a wonderful place to play golf.
The memories of last year come back, and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon to win here last year.
It was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate."
Gary Orr, who came to the European Senior Tour earlier this year after his 50th birthday, returns to action on home ground.
This event will be his first Scottish appearance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"It always means a little more when you play at home," said Orr, the man from Helensburgh.
"You want to do well, but you also feel this additional pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again, and I played a solid golf.
I'm glad about how it went so far."
With the trio on the field are the former masters winner Ian Woosnam and the senior major champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among the six Scotsmen in the field, the others Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
The entrance is free of charge, the parking cost is £5 per car with one occupant and £10 per car with two or more occupants.

Less lung cancer due to passive smoke
In the past two decades, fewer and fewer people have died of lung cancer due to passive smoking.
Scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) will come to this conclusion in a study.
"Our estimates are that 167 lung cancer cases are caused by passive smoke per year," said study director Heiko Becher.
As a comparison, he launched his own study on this subject in 1994.
At the time, there were still 400 lung cancer cases due to passive smoke per year in Germany.
The new study is published in the International Journal of Public Health.
Home connections prove to be very complex
The construction work in Villinger Straße is in full swing and "is a bit in time", says the head of the Bauhof Fred Heinze.
In the area of home connections, the situation is more complicated than expected, as there is a lot of hiding in the underground, which is not mentioned in the plans.
Transport, which repeatedly hampers construction work, is a major problem for the Stumpp construction team.
"The ignorance of the drivers in front of red traffic lights and locking bars is already enormous," Heinze reports.
The road is blocked and only the buses are allowed to pass through.
Angelo Caruso, Marvin Kostorz and Tim Kostorz from Stumpp have been working on the bridge for weeks.
"The hot days were already quite exhausting.
But fortunately, we were supplied with cool mineral water by our friend Fritz Matt," says Marvin Kostorz.
Poverty and Death in Indonesian Goldland
If Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she won't use a stove.
She even rarely uses a pot.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of the Paniai Regent in the restful Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife normally places a sweet potato - locally referred to as "nota" - directly into the fireplace.
After half an hour, the charred tuber is removed and swallowed with zealous, unwashed hands.
Degei sits on the clay floor - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work, e.g. to wash clothes with cloudy water from the nearby swamp.
A bucket in a roofless room serves as a latrine.
As the youngest of the four wives of her husband, no fields were assigned to her.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: most villagers are unemployed, and many drink hard, and there are soldiers here.
"No one dares to walk around the village after 5 p.m.," she says.
It is a rare insight into the daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was taken up in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia, when only 1,026 elders were to vote by a public hand survey in front of the crew.
An existing movement that stood up for independence against Dutch rule quickly turned against the government of Jakarta, which maintains control of the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers.
In 2003 the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, with the independent part of Papua New Guinea covering the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is as remote as it is desolate. The trip includes a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital Jayapura to Nabire and then a morning 5-hour drive by car.
There is no public transport.
The town with about 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences and corrugated roofs converted by rust into various yellowish tones.
Very few Indonesians have made their way here, let alone journalists and virtually no foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago Papuans venerated a god called Uga Tamee.
There were other changes.
"We were not used to wearing these clothes," says Degei, pointing to their lively, hand-woven turban, their dark shirt and their bright skirt.
"We used to have only leaves on our bodies."
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst infant mortality and literacy rates in Asia.
But it's also Indonesia's Goldland.
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, Grasberg, owned by Freeport McMoran from Phoenix, is located just 60 miles from Paniai, a highland province of the size of New Jersey with 153,000 inhabitants.
In 2015 alone, Freeport has reduced the value of $3.1 billion of gold and copper.
In addition, Papua has wood resources worth an estimated $78 billion.
However, these riches are a source of misery for the Papuan people, which ensure that Indonesia's powerful military maintains an suffocating presence.
A 2005 survey in the New York Times reported that Freeport paid local military personnel and units almost $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 to a single officer.
Papuan demands for greater autonomy threaten this golden goose and are treated mercilessly.
According to activists, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed and thousands have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969.
Mass killings in Papua's Tribal Hochland in the 1970s became genocide according to the Asia Human Rights Commission.
In the region alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful demonstrators last year.
"We will lose everything" is said in a report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane from 2016, which contains reports of atrocities of the previous year, such as illegal executions and torture - rape and electric strikes are particularly popular according to another report - and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations.
"It is difficult to count the number of victims as incidents happen every week," says Andreas Harsono, Indonesia's Human Rights Watch researcher.
The screws have strengthened, as Papua's resources bring an influx of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
The population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83% Christian, but demographic development is changing as Muslim economic migrants come from the populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese warning canteens sell fried chicken and gado gado, a mixed vegetable served with peanut sauce.
Local people are fighting to keep up.
"The migrants have started selling chickens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than local Papua," explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old Paniai native who went to work in the provincial capital of Jayapura.
"It cost the native Papua - the Mama [the women] of Papua - their market."
Indonesia's President Joko Widodo, known as Jokowi, promised to tackle inequalities and legal violations in Papua during his 2014 election campaign.
The former Zimmermann secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua – including Paniai – on their way to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta.
But little has changed in Papua, and today the locals feel cheated.
"Our hearts are broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014, with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored," you say.
In fact, only two months after Jokovi's inauguration in October, Paniai suffered a low point.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children were outside and sang Christmas songs in front of a campfire in Enarotali, when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle.
The frightened children told them to turn their headlights on.
One of the soldiers started their tone and later returned with four soldiers, according to local pastor Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers who had drunk hunted and beat the group with their rifle butts, said victims and witnesses.
Then one of the soldiers fired into the children's group.
A child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so hard that he fell into the coma.
A few hours later, the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and things escalated the next day.
About 1,000 young Papuans gathered men, women and children in a football field in front of the local police station and the military command center to demand justice.
They wore ceremonial hunting bows and performed the Waita dance - continuously in the circle and mimicking a bird song - by Papua Mee Pago tribe.
Some demonstrators began to throw stones at police and military posts.
When the mood was warmed up, the soldiers were sent a command over an internal radio: "When the masses resist more than three times, they shoot them dead," says an official document by TIME, which was not released to the local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, head of the Kego Koto quarter of Enarotali, saw the impending danger and called for peace and called for the crowd to return home.
No one was in the mood to listen.
"When I turned around, I was suddenly shot in my left wrist," he said TIME on the veranda of his colorfully painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who fired, but says the bullet came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered here.
"It was overcrowded, many shots were fired," he adds.
The native man Alfius Youw was hit three times, his cousin, the witness of the shootings.
"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure it was him," said Yohanes, who, like many Indonesians, has only one name, the TIME in a dark mood.
"I saw he was dead... I kissed him."
The chief inspector of the Papua police, Yotje Mende, told reporters that his officers only wanted to "sure" their station because they were being attacked.
"We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," said the spokesman for the Papua Police, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo, in 2015.
"It's about life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young demonstrators were killed and many more injured.
The news of the killings only came 'filtered' to Jakarta the following day.
Three weeks Jokowi gave a passionate speech in Jayapura in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and vowed to address the historical abuses in Papua.
"I want this case resolved immediately, so that it will no longer happen in the future," he said.
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he had set up an out-of-court mechanism to resolve historical human rights violations.
But the excuses started almost immediately.
"Most injuries occurred a long time ago.
Some were in the 1990s and early 2000s.
The point is that we have committed ourselves to tackling these violations, but there are processes that need to be passed," he said.
Then Wiranto withdrew when he spoke to TIME in Jakarta on June 5 and said he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, "everything is regulated by law," he said.
Wiranto, who accused the UN of "crimes against humanity" calling for more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor's bloody independence vote in 1999, said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua have already been resolved, including the Paniai incident.
Families of the Paniai victims accepted such claims with fierce disbelief.
"I have been interviewed four times in the last three years, but there has been no progress," says Yohanes.
"I'm tired."
He says that years later he still lives in fear.
"I'm scared," he says.
"I'm afraid of being arrested by the military is afraid of being shot."
His brother Yacobus repeated the view that people in Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident.
He says he was beaten by the military after he helped bury four of the victims.
"After I buried the bodies, the military was looking for me," he says.
The shootings didn't stop.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police shot at villagers in Panai's Deiyai neighborhood.
During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company who refused to bring a unconscious man to the hospital, one person died and 17 others were injured, including children.
The man, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who had drowned when fishing in a nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
Excited villagers protested in front of the company's location office.
The police said that the villagers threw stones at officers who responded by firing warning shots.
But locals say that the mobile brigade (indonesian paramilitary police) started shooting at the crowd and killed one.
"We were so panicked, we're afraid there'll be revenge," says 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and was witness as the injured were quickly delivered here, according to TIME.
"I've been hiding in my house for two days."
The Deiyai Parliament has called for the officers involved to be held accountable and the police's mobile brigade to be withdrawn from the area.
Paniai was always a troublemaker for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development strengthens the dissatisfaction of the tribesmen Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal, who live in the green highlands of Papua.
Many joined the Free Papua Movement (OPM), the rebel army, which claims to defend the rights of Papua by inciting sporadic attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders come from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response to this, thousands of people have been arrested in Paniai in recent years and arbitrarily detained, under the pretext of "ensuring national sovereignty".
Some never show up again.
Among the people in Papua, Paniai is known as "a tragic, forgotten place".
Poverty strengthens dissatisfaction.
The little rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.
Bread is just as out of range.
People here are building everything they eat: especially notice and fruit and leafy vegetables.
Agriculture is the task of women who can each process four or five fields of sweet potatoes.
They keep most of the harvest for the family, while the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten pieces of note cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities between the native Papua and the new migrants have increased since the opening of new routes to Nabire airport.
The few jobs available in the region usually go to the better educated and more prosperous migrants.
Papua rarely has the capital or the necessary skills to run their own businesses competitively.
"The young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there are no jobs or money here," says John Gobai, chairman of the tribal council of Paniai.
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua.
In addition, restrictions on the reporting of international media remain tense.
At the beginning of the year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua due to a lack of coordination with related institutions, although the rare permission to film was given to them.
According to Phelim Kine, the deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch, the promises of Jokowi's election campaign to remove the restrictions of reporting in order to promote transparency and development have not been fulfilled.
"There are new dangers for foreign journalists who are trying to report on Indonesia's restless easternmost provinces of Papua and West Papua: visa refusal and a black list," he said in a statement.
Lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely limited to the immediate neighbours of Papua.
In March, six Pacific states - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the "various and widespread injuries" in Papua including the Paniai shooting.
The same countries have historically supported the OPM.
The spokesperson of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Arrmanatha Nasir rejected the group's accusations and said journalists in Jakarta: "In Indonesia there is still a democratic system, and there are free media, so it is difficult to cover up the evidence of human rights cases."
People on the ground want more foreign governments to take note of this.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on May 4, locals broke their silence and forced him to "We want freedom", according to a source who also participated in the meeting but wants to remain anonymous.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but the Papuans say they will probably not vote for Jokowi again.
"Jokowi is a person who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the Panii shoots," says Gobai, chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai people, apart from living under the constant threat of a robbery military, are in poor education and health services.
Gobai says that the Paniai people, like other Papua, regard their voice for Jokowi as a "debt" he has to pay back.
"They don't need money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite the threats and intimidations, families of the Paniai victims carried out a last symbolic act of defiance: the body of a victim was buried on a site just opposite the police and the military station.
They know that justice may never come to them, but at least they will not let those responsible forget their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed," says Yacobus with a lowered head.
"What else can we do?"
Fire capture the 'Torch' skyscraper of Dubai for the second time
A fire found its way through Dubai on Friday in one of the world's tallest residential towers and forced hundreds of residents to flee the 337-metre-high 79-storey building.
It is the second fire that sweeps through the high house in just two years, which is by chance called the Torch Tower.
The building was evacuated, injuries were not reported, and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame.
"We slept and we got up at the fire alarm and screaming people.
We ran down the stairs, and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor," said a resident who gave his name as George, Reuters.
Dubai's civil protection authorities said that the fire-fighting units extinguished the fire and cooled the building at about 4 a.m. local time (00.00 GMT).
The government said she was working on providing accommodations for the affected.
The incident can revive questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high-rises around the world.
An investigation by the management of the Torch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damage was caused by the covering, the outer covering for decoration or insulation.
In the UK, the police said that the system of plates for insulation and covering on the London Grenfell Tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died.
No Davis Cup Reform: Next Best-of-five
The president of the International Tennis Association (ITF) passed through the General Assembly with his large Davis Cup Cup.
At the meeting in Ho Chi Minh City, the revolutionary proposal for this sport to play Davis Cup singles only on two winnings was not supported by the required two-thirds majority.
The five-rate classics, which are often very long, but also very much appreciated, will thus remain the traditional competition.
63.54 percent of the member countries voted in favour of the reform, so the objective of ITF President David Haggerty was barely missed.
"We respect this decision, but are disappointed that our member nations have not accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and Fed Cup.
We need a change to secure the long-term future of these iconic and historical competitions," Haggerty said.
We will continue to work to improve the applications.
Not only for the vote, but for many objections, the proposal to hold the finale in a neutral place had already been made.
New from 2018 are only comparatively smaller details: The finalists in the Davis Cup and Fed Cup will have the host law in the following year in the first round.
In order to reduce the costs for the organizers, the requirements in terms of training places etc. are facilitated and the players will have to complete less official media terms before the Davis Cup.
More than 1 out of 5 US travelers brings prohibited items to the plane, finds out a survey
A survey of air passengers revealed that more than 20 percent of deliberately or unwittingly prohibited items were smuggled past the control points of the US Transport Security Administration, including at least 6 percent who entered the aircraft while carrying accidentally banned knives or other items with blades.
Less than 1 percent claimed that they had discovered late that they had traveled erroneously with firearms, ammunition or explosives.
The survey of more than 1,000 people - carried out by a jet charter service, Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - also found that younger travellers were more likely to disobey the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted that they had knowingly tried to fly with something that was banned by the TSA, 19.7 percent were millennials, compared to less than 15 percent who were generation X members.
The most common items intentionally passed by TSA agents were food and liquids.
More than 3 percent admitted to knowingly carrying items with blades through security controls, while 2.2 percent of female respondents and 3.7 percent of male respondents also confirmed that they had intentionally brought banned drugs into the plane.
The company said it had interviewed travellers all over the country to find out how many accidentally smuggled goods had been brought through airport security and how many had done it intentionally.
It is no surprise that the people who used to carry contraband - knowingly or unknowingly - by safety were the ones most often flying.
However, the company points out that the TSA Directives are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People are often unsure which fluids they may take or how much of them.
It is no surprise, then, that the largest quantity of liquids seized by the TSA is prohibited.
For a while, people thought that TSA could view books as contraband.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
Elon Musk doesn't care: Tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel order
Elektro-thousandsassa Elon Musk likes to indicate with the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla "Model 3".
He has thus far suggested that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non-binding reservation.
In addition to the ever triumphant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets, Tesla-Chief Elon Musk has for the first time announced the latest quarterly balance sheet with a different, less shiny number: the cancellations in the new mass market model 3.
Musk has often advertised the more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car, whose delivery begins in the past months.
Now Musk admits: Of the 518,000 pre-orders, 63,000 have already been withdrawn.
Critics had repeatedly pointed out that these were only non-binding reservations.
In case of cancellation, Tesla will fully pay back the 1000 Euro (US$1000 and UK £1000) "reservation deposit".
At present, 455,000 such non-binding reservations were made, Musk admitted to a telephone conference with analysts.
However, the Tesla Chief does not believe that the cancellation of around 12 percent of all orders could become a problem.
His argument: The challenge for the ambitious growth goals is not demand, but production.
Last year Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.
2018 - all models combined - should be 500,000, 2020 one million.
The demand for this is obvious.
According to Musk, 1800 reservations are currently included per day.
If you order a "Model 3" today, you can expect delivery at least in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla manages to drive its brand new production routes that have never been tested in practice without major interruptions with maximum capacity.
Many experts doubt that this is possible.
However, if there are major delays, then the inability of reservations could become a problem for Tesla.
Because then the company cannot stop dissatisfied customers from running away in crowds.
EPO Chief Pruitt withdraws due to the delay in the Obama era's emission reduction rules
One day after he was sued by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, withdrew his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era in order to reduce emissions of air pollutants causing Smog.
Pruitt presented the change when its agency proved to be more responsive to the needs of state environmental authorities than previous administrations.
He did not mention the action brought against his previous post in a Federal Court of Appeal.
It is a deadline that expired on 1 October for states to comply with the 2015 standards for ground-level ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that he would delay compliance by one year in order to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid "mixing in local decisions or hindering economic growth".
Pruitt, who was President Donald Trump's prosecutor of Oklahoma before his appointment, was a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations for a long time.
Since his arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved to block or delay regulations that the chemical industry and the fossil fuel industry oppose.
The sudden return of Wednesday is the latest legal setback for the Pruitts regulatory rollback agenda.
Last month, a Federal Court of Appeal in Washington decided that the EPO administrator had exceeded its authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama Administration that required oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leakages.
In a statement published on Wednesday evening, Pruitt proposed that his turning point in ozone standards simply strengthen the EPA's willingness to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely compliance with the new standards.
"In previous administrations, the EPO has often failed to comply with the deadlines for implementation and then waited to be charged by activist groups and others, and in an agreement to set the deadline for implementation," said Pruitt, who sued the EPO more than a dozen times in his previous job.
"We do not believe in judicial regulation, and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take seriously the law and the authority that we have."
Nevertheless, the EPO opinion stated that Pruitt will at some point use its "power to delay and all other legally available powers" to ensure that the rules are "based on sound policy and the best available information".
The Republicans in Congress are pressing for a more comprehensive revision of the ozone rules.
A draft law approved last month is intended to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been put to the vote in the Senate.
New York's Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that had sued the EPO this week, said that the group intended to maintain the legal pressure.
"The conversion of the EPO - following our complaints - is an important benefit for the health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and the over 115 million Americans directly affected by the smog that flows into their communities," said Schneiderman.
In this case, New York joined California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington and the District of Columbia.
Soil ozone is produced when pollutants from cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive groups of people, and each year contribute to thousands of premature deaths.
Representatives of public health and environmental protection welcomed Pruitt's surprising change of course.
"It is worrying how much pressure it takes to get this sensible step from the person responsible for protecting the air that we are breathing in," said Lori Ann Burd from the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to fight against the ideological crusade of the Trump government to offer ourselves to polluters and their special interests."
Tumlingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hilarius Church
750 years of St. Hilarius Church: On the occasion of the anniversary of the Mountain Church, the old cemetery area in Tumlingen is invited to a serenade on Sunday, July 16, at 4.30 p.m.
Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historic St. Hilarius facility is a popular place to stay.
Visitors to the sixth benefit serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.
The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the place have made Tumlingen's friends and promoters their concern.
Walter Martini emphasizes: "It is a unique village treasure".
In 1267 the St. Hilariucskapelle was first mentioned in the Württemberg document book: Count Hermann von Sulz sold "the mountain with the parish church to Tumlingen and Vogtei" to Magister Eberhard von Horb and to his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver.
According to the text of the document, on the Tumlinger Mountain, besides the former parish church, there was also a ruling court, to which the church or the patronage law belonged and not vice versa.
So people also lived there.
As can be seen from the description of the Upper Office of Freudenstadt of 1858, the "mountain" was the third, the dominant settlement center of the village, next to the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which can be seen today in the village of Tumlingen.
Old maps from the time around 1600 underpin these historical conditions.
Patronate law arose from the early medieval law of the Eigenkirchen.
A master who built, equipped and occupied a church with a pastor remained the owner of this church and could also inherit this church.
This involved the right to use a pastor or to propose a new pastor to the bishop.
There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.
The larger of the two shattered at Christmas 1673.
The newly acquired bell then sounded for the first time in 1692, but had to be delivered later in the Second World War in 1942.
In the 30-year war (1616-1648), the windows were struck and the bell ropes were stolen.
The roof was leaked.
In 1796, French troops camped near the church.
They broke out the pulpits and church chairs and used them as firewood.
The remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.
Until 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius-Friedhof also served as the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.
In 1823 the cemetery was enlarged and the church of Hilarius was demolished.
Only the church tower was abandoned.
In the New Year's Eve of 1834, a storm split the church tower and half collapsed.
To prevent an accident, the tower was cut off.
Only the tower dwarf that still exists today was preserved as a witness to the 750-year-old church history.
Today, Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem from the "Schaffigen Retirennern" as successors of Dieter Dockhorn maintain the Hilarius plant.
As an organizer, the friends and promoters of Tumlingens invite you to the sixth serenade on Sunday, July 16, to the old cemetery to St. Hilariuckapelle.
This is designed by the Combo of Kepler-Gymnasium Freudenstadt and by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.
The final word is spoken by Hartmut Romann.
The programme starts at 4.30 p.m.
Admission is from 3:30 p.m.
To finish the Serenade, a roundabout takes place in front of the cemetery.
"Enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest", the organizers show the fantastic view.
The serenade takes place only in dry weather.
The organizers hope for many supporters to preserve the historic St. Hilarius plant, which is important for Tumlingen and Hörschweiler.
The friends and sponsors of Tumlingen feel particularly committed to home care, as confirmed by Serenade organizer Walter Martini.
Association wants to check approval of wind turbines
"Boisheim fights" sees no legal requirement for the construction and has therefore turned to the Landrat.
The Boisheim Association has asked Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheimer Nette.
It was unlawful.
The association argues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Boisheimer Nette no wind power plants could have been approved at all, since at the time in Viersen there was only a wind power concentration zone at the city border to Schwalmtal.
Within this concentration zone, the construction and operation of wind turbines are in principle possible, but at the same time the concentration zone eliminates the use of wind energy for the rest of the urban area.
Such zones are intended to prevent the "sparing" of the landscape.
Although the city of Viersen had decided a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette a few days earlier by changing the land use plan, the district government of Düsseldorf had not approved it because of a form error.
"Due to the lack of planning requirements, the authorisation decision issued is still illegal and therefore also illegal," said Christoph Erkens, chairman of "Boisheim is fighting back".
Current state of affairs: The City Council has once again decided the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette before the summer break; a permit from the district government is still pending.
Recognising: "This means that the granting of an approval for the construction of wind turbines is prohibited under planning law at this point".
The circle confirms the receipt of the invitation.
"The corresponding letters have been received by the district of Viersen since last week," said one speaker.
The circle takes them for the occasion to re-examine the matter.
However, they are not likely to lead to a halt to the procedure.
With regard to ongoing proceedings at the administrative court, the circle did not want to comment on the content of the argument of the association "Boisheim fights" on Thursday.
The NEW Re, a subsidiary of the NEW, plans to build four 200-metre-high wind turbines on an area on the Boisheimer Nette.
Last year, the company in which the city of Viersen is indirectly involved had signed leases with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of land.
With the construction of the four wind turbines, the electricity demand of around 11 400 households should be covered - which corresponds to about one fifth of the electricity demand of all four households.
The NEW Re wants to invest around 20 million euros.
Last summer, Viersen's City Council gave green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the Linnich wind farm near Aachen as well as participation in a wind power plant in Übach-Palenberg in the district of Heinsberg.
Car and tractor collapse: woman dies in a terrible accident
One terrible traffic accident took place on Friday morning at around 10 a.m. on the L 333 between Niederwallmenach and Bogel (Rhein Lahn-Kreis).
A woman was fatally injured.
Two more people were slightly injured.
The Landesstraße was blocked for hours.
According to police records, a 17-year-old young woman from Bornich drove her car with her 53-year-old mother as an escort to Bogel.
City and Retailers Plan "Home Shopping" Weekend
Bad Langensalzaer and people from the region will rediscover shopping in the city centre in September.
The commercial association and the city administration want to use the weekend on September 8th and 9th to lure the residents to the shopping mall.
As the president of the business association, Christian König, announced, the "Home-Shoppen" weekend is intended to raise customers' awareness of what offers the city has to offer outside the usual supermarket goods.
A market with regional suppliers is therefore planned, similar to the weekly market.
In addition, local companies are to present themselves with their training places.
In addition, the shops of the city centre are to be invited to the "Mitternachts-Shoppen".
The action is not only aimed at residents of the city and the surrounding region.
In preparation are advertising spots on the radio, an Internet video and printed bags pointing to the action weekend, says Christian König.
City administration and commercial association cooperate with the Chamber of Industry and Commerce.
Thus, the commercial association and the city go into another stage of the "Attractive City Centre" project.
These include new offers such as the first "Active Day" at the Brunnenfest with open-sunday, conversations with all traders and hosts to move them to active participation.
Also attractive offers for Saturday and the waiver of parking fees on this day are part of the concept.
In addition, customer potentials should be re-opened or re-opened.
These include spa guests and tourists.
But also many locals would have lost sight of the city centre when shopping.
In the end, everyone would have to contribute to revitalizing the city centre - up to landlords, the businesses of the whole city and clubs.
It was necessary to overcome with a network the lethargy that had partly spread, King had said in the spring.
Birgit Streich, head of the IHK-Center in Mühlhausen, announced that for the first time five Thuringian cities participated in the third "home shopping day" nationwide.
In addition to Bad Langensalza, this is Weimar, Sömmerda, Heiligenstadt and Bleicherode.
The day was to "advertise for the appreciation of local trade and emphasize its importance for the common good of our cities," says String.
The action under the leadership of the IHK and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence his own direct environment with his buying behaviour.
Two dead and several injured after explosion at U.S. school
During construction work there was a gas explosion in the school building.
New people were injured.
In a gas explosion in the U.S. city of Minneapolis, two people were killed and nine more injured, some of them heavy.
According to the fire department, on Wednesday (local time) was still a critically injured person.
A man died when a part of a school building collapsed during the explosion.
A first missing person was later also buried dead.
The dead were employees of the school.
As a cause of accident, the authorities suspected that they were working on a gas pipeline.
During the holiday season, only a few people stayed in the Minnehaha Academy building.
Trump put pressure on Mexico for the payment of the border wall after leaked transcripts of phone calls
Transcripts of telephone calls between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post.
On January 27, Trump called in a telephone call with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to stop saying publicly that he would not pay for a planned border wall.
The U.S. President insulted him because he had publicly denounced the wall. According to reports, he said to him, "You can't tell the press that."
Trump launched his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the USA, and vowed to make Mexico pay for the project.
Transcripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published and revealed a tense exchange.
Mr. Trump told Mr. Turnbull that a trade for the US refugees who emigrated to Australia was "stupid", "meek" and "stupid" and that the existence of trade, which was mediated by the Obama government, would make him look like a "depp" after he had proposed a ban on the relocation of refugees to the United States.
Mr. Trump ended the call after he said to Mr. Turnbull, "this is the most unpleasant call for the whole day."
Moore's Ford Massacre: Activists re-introduce racist lynchact as a call for justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury drove through a group of spectators in rural Monroe, Georgia, bumping into Moore's Ford Bridge.
Before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver who could reach the bridge, a group of white men came out with guns to block his way.
The leader of the mob - a middle-aged man in a needle stripe suit - took a long train at his cigar and looked at the windshield.
Inside, the inmates floated in fear.
"We want this n-- r Roger!" the man roared.
"Get him out of the car!"
Crying shattered the silence when a young black man was torn from the passenger seat.
Fortunately, this terrible scene, which was played on July 22nd, is just a replica.
But when a sling is thrown around the neck of "Roger", almost everyone in the audience was very sighing.
Since 2005, civil rights activists have returned to Moore's Ford Bridge to imitate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom as well as George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lynched by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
No one was ever charged with murder.
"It's really unbelievable that no one person has been arrested in all these years - although we see them in our communities, even though we know who they are," said Tyrone Brooks, who helps with the organization of reproduction.
"It's a dirty spot on a story, but it's a burden to our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old former congressman of the state of Georgia and a lifelong civil rights activist.
For him, the reproduction serves as a dramatic call for action and represents an annual reminder of the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected.
"We want law enforcement, we want the end, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we need justice," he said.
"We cannot reach healing and reconciliation until we receive justice."
A medical examiner lays a bedclothe over the corpse of one of the victims of the Moore Ford Lynchen on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI files received from NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected in the lynching process.
But no one was ever charged.
Although the suspects have been on the loose for decades, civil rights activists say that the dual motivation for the Lynch actions throughout the city was always known: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a decision of the Supreme Court enabled the black citizens in Georgia to vote for the first time in the summer campaign.
About the same time as the election, according to the FBI, the black farmkeeper Roger Malcom stabbed a white landowner, Barnett Hester, during a fight - allegedly because of a woman.
Brooks said the rumor in the city was that Hester slept with Malcom's wife Dorothy and that the baby she was carrying was not from her husband.
On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid $600 to free Malcom from prison, according to the FBI.
He was accompanied to prison by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
But when they got away from prison and approached Moore's Ford Bridge, a lynch mob surrounded the car.
"As it turns out, it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the murders," concludes an FBI report.
"It is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between the state and local law enforcement that was not only involved in the murders, removed evidence and obscured the identity of witnesses."
Brooks puts it even more concisely.
"It was an electoral matter," he said.
"They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community: "If you register and if you vote, this will happen to you."
For almost a decade, Cassandra Greene has led the annual reproduction of the Moore Ford Bridge Lynch murder.
Its presentation is vivid, catchy and is founded in a kind of deep racism, many of which want to believe that it no longer exists in America.
It's hard to watch, and even harder to look away, but Greene said that's the point.
"We don't want to talk about the lynching, because we are then confronted with its uglyness in all of us," she said.
"But I can't build a relationship with you if you don't want to listen to me or if you don't want to hear what I've been through."
The samples for this year's production began in June, and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen whites and the rest blacks - pushed into a room and listened when Greene started a well-recorded overview of the piece.
Wade Marbaugh is Greene's co-director.
He has been playing the role of the chief clan member for years, but he said the role will never be easier.
"I feel dirty because I'm not like that," said Marbaugh.
"But I think it's very important to keep this story alive because we don't want to return to these times."
On the other side of the room the actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, tried their lines.
The play begins with Malcom, who screams at Hester and harasses him, angry that he slept with his wife Dorothy.
"I said, n--he, get away from my property!"
Rascona returns the fire.
There's a break.
And then everyone (at least all black actors) breaks out in laughter.
Greene laughs the loudest.
"What?" asked Rascona.
He's alarmed and confused.
Was I too hard?
"No," said Greene, still shimmering.
"I just don't think white people would have said 'n--he'."
"But," one of the other black actors joked.
"You just have to hit the hard 'R.'."
And right there the energy shifts in space, a feeling of companionship replaces discomfort.
Everyone is busy getting this right, not only because of the game, but also because of the memory of the four killed people.
The scene starts again.
This time, when Rascona says the N-word, he says it sharply and emphatically.
Absolutely no one laughs.
This repetition ends violently and quickly.
There are screams, shots, and then silence.
A woman, dressed in a mourning dress, stands over the bodies of the actors and performs Billie Holiday's grieving Lobrede "Strange Fruit".
Your voice breaks with every second word.
About a hundred meters behind it, a group of about four dozen spectators wipes out sweat and tears.
The audience is almost evenly divided between black and white.
A couple have come from Ithaca, New York, to see the performance, many just come down the street.
They have all experienced almost eight hours of Georgia's depressing moisture when Brooks leads them on a pilgrimage to the tombs of Malcoms and Dorseys.
Up to this point, the murders have remained an anecdote, but now, when you stand on the same land where the Lynch murder took place, the air feels spooky.
When the last notes of the song stop, Greene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the dead body name.
Children squat on their heads, register the fake blood and the silent bodies and whisper to each other.
"They're not really dead," murmurs a little boy, as if he wanted to remember it.
After a few minutes, Greene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it's over.
The actors throw away the lynch rope and wipe away their tears.
Bradshaw embraces Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the clan member.
Nick Rascona embraces two of his fellow players and then tears down in her arms, finally breaking through the emotional burden of the performance.
"It's okay," whispers one of the women.
"We know this isn't in your heart.
You did this for a reason."
Later, the audience meets the actors for dinner.
At a table, a white couple from Atlanta chattered about the reproduction with a black couple they just met.
Denise Duplinski struggled to find words that left the feeling of the performance.
"It's hard to hear these horrible words and deeds... from people who look like you and who do it because they look like you," she said.
"What it really does to me makes me think that the lynching is still going on," she added, "now it's just called police shooting."
In the same room, Tyrone keeps Brook's farm at his table, eats and reminds of civil rights.
He said he's already started planning the performance next year.
"The imitation is in some way inspiring, because it describes the horror of what we have endured, but it is also a moment of learning," he said.
"It is true that if we do not learn anything from it, it can happen again.
Whoever does not study his own story, who does not know his own story, is doomed to repeat it."
"Götterdämmerung" reconciled the Wagnerians in Bayreuth
In the fourth part of Richard Wagner's monumental work, director Frank Castorf is also focusing on a colourful, frivolous production in front of a gigantic six-story setting.
The turnout stage (designed by Aleksandar Denic) shows either a skewed street corner, including the remains of the wall and Donnerbude in Berlin, a "Plaste and Elaste" logo from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange.
Before that, an open Mercedes-Oldtimer, in which the Rhine daughters pose as rocker girls, or alternatively an Isetta, will park.
Stacked oil barrels remind of Castorf's motto - money, power and greed - that moves through his "ring" production.
The three Rhine daughters - sung by Stephanie Houtzeel, Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner - harmonize wonderfully as in the "Rheingold".
Kess seduces Siegfried (Stefan Vinke), tearing a body into the trunk in Hollywood manner and giving the Krawallo-Clique.
Stephen Milling sings the gorgeous ugly Hagen that surrounds the aura of a heavyweight boxer.
Brutally the scene when he beats Siegfried.
Later, Gunther (Markus Oak) has to believe in it.
The audience thanks the ensemble with strong applause.
Foster, Milling, Vinke and conductor Janowski are celebrated in a stormy way, who modestly bows his hands to the Merkel-Raute.
There is great applause for the festival orchestra, which is shown for the first time on stage - in view of the great heat again in casual clothing.
The performance of Frank Castorf and his directorial team had been eagerly anticipated.
In 2013, if he had yet to experience a valid pipe concert, there were five years later great cheers in which the single "Buh" called went down.
Festival director Katharina Wagner should have enjoyed it.
"One notices that the audience has grown together with the "ring" in some way," she said shortly before the performance of the dpa.
The audience had not only made a form of peace with Castorf, but it had also grown an understanding of his view.
I draw a positive summary.
Max Menge works as a volunteer
They work in several places in their volunteer year.
Where else?
Quantity: Usually in Steinfurt in the furniture market, once a week I help out here in Greven in the furniture bridge.
And I've been working at school all day.
How are your experiences with this?
Quantity: It is a beautiful, wide spectrum that I see here.
I have to deal with different people, with young people, with refugees, with young adults.
You're now 26 years old, so you're a late-call volunteer.
How's that?
Quantity: I've done Abitur.
And then a construction engineering study, let's say, successfully terminated.
I realized for myself that it's the wrong thing for me and I want to do something else, work with people.
And then I asked myself, what are you doing?
Make a social year, there is an insight, there you can see how it is on the ground, in the focus maybe also, really.
And was it so?
Quantity: I have collected great impressions.
I'm going to start my social studies in the winter semester.
I will study dual, probably do a social worker training at the youth office Herne and study at Hamm University of Applied Sciences.
Is it not unusual to have several different places of work during voluntary service?
Quantity: Yes, it is very variable.
I guess it always depends where you're doing your FSJ.
You can do it from the old age home to youth work - in all possible facets of social work.
It was very varied for me.
I was also part of the OGS, i.e. in the afternoon care.
For me, that was exactly what irritated me.
I could see my own strengths and see how it really goes.
Unlike in architectural engineering?
Quantity: Of course, this is not about calculating statics.
You always have other people shaped their heads, each with a completely different story behind it.
Whether a refugee, whether a youth who has been taken out of the family, must always address it individually.
Very interesting.
And you didn't have any fear of contact?
Lot: I'm not the guy for that.
It's an area that gives you a lot.
A lot of love, a lot of kindness.
There are also negative moments, but that's how life is.
Pearson shortens 3,000 more jobs and shortens the dividend to revive the business
On Friday, the British educational group Pearson said that it would cut down another 3,000 jobs and cut its interim dividend by 72 percent, as another restructuring programme was launched to overcome the pressure facing the company.
The job losses announced by Director General John Fallon for the most part at the end of 2018 and early 2019 are in addition to his previous restructuring, which already lost 4,000 jobs.
In May, Pearson announced a cost reduction plan of another £300 million (394 million) in a third cost reduction programme to revitalise a business that was taken by the rapid move to digital learning.
The company, which sold its stake in Penguin Random House to partner Bertelsmann last month, said that the outlook for the financial year was unchanged after it increased from 1 percent to 2.05 billion pounds in the first half of the year.
Convoi attack of Kabul: Nato soldier killed in suicide attack
A suicide bomber has attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital Kabul, killed a NATO soldier and injured several others, say officials.
Five soldiers and an interpreter had been injured, a statement from NATO was communicated.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians died in the incident in the district of Qarabagh.
The bombing is the last act of violence that Afghanistan has committed this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Herat.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul.
In a statement by NATO, the explosion occurred on Thursday evening when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by a "improvised explosive carried by persons".
The statement states that all injured persons are in a stable condition and are treated in the US military hospital at Bagram Airport.
Correspondents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so-called Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh is a great concern for the NATO troops in the nearby Bagram.
According to the United Nations, there were at least 1,662 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, of which about 20 % were in the capital.
At the end of July, a suicide bomb killed at least 30 people in a predominantly Shiite district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they had carried out this attack.
On May 31st, a massive bombing in the center of the city killed more than 150 people with the most deadly militant attack of the country, since the US-led forces in 2001 displaced the Taliban from power.
Violence underlines the precarious security situation in Afghanistan, as U.S. President Donald Trump is considering increasing the number of U.S. troops supporting the military and police in the country.
Correspondents say that the suicide attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government, its politics and, in particular, the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
EPO reverses decision to delay the smog rule after actions
The U.S. Environmental Protection Authority has suspended a decision to delay the regulation of the Obama government, which obliges States to contain smog-causing emissions. This took place one day after 15 states sued the Agency for the step.
The EPO announced the decision to advance the so-called "Ozone Regulations 2015" late on Wednesday and said it would show the Agency's obligation to cooperate with States.
"We believe in the dialogue with and in that we respond to our state partners," said EPO Chief Scott Pruitt in a statement.
In June, Pruitt announced the intention of the EPO to delay the ozone determinations – in which a part of the country is to measure emissions of pollutants in order to determine where cuts have to be made to comply with stricter air quality standards – by one year until October 2018.
A group of 15 mostly democratic states, together with the Colombian district, filed a complaint on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal.
The government of President Donald Trump has tried to drive back a wide range of environmental requirements imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda to boost economic growth according to Trump.
However, efforts have triggered the setback of democrats and nature conservation groups who are concerned about the impact of greater emissions on public health.
The EPO website says that breathing air that contains ozone can "reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms", such as asthma.
Municipal Council wants common space
In the end, the decision was clear: In two votes against, the City Council of Fluorn-Winzeln decides to set up a common area in the future old-age housing system.
Before the discussion, there is an important information: the purchase contract for the missing part of the property has been signed, reports Mayor Bernhard Tjaden.
Although it will take time for the area of the church to be in municipal ownership until now, there is no longer any planning obstacle for the project to be voted on by a private investor.
There is a debate on a Community area.
One of the two investors still in the boat has offered to meet the community.
On the ground floor he would provide a living area - about 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with at least 70 square meters of space for a special price.
The administration and the majority of the municipal council suggest that such a common space should be provided not only as a meeting place for the residents of senior housing, but openly into the community.
As an example, the word from the "Strickcafé" made the round.
The decision already taken last autumn by the provision of appropriations for the current budget will be watered down by means of funding.
The building is located in the refurbishment area.
The establishment of a Community area, reports Tjaden, would be eligible with 60 per cent of 30 per cent.
The proposal for a decision, in order to signal to the investor that he does not want to be thrown between his legs in this respect, provides for the finding that both saddles - which are based on the environment - and pult roof - would be possible, which reduces the height of the stairs and makes the construction more economical.
Needless to say, not only does Wilfried Sohmer mean this addition.
If it helps, it happens unanimously to the body.
It's not that simple with the common space.
Daniela Ruf refers to the many own buildings with which you don't get too far, for which one now leans out of the window at the common room, she says: "I'm having a hard time with it".
Yvonne Staiger is absolutely in favour of the Community area - but absolutely against municipal participation.
It sees behind it a hidden subsidy to already wealthy or even foreign investors.
This is not the case, because with the acquisition of the land one does not give a grant, but gets a real, in case of doubt marketable counterpart, the opposite is the case.
Staiger's request to split up the proposal for a decision is supported by three.
Thus, two votes against remain in the original programme, which Stefan Haller summarizes: "If we take the decision this way, we will take a huge step towards closing a huge gap in our infrastructure".
Collision by car: cyclists are thrown on the road
On the road crossing, an 82-year-old cyclist in Garath was captured by a car on Wednesday and severely injured.
As the police reported, the 82-year-old Langenfelder had been traveling on his bicycle on the bike path of the Black Road from the direction of Hilden at 12.20.
The senior wanted to cross the road at the height of the street Am Buchholzer Busch.
A car driver in the same direction gave him priority.
When the Langenfelder went on the road, he obviously did not pay attention to the counter-traffic.
He collided with a car driving a 66-year-old Hildener.
The man was thrown into the street.
He suffered serious injuries and was taken to a hospital by a rescue car.
FC Bayern Munich must renounce David Alaba and Thiago at the Supercup against Borussia Dortmund
The Supercup takes place without him: David Alaba must have the game played against Dortmund.
With personal care, FC Bayern travels to Dortmund for the first mandatory game of the new season.
Seven pros are missing the title defender in the Supercup against the Cup winner.
The personal services of the German football record champion Bayern Munich are getting bigger and bigger before the Supercup on Saturday (20.30 p.m./ZDF and Eurosport) at Pokalsieger Borussia Dortmund.
Trainer Carlo Ancelotti must also refrain from David Alaba in duell with the BVB.
The Italian confirmed this on Friday.
In addition, the miners Manuel Neuer, James, Thiago, Jerome Boateng, Arjen Robben and Juan Bernat are missing.
Ancelotti has been responsible for the five defeats in the past six test games and for the lack of balance in his team game.
"We know that we are not in the best physical condition," said Ancelotti, adding: "The most important point is the balance in the team.
It wasn't good at last."
However, the 58-year-old believes in an increase in performance in the first official compulsory game of the season.
"Football is also tactics, strategy, personality and motivation.
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities.
The team is ready.
We want to play intelligently," said Ancelotti, who expects a "difficult, intense game".
The duel of the two German football heavyweights pulls the fans into their spell.
The game is sold out with 81,360 spectators, the German Football League (DFL) announced on Friday.
Hike in the resin from star to star
In the resin, the first "star path" is to be created nationwide.
The association is designed by St. Andreasberg.
There is a planet trail in Göttingen - since 2003.
A "star path" meets the information needs of many resin visitors, it said.
He combines nature, science, movement and sporting performance.
Members want to set up tables along the planned route and inform about stars and constellations.
In a first phase until 2018, the association plans "well-reachable installations in five to six locations" in the upper resin.
St. Andreasberg, Braunlage, Hohegeiß and Sieber would be in question.
The information on the panels is to be supplemented via the Internet.
Therefore, a good mobile network reception plays a role in the location selection.
Accessibility is also a criterion.
Later, the Star Path train is to be extended by train.
"On the Star Path, the viewers learn a lot about the physics of the individual stars, for example," the association explained.
In addition, they learned why stars have different colors or why one star shines more brightly than another, although it is much farther away.
It will also be conveyed which constellation is in which a selected star is located and when it is best to see it.
Since 2014, the association has been operating the highest-ranking observatory in Northern Germany in the mountain town of St. Andreasberg.
According to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation, the site in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six darkest regions in Germany.
From there the Milky Way and even the Andromeda-Galaxie are often clearly visible with the naked eye.
Since 2003 there has been something similar in the university city at the initiative of the funding association Planetarium Göttingen, similar to the planned Star Wars – the Planetary Way.
Starting in front of Gebhard's Hotel in the Goetheallee, which forms the interior of our solar system, the planetary trail leads up to the Hainberg and the observatory - as well as an "external" location in Diemarden (Gemeinde Sameen) with the planet Sedna.
The stelaes with the individual planets - including the Pluto at the end point, which was degraded to the dwarf planet - are precisely positioned at a distance and scale from one to two billion.
The earth shrinks to a sphere of 6.5 millimeters in diameter, while at least the exact sun standing 75 meters away measures 70 centimeters.
The entire distance of the planetary path is well over four kilometres.
While the light from the sun to the pluto takes about eight hours, pedestrians need a good hour to the stele with pluto.
So pedestrians are faster than the light in space.
The march to the next fix star, however, would take another half year.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomaenko meet for the first time, discuss a possible showdown
Vasyl Lomaenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be in a collision course to stage the most exciting boxing campaign in the near future under 147 pounds, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms in ESPN offices in Los Angeles, until Garcia, the unbeaten World Boxing Council Lightweight Championship, went down the hall to welcome Lomaenko, the World Boxing Organization Super-Federal Weight Championship.
After Garcia's victory by unanimous decision on the former four-division world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday at Showtime, both fighters are members of the top five pounds-for-pound list.
Garcia stretched out her right hand and said, "How are you, Champion?
I wish you luck."
Lomachenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday evening at 7 pm on ESPN.
When the pair posed for photos, Lomachenko manager Egis Klimas noted that a possible showdown between the fighters would be the "perfect order of magnitude".
"I'm a former spring weight," Garcia recalled.
"I went up for Broner [to 140 pounds], but I'm not that big.
I'm small for 140.
I want to get down to weight.
And he has to move on lightweight [135 pounds] and then we fight.
That's what the fans want.
Let's give it to them."
Lomaenko agreed.
"Boxes need this fight."
Climates asked whether it should be on pay-per-view, part of a strategy that Lomachenko has to fight with a 135-pound debut this year to make a date next summer with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts) that also has an interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell after their lightweight-title fight in the forum on September 23.
"This fight could take place in pay-per-view mode because all fans asked for it," said Garcia and later expressed themselves openly to fight on the network that offers the best financial package.
We're the best.
No other name can generate this kind of attention.
Whenever they are ready ... "
Garcia said he appreciates Lomaenko as "a huge fighter", and he might participate in his Saturday fight.
But Lomaakenko stopped at the generous praise for Garcia and said that he thought he saw the three-fight champion from Riverside "very slow, I'm sorry Mikey ... you wanted the co-off."
Garcia said the focus is to show the impact force, then box.
Both said they could feel the momentum that built up for their own struggle.
"This is the fight that needs to be carried out.
No other battle creates so much attention and enthusiasm.
I am more than happy to work on it," said Garcia.
Lomaenko said, "I've been waiting for the top fighters, and that's Mikey.
It will be a great fight."
Four injured by tyre spacer
In the event of an accident on the A7, four people were partially injured on Thursday afternoon.
According to initial information, the driver of an Opel Zafira lost control of his vehicle at 4.30 a.m. just before the connection point.
The car hurled to the right into the bush, where he crossed and then lay on the roof in the green strip.
The four inmates - two adults and two children - were seriously injured in the accident.
During the first service of the injured by the rescue service, the A7 was blocked towards the north for about an hour, then the traffic on the left lane could be passed by the accident site.
Fortunas Hoffmann: "Third chain works better"
Andre Hoffmann hopes after 2:2 for the start of the season against Braunschweig that the optimization of the defense formation in Aue points.
Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the first season game, with the result that the two opponents were not at 2:2 against Braunschweig.
"These were two opponents too much, and we need to be even more careful in Aue," says Fortuna Düsseldorf's defense player.
In the Erzgebirge, the trio chain should also be further optimised.
And a gate after a free throw doesn't want to catch the Fortunes either.
"For the future, it will be so that no one stands on the line next to Michael (Rensing)."
Hoffmann is convinced that his team will do better in the preparation of the three-chain than in the four-chain.
"I still don't know how we're going to act in Aue," says his coach Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is sure of his business, "because we have players who can build well in the three-chain on the half positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann," Hoffmann said.
"Constraint is, but that we are even better harmonised and we don't make so many playwrights in the construction."
Of course Hoffmann also drives to Aue to win the game.
"But whether you can talk about a failed start after a decision is made, you don't know.
The performance could be okay," Hoffmann said.
"But if we stand there on Sunday with four points and can focus on the trophy, we will certainly be able to talk about a regular start to the season."
His coach didn't want to know about that.
"I only judge the start of the season after six to eight days of play," said Friedhelm Funkel, who does not want to speak of an advantage to Aue, just because the game of Saxony in Heidenheim had to be interrupted prematurely because of a bad weather.
"Now they can almost start the season with a home game," said Funkel and Hoffmann, thinking that the players from Aue might even be a bit fresher because they don't have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against a favorite ascent in the bones.
"But they don't know as much as 100 percent where they are at the moment," says the internal defender of Fortuna.
Although the guests from the Rhineland as an easy favourite on Sunday go to the meeting in the finally (almost) finished stadium of Aue.
"The fact that we are sweeping them away, just because we have the right to be among the first six, is nonsense," says Funkel, whose balance is quite positive in only one defeat against aue from nine games.
"There is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga that you have to beat from the beginning," explains Fortuna's chief coach.
"To make such a statement would be arrogant and superlative."
And so Funkel doesn't want to experience his players on Sunday.
New results of Swedish Asylum Age Assessment Tests published
The recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden, which have undergone a new method of medical assessment of their age, show that more than 80 percent of those tested are older than 18 years old. But not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish Forensic Medicine Authority (Forensic Medicine Agency) started conducting the tests last year.
They should make the assessment of the age more accurate during the asylum procedure after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsket) was criticised for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were underage.
To date, Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 cases to be tested and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from mid-March to 31 July 2017.
Eighty per cent (2002) were assessed as 18 or older, while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was "possibly 18 years of age or older".
In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person is "possibly under 18 years of age".
The tests are carried out only in cases where the age of the person is called into question.
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results have been consistent in recent months.
"We don't see a big difference in the statistics of recent months, the numbers are quite constant," he said in The Local magazine.
The high proportion of cases in which the person was judged to be more than 18 years old does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker lied about his age.
In May, the Agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there were 442 cases that "suggest that the person surveyed was 18 years of age or older".
When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the 581 published results, she found that in 243 of these cases the person had openly said that she was 18 years old this year.
The method of medical age assessment, in which x-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI uptake of knee joints, which are then analysed by dentists and radiologists, has also been criticised in some areas.
A skeptic is Endocrinologist Claude Marcus of Karolinska Institute, whose work includes the assessment of the biological maturity of humans to see if they passed through puberty sooner or later than usual.
"I had reason to think about it, and I don't think the type of measurement should be used.
To judge biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't say for sure, we shouldn't do as if we could," he said the newspaper Metro.
Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, however, defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, you can say that the risk of misjudging a child as an adult is low.
The greatest risk is if the person is just under 18, in this case this is about 10 percent."
Full in the Plan
The work on the three bridges of Landstraße 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is progressing well.
On Wednesday, a seven-ton concrete section was installed at the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach.
"We're very good at the time, it's going great," says Reinhold Light, head of construction at the Department of Roads and Transport at the government bureau of Freiburg.
In April, the works started at the same time on all three necessary bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach.
Construction is planned for October and it is easy to ensure that the schedule is adhered to.
The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads over the Trombach.
It is a concrete arch with red coloured sandstone and has a total length of 4.80 meters.
It was built in 1900.
Like the other two bridges, it has now entered the years.
In order to ensure stability and road safety, the three buildings are now thoroughly refurbished.
The other two bridges lead over the Lauterbach.
They are made of red coloured sandstone.
Both were built in 1939 and are twelve, or 10.60 meters long.
The bridge at the entrance to the town of Lauterbach has now received on Wednesday morning on the north side a 1.30 m wide and seven tons heavy so-called bridge cap.
This is an edge fastening, which is also used as an operating route.
A 2.20-metre-wide bridge cap is to be used on the southern part of the bridge on Friday.
Then the pedestrian road should follow.
The special thing is that these are finished parts, a patent of the Schramberger company Dizwo.
The other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps.
Special sensation of fingertips has required the laying of wires through the construction in Lauterbach.
Because there is also a fiber optic cable, to which many companies are connected.
The residents were informed of the project in advance of the work by handsets.
In addition, fish and cancer had to be fished.
For the bridges between the Bauhof building and the collectible in the direction of Schramberg, the traffic is regulated by a traffic light.
For construction work on the bridge at the Lauterbach entrance, the road is fully blocked in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels "Tannenhof" and "Sieben Linden".
The total cost of the three bridge renovations is EUR 700 000.
The whole thing is financed by the country.
AfD in Gerolstein: Colorful protest at German potato salad
It does not happen so often that parties draw on one strand, but when it comes to the alternative for Germany (AfD), it comes together, which is otherwise difficult to put under one hat.
The parties represented in the district day Vulkaneifel (CDU, SPD, Grüne, FDP, FWG, Left) are part of a broad alliance that shows peaceful flag on this day because the AfD invites to the poster "great campaign act" in the Gerolstein Stadthalle Rondell.
And well-known names are starting - like Alice Weidel, who together with Alexander Gauland is the top duo for the Bundestag election on September 24th, and the Deputy Federal Chairman Beatrix of Storch.
But those who are already on site hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the AfD students, but demonstrate.
The motto "The Eifel remains colorful".
Originally, the city picnic was planned under the motto "All at one table" on the well square, but now takes place in the parking lot below the Rondell - and thus directly in front of those who come to the AfD event in the city hall.
It's a colorful picture.
And what Christa Karoli, chairman of the Forums A world and one of the key organizers, is really happy: "Great how many people have come together here."
There is music and plenty of food, including a "German potato salad, which the AfD could eat easily," says the woman who brought it.
The police have ordered many officials to Gerolstein, she shows presence above all at the train station, which is only a few meters away from the venues.
How did the AfD actually get to Gerolstein?
Mario Hompes reports from the AfD Vulkaneifel that he has sought such an event and received the award.
The 45-year-old from Gönersdorf had initially asked for a parking space in Daun, but there was a cancellation, because due to the already built Laurentiuskirmes there were not enough parking spaces.
So now the Rondell, Hompes is pleased that "we can have such a nice event here".
Looking at the event on the Rondell foreplatz, he says: "This is the good right of the people, the main thing, it remains peaceful".
That's also true: around 8:00 p.m., a band at the Rondellvorplatz provides entertainment, in the Stadthalle several speakers, including the Rhineland-Palatinate AfD chairman Uwe Junge.
In the hall there are about 200 listeners waiting for the top candidate for the Bundestag election, Alice Weidel, and the vice-chairman Beatrix von Storch to give their speeches.
The police presence is unchanged, but so far the officials had a quiet evening.
The AfD event takes a little more than an hour, the guests in the front square have a longer breath, but also there is soon after 21 o'clock ready to clean up.
The police can pull off - no special incidents.
Trombone meets trumpet
An audience with the Wolfach tromboneist Frederic Belli will be held in the series Haslacher Monastery Concerts tomorrow, Sunday, at 8 pm in the monastery church.
Together with the Bulgarian trumpeter Miroslav Petkov he gives a concert under the motto "Black Sea meets Black Forest", or "Balkanfolklore" meets a classic German education with roots in brass music.
Both soloists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have solo positions in European topnorchesters.
Petkov is a solo drummer at the renowned Concertgebouw Orchestra Amsterdam and Frederic Belli is a soloist of the SWR Symphony Orchestra.
Both combine the desire not only to cross the boundaries of their instruments but also to merge the boundaries of the various genres.
This is how Johann Sebastian Bach sounds at the two as in a new costume, Daniel Schnyder's "World Music" combines with Bulgarian folklore, and in the play "Exchange Suite" by Jazzecho Award winner Nils Wogram, classics, jazz and free play mix into a fascinating piece of art.
This core part of the programme was only premiered this spring with huge success in Freiburg.
The renowned composer Nils Wogram wrote it especially for the two musicians and more: The Haslacher Monastery Church with its special acoustics is deliberately included in the concert.
Kristen Stewart talks about her bisexuality
"Some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives.
But I want to try everything," says Kristen Stewart very openly about her bisexuality.
"When I bite in grilled cheese, I think, 'Oh that was cool, what's next?'"
The most famous relationship of the Hollywood star was with her "Twilight" colleague Robert Pattinson, who eventually broke up bitterly.
Despite all this, the brunette actress assures the "Harper's Bazaar" magazine: "I was seriously in love with everyone I dated.
Or do you think I would have played it?"
After her separation, Kristen admitted that she was bisexual: "I have always lived dualism and seriously believed in it.
So it has never confused me or hindered me.
I just never liked not to be taken seriously."
In particular, she suffered from it according to "Bang Showbiz" but in school when she preferred to dress like a bub: "Not all girls are typical girls.
That really hurt me.
When I was eleven, the kids told me I'd look like a bub.
I felt really attacked, scared and ashamed.
Now I look back and think to myself, 'Mother, be proud of you!'."
Especially to the public, they don't like to explain their love life: "People expect you to behave in a certain way and that annoys me.
And maybe some people call me ungrateful, but I don't like to have to justify myself in front of the public."
The Governor of West Virginia announces that he will change the party
The Democratic Governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced at a rally with President Trump that he would change the party.
Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have left me," said Governor Justice.
"Today I will tell you with many prayers and many thoughts ... today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia that I can no longer help you when I am a democratic governor."
The rally broke out in jubilation.
"Tomorrow I will change my registration to the Republicans," Justice added.
"As a coach, I'd say it's time to play another game."
Mr. Trump promised before a big announcement at the West Virginia rally.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia with 42 points, and Justice did not approve the democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, which according to Forbes is the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states and has inherited coal from his father.
It's worth about $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee issued a statement on Thursday evening saying: "The change of party by Governor Justice is another blow to a Democratic party that would rather hinder us than work to make our country great again."
"With only 15 governors and the control of the least legislative bodies in history, the announcement by Governor Justice is only the last rejection of a party that is from top to bottom without leadership and is unable to find a positive, united message," said RNC president Ronna McDaniel in a statement to CBS News.
Coe praises "honest" Russian excuse for doping scandal
The world leader of athletics, Sebastian Coe, praised on Thursday what he described as an obvious excuse from Russia as a doping scandal, but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be reintroduced into sport.
During the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World Athletics Championships, Russia's athletics chief Dmitry Shylachtin said that the banishment of his country was correct and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said he was sorry for "all athletes who were caught away in competitions gold and silver medals".
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted in favour of maintaining the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) had found evidence of State-funded doping in Russia.
"I thought it was a very open answer today, a very honest presentation," said IAAF President Coe to the reporters.
"The entire Council and the entire Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation recognized in itself that it had experienced some quite hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation was redesigned."
Coe said he was also "enjoyed" that Russia accepted the criteria for its reintroduction.
"I think it was a very constructive day, and I think that progress has been made, but Congress supports the Task Force's recommendations that this is not the time to reinstate Russia," said Coe.
"We have to do everything we can to normalize this situation in the next few months.
The guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the corrupt system," he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes will become neutral players in the athletics world championships, which begin on Friday in London, following the strict IAAF criteria.
The head of the IAAF Task Force, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia still had to meet some of the criteria for resetting.
Drug testing was still insufficient and prohibited trainers were still free to work, he said reporters in London after a lecture at the IAAF Council.
Sacrifice for fallen soldiers in Mali
At a mourning celebration in the North Hessian Fritzlar, about 1,000 people thought of the two soldiers killed in a helicopter crash in Mali.
The ceremony took place on Thursday in the Domstadt under high security conditions.
On the still unexplained cause of the crash, Secretary of Defense Ursula of the Leyen (CDU) said nothing.
However, she called the two deceased pilots "the masters of her profession".
"We bow to this highest sacrifice they have made on behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany," she explained.
The 33-year-old Major and 47-year-old North Hesse Chief of Staff had died in West Africa on Wednesday a week ago.
Her coffins were transferred to Germany and taken to the Fritzlar Cathedral of Saint Peter on Thursday accompanied by a guard of the Bundeswehr.
At noon, only the members of the church said goodbye.
Afterwards, the funeral began in the circle of the family, close friends, representatives of the Bundeswehr as well as politics.
Among them were Hessen's Prime Minister Volker Bouffier (CDU) and the general inspector of the Bundeswehr Volker Wieker.
Grieve guests laid down roses, the relatives stood arm in arm on the särgen.
In front of the church, Fritzlarer and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas.
The defense minister of the Leyen called the dead soldiers "highly decorated" and used.
The Chief of Staff had built up the operations of the Tiger fighter helicopter in Fritzlar and had been one of the first six Tiger pilots of his regiment.
Volker Bauersachs, commander of the regiment, to which the soldiers belong, also said: "If this crew could not prevent the crash, then no one would have been able to do so."
Doubts about the UN mission in Mali did not show the Leyen minister that the use was dangerous.
But he was also of great importance "for a country from which we are separated by only two states," she said.
After the funeral, the sarcasms were taken out of the cathedral.
When and where they are buried, the Bundeswehr did not provide any information.
Prince Henrik doesn't want a grave next to his wife.
The man of the Danish queen Margrethe (77), Prince Henrik (83), does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death.
This was announced by the Royal House on Thursday.
Traditionally, the Danish royal couple are buried in the cathedral church of Roskilde.
The sculptor Bjørn Nørgaard already produced a sarcophagus for the two.
The Queen agreed to her husband's decision, as further stated in the communication.
Where Prince Henrik is buried is still unclear.
But he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland.
Prince Henrik had never made a big deal out of not being happy with his title.
After the accession of his wife Margrethe in 1972, he would have liked to become king.
In 2016, he retired, leaving the title "Prinzgemahl".
Since Henrik had not received the title and function he wanted in Denmark, he did not consider himself equivalent to his wife - even after death, said Lene Balleby, chief speaker of the Danish royal house.
Where the last rest place of the 83-year-old will be finally, it is still unclear.
However, he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland, but in Denmark.
He likes the country he's worked for in the last 50 years.
Born Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, son of a French noble family, had met Margrethe in London in 1965.
He worked on the Thames in the French Embassy.
During his later wife the people's expressions of sympathy always flew in, Prince Henrik had a difficult standing in his nearly 50-year reign with the Danes.
In an autobiography Henrik said about the first years in Denmark: "A few months after my arrival everything I did was criticized.
My Danish was waving, I preferred wine instead of beer, silk stockings instead of knitted socks, Citroën instead of Volvo, tennis instead of football.
Even for the Gauloises, which I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco and who here had the reputation of being the brand of socio-critical intellectuals, I could not hope for forgiveness.
I was different.
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not to be ashamed.
That was just two mistakes!"
Prime Minister Weil wants quick re-election
CDU and FDP before a possible majority in Lower Saxony
Niedersachsen's Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) is after the loss of the red-green government majority for a rapid re-election of the Landtag, but he does not want to resign.
Because on Friday, we voted in favour of the dissolution of Parliament.
Previously, the surprising withdrawal of a Green MEP from her parliamentary group in Lower Saxony had plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the official election date, the red-green coalition in Hanover lost its narrow one-vote majority in Parliament to the opposition from CDU and FDP.
The former Green MEP Elke Twesten founded her step with the non-nomination for the 2018 election in her constituency in Rotenburg (Wümme).
"I see my political future in the CDU," she said on Friday in Hanover.
The CDU Group leader, Björn Thumler, wants to recommend that his group accept them.
Thus, the CDU and FDP had 69 seats in the Dutch Landtag, SPD and Green 68 seats.
So far, the relationship has been reversed.
The new Landtag will be regularly elected on 14 January next year.
Thumler said that the red-green state government now had to decide whether it could continue to rule in this situation without a majority.
Stephan Weil, however, considers it essential that the Landtag decide its self-resolution as quickly as possible.
The CDU Group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday.
The Constitution also provides for the Landtag to withdraw confidence from the Prime Minister and to elect a successor.
"Our Constitution offers several options.
These possibilities need to be assessed in a clean legal manner," said Thumler.
"You will be able to discuss all the questions in peace when they have been legally tested."
Thumler called Twesten's step "but a bit curious".
The politician herself stressed: "I am not a traitor.
I feel very good".
She was known as a follower of Black-Green.
The Greens called on the abject MEPs to return their country's mandate.
"We assume, of course, that she will return her Landtag mandate, which she has received via the Green Country List, with immediate effect," said the country presidents Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner.
The group chairmen of the Green Anja Piel said: "We regret the decision of Elke Twesten exceedingly."
She decided deliberately not to hold a debate in the group.
"Even against the background that there were no substantive differences, we cannot understand this step."
SPD Chancellor candidate Martin Schulz condemns the break-up of the Dutch Green MEPs Elke Twesten to the CDU as a betrayal.
"The behaviour of former Green MEPs in Lower Saxony is not only a betrayal of voters, but also a betrayal of Red-Green," wrote the Federal Head of Social Democrats on Friday on Facebook.
He supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) to have the Landtag re-elected quickly.
The departure of Twestens costs the majority in red-green in Lower Saxony.
The politician "put her personal interests ahead of the country in her hurt vanity and frustration," criticized SPD Secretary General Hubertus Heil.
"It is a scandal that the CDU participates in this dirty intrigue in Lower Saxony and tries to beat political capital out of it."
Niedersachsen's CDU Group leader, Björn Thumler, wants to recommend that his MPs include Elke Twesten in the CDU.
The head of the SPD in the Bundestag, Thomas Oppermann, accused Twesten of falsifying the result of the 2013 Landtag election with personal career thinking.
The CDU was then the strongest force in front of the SPD, but SPD and Greene had a very thin majority of one vote in the Landtag.
Minister of Agriculture in the Interview - How do we protect ourselves from poisoning, Mr Schmidt?
Germany discusses contaminated eggs.
How could the scandal happen?
How can consumers protect themselves?
Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt (CSU) is interviewed by the editorial network Germany (RND) for speech and response.
Mr Schmidt, how can consumers protect themselves from poisoned eggs?
I can only encourage all consumers to take a close look at the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamp printing.
On the Consumer Protection Portal www.Food Warning.de, the federal states submit the latest information on the affected egg-chargens.
Affected eggs should be destroyed or returned.
Even if, according to everything we know at the moment, a health hazard is virtually excluded.
Is Aldi now taking over the best possible crisis response - all eggs out of the supply - because the central role of the informer is not really being exercised by the Federal Minister for Agriculture?
Food monitoring is the task of the federal states.
Nevertheless, my house has immediately opened up and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since the announcement of Germany's involvement.
All information and risk assessment are available to consumers.
Trade shall ensure, as well as manufacturers, that the products sold are marketable and health-friendly.
Where eggs exceed the maximum residue limit of 0,005 mg/kg, they are not capable of being transported.
Unloaded eggs, however, can be sold and consumed.
This time, the farms are not to blame.
Are production companies and consumers in the same boat?
According to current knowledge, production plants are not directly indebted.
Rather, they have to rely on economic damage due to allegedly illegal practices of service companies.
As always, there are too few controllers in the serious case.
Is there a lack of competence on the part of the staff or also on the part of the competent authorities?
It was precisely the official controls that revealed the process.
The truth, however, also includes that food fraud and criminal energy can never be excluded to 100 percent.
That is why a consistent investigation of such events and the handing over to the prosecutors in cases where criminal offences may occur are crucial.
I have already made it clear several times that I expect the responsible authorities to provide a complete clarification.
Is regular alerting in food scandals really necessary?
Consumers have the right to obtain only safe and transportable food.
If an unauthorised insecticide is used in the food industry, consumers are rightly outraged.
By means of the armored means, manufacturers, dealers and consumers have come into a situation that is absolutely not necessary.
In principle, it must be clear that the illegal use of the insecticide Fipronil in the holding of food-producing animals is unacceptable and must be terminated immediately.
This must be done consistently and with high pressure at all levels.
I expect from all the competent authorities that the matter will be cleared up quickly and without any gaps.
How the financial rules of football affect Neymar's move to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unhindered spending by European football clubs will not interfere with Neymar's world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to French Paris-Saint Germain.
Some consequences will still come for Paris Saint-Germain from the UEFA, because the leading organization that has overseen the European game has the power to prohibit teams from accessing the prestigious Champions League tournament.
Financial Fair Play rules, launched by UEFA in 2011, mean that PSG must at some point prove that Neymar's transfer was financed without significant losses.
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ($262 million) to buy out the Brazilian from its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary of several ten million dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to France.
PSG can certainly loosen the money so that Neymar signs and brings him into a galaxy of other stars, given the financing of the team by the energy-rich family of rulers of Qatar.
Clubs may spend a lot of money on the purchase of players, but must counter them with legitimate sources of income that allow them to break-even point in their football-related business.
FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA President in 2007.
The former French player believed that clubs that had taken on huge debts in their quest for success effectively cheated and risked ruining themselves when banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, FFP shifted from concentration on the debts of the clubs to monitoring their losses.
The change meant that the business model that novel Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - should become a tougher business.
During the current three-year FFP investment period, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses of EUR 30 million.
And although Platini fell into disfavor in 2015, his UEFA successor Alexander Ceferin continues to work to discourage excessive spending.
"FFP is certainly not dead and we will definitely strengthen the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for FFP at UEFA, in front of The Associated Press last week.
Although the PSG has paid Neymar's buy-out clause in a package, it can distribute the amount for accounting over the duration of its contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract so that the amount of the redemption can be recorded in the annual accounts for the next five years of EUR 44.4 million.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, the PSG, together with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, has met with the most severe sanctions.
The PSG received a fine of 60 million euros (at that time 82 million dollars), which later was reduced to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the team members for the 2014/15 Champions League remain limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players.
The UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to outsmart their financial supervision by blowing up their revenues by companies linked to the owners of a club.
While a cataric company could sponsor the PSG if the value of sponsorship were to exceed the standard market rates, the UEFA would not consider this to be a legitimate income.
That's exactly what happened in 2014, when the UEFA decided that the value of sponsoring the PSA was blown up by the Qatar Tourism Authority.
It has been reported that some of the PSG payments to Neymar could be made by the World Cup Organisation Committee in Qatar in 2022.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 have argued that Neymar will become a WM ambassador and that such a manoeuvre for UEFA regulators could be easy to find.
The previous sanctions against PSG mean that the UEFA will be even more attentive to any attempt to circumvent the rules.
The UEFA had no preliminary talks with PSG about Neymar's transfer, said on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation.
They spoke with The Associated Press under the condition of anonymity, as they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.
The last published reports show that PSG 2015/16 has achieved a profit of more than EUR 10 million with a turnover of EUR 542.4 million.
The accounts for the last financial year still need to be published.
PSG expects Neymar's arrival to be a blessing for sponsoring deals, merchandising and jersey sales.
The association expects sales to increase by at least 30 percent after signing.
The Spanish league was clearly annoyed to see one of the best football players going, and she tried to prevent Neymar's departure by claiming that PSG would hurt the FFP.
"It is a clear case of "financial doping" with the club and the state," said the president of La Liga, Javier Tebas, Spanish daily AS regarding Qatar's final ownership of PSG.
Arsenal Manager Arsen Wenger, whose association is owned by an American sports tycoon, shares La Liga's reservations against a state that finances an association.
"It is the consequence of ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years," said Wenger on Thursday.
"As soon as a country has an association, everything is possible.
It will be very difficult to respect the financial fair play because you can go different ways or have different interests if a country has such a big player to represent a country."
Swiss is looking for a new forest supplier
In recent years Chocolate Frey has produced on-board chocolate for the Swiss.
The sweet cooperation is now facing a possible end: the airline is rewriting the contract.
Swiss spokesperson Meike Fuhlrott confirmed on request of the news agency sda a corresponding report of the newspaper "North West Switzerland" of Friday.
According to current planning, the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018.
The products would be checked every two to three years and subject to quality control.
"We are very satisfied with the current supplier Chocolate Frey," said the spokeswoman.
Around 17 million small reddish-white packaged forest boards to 14 grams a year distribute the flight attendants before landing to passengers.
The Swiss did not want to provide any information about the costs.
According to "North-West Switzerland", the order volume is estimated to be between 1.5 and 2 million francs - the Migros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of around one billion francs.
But all the more important is the advertising effect: For a forestry producer it is a prestigious order.
How many candidates there are in the new tender does the Swiss not want to reveal.
However, only Swiss manufacturers are eligible.
According to the newspaper report, Chocolate Frey intends to seek a renewal of the contract beyond spring 2018.
For the sda, the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for an opinion.
Chocolate boards have been distributed by the Swiss on board their flights since 2006.
Before the Swiss concluded a contract with Migro's daughter, Barry Callebaut had delivered the chocolate tablets in cooperation with Hug.
Swiss introduced the possibility to place the logo two and a half years ago with the start of the collaboration with Chocolate Frey.
The airline cooperates with various Swiss chocolate producers.
On long-distance flights, customers of the First Class are spoiled with delicacies from the Confiserie Sprüngli, in the Business Class wet passengers Schoggi from Lindt and in the Economy Class Schoggi from Chocolate Frey.
Swiss Schoggi from Chocolate Frey, both in the business and in the Economy Class, is also distributed on the short distance.
Athletics - Discus Olympic winner Robert Harting reaches World Cup finals
The three-time World Champion fights for a medal in the finals on Saturday.
His brother Christoph, Olympic winner of 2016, had failed in the national World Championships and could only watch the discus competition from the stage.
Also with the first attempt, the Polish defender Piotr Malachowski, who threw 65.13 meters away, qualified for the final battle.
Nostalgia goes to the niches in "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective"
This repetition of history is at the same time nostalgic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80s, for the 90s-year grunge era (when the forerunners David Wain and Michael Showalter filmed the Sketch comedy "The State" for MTV), and for themselves - that is, for 2001, before their stars, like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd went to bigger things.
As a cultural artifact, it is equally a parody and a embodiment of our Facebook-enabled era of permanent memories.
But as a franchise, it feels like time is running out.
"First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not only because of his absurd humor (it contained an original story for a talking can of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).
By sticking to the core of the gag - middle-aged actors play horny children who are growing up - they still managed to make it impossible to win back the last part of the joke.
"Ten Years Later", with his adults who are now playing adults, is less emotionally rooted and his parody goes more according to the casting cannon principle, including a riff on the Stalker films of the 90s like "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle" ("The Hand That Swings the Cradle").
At one point, a character roams through an Apple powerbook, some inline scans, and "a series of other things from 1991".
Many of the central stories are the same.
The lovely Coop (Mr. Showalter), now a novelist, has still not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) has still not lost his virginity.
And there is another crazy-bunny plot that includes Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter), now supported by George H. W. Bush (a well-performed impression by Michael Ian Black).
As always, the excursions are the best part of the franchise.
It is especially fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rudd, who shows Matt Dillon's underlipbar of "Singles", whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy now feels like an old cracker.
It's the moments of random madness that could fuel this franchise like a kind of repeating "Seven Up!" series, until he reaches what I take as his logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later", whose last scene will show the band how she will be attending the film premieres of "Wet Hot American Summer".
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon now reminds of another kind of nostalgia: the revival of the Cold War of "The Americans", the film "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW" with its East-West ring-fight iconography.
The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka with Rhys Thomas as director indicates being a found TV series: a Romanian drama of the eighties with the two policemen as friends, two Bucharest officers fighting for truth, atheism and the path of Marxism-Leninism.
The main roles - a hard spoken Gregor and an idealist Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, whose dialogues are synchronized by Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in English.
It's a brilliant idea.
But it's not much more than an idea.
There are some nice Gags to see (the police spend time watching chess on TV, as Americans might do with football).
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevigny - ensures a decent game 'Find out the voice'.
But "Comrade Detective" is so committed to the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer wearing a Reagan mask is involved - that it often plays like one.
At six long episodes it moves, and the comedy is not fast or frequent enough.
"Comrade Detective", which was edited to a lesser length, could deliver its Agitprop satire better, as Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the American Embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who devour a bunch of Hamburgers.
The message for the imaginary communist audience is that Western culture can make everything a food for a living.
The fictional Romanian creators were not wrong: we do it even with our own younger story and with their own.
Hit against drug mafia in the country
The police have succeeded in beating the Italian Mafia in Baden-Württemberg.
On Wednesday morning, numerous objects were searched in the Schwarzwald-Baar-Kreis, in Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart, as the public prosecutor Konstanz announced on Friday.
15 accused persons between 25 and 77 years of age were arrested and have already issued arrest warrants against them.
In addition, officials secured larger quantities of marijuana and cocaine, firearms and several hundred thousand euros.
At the same time, in Italy, two people were arrested.
There were German warrants against the two suspect Italians.
The two will probably be delivered to Germany.
Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the action.
In total, more than 300 police officers were in operation.
Mafia members are accused of organized drug crime, serious violence, attempted murder, robbery and extortion.
Since summer 2016, the Public Prosecutor's Office has been investigating Konstanz against organized drug trafficking in southern Germany.
Between the prosecutors in Konstanz and Palermo there was a lively exchange and the investigators of the Kripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily.
Therefore, on Wednesday morning, four officials from Palermo also accompanied the large operation.
In particular, Italian nationals with close links to the Italian Mafia were targeted by the investigations.
An incident on May 27 in Hüfingen, where several shots were fired at a restaurant early in the morning, should also go to the account of the gang.
How to complain about large gaps in the foreign register
"Data from citizens who should not show up": According to a report, the foreign register in Germany has considerable shortcomings.
This leads to some serious misconceptions in asylum procedures.
According to Frank-Jürgen Weise, the Commissioner for Refugee Management of the Federal Government, a media report has drawn attention to major gaps in the foreign central register.
Deficiencies in the data recorded there could lead to "to some serious misdecisions" in asylum procedures and deportations, warned in an analysis available in the "South German newspaper".
According to the register, ten million people with foreign nationality are recorded, including some 5.7 million from non-EU countries.
The data are then managed by about 600 foreign authorities in Germany.
Because the data had not been properly maintained, the data quality had not been good in parts so far.
In individual cases, data from 1921 were found, "by people who have long since died, or by citizens who have become German citizens and should not appear in the register".
"Faulty data input can significantly slow back processes," the report continues.
Furthermore, the statistics on persons subject to the obligation to leave include EU citizens who do not have to leave at all.
However, such wrong allocations led to "a distorted debate on the handling of those who are required to leave", according to the analysis.
Meanwhile, the federal government apparently began sending refugee families back to Italy with children under the age of 16 when they arrived from there.
This is reflected in an internal paper by the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), reports the "New Osnabrücker Zeitung".
The paper thus states that the BAMF has been conducting such procedures "with regard to families with children - with the exception of infants and toddlers - to Italy since 1 June 2017.
Since the end of 2014, this was practically no longer possible, according to the newspaper, referring to the difficult situation on the ground.
Under the Dublin Agreement, refugees are responsible for the EU country they first reach.
If a migrant travels to another EU country, this state may send him back to the country of entry.
To justify this, the Office now writes: "In the meantime, the reception capacity for families with minor children in Italy has increased considerably".
Italy had given guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families.
Even the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) considers these commitments to be sufficient.
Other EU countries, too, would send back refugees under the Dublin Agreement.
The political spokesperson of the Left-wing Group in the Bundestag, Ulla Jelpke, criticized this decision: "Families with children are at risk because of the deficiencies in the Italian asylum system, which violates human rights and a threat to the well-being of children".
Second best result achieved
A total of 220 litres of blood from people living in Oberreichenbach already made the blood donation service available to other people.
At least out of the twelve citizens who were awarded the prize on Friday.
All in front of Jürgen Greule, who now shared 50 litres of blood with his 100 donations.
Traditionally, at the meeting of the Municipal Council, the congregation acknowledges its willingness to donate blood several times.
"It is ingenious how our body is designed for this and we respect the donors who make their blood available to strangers, even in vain," said Mayor Karlheinz Kistner.
"A single blood donation helps several people," explained the circuit leader of the German Red Cross (DRK), Holger Maisenbacher, because the cannings are broken into their components.
Three people could already benefit from a blood donation.
At the same time, Maisenbacher reported on the actions carried out in the spring in Oberreichenbach.
"This year we achieved the second best result with 114 donors," said the DRK circuit leader.
Obviously, the change to the theatre house led to higher attendances a few years ago.
Before that, Thomas Bockstadt, Susanne Reichle, Sandra Schöck, Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbeer were among the multiple donors and were awarded 50 blood donations each.
Half as many book Herbert Mair and Dorothee Riexinger, while Tamara Pfrommer, Petra Schleeh, Stefanie Stoll and Uwe Vetter paid ten times each 500 millilitres of their life's juice.
The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and inflation have dampened speculation over an increase.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain "low" as it kept the interest rates on family income in the midst of increasing pressure.
The Bank's Monetary Committee (MPC) policy makers voted 6 to 2 in favour of keeping interest rates to 0.25%, with fewer members seeking an increase this month, as weak economic growth has weakened support for an increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7% and for 2018 to 1.6% and warned that the pressure on household income would continue, with inflation expected to rise to almost 3% in the autumn.
But it signaled that in the coming years interest rates would be needed to curb the inflation heated by Brexit and said that credit costs might have to rise more than expected in the financial markets.
The members also voted in favour of withdrawing part of the Mammut business package issued one year after Brexit.
It will require time for the financing plan to provide more affordable finance for banks as of next February, although it has been said that it is now expected to provide more 15 billion pounds under this system - with 115 billion pounds sterling.
Minutes after the decision on the interest rate, the bank said: "In the MPC's central forecast, gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak in the short term, as the pressure on real household income continues to burden consumption."
On the basis of interest rates, she reiterated that "a certain tightening of monetary policy" would be necessary to cool inflation and a "something greater" extent than the markets expected.
Markets are currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that increases would be "progressively" and "limited".
The Bank's downward-adjusted growth forecasts for this year and next year are 1.9% and 1.7% compared to the one forecasted in May.
It maintained its growth forecast at 1.8% in 2018.
The pound fell after this news against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5% to USD 1.31 and fell by 0.4% to EUR 1.11.
There is no change in the decision after the recent disappointing growth rates have dampened the rising expectations for an increase in interest rates and GDP has risen from 0.2% in the second quarter to 0.3% in the previous three months.
Growth is expected to be 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will recover slightly from the Bank towards the end of the year.
The recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households affected by rising inflation and slight wage increases, as the tightening up is getting even worse before it gets better.
She added that in the next few years monetary policy will not be able to "prevent" the decline in income, but she added that at the end of her three-year forecast wages will be recovered "significantly".
The economy is also strengthened by the increasing demand for British goods, which is due to the weak pound, which will compensate some of the lower consumption expenditure.
The decision comes one year after the fall in interest rates to 0.25% last August following the shocking EU vote that caused the pound to fall.
The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years for this to be fully achieved by prices and the economy.
Prior to the Bank's final judgment on interest rates, the call for an increase in interest rates had increased as inflation increased pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policy makers demanding an increase of 0.5% in July.
Inflation fell from 2.9% in June to 2.6% last month, although the bank said this was expected and will attract it again in the coming months.
The Bank said that the overrun in relation to its target of 2% is to be attributed to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "In view of the recent decline in swap rates, the mortgage market should become more competitive again, as the lenders are looking loudly for business and want to end the year in a positive way.
The market looks particularly good for those who end the existing deals and close the new mortgages, and many with free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular."
NHS (National Health Service) is to prescribe HIV drugs to 10,000 people who are controversial
Patients will be given access to a "transformative" HIV prevention treatment from September after a fight before the High Court against the financing of the drug in the NHS.
NHS England announced that a pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 percent, is now being provided by the health service over a first three-year study for an estimated 10,000 people.
He declared himself willing to finance the proceedings after the appeal court confirmed last year a ruling by the Supreme Court that the NHS had the power to pay for the PrEP despite the claim that the local authorities should finance it.
The chess move announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England chief Simon Stevens as "important new intervention", while the National Aids Trust (NAT) called this a "distinguishing moment".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to enable the registration of people, and more clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a consequence of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission in those at risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before sexual intercourse means that just enough medication is present in a person’s body to prevent HIV infection.
Such medications can be taken every day or two hours before sexual intercourse.
Those eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexuals and people with HIV positive partners who have not been treated successfully.
In clinics, suitable participants are identified who agree to the study, including men, women, transgender and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral therapy.
People who live in England and are registered with a family doctor can also register for a possible participation in their local participating sexual clinic.
The program will be £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to deliver the drugs this week after an international competitive procurement.
The study is intended to assess the overall potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence on how it is used, absorbed and implemented on a large scale.
Stevens said: "This major new intervention should complement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It is another milestone in the more than three decades of progress in addressing one of the greatest health challenges facing mankind."
Deborah Gold, Chief Executive at NAT (National Aids Trust), said: "This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, when targeted at people in need and at risk, offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic.
From September onwards, people with a high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is really individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner, leading to the improvement of many, many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement."
Ian Green, CEO of Terrence Higgins Trust, said: "The priority must now be that the study is carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one who has a risk of HIV is left behind.
Now that the PrEP test medicine has been acquired, we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 people infected with HIV."
Sharon Hodgson, shadow health minister, said: "The start of the PrEP process is welcome and overdue after months of delays and hesitant implementation by the government.
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can stop the transmission of this life-changing infection.
This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the advantages of PrEP.
It is now important that this study be carried out as quickly as possible across the country to protect people infected with HIV and that it will help to bring us closer to the end of the spread of HIV in society'.
Living the big life: intermediate floor and clever designer tricks have turned these little Earls Court apartment into a generous home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, decreased from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment in 2014.
It is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her bags.
"Before that, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room," says Joanne.
"I was looking for something that was comparable to my price.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and she had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and made an offer that day."
Since the first visit, the 1,000 square feet of large apartment has been completely overhauled.
Originally a one-room facility with a nestled layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and an intermediate floor to make optimal use of the generous ceiling height.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.
That was my request," she says.
For this purpose, she commissioned Erfan Azadi's architectural and design studio Duck & Shed from Notting Hill to use the 12.5 foot high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne.
The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms above each other, so that the architectural challenge was to create an intermediate floor where you could stand.
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the specification.
"The steelworks are quite complicated," he explains.
"We had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stacked all over each other without having to bow down.
It was not just about building a simple platform, but about installing the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below."
This arrangement enabled Erfan to place two rooms at full height above each other - with much additional drama.
For the intermediate floor, a classic copper light window from Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area.
Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.
At both ends a short corridor is mirrored to make it work longer.
In the kitchen, the reflection feels like a window in another room.
At the entrance mirrored units offer space for all cutlery and glasses from Joanne.
By observing a more glamorous room, the beauty of the living room can lock the kitchen if it is not used.
Foldable kitchens are nothing new.
The special thing about this is that it's a garage door.
"A bit of engineering went in there," Erfan explains from the steel reinforced, furnished MDF door.
"It's counterweight, so when you push the door up, it slides very lightly."
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space Joanne was able to win an additional 16 m2, an additional bedroom and an improved layout.
"At the end of the day you will sell the floor space - or how your property is estimated," says Erfan.
"In a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the soil size."
Here they have managed to enlarge the floor area while using high-quality materials that give the space its luxurious advantage.
"The materials are the things you touch and therefore help create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan.
"You don't fall in love with the electrical sockets in the walls.
These are important, but they don't play with your heart."
It shows that an apartment can transform itself into something quite amazing through good design and increased square meters of something standard.
In fact, like Joanne, you could decide not to leave them.
Brothers are fighting for a $500 million real estate empire
Two brothers are located four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, in a dispute over one of Victoria’s largest real estate empires worth over $500 million.
The former director of the 'Carlton Football Club' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, only three doors away from his younger brother Paul. He has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and business assets are to be divided.
Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014, but a heated debate about the separation takes place in the Supreme Court.
Together with her mother Anna, the brothers own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, since the family bought a store on Smith Street, Collingwood, in 1973.
There the Westco Jeans family founded and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores.
It was sold for $85 million in 1999.
This money was invested in real estate, and the portfolio of De Lutis now includes offices in the city center, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping centres in the suburbs.
According to an agreement with her deceased father, Colin - described by Paul as the "principal operator and the dominant personality" in the De Lutis family - owns about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul about one third.
A court act states that this means that Colin has property worth 316 million dollars and Paul worth 176 million dollars.
The division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.
"The divisions proposed by Colin left him with what I thought was the best objects," he wrote in 2015 in a first affidavit.
The first hearing of the Supreme Court took place last Friday after several failed hearings.
The brothers are now also fighting for control of the existing business - of which Colin, as Paul claims, excluded him.
Colin argues that this is not true, but accuses Paul of incompetently managing some possessions.
In an early affidavit filed by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.
"My Italian heritage requires the family to be the most important priority," he wrote.
The costs rise in the case, with hundreds of pages with affidavits, e-mails and reports from companies including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers including Allan Myers, QC, and lawyers held by both sides.
Ms. De Lutis and her late husband, Luigi, were Italian immigrants who owned milk bars and delicacies from the late 1950s and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
They used the security to buy the Collingwood property, where Colin opened the family's first jeans store.
Colin says he started Westco there when he was "in my last years of high school when Paul was still a young child (about 10 years old)."
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to hand over their property to their sons.
"Luigi often told me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group, with Colin claiming that Mark was paid $10 million and Luke $26 million on leaving the company.
Both Luke and Mark were bitter about the conditions of their financial separation, says Paul.
Colin has been very reluctant, although he was a former AFL member of the board and, after a 2015 biography by Eddie McGuire, was the best friend of the TV star.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.
Only Colin answered by SMS to say "I really can't say much" because the case was in front of the courts.
"It is very, very sad that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and drag our family name through the courts," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote to the court that he had tried to meet his brother's demands.
"Our father wouldn't have wanted Paul and I to end up in our current dispute," he said, adding that he "is still hoping for a solution."
On Friday, this hope seemed to be over.
"Our business will be resolved by the courts in the near future," Colin wrote.
Trump's new Chief of Staff plans to limit the President's media abstinence.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.
If so, he will be the first.
Politico reports that the new head of staff of the White House is planning to limit the flow of information on President Trump - including reports from the news media - in the hope of keeping the boss on a more consistent course.
Here is a piece by reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When John F. Kelly, the new head of staff of the White House, met with senior staff on his first working day, he was a main problem in President Donald Trump's White House, which he wanted to repair: bad information coming into the President's hands.
Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he received good information."
Kelly's diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet.
President Trump's relationship with television dates back decades - and now that he is in the White House, his television advertising is still strong.
"If candidate Trump was annoyed by unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received a fair reporting of positions that were convincing," said former election consultant Sam Nunberg to Politico in February.
Politico's Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keeping Trump's Twitter habit under control, according to six former election officials, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise price."
Okay.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit was ever "under control" is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign officials know something we don't know about others - that Trump's tweets would have contained even more fuel without their interventions.
We'll probably never know anything about the tweets Trump didn't send.
If his employees managed to keep trouble away from him a few times, then their efforts were worth it.
But no one has been able to consistently prevent Trump from creating controversy.
Part of the problem is that people in a White House, composed of competing parties, keep trying to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that may promote their views from the world.
Politico - all concerned with this story - reported in May on the preference of the consultants to provide the President with dubious information for strategic reasons.
This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
"Current and former Trump officials say that Trump can react like a volcano to negative press cuts, especially those with damaging leaks, and that he insists on finding out where they came from.
That's exactly what happened at the end of February when someone maliciously gave the president a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of Internet Procurator Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh of being "the source behind a pile of leaks" in the White House.
Although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter because of harassment or that he did not offer any concrete evidence or that he had made false accusations in the past and revoked them.
Trump read the article and started questioning employees about Walsh."
Goldmacher added that the former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary General of the White House, Rob Porter, "sought to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork that Trump receives".
How'd that work?
Kelly tries to do the same three months later.
Perhaps he will prove himself more effective as a manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisors are still striving for influence.
These unchanging factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Mostly wanted criminals receive mail from Europol
Since the address is unknown, the help of the population will be sought and hoped.
The police across Europe are sending postcards to dangerous criminals on the run this summer (virtual).
Since the addresses of the wanted criminals are not known by nature, hints from the population are hoped and sought.
Europol reported on Friday on the action following the winter's "EU Most Wanted" Advent calendar.
Experience has shown that many refugees are hiding in holiday destinations, said Europol.
21 postcards were compiled for wanted criminals from 21 EU countries.
Since 2016, the website www.eumostwanted has been viewed more than 2.5 million times.
36 of the online applicants have been arrested so far, at least eleven of them on the basis of references after publication on the website.
Travelers negotiate a trench and return to the 'millionaires' series
Some of the wealthiest homeowners of the West Midlands are again standing on warfoot with some determined travelers who have negotiated a tomb drawn by the congregation to demand a field in front of their mansions.
Travelers have parked their 20 caravans on a field outside a wealthy street of Solihull called the "millionaires series".
They brought horses, babies and an army of transporters after they were thrown out in May, but without being deterred by a ditch dug out by the council to prevent their ideas.
The tactful group found a gap in the defense systems and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained unhindered to find a way.
Angry residents have pushed the advice of Solihull, who said that it is "useless to deal with the problem".
An anonymous resident said, "They moved there on Monday night after they were sent on by Bentley Heath, where they threw stones at the passersby.
The Council must be forced to implement through shame, as it was useless in dealing with the problem.
The travelers were there in May, were moved on and are now back.
More arrived last night, probably more today."
She added: "The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with this by giving long lessons to protect its parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Road and I'm not happy to continue paying my municipal tax if the Council can't even stop it."
A resident who didn't want to be mentioned said, "It's ridiculous, we just saw the last round of these travelers just to be looted by another round.
The numbers have increased this time and you have even seen a horse in the park."
A spokesperson of the Solihull Council said: "We are aware of an unauthorized camp in the countryside beyond Streetsbrook Road and work with the Solihulls police. We take the necessary legal steps so that they move on as quickly as possible.
To support our evidence collection, it is very important that as many residents as possible report anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.
This helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court has to examine when we present our case."
From Birkenhof becomes Waldhotel Luise
From the former hotel Birkenhof is the Waldhotel Luise.
The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and will be reopened on March 1st next year.
That's good news for the city.
Because with the closure of the hotel Birkenhof by the then ambient company mbH on 13 April 2014, about 30 000 overnight stays per year were lost and also revenues from the tourist tax.
In the autumn of 2014, in view of the dramatic rise in the numbers of refugees who came to the district, the hotel building was offered as a collective accommodation to the Landratsamt, which led to controversial discussions.
The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by drawing up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location.
The decision was not undisputed in the municipal council at the time.
But above all, the Mayor of Freudenstadt Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious stakeholders at the house.
He should be right.
The group Luisenhotels with Managing Director Birgit Scherer, based in Bad Bergzabern, has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof for a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to turn it back into a house of the three-star plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise.
The group has four houses with the joyful city object.
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.
Your name is Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.
The former hotel Birkenhof has been standing in front of the entrance for a long time, and when you enter the house, it becomes clear what extensive renovation work is being done.
The floors were demolished, blankets partially demolished, old baths removed from the rooms.
The entire hotel building is a single construction site.
There's still a lot to do until March.
"It's actually a nice hotel," says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper.
Everything should be renewed in the Black Forest style.
The rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers, the entrance area is refurbished, new windows are installed.
Everything was later to become "beautiful close to the citizen", as Thomas Scherer put it.
"We want to make a piece of jewelry out of it."
Swimming pool, wellness area and a conference room are included.
You do not want to position yourself at the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad, but already at an elevated city center level, Scherer emphasizes.
The Waldhotel Luise with its 60 or so rooms wants to be wide open, explains Scherer.
Both individual holidaymakers, groups or businessmen should feel comfortable in the hotel.
He has already had conversations with OB Julian Osswald and tourism director Michael Krause, says Scherer.
The city's ideas are similar to those of the hotel group.
"We're on the same line."
Asked about the amount of investment, Thomas Scherer does not want to make a precise decision.
Just under a million euros, he's counting.
The outside systems are also brought to the front, which is already clearly visible.
In an courtyard there is a large terrace that will be accessible by the restaurant, which is public.
Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Freudenstadt is a good market".
Russia affair: U.S. Special Investigator uses Grand Jury
In the Russia affair around US President Donald Trump, Special Investigator Robert Mueller reportedly used a so-called Grand Jury.
The body has taken up the work in recent weeks, wrote the Wall Street Journal calling on people familiar with the matter.
The paper considered the step as a sign that Mueller had expanded and intensified his investigations.
The transmitter CNN reported that there were already first calls by the board in connection with a meeting between Trump's eldest son and a Russian lawyer.
US secret services have been accusing the Kremlin of having been targeted in the 2016 presidential campaign.
Mueller investigates whether there were agreements between Trump's campaign team and Moscow.
The focus of the investigation is to be on several men who acted as advisors to the Republican in the election campaign.
According to reports, Mueller also looked at more and more Trump's private and business environment.
The "Washington Post" wrote a few weeks ago that the Special Investigator Trump personally went to the center and investigated whether the president might have obstructed justice in the course of the affair.
The main task of Grand Jurys is to examine available evidence in possible criminal cases and decide whether to bring an action.
Grand Jurys are therefore also called the Prosecution Chambers.
Mostly, they are switched on when it comes to larger and controversial cases.
The procedure is always done behind closed doors.
The body can also be called on by the Public Prosecutor's Office to invite people to the hearing under oath.
According to the broadcaster CNN, preliminaries have already been issued that revolve around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.
Those who were involved in the meeting were invited to make a statement in the report.
They should also provide documents.
In addition to Trump Jr., Trump's advisor and son-in-law Jared Kushner as well as his then campaign manager Paul Manafort were present in the conversation.
On Thursday evening, on US television, legal experts said that the deployment showed that Mueller did not let himself be intimidated in his work and that he wanted to act quickly if necessary.
However, it should not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be called to an end in order to decide on the imposition of an accusation.
Nevertheless, the setting up of the panel was the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause for concern for President Trump.
In the midst of the new revelations, the President used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to present the Russian affair as a campaign of his political opponents.
"The history of Russia is a total invention," said Trump.
The topic gives the Democrats an opportunity to "feel good because they have nothing else they can talk about".
His special advisor Ty Cobb explained in a statement that he knew nothing about the establishment of a Grand Jury.
But he also usually worked in secret, he stressed.
The White House is in favour of any measure which hastened the work of the Special Investigator in a "fair" manner.
Former FBI chief James Comey said three times that the president would not be tried.
There was no reason to believe that something had changed about this, the statement continued.
But Mueller had only been used after Trump fired Comey.
Because of this outburst, accusations against Trump had become loud that he wanted to obstruct justice.
Comey told a Senate committee in June that Trump had asked him to stop the investigation against the then national security adviser Michael Flynn.
The President is under great pressure because of the investigation.
After depicting US media, the White House collected material against the Special Investigator and his employees.
This led to speculation as to whether Trump wanted to release Mueller.
Unlike an independent special investigator of the Congress, such as in the Watergate affair around the later resignation of President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired by the Ministry of Justice at the request of the President.
Several senators of both parties, however, want to prevent such a step.
Two groups of republican and democratic senators presented draft laws on Thursday, according to which the Special Investigator could no longer be dismissed so easily.
Antarctica: Giant iceberg runs in Antarctica
In the Westantarktis, a giant iceberg of almost seven times the size of Berlin has been dissolved by the Schelfeis.
This was announced by the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research in Bremerhaven on Wednesday.
The colossal mass of more than one trillion tons and 5800 square kilometers now drives north and will probably take two or three years to melt.
With a length of 175 kilometres and a width of up to 50 kilometres, it is one of the largest ice giants that researchers have registered in the past three decades.
A danger to humans does not come from him.
According to researchers, the extent to which climate change has played a role in the iceberg's break-down is unclear.
However, for some 30 years there has been a series of unusual collapses of ice sheaths in the region, writes the U.S. Snow and Ice Research Centre (NSIDC) in a factual background.
Many researchers believe that this could be related to global warming.
The now abandoned Colossae was a part of the Larsen-C-Schelfeis.
Schefeis swims on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.
It thus grows ever further into the sea and breaks down regularly.
The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is located south of South America almost at the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula.
To the north of this ice-cream was the balance of wax and breakage a few years ago.
A complete ice-cream was destroyed there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.
There is a great deal to say that the Larsen-C-Schelfeis is also in danger, because the front edge has never retreated as far as it currently is.
In addition, the ice sheet is under tension and can fall apart if a piece breaks down at a key point.
Melting of ice cream and iceberg does not increase sea level, as it swims on the water and disperses ice as much water as it produces after melting itself.
However, the loss of the ice-cream leads to the glaciers pouring directly into the sea and being able to flow much faster than before.
This could possibly increase sea level, but only to a small extent, writes the British Antarctic Observation Research Project (Midas).
According to AWI data, the Larsen-C Schelfeis is the fourth largest ice-cream in Antarctica, with almost 50,000 square kilometres.
At the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean around 200 meters.
There it breaks down regularly.
"Although it is a natural event and we are not aware of any direct connection to climate change, the ice shield is now in a more dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary from Swansea University.
"This is the largest withdrawal since the beginning of the recording," he also confirmed.
Among scientists, whether the Larsen-C-Schelfeis will grow again or go back in the long term and possibly coincide, his colleague Adrian Luckman said, adding, "Our models say it will be less stable."
But this development will take decades.
Although these researchers are not responsible for the break-up of this giant iceberg to climate change, many of the Antarctic peninsula's ice-creams have been shattered in recent decades.
This long tip of Antarctica extends towards South America.
According to data from the British Antarctic Survey research program, the Antarctic Peninsula's ice area has decreased by 28,000 square kilometres since the 1950s.
The increase in temperature had contributed to the decline.
The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed up by about three degrees over the past 50 years and thus counts among the areas where temperature rises most rapidly.
CDU wants house rate for staff
Because it is becoming increasingly difficult to fill vacant posts, the CDU is calling for the Employer's Association to leave in order to become more attractive.
Shortly before the summer break, the district day has won 41 new positions in the administration.
More than 1,100 employees and officials work for the district administration in Mettmann.
Now 17 trainees have their first working day behind them.
The teaching positions in the circle are obviously very desirable.
Around 620 applications were made for the places to be awarded this year.
Nevertheless, the circle still lacks staff to cope with the increased demands and tasks.
There are still 50 vacant posts in the Mettmann County.
Among other things, doctors and engineers as well as forces of general administration are sought.
The CDU now wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG and to counter the shortage of skilled workers in the administration.
According to the parties' wishes, the administration is to "develop a concept of staffing and personnel development".
The aim is not only to meet short-term needs for skilled workers but to counter the shortage of applicants in the future, it is said.
The overall approach should focus on both inside and outside, identify concrete measures for cross-border beginners and include a training offensive, call for CDU, FDP and UWG.
That already sounds like a good approach.
Because the circle has to do with personal problems that you didn't know before.
Other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.
The speech is about a regular "competition of public employers".
In addition, a high number of employees who leave the service as a result of illness or old age.
So it's time to act so that we don't have more jobs.
But Klaus-Dieter Völker, head of the CDU Group, goes beyond the joint request with his party.
He had a surprise recently in the district day when he publicly questioned the personnel cost cover and the other parties were amazed.
Peoples want to have all the possibilities that allow them to leave the local employers' association.
"If we do not come to a satisfactory solution here in the short term, the county administration with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the counties - should seek a house rate," people said.
This means that the CDU is trying to pay employees and officials better than it actually provides for the public service tariff system.
The salaries are currently precisely prescribed, increases or more money exist only if you change to a higher level, which is oriented towards career years.
But the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years.
It was only a few weeks ago that new rooms had to be set up in which employees took care of the provisions of the new Prostitute Protection Act.
Not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers, Landrat Thomas Hendele and district director Martin Richter have a problem: they have too few staff.
Italy is tightening the tone of NGO Migrant Rescue Boats
Italy has warned NGOs who use lifeboats for migrants in the Mediterranean that they must not continue to do so if they do not comply with new rules for their operations.
"If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue to work," said Minister of Interior Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa.
Minnitis Warning came one day after the Italian authorities confiscated a boat from the German aid organization 'Youth Savet' because their team had worked effectively with traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.
The aid organization, which has only been in operation for one year, refused to make any detailed accusations by the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"For us, saving human life is and remains our top priority, so we are very sorry that we are currently unable to operate in the search and rescue zone," said the organisation in a statement on social media.
"We can only assess all the accusations currently being raised after we have collected all the information and can assess the situation."
The Italian authorities had been overseeing the boat of 'Youth Savet', the Iuventa, since October.
It is believed that his crew will take on-board tug-boat migrants who will be delivered directly to them by traffickers, and that smugglers will be able to leave so that the ships can be used again.
At least one such meeting allegedly took place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the file of the prosecutor whose content was published by Italian media.
The crew is suspected of overseeing the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not for any other reasons.
Under the Code of Conduct, boats such as the Iuventa must have an Italian police officer on board, in particular, to monitor their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to stick to the code: Save the Children, MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary, but acceptable, as they would not bring about any "significant changes or handicaps" of their rescue actions.
Among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel Prize-winning organization Doctors without Borders (MSF).
Minniti said that the number of migrants who arrived after the rescue measures in Italy had fallen sharply over the past few weeks, indicating that efforts to strengthen Libyan coastguards and to cooperate with local mayors had borne fruit.
"In the last few days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," said the Minister.
He announced plans for further talks with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
Increases and Trials
Nine Weilerm Biker, the "Berliner Austernposten" and two guest riders met in Wachenheim in the North Palatinate to enjoy trials and sights for four days.
Three friendly guides were available for this.
The accommodation in the Wachenheim valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.
The castle and wine festival of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.
The first tour led to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards.
The following were viewpoints, partly on towers, from which one could look far above the Palatine Forest and the precipitated plains.
In between, there were always longer increases that rewarded the long trials.
On the second day we went to Bad Dürkheim to the Saline and the Volksfest Wurstmarkt.
Again, the vantage point was at the vantage point, connected by "flowy" trials and moderate increases.
During the last two days, many altitude meters were back on track.
Caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and shelters brought welcome breaks.
In Bad Dürkheim, the bikers breathed healing seals into the open air inhaler.
Neustadt was also controlled.
After 173 kilometers and almost 4,500 meters of altitude, the group had met the Pfalzer Forest from its best side - sporty and cultural.
Console instead of lawn - Bundesliga equips itself for e-sports
Do the sports stars face computer consoles in the future, instead of perspiring in the wind and weather to fight over the stadium grass?
Fact is: E-sports has long been a serious industry, becoming a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high levels included.
This has also been recognised by the first Bundesliga clubs, which are increasingly engaged in this area.
The VfL Wolfsburg started in 2015, followed by FC Schalke 04 and, last, VfB Stuttgart, which founded an e-sports department in mid-July and contracted two professionals for the FIFA 17 computer game.
"We hope to inspire quite new young target groups for the VfB," says the Management Board Jochen Röttgermann.
He's sure, "that on this train a number of clubs are still rising."
Next weekend, the FIFA Football Association in London will organise the first "Interactive Club World Cup" in which the gamers of different clubs face each other.
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or PSV Eindhoven have qualified.
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sports.
The ex-trainer from Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen now advises an agency for virtual football players.
"Real football has to deal with the 14 to 30-year-olds in particular, that the young people will still be in the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old.
And: The clubs tried to conquer all kinds of markets, especially the Asian ones.
With prominent e-sportsmen under contract, you could be present online much more often on these markets than just once a year to send the Bundesliga team to Asia.
What exactly is it about?
At e-sports, computer games such as "League Of Legends", "Dota 2", "Counterstrike" or football simulation FIFA are fought at the competition level.
Long ago, as in normal sports, leagues have established themselves in which the professionals face each other.
And in the Asia 2022 games, e-sports are already part of the official program.
But is it a real sport at all?
For many, the idea is certainly in need of habit.
Ingo Froböse has also dealt with the question for a long time.
For the professor at the German Sports College in Cologne, E-Sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that are also found in classical sports - for example, increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes.
It also needs cognitive skills, a technical and tactical understanding and a quick reaction.
Professional gamers should not only train at the console, but also their bodies and pay attention to the diet.
"The fit player is a good player."
Frobouse also sees problems: "Doping is becoming more and more a topic".
Controls were difficult to perform in online games, and in the scene the structures of classical sports were missing.
The scientist positively highlights the high integrative impact of e-sports.
The players are international, that is like a large global family, there are no intercultural barriers.
A study by Deloitte and the German Association for Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) predicts rapid growth in e-sports.
In 2016, this resulted in a turnover of EUR 50 million in Germany, mainly through advertising, sponsorship and major tournaments.
In three years' time, sales are expected to be 130 million.
This is not much compared to the almost EUR 2.4 billion of the football league.
However, the e-sport "is no longer far from the other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey," writes Deloitte consultants.
Internationally, many countries are already further.
Large markets are Asia and the USA, where former basketball players Shaquille O`Neal and Baseballstar Alex Rodriguez participate in the US team NRG eSports.
Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher invests in the Unikrn eSport betting provider.
There is also a lot of work to be done in Europe.
In a Norwegian school, e-sports had been introduced as a teaching subject, says Froböse.
In the Netherlands and France, according to Dutt, the Soccer First League Associations are now obliged to set up an e-sports department.
"In European comparison, Germany lags behind," explains VfB CEO Röttgermann.
Just to fall into nostalgia, and to clarify the old times, is no longer enough.
It is about preserving the tradition of the association, but at the same time aligning the company on the modern market.
"We live in a digitized world," says Dutt.
"You can't hold on to the fact that only football will keep everything the way it always was."
Poison egg ade - The egg-alternatives for cooking and baking
Almost all federal states are now affected by the scandal of poisoned eggs.
Aldi Süd and Aldi Nord have responded and have taken all eggs from the sale throughout Germany.
Only eggs which are proven not to contain fipronil should be taken into the shelves.
Michelle Carter condemns for the texts that force Conrad Roy to commit suicide.
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years for encouraging her friend through texts and calls to suicide.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months in prison behind bars and five years on probation.
Carter was sentenced in June to negligent killing of Conrad Roy, who took his life on July 13, 2014.
Roy's father said on Thursday at the hearing, "My family is inconsolable.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was allowed to remain free until the appointment.
She had been faced with a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from a mental illness.
Dressed in red pants and a creamy blouse, Carter stood there with tears in her eyes, with folded hands and eyes facing downwards when she was sentenced.
"Your actions have killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
"She ended his life to make her own better.
She took no responsibility," she said.
"She has shown no regrets."
But Carter's lawyer said it was a "frightful circumstance that she completely regrets."
Judge Lawrence Moniz, however, said that he did not find out that their "age or maturity or even their mental illness have a significant influence on their actions".
A prosecutor read a statement by Roy's mother Lynn Roy saying that there is "no day on which I do not mourn the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything. I try to be there for his sisters, despite all the pain we will suffer for eternity," it says.
Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, said that she was being "traced" by the realization that she would never participate in her brother's wedding or be an aunt to his children.
"No longer having this only person with whom I have been together every day since I was born is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life," she said.
The case seems to set a legal precedent since there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to ask another person to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead from carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.
The case attracted national attention after Carter's text messages revealed that she had encouraged him to end his life.
"Stand up, jump from a building, first yourself, I don't know, there are many ways," she said in several messages she sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family.
In the moments before his suicide she wrote, "You have to do it, Conrad" and "All you have to do is turn on the generator and you'll be free and happy."
Judge Moniz said that Carter was seeking attention through Roy's death and ordered that she benefit from the case through some press.
The case shared the legal opinion.
Among the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007 before being acquitted two years ago.
Mrs. Knox, 30 years old, published a comment in the Los Angeles Times: "Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not prison."
Joshua Kimmich: Learning from the new mini-lam of FC Bayern
The fact that Joshua Kimmich was allowed to run as a captain at the Audi Cup is no coincidence.
The FC Bayern has a big season for the Confed Cup winner - extra motivation doesn't hurt.
Something else was in his place in the cabin, which Joshua Kimmich saw immediately, even if the additional garment was very, very small.
But since far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup there was of course no Philipp Lahm and no Manuel Newer to see, he made himself the assigned tie to his arm.
"The coach didn't announce it," said the Confed Cup winner afterwards, after his first engagement as Bayern captain.
Well, the stop could have run better than the 0:2 against the SSC Naples.
But the sign of the coach could also mean Kimmich.
Not the eight-year-old Arturo Vidal had been selected as a game leader in the C-Elf, a team of youth players, debutants and professionals who had just come from the holiday.
Sugar is best distributed to those who are trusted to keep their spirits warm.
So whoever was chosen to enter the legacy of lamb can only use a small extra motivation well.
Kimmich confirmed: "That's what you want as a player: take responsibility."
On Wednesday, the 22-year-old was fluttering as a mini lamb across the field.
Right behind, that's his position, the white tie on the arm did the rest.
And at all, Kimmich seemed like the one who can best take the row in his hand in this start formation.
He gave instructions, tried to direct the unplayed force.
He had the eye for the whole while many others were busy with themselves.
Vidal to overplay his missing fitness (rarely succeeded); Renato Sanches to get out on devils to relate to the performances of the Asia-travel (also only conditional); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle not to notice negatively in their first appearance in the Bayern tricot.
Anyway, it worked out pretty well.
Süle ran next to Kimmich, Rudy up before the defense, both acting sovereign.
The well-known Napoli storm was often difficult, and siele also tried to succeed a few times in the game.
His colleague Rudy admitted that the result was "not as we hoped".
But he also showed a decent performance at the debut.
Game shift, change of pace: "For this style I was also picked up".
As unfamiliar this Bayern world is still for the new additions, one saw after the game.
Rudy, for example, did not give one or two interviews in the catacombs, but certainly six or seven interviews.
Kimmich said goodbye after a few crackling statements in the back of his new co-players.
There he heard an interesting phrase from Süle: "What's going on here, I've already noticed.
At Bayern you just have to win every game".
After all, he doesn't have to teach the new one anymore.
Alabama Motivates ÖFB Women
David Alaba believes in the success of our ÖFB women
Austria's most famous footballer reported on Twitter just before the game and wished the ÖFB ladies all the best.
The Bayern Legionary is a kind of club colleague from ÖFB Captain Schnaderbeck and shares with our ladies.
The tweet of the Austrian footballer of the year and Champions League winner should be a special motivational injection.
The famous Bayern Dusel may well need our ladies.
Company satisfied with Rhineland-Palatinate Minister: Economy praises Wissings Tempo
It often became irreconcilable, the relationship between the country and the regional economy, when Eveline Lemke (Green) was still Minister of Economic Affairs of Rhineland-Palatinate.
This is evident after more than a year in which the new Minister of Economic Affairs Volker Wissing (FDP) is in office.
Chambers and companies from the region speak on T-V request of a change in economic policy - while at the same time reprimanding the old minister.
Frank Natus, Chairman of the Association of Trier Enterprises (VTU), says: "Wissing responds to the wishes of the economy, which Lemke has all blocked".
The largest turnaround sees Natus in infrastructure policy: the gap between the highway 1 between Kelberg and Adenau is now at the top of the country's priority list.
This year, the Ministry is still hoping for a planning process, and until 2021, the right to build is to stand.
A role in the plans of the country is also played by the West bypass Trier, which is in the urgent need of the Federal Transport Plan.
The aim is to put the route into operation in December 2020, says Ministerial Spokesman Cornelia Holtmann.
Natus sees it as a signpost to support regional but internationally competing companies.
The Chamber of Industry and Commerce (IHK) Trier, as suggested by Wissing, strives to use a Rhineland-Palatinate label to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German wine exports that have been falling for ten years.
In addition, Wissing has an open ear for people who want to set up their own company, the IHK praises.
The Trier Chamber of Crafts sees an additional incentive for young trainees in the new Master Bonus, says Managing Director Matthias Schwalbach.
A premium of 1000 euros is foreseen for the passed master's examination and 2500 euros if graduates become independent within ten years of master's training.
However, the country's housework list remains long.
With the planned road construction, facts can be created quickly, at the same time, the country lacks the necessary personnel," says Jan Glockauer, Chief Executive Officer of the IHK Trier.
Of 56 new engineers who want to stop Wissing at the Landesbetrieb Mobility, only 29 are currently employed.
The IHK calls for more contracts to be awarded to external offices.
CDU Group Vice Christian Baldauf refers to calculations by the Court of Auditors, which in 2017 and 2018 invests more than 20 million euros less in the maintenance of state roads than suggested.
Frank Natus also expects a concept of the country, as it intends to address the shortage of skilled workers in the region.
It is also sobering to see the expansion of broadband in the country so far.
In 2016, regional companies evaluated the network supply in an IHK survey only with the grade 3.4.
They complain about growing Internet connections and interruptions.
Ex-Minister Eveline Lemke, on the other hand, is currently out of politics and is still on the Supervisory Board of the Pro Wind wind company.
The Green Group left Lemke in April to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe - where she already cleared the field after four months of disagreement.
Audi is supposed to change 850,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter-reaction
One day before the announcement of Audi, BMW said it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW president said that the company believes that "there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions", and this refers to European cities - including Munich, where BMW is based - to ban or restrict diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.
None of the companies described the companies as a recall.
European car manufacturers have strongly promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions rules.
But the nitrogen oxides that emit diesel engines are considered carcinogenic and can cause asthma.
The costs for car manufacturers to install installations to neutralise the exhaust gases emitted by diesel vehicles are also increasing, making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also charged with stifling the powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem.
The companies are trying to avoid the errors of Volkswagen, the use of so-called shut-off devices that could regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car was tested but driving back under normal driving conditions.
In the United States, several employees were charged by Volkswagen, while others were investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former director of thermodynamics was arrested in Audi's engine development in Germany.
The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be tried in the United States.
At the beginning of this year, Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen, after the authorities accused Audi of having a system in place to bypass emission regulations in Europe, and an issue focused on the United States was expanded.
The involvement of Audi in the investigation could weigh heavily on Volkswagen: the luxury car manufacturer contributes disproportionately to the profit of Volkswagen.
This message has the raft on Saturday on the Isar
The city wants to protect the Isar.
In order for the Isar visitors to join us, a raft passes through Munich on Saturday, which has a special message.
Whenever it moves to the Isar again on Saturday, it will see a large raft there between Flaucher and Reichenbachbrücke.
And that's not a usual raft, with Isar tourists.
But the construction report wants to clarify.
On the raft you can see a large information transparency.
It shows a pile of garbage.
The start of a public campaign to appeal to the Isar visitors.
With the motto "Where Love Is ..." the understanding of the Isar is to sharpen as a protective wild river.
Last summer, the river crossed the Isar and this year, too, there are other actions and measures to achieve a reckless and environmentally conscious behaviour.
Mordillo's nostrils and laughing at the suffering
Mordillo was sometimes one of the most published cartoon characters, the nostrils of his characters are his trademark.
The Argentinian still draws with 85 and works on a film.
His message: laugh, "because there is too much suffering in the world".
Guillermo Mordillo was born on August 4, 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires.
In the early years as an artist, he went through as a drawing artist for greeting cards, which frustrated him.
"The happiest day in my professional life was the day when my job was lost," he once said.
After stops in Lima, New York and Paris, he made the breakthrough at the end of the 1960s: with the release of his cartoons in "Paris Match" and then also in "Star" and other leading magazines around the world.
Even in China, Mordillo found many fans.
Again and again, the artist was inspired by cities.
Large, roundish Mordillo figures immerse themselves in drawings with the slate tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow.
In the early morning, according to his own information, he is still sitting on the drawing table today, working almost ten hours a day.
About calendars, puzzles, books for big and small, t-shirts, plush animals and watches, its dirty figures continue to be widely distributed worldwide.
For six years he has also been working on a cartoon film and a TV series with his characters.
The main character in the movie "Crazy Island" is a giraffe - Mordillo's most popular animal in his drawings - that has a thousand-fucking as an opponent.
For the first time, his characters speak in the 3D film, which is to come to the cinema wall in 2019.
"I don't know exactly what they're going to say, it's weird for me," says Mordillo.
The script is not written by him.
That's why he prefers to focus on the TV series, which, like its original drawings, is produced wordlessly.
Lavender from Provence threatened by climate change
It has become a symbol of Provence in southern France, but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change.
The lavender is declining due to the conditions of drought and disease-borne insects, causing great headaches to scientists and farmers who are trying to find solutions.
Eric Chaisse, expert at the agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "The lavender in Provence is effectively at risk because in recent years the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change, which has brought much less rain in spring and much more in autumn.
This has an impact on the life of lavender.
There is also a small cicada, a microbacteria that transmits dwarf zicadas, and in very dry weather there are a lot of them."
And there's a lot at stake.
Lavender oil not only attracts holidaymakers, it is also very much in demand for perfume and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said, "Instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.
So we have less parts with essential oil."
Solutions considered include better water distribution and the slowing down of evaporation from the soil, as well as spraying of the plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to dryness.
The town of Geisa in the Thuringian Rhön celebrates its 1200th anniversary this year.
The highlight is this Saturday and Sunday with a medieval festival.
Cranes, fires, merchants, vagans or a national servant camp should be experienced in the city centre on these days.
The murder of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico
The staff of the Riodoce weekly usually meet on Wednesday to review their plans for reporting on the latest chaos in the State of Sinaloa through organized crime, corrupt officials and unstoppable drug wars.
But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.
They were informed that it is important to change their routines.
Two high-level journalists discuss what feels more secure: they should take their children to the office, which was the target of a grenades attack in 2009, or leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words on a board at the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies.
You ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no proof is necessary, perceptions and abdominal sensations suffice.
There are drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of being on the payroll of the government or cartel, a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.
There is no rest from the violence, and while the bodies accumulate throughout the country, there are more and more journalists present: at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012. 589 are under federal protection after attacks and threats and so far there have been at least seven deaths in seven states this year.
Among the latter are her editor and her inspiration of Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on drug-related violence.
His lack is deeply felt, although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez, showing his middle finger with the word "Justice", hangs on the facade of the Riodoce building. Two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panama hat.
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared topics, the trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although in 2010 a special federal attorney general was established to deal with the cases of journalists, according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists, only two criminal proceedings were initiated.
As with most thousands of murders associated with drug trafficking and organised crime each year, the murderers of journalists are rarely brought to justice.
At Riodoce they still insist on dealing with the violence of Sinaloa, although they are inconsolable and although the terrain is now even more treacherous.
Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting has little use in discussing security, says Ibarra.
"It's very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.
"As long as we don't know why, we don't trust everyone."
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the newspaper Riodoce in the state capital of Culiacan.
He only managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. He was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot at him, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated "Twelfth River".
The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left behind a woman and two grown children.
Rumors tend to fly freely around Culiacan.
But on the subject of Valdez there is practically nothing but silence.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the most bloody battlefields in the country, as rival factions are fighting here to fill the vacuum.
It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa someone or several people are shot every day on the street or that the cemetery is full of decorated, two-storey mausoleans for drug kings who are larger than many houses for the living.
Forget for a minute that there is a state of "rest" if only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes to the United States.
Nevertheless, and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, is guilty of breaking apart that he could not protect his friend.
He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.
First in February there was the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel fractions in the war with Guzman's sons.
This publication may have annoyed the sons, suspected gang members bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to the newspaper kiosk.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after confiscation of another newspaper that had published the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his death is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there.
He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined five colleagues to set up Riodoce and sold $50.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to operate journalism without encountering the drug problem," said Bojorquez.
In time, the paper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.
Reporters loved to be able to publish hard-hitting investigations without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to treat.
Eight years after the founding of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot Prize" for her coverage in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage in persecuting Mexican drug history, wherever it led.
He voluntarily admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to live on," he said at the time of the CPJ award.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa "is a way of life", he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento TV.
"You have to take on the task you as a journalist - either that or you're playing the stupid.
I don't want to be asked, "What did you do in the face of so many dead people ... why didn't you tell me what was going on?"
The Riodoce team misses Valdez, the funbird who could swear like a port worker, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trusted his routine.
He would always wear his hat.
He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and sit there always at the same table.
Now they ask, Was his love of routine his destruction?
His death also forced her to question her own assumptions about how they could best do their work and stay alive.
"They don't like it when you deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret runways" to move drugs.
"These things were not allowed," said Bojorquez.
The result, even in the best times, is a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.
Trust his own instincts.
If it smells wrong, stay away from it.
The trouble is, the editor of Riodoce Andres Villarreal said, "Smell a sense that can be deceived ... and then the thing happened to Javier."
The old rules, as he and others say, no longer apply in Sinaloa - just as not in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a toxic mixture of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the room where Riodoce employees met for security training, suddenly no cell phones were allowed. Days earlier it was known that spyware sold exclusively to governments was used for monitoring journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two policemen sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.
They were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a middle-class quarter of Culiacan.
Half the joke, some of the reporters wondered if these officers were among the 50 percent of the police who the governor himself called untrustworthy.
It has been months since the reporters went to the mountain landscape, where the drug gangs are de facto under control.
For the issue this week, Riodoce has looked at three main stories.
There was the murder of the brother of the former well-known boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had an exposé of government expenditure that focused on the governor's hometown.
And there was a group that carried out a kidnapping in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the prosecutor's office.
There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was required when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite place of drug dealers and authorities.
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who belongs to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which dominated almost all political levels throughout the century.
Recently, several PRI governors were accused of high-ranking cases of corruption.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this room, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military attack.
Only a few months earlier, the readers had considered Valdez's column to be the best-informed source of kidnapping.
"In the past, we already knew what happened," said Villarreal, 46, nicknamed "El Flaco" because of his slender body stature.
"Now all channels of communication with our sources are broken."
Valdez's office has been converted into a storage room for signs and stickers who protest against the murders of journalists, because the employees have become something they would never have expected: activists in the name of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few signs and the next morning went to a demonstration for another journalist to the prosecutor's office.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the western state of Michoacan.
A burned body was discovered and officials say, based on DNA tests, that it is his.
Throughout the country, journalists have become louder by writing "SOS Press" in organized protests on footpaths and buildings.
On that day the director Bojorquez is gone in Washington and tries to gather international support for the judiciary in the case of Valdez.
At a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa the day after Valdez was murdered, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and having them killed because they told the truth.
Since then, she has asked for it to be reclassified by the government because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were "encircled" by organized crime, government officials involved and an indifferent society.
In his last book "Narco Journalism", he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs, but also on the orders of politicians and security forces who put the organized crime under a blanket.
Last year, the media guard group "Article 19" assigned more than half of the attacks on police and civil servants' journalists.
"In Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth shut," said Ramirez.
Obviously, the murders have a deterrent effect.
No one forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
Her body was found along with a note allegedly signed by the Zetas cartel: "Here I am because of my reports."
A computer keyboard and headphones were next to their separated head.
Some branches have chosen to close the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the murder of the correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others continue as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after her director was murdered in 2004.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartel with an editorial on the front page entitled "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled from their homelands or even from the country.
It's a painful decision.
It's hard to find work in exile, and they're still watching the streets and looking for dangers.
And sometimes they are hunted, as it seems to photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the flight from Veracruz.
For those who stay behind and continue their work, it is a daily dance with risky decisions.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that the drug trade scares him.
"Mexico goes to hell, and that's why I became a reporter," he said.
At midnight on the last Friday, when the last issue had already ended, the editors of Riodoce sat on the sidewalk in front of the office drinking beer when all their phones suddenly started to buzz.
A number of shootings with band rivals and security forces near the seaside resort of Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.
The war escalated further as promised by a number of cartel embassies in the region.
They have published the news on the Riodoce website about mobile phones from the edge of the table stone.
The cover page had to be changed the next day.
Sirens cry up nearby - another shooting in the area.
Bojorquez took a look at the police officers who were watching to see if they were ready.
If they were afraid at all, they didn't show it.
Under the immense portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible to all of Sinaloa, the employees of Riodoce followed his lead.
"How can you even think of closing your mind," said Bojorquez, "when the same day Javier was murdered, the intern asked me to send her to the street for reporting."
Dinosaurs used camouflage to avoid their enemies
At first glance it looks like a statue, though a terrifying one.
Researchers have now found that the first findings of the incredible rhinoceros of a Canadian miner have been so well received that experts have described it as "Mona Lisa of dinosaurs".
It was so well received that they could even see that his scaly skin was of reddish brown - and they said that she had something of a "disquieting past".
The report in the magazine "Current Biology" described him as "the best preserved armored dinosaur ever found, and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world".
The fossil is a newly discovered species of nodosaurier that lived between 110 million and 112 million years ago in the middle of the Cretaceous period.
His incredibly well-preserved condition has amazed researchers who describe it as "really remarkable".
According to reports in National Geographic, the armored plant eater is the best preserved fossil of its kind.
It was found by Shawn Funk when he dug on March 21, 2011 at the Suncor Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada.
He met something that seemed to be missing from the surrounding rock, and decided to look more closely.
The fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrell Museum of Paleontology.
They spent the next six years uncovering the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) of heavy earth.
After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.
"If you just blink a little with your eyes, you could almost think it was asleep," said chief author Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrell Museum, where the creature can be seen.
"It will go into science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs."
Researchers have found that this plant eater, although covered with armor and similar to a changing tank, was likely threatened by meat-eating dinosaurs.
The heavily armored dinosaur used a red and white cover to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as counter-shadowing, which is also used by many modern animals.
This would have allowed it to mix better into its surroundings and avoid its enemies, say experts, indicating that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million-year-old creature from the Nodosaurier family made headlines for the first time in May and is now on display at the Royal Tyrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and named it Borealopelta markmitchelli after the museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours carefully discovering it.
The amazing preservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armor over his body.
They discovered the counter-shading, a common defense method in the animal kingdom, which means that the tip of the creature was darker than its underside.
Although the counter-shading is common, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta far exceeds that of the animals living today.
It suggests that the dinosaur was hunted by enough pressure from meat-eating dinosaurs that evolution favored the veiling of confrontation as a means of survival.
But most of the contemporary animals that use the shade of the counter - think of deer, zebras or belted animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey, which signals that this nodosaurier was exposed to a real struggle for survival.
"Strong predator behaviour on a massive, heavily armored dinosaur shows how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the Creed Age must have been," said Brown.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was reddish brown.
Scientists continue to examine the animal for clues about its life, including its preserved intestinal contents, to find out what it ate as its last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur, when he died, got into a river and was driven out into the sea, where he sank on his back to the seabed.
At that time Alberta was as warm as South Florida today, and rivers and oceans probably spread much further inland than they are today.
"This nodosaurier is really remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved scaly skin, but also remains in three dimensions and retains the original shape of the animal," said Brown.
"The result is that the animal looks almost the same today as it did in the early Creeding period.
You don't need to use a lot of imagination to reconstruct it. If you're just shoving a little with your eyes, you might almost think he's asleep."
The Creed Age was a time when huge theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs standing on two legs traversed the earth.
Although the king of them, Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of his fearful ancestors.
This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11.5 m) long, six tons heavy monster.
The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta was sunk in the sea after death and mummified in the mud.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he dug on March 21, 2011 at the Suncor Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the best preserved armored dinosaur in the world, including skin and armor, and is complete from the muzzle to the hip.
The creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
It contained two 20-inch-long laces that hung from his shoulders.
The researchers believe that the armored plant eater was flooded through western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.
But the underwater burial of the dinosaur preserved its armor in exquisite detail.
The petrified remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the skin remains still cover bumpy armor plates along the dinosaur
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is as rare as a win in the lottery.
The more I see it, the more confusing it becomes.
Rocked remains of the skin still cover the hollow-pricked armor plates that carry the animal's skull.
His right front foot is on his side, his five fingers are spread up.
I can count the scales on his sole.
In the thunderstorm: Mass carambola on A8: Many injured
Heavy accident on Thursday evening on the A8: Nearly 30 vehicles are involved in a mass carmowage.
There are many injured, miles of traffic jams and forks.
On the Stuttgart-Munich motorway (A8) about 20 people were injured in a mass carambola in the late Thursday afternoon.
According to the police's first report, about 5 p.m. between the Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen connection points (Aichach-Friedberg County) during a thunderstorm nearly 30 vehicles, including probably trucks, were interlocked.
At first, no information was available on the exact number of injured persons.
It's about mild to moderate injuries, said a police officer.
A large supply of rescue vehicles was at the site of the accident.
The A8 was completely blocked towards Munich.
In the direction of Munich, a backstave of about ten kilometres was formed.
As reported by an AZ reporter, massive obstacles were also encountered on the counterrail – through numerous Gaffer.
The fire department took note of the identification marks of the vehicle drivers, who now have to expect sensitive punishments.
Shortly after 18:45 a second accident happened on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.
There was a collision between a car transporter and a car.
A rescue helicopter was on its way to the accident site.
Deutsche Bahn: Group tests "Comfort Check-in"
It's a moment that almost everyone's ever experienced: nothing to suspect you're sitting on the train and sleeping.
Or you're deeper into your work and you just have a brilliant thought.
And then: puff.
Comes the creator and wakes up an unsavory or rips the passenger out of the middle of the workflow.
Ticket control.
But the times of interruptions are soon over.
The Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the unscrupulous ticket control.
You simply confirm by phone that you take your seat and devalue the ticket.
A test operation is currently running on two routes.
"If the offer arrives, let's expand it.
It is expected to be available at the beginning of next year on many other long-distance routes in Germany," said a railway spokesperson.
"Comfort Check-in" the railway calls the ticket evaluation without a creator.
In order to be able to use them, however, some prerequisites have to be met: you need a smartphone or a tablet.
And you must have booked an online ticket - which is what most passengers do anyway.
You also have to use the app of the train that DB Navigator has purchased, which is anyway the most convenient way of booking a ticket.
And last time you need a seat reservation.
Because the "Comfort Check-in" works like this: You get on the train, call your ticket under "My Tickets".
A button for electronic evaluation will then appear in the test customers.
The train attendants receive a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and has taken the booked seat Y.
When the train attendant comes to Place Y at the ticket check, he knows that there is a passenger with an already devalued online ticket.
So you can continue to sleep, continue to work, keep quiet.
The "Check-in" has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train - which in turn should use the passenger.
"Who wants to travel by our train attendants without a ticket control, simply check in at the DB Navigator himself.
This makes it possible for passengers to make their travel time more personal by train," says Michael Peterson, Marketing Director of DB Fernfahrt.
Second Plus: "And our employees have more time than today to address individual customer needs".
Those who often travel by train know that, in addition to delays and missed trains, ticket checks are among the biggest annoyances.
Because often you, but in any case one of the passengers, do not have all the documents you need to devalue online tickets.
Either the credit card or the ID card is missing or a document is required.
The result is endless discussions between train attendants and passengers, which leads to a bad mood in the compartment or large room and delays in controlling your own ticket and the creator at the end takes the time to take care of other concerns.
Only a small number of test customers can still use the new service.
And this also only on the connections ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.
Further train numbers on the same route are not yet fully accessible.
How an activist came to learn the answer to the question, "Whose Streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to her core.
Just one day after she arrived in New York City, the one in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an airbnb apartment that she rented and rolled through Facebook on her phone.
She stumbled over a mail from someone from high school.
"The police just killed an 18-year-old child, and it's still on the street," it said.
Confused, as no one else had posted the information on their feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with the handle @TheePharoah was constantly retweeted on their timeline.
The rapper from the area of St. Louis was about to tweet the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo.
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body that was stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours.
"That's wild," Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new to her and her community.
She dropped off her phone to return to tweets about people on the Canfield Drive later in the evening.
There were photos of the police band and people screaming, and of a man who claimed to be Brown's father carrying a sign with the inscription: "Ferguson's police just killed my unarmed son!"
She watched a live feed in which a policeman stood in front of a group of demonstrators with a barking dog.
In another video, she said, another policeman unarmed his gun and shouted, "I will kill you... animals all."
"This is not common," Ferrell recalled her statement.
"This is not the kind of murder that we've got used to and that we can call typical."
At this moment I felt chilly.
I was angry and crying."
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 23 o'clock, she picked up her six-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the next morning the two would go to Ferguson.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson in the next three years is the theme of a new documentary, "Whose Streets?", in the cinemas from the 11th.
It is a history of survival and protest, of love and loss, of strength and resistance, which consists of the vision of people living in the community and who have filled the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell went to Ferguson with her daughter, who wore a flower dress and a suitable crown, they discussed a conversation that they had innumerable times before this morning "about the black experience and the black condition".
"You remember how I taught you when black people had to fight for what they believed?" she recalled what she said.
"We're going to Ferguson now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that wasn't right.
I couldn't take her with me," said Ferrell later.
"What happened today is a culmination of what happened in the past.
She needs to know and see it and be brought up in it.
It must be well developed to know not only activism and organization, but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we must do to become free to free ourselves.
Even though I am lucky to give her an experience where she personally does not experience blatant racism, she is no different than the next black woman child.
I have the feeling that I would do her a bad service to keep her away."
The first station when they arrived in Ferguson was located on South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police station that became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non-prosecution of Officer Darren Wilson.
There, Ferrell and her daughter joined a local business owner who had lunch.
They prepared bags and helped pass them on to demonstrators.
Slowly a new kind of activism began to take shape for Ferrell.
"My activism changed completely after August 9th," she said, noting that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities.
"I had no experience in organizing.
Everything has come."
Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's co-directors, during an evening demonstration.
Folayan said that she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar only wanted to "document" what happened.
One question came to mind: "Do you want to document or are you trying to find a story that you can exploit?"
This scepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often by whites - in a community that benefited from its pain and resilience.
As Folayan recently explained in an interview: "We had heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson did not center their voices and we wanted to make it different."
Folayan had already collaborated with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the field known for his activism around death penalty inmates.
His commitment brought Ferrell closer to the project, along with six other locals followed the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years after Brown's shooting.
"This documentary isn't someone who talks for us or talks to us. We talk," said Davis.
"That was the main thing for me, how these people are represented, because that's how I'm going to be represented."
The goal was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - to show that the movement "is not a Messiah leader, but a community that comes together," said Folayan - she proved to be the most open participant in the film.
As a result, documents from "Whose Streets?" reveal surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life, how she falls in love and marries her wife.
"I felt like naked," said Ferrell, laughing when she saw the finished product for the first time.
"But I have understood that there must be a certain vulnerability in this work and in the humanization of black people."
In addition, Ferrell's story repeats the role of black gay women in the broader Black-Lifes-Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement who, after the death of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, influenced the film "BlacklivesMatter" in social media identify themselves as gay.
"Black, gay women in leadership positions have worn the movement as a whole," said Ferrell, "and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fronts.
Black, gay women have to bear the main burden of everything."
Folayan agreed to note that "the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women".
However, it insists that "this is not an affirmative type of action" in which Ferrell was selected as the heart of the film because of her identity.
"She was the person who shook up this energy," she said.
"It's not a coincidence, although it was on the front line, because in a life at these intersections as a black, gay woman is so much at stake.
You can feel their energy through the screen."
Meanwhile, news cameras in Ferguson have long since disappeared, but the racial connections between the community and the police continue to exist.
Ferrell is on probation for 21⁄2 years because of blocking a highway during a demonstration.
She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls her home: "A chaos".
Nevertheless, she clings to a song and she feels obliged to remember this since she went to the street in Ferguson three years ago.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It's our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose except our chains."
From "Dream" to "Größenwand": TV readers discuss bit gallery
The bit gallery moves people even though it is not built for a long time.
But the idea of a shopping centre at the south end of the pedestrian zone splits the population into supporters and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.
Coldly leaves the subject hardly one.
The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg".
While the ones say to the bit gallery: "That would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That would be really great" (Nicole showers), come from the other side: "Does not need a man" (Siggi Betzen) or simply: "Great wonder!" (Lars Scholz).
While the supporters build on the fact that a gallery attracts more customers to the city, which also benefits from the other shops, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will then bleed out.
In addition, the gallery is planned exactly on the plot on which the Farmer's Market Hall is located, where 13 direct marketers offer their products.
At the beginning of the construction work, this will be over.
The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to the Beda square with the possibility to sit outside.
Simone Zimmer: "For many years we have been buying almost weekly in the Farmermarkthalle.
Mostly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the landwives always like very much.
We also discovered the masonry for ourselves.
We would like to see a chance to maintain this offer during and above all after the construction of the gallery.
In other cities, there are too.
The Kleinmarkthalle in Frankfurt is especially interesting."
Gerd Densing: "Whether direct marketers are located in a market hall in the gallery, it depends on the amount of rent.
However, it is not likely to be very low in the new project."
Eva Kilic: "Where shopping palaces in Bitburg?
Whether clothing, shoes, drugstores or supermarkets: I find this unnecessary.
There's enough of that in our city.
You can see how many stores here are empty - some for months and years.
However, since there is not even a regular weekly market here, it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains.
After all, the product offered there is fresh, is mostly offered directly by the producer and is above all cheap.
As you can see, shops in a shopping mall are rented only by larger companies, because the rentals there are often not portable for a retailer.
Too bad, there's almost no more special business and what's left of it will probably disappear."
Wolf Fandel: "A shopping centre with a market hall doesn't fit with me.
And the gallery doesn't fit into Bitburg.
Above all, where should the Farmer's Market Hall go during the construction period?
The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long run, if the bit gallery actually comes at some point.
Or does the ghost bit gallery manage to drive all shops out of Bitburg before?"
George Marquet: "That just won't work.
And a shopping center that's empty doesn't need anyone.
In my opinion, it would have been better to promote a real farmer market instead of this gallery.
But for a farmer's market hall, thanks to the insanely many - as I find it - construction projects in Bitburg no longer have a place.
When the Farmer's Market Hall is destroyed, a piece of culture will disappear again."
A matching resemblance: Artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning's DNA
In the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York there are many faces - white, black and brown, which are almost inconspicuously the same - hanging on cables from the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupfern and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth Prison, where the former intelligence analyst was sentenced to 35 years in prison after she made secret diplomatic reports about WikiLeaks' website.
The new exhibition, which was opened on 2 August, is called A Becoming Resemblance (A Matching Similarity).
It is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline united their expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a trans-female and groundbreaking dissident whose condemnation of Barack Obama was converted when he had only three days left in his office.
Dewey-Hagborg, through the algorithmic analysis of the DNA extracted by Manning and created from the 30 portraits, how someone might look with these genomic data, has created a sharp, though some intellectual comment not only on the formability of DNA data - the many ways in which they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also on identity.
Manning, who was born Bradley Edward, but has already openly talked about identification as a woman since her puberty, was convicted of 20 charges in 2013, including six violations of the spying law, computer fraud and theft.
Through the prison her image was suppressed, so much so that there was only one photo - a grainy, black-and-white selfie, in which Manning apparently sat unwell on a driver's seat and wore a platinum blonde wig - to which she was associated.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg just came from the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.
In it, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts such as cigarette stump and chewing gum by extracting the DNA from the waste to create a picture of what these people might look like.
That was the time she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.
"They interviewed Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," Dewey-Hagborg explained at a press preview of the new exhibition.
And she couldn't visit at that time and she couldn't be photographed, so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.
The artist and her incarcerated museum became unequal friends of letters who exchanged several letters over the course of two years.
They even created a comic "Suppressed Images" illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which predicted a future in which President Chelsea's judgment would be transformed and she would be able to see the exhibition in person.
That Obama would in fact require Manning's release only a few days after the book was published, after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas, was a welcome kind of happy meeting.
There is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump wages a war against informants from the government camp and against Transgender troops to find new, tweetable ways to further ignite the rigid divisions that he was supposed to fix.
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things, she said that "things happen for a certain reason."
In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning called for an end to "automatic fragmentation, the basis of which has been sex, race, sexuality and culture" with its oversized signature below (the "i" in her family name is marked with a heart).
On the opposite wall is its mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousand feet of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show by the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotide after the artist's highly developed scientific lexicon) how amazingly similar, at least in biological terms, we are all.
"What people will hopefully take with it is that our genome does not care about who we are and how open genetic data is for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work of 2007, Spurious Memories, can also be seen.
"DNA data can tell so many different stories, that's why it's 30 of these stories."
The last piece in the exhibition, which is stored in a separate room, is a page from the comic novelle mentioned above.
She shows Manning how she shows up with a freephone in her hand from the disciplines of the United States like King-Kong.
"If they make your speech cold, they have won," it says.
"Never shut your mouth."
"It came directly from a letter she wrote to me," said the artist who greets from Philadelphia.
"I still get goose bumps when I talk about it."
Manning has not seen the exhibition in person yet - as anticipated in the comic book - but if she should do so, she will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks, by her own genomic Simacres, which gather like hordes of Protestants.
This was also targeted, like everything in the exhibition, up to the size (5 " 2, Mannings Statur), where their genetic haplogroups were written with pencil.
"In the past, I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," said Dewey-Hagborg of the portraits.
"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea, like the movement that was also behind her liberation."
Professor of the University of Northwestern and an employee of the University of Oxford seeking death
A nationwide human hunt is under way for a professor at Northwestern University and a staff member at Oxford University who is considered a suspect after a man has been stabbed in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with fatal injuries.
On Monday, Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) were issued warrants for murder for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, as shown by the files of the Cook County Court of Justice.
The documents say that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several stitches.
A community warning system published by the Chicago Police Department states that the body was discovered on July 27th.
Officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body.
Cornell-Duranleau was still declared dead at the scene, and detectives are investigating the stings as murder, while the police are actively looking for the two suspects, said officials.
Lathem has been an extraordinary professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, Vice President of University Relations, said in an e-mail statement that Lathem had now been on leave and had been excluded from joining the Northwestern University campus.
"This is now a criminal case investigated by the competent authorities, and Northwestern University cooperates in this investigation," Cubbage said.
Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University.
A speaker from the University and Somerville College said in an e-mail statement that "we are in contact with the police in Great Britain and are ready to help the U.S. investigation authorities in every conceivable way."
The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and wanted him to stand up.
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department, Anthony Guglielmi, said he urged the suspects to stand up to the authorities.
"The police have an idea of their place of residence, and our efforts to locate them are intensifying," said Guglielmi.
Guglielmi said that local, regional and national authorities help find the suspects.
Guglielmi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a mysterious tip that said something had happened in apartment 1008.
The police described the scene as very cruel.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident had taken place on July 27th.
It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.
"We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," said Guglielmi.
Grand Plaza's management team published a statement to the residents: "The police are currently working on the timeline and the victim's background and are exploring a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident."
"We will conclude the WADA timetable in the near future" - the Russian Vice Prime Minister Mutko
The Russian Vice Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it will not take long until the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) for the restoration of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) are implemented.
"At a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the roadmap, RUSDA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).
The WADA timetable has been updated in this respect," said Mutko on Thursday.
The PM commented on the second part of the WADA Roadmap to comply with the Code, which describes the criteria for the re-establishment of RUSADA and was recently published on the Organisation's website.
According to Mutko, it contains nothing that could cause Russia to worry.
"Everything has been announced, everything is implemented.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the WADA in the near future," he added.
However, one of the criteria mentioned in the list states that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the investigation approved by WADA by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren on allegedly State-funded doping in Russian sport.
Regarding the matter, Mutko said: "We are conducting the investigation because our anti-doping system has made a mistake.
All measures have been implemented.
But there were no government programs, and we won't admit anything that doesn't exist."
Mutko's words were consistent with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of the independent Russian anti-doping commission.
In conversation with the Russian sales office RSport at the beginning of the day, Smirnov added problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organizations, but then added: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and rules.
No one intends to accept this report unconditionally," added Smirnov.
In November 2015, during the Doping scandal, RUSADA was excluded from the WADA from the conduct of doping controls in Russia.
However, it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping (UKAD).
After a visit to the Organization's headquarters in Moscow in July, WADA Director General Olivier Niggli said that RUSADA is moving "in the right direction" to be reinstated.
Aldi sells no more eggs for now
This was communicated by the groups of companies.
It was a purely precautionary measure, which could not be expected to be harmful to health, as stated in the Communication.
From now on, only eggs should be delivered to Aldi, which have been shown to have been tested negative for fipronil-containing anti-lysing agents.
Aldi wanted to create clarity and transparency among its customers.
The start-ups that will help your company not to become the next over
Amy Errett wanted to measure the luck of your e-commerce start-up with your employees, but the surveys didn't work.
Answers were often vague, little helpful or, worse still, deceitful.
And even if you promised anonymity, some workers did not trust the process.
"There just never was consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care company Madison Reed.
She called people from outside for help.
A new breed of Human Resources Start-ups is growing to help companies find out how their employees feel.
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it enables companies to conduct surveys, address special groups and demographic groups, provide employees with anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases allow whistleblowers to bypass the C-Suite executives and to contact the Board of Directors directly.
"You now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for tracking their health, but where is the fitbit for your business?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and chief executive of Redwood City Startup Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
Errett said that she gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with glint.
In addition to the snap surveys and surveys of certain teams, it offers a company heat card that shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which executives have low consent results - so you can rehearse why.
Companies come to see that the top of the workplace culture must remain so that you do not become the next Uber involved in scandals since a former employee has published a blog post describing an environment of harassment in which those who spoke were punished.
For start-ups like glint, this desire for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity.
The global governance, regulation and compliance industry could have more than $181.7 billion in 2020, according to the financial engineering website Let's Talk Payments.
Denver, Colorado, start-up converter, which helps companies prevent and detect bad behavior, saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year amidst the over-fare in discredit.
Convert has almost 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently signed up as a client.
Like Glint, Convert lets companies send customized "pulse" surveys, collect confidential answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline with which employees can report bad behavior.
And when the chief executive is involved, complaints go directly to the supervisory board.
"The court of public opinion has taken over the regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, founder and managing director of Convert.
When a company is found that treats its employees badly or behaves unethically, it can experience costly consequences through consumer boycott, employee flight and complaints, said Quinlan.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations, has been using Convert for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters.
Earlier, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a telephone number or e-mail for the company headquarters, file a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously.
It was often an intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel, who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees.
Now that the company is using Convercent, problems that were previously identified and addressed by executives in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair practices - can be more quickly identified and addressed.
"I can get closer to this holistic 360-degree view in the experience of employment," said Vitrano, who heads Ruby Tuesday's Risk Management Group.
"And we protect our shareholders from employment disputes."
Companies began to take ethics, values and employee engagement more seriously in 2002 after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations by the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.
But it took until the "social media came to their right" that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry from going online.
"Before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convert offer your software as a service, and charge companies with recurring fees for the use of their products.
It is a business model and an opportunity to find the consent of venture capital investors who have supported both startups.
Convercent received $10 million in February from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising the total capital to $47 million.
Glitters secured $10 million in November by Bessemer Venture Partners and brought its entire funding to $60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising given the networked nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
There is a growing complex of research that shows that today's employees expect more from their jobs than before.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are only bets.
The employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.
"When people are happy to be in a company, feel that their voices are heard, and that the work you do is worth it, then they feel more committed to succeeding this company," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, who uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies run well. Companies run well when employees engage and are engaged.
If the Analytics tools promise third-party to increase the commitment and commitment of the employees, it is no wonder that you will find support.
The data on employee engagement according to the experts in workplace culture is important.
But the data are useless if the managers of a company do not take action.
In fact, when a company asks employees for your feedback, it may have a expectation that change is on the way.
And if change doesn't come fast enough, or not at all, it can breed disappointments and defy employees.
"If you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you must be ready to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Katter International, which has seen companies that have relied too much on data collection.
"For if you don't follow, employees will ask themselves, "Have you really heard me?
Do you take care of it?
And whoever you don't care about, why should I?"
Madison Reed, who now conducts monthly employee surveys, was able to initiate measures on the same day when a problem is reported about glint, says Errett.
And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees, it was through the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, able to reorganize several teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems.
At Ruby Tuesday, the company is constantly gaining new insights about the employees, and it hopes that in the long run, this will lead to a better bonding of employees in an industry known for high sales.
"If you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people," Vitrano said.
"And if you lose people, you also lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you will lose companies.
The NCAA eliminates the two-day practices and makes a long day for the Bruins
It goes to 23 o'clock when a lot of UCLA football players are talking on one side of the team's new practice fields on campus.
Some have pulled out their knitted tops and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp.
For a good part of the team, these idle minutes are a lunch break.
Players enrolled in the summer courses will return to their final exams after the three-hour exercise before returning to the Wasserman Football Center at 6:30 a.m. the next morning.
"This is a real treadmill for the boys for the next three days," said Bruins coach Jim Mora shortly before Monday became Tuesday.
The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to ease the load of players, and it has actually extended its days - at least until the final on Friday.
Therefore, the first three training sessions of the UCLA should begin at 19:15 in order to meet the players' already packed schedules.
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day on which the Bruins moved the start of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mora's six seasons in Westwood practical exercises.
They are scheduled to hold 18 exercises during August. 20 before the start of the formal game preparations for their start against Texas A & M in September.
Mora said he supports the rule change of the NCAA, even if they add another point to the busy routes of the players.
"We put this enormous burden on them for three or four days, and it is very challenging," Mora said.
"And they just pushed it through, they keep plaguing, they're great people.
I think as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time, it will be really great."
The UCLA will end its practices as soon as the camp is finished, which, given the clear lines of view of its fields from an adjacent car park and the adjacent Luskin Center, a hotel of the high class, which has already been thrown with footballs that cleared a protective net behind a torpedo, will not be an easy task.
Bruins players are supposed to occupy the hotel from this weekend, but Mora admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season.
"We will use our security," Mora said.
"This is a real problem, and it's not far to think that people rent a room there and then adjust to record an exercise there.
If you have the videotape of an exercise, it's a pretty good business.
But we have security forces there, and we have security forces in parking 8.
We'll do the best we can with what we have.
I'm not too worried about that.
We have a plan."
Facebook wants to intensify fact-checking in the fight against fake news
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false reports to third-party fact reviewers and then display their results under the original post, said the world's largest online social network on Thursday. It is one of its efforts to combat fake news.
The company said in a statement on its website that it will start using updated machine learning methods to detect possible mis-reports and send them to factual reviewers who may display the results of the fact-finding from the original article.
Facebook was criticized as one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news, many of which believe that they also influenced the US presidential elections in 2016.
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe, with French voters flooded with false stories in the run-up to the presidential elections in May, and Germany supports a plan to punish social media networks if they fail to quickly eliminate hate-filled postings as before the elections there in September.
On Thursday, Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new fact-finding review will be launched in the USA, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to knowing what stories are being challenged by third-party fact reviewers, people want more context to make informed decisions about what they are reading and sharing," said Sara Su, product manager for Facebook news in a blog.
She added that Facebook will continue to test its feature on the "related article" and work on other changes to its news feed to reduce false messages.
Create a comic novel: A castle in the history of England
In his recent past, the small Scotney Castle was shown in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his cozy seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent and has now become the inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mobile Yorkshireman with a fondness for historical documents.
"I like to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years," he laments.
"What a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand."
'A Castle in England' extends the period from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scotney. Each story was illustrated by another, emerging British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
It is not the first book by Rhodes based on an archive: He wrote in 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he found unexpectedly emotional.
"I only reacted to the thumbprint on the side of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700s who worked for the Jacobins," he says.
"This is his thumbprint!
Letters always smell like smoke, for at that time a fire was lit because of the light.
For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect, as if he himself were there.
Oh, I love archives!"
For someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ("To be honest: I have overestimated my welcome") all this seems too nice to be true.
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, looking through the archives and studying the many treasures and curiousities of the castle, such as the mounted hyena heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the trench.
He wandered through the grounds and the ruins of the old castle and talked to landscapers, gardeners and sometimes also the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.
Then, at night, he drank whiskey and started writing.
The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown, as the National Trust only gained full access in 2006 when the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived a decade later, the employees just started to take care of the archive, which he described as "hundreds of years in which aristocrats said "Oh, throw it to the attic".
Diaries, letters from the time of the English Empire, maps depicting who owned what: "One might think that country conflicts would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was a birch fighting for the two families.
Guys, let everything go its way!"
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to dive into English history on a broader basis, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381.
"There is a record of a riot that occurred in 1380 in the castle, in this book entitled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex'," says Rhodes.
"The peasant uprising began in this area and I thought that an uprising was a good start.
Maybe they're connected?"
Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - such as 'The Priest', which tells the story of the Jesuit Father, whom the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or 'The Smuggler', in which smuggler Arthur Darrell from the 18th century is depicted, who staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery that was made only years later when his coffin was excavated).
The Darrells are Rhodes' favorite family of Scotney: "The gentlemen seemed to be quite geeks, to make debt over and over again, and to spend money on things they couldn't afford.
Other generations of Darrell men solved their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of good-looking boys, with a talent to advertise in."
After the end of his engagement in the castle, Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences
He has brought behind him a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elämänmäki, the site of a Sanatorium from the early 20th century, which has since been demanded back by nature.
But Scotney has a special place for him.
"I was sad to go again," he says.
It was like, "Oh, now I have to deal with the fucking life again."
Campaign started: Over 300 years old Marienkapelle covered in Rhöndorf
With the cover of the 301-year-old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf, the city of Bad Honnef launched its campaign on Friday to introduce a new roof brand (round view of Thursday).
Until Thursday, Mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team around Nelson Artz want to keep the logo and the slogan secret.
At the end of August there will be a festival on the island of Grafenwerth as the highlight of the campaign.
"Too good for us.
Or?", the makers of the action asked on the posters at the Rhöndorfer Kapelle yesterday.
"We don't really think that (of course!)", they write on their website that was fully accessible yesterday.
"But we use this measure to gain your attention.
And to make it clear that some things are better than it seems.
Basically, we are firmly convinced that as Bad Honnefer we citizens know very well about the beauty and attractiveness of our city."
The action involves more than "only" a logo and a slogan, it goes on to say.
"It is necessary to formulate a single promise, one that gives the city an unmistakable unique attitude".
Finally, they compete with other municipalities.
The city of Bad Honnef can cost a medium five-digit sum of its new roof brand and the campaign.
Military reforms in Turkey - Erdogan's fear of the army
Every year at the beginning of August, Ankara, the Supreme Military Council (YAS) advises on retirements and promotions in the Officer's Corps.
So is this week.
At first glance a normal process.
But nothing is routine among the Turkish forces one year after the coup attempt.
The meeting was no longer held in the General Staff building, as before, but in the Prime Minister's office.
The five vice-presidents, as well as the Ministers for Defence, Home Affairs, Justice and Foreign Affairs, were now taking part in the deliberations under the chairmanship of the Heads of Government.
Thus, the civilians in the YAS were in excess.
The government is pulling the reins in the military.
General Chief of Staff Hulusi Akar remains in office, but the commanders of the army, the Air Force and the Navy have been deposed.
Since the failed coup, Head of State Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals.
Over 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of the exile preacher Fethullah Gülen, whom Erdogan sees as a wire puller of the coup attempt.
Against 486 people who are supposed to have been directly involved in the coup trial, the deal has been in Ankara since this week.
The day after the coup, Erdogan had already described the attempt to overthrow him as a "gift of God" because he gave him the opportunity to "clean the entire army".
But does Erdogan really control the army?
At the end of February, the newspaper "Hürriyet" published an article entitled "Unbehagen im Militär-Hauptquartier".
In the General Staff there are concerns about an increasing "Islamization" of the army, which manifests itself, among other things, in the lifting of the head cloth ban for soldiers, the newspaper wrote.
The major cleaning of the army and the security forces is at least continuing.
In mid-July, Erdogan had another 7395 state servants fired by decree, including 2303 policemen and 546 soldiers.
It seemed that Erdogan tamed the military.
The generals were considered earlier than the real masters of the country.
Three times they took advantage of their role as guardians of the secular order.
After his election victory in 2002, Erdogan pushed back the power of the military step by step, not least on the basis of the European Union's reforms.
Former officers say that Erdogan is actively pushing forward an Islamization of the armed forces.
In the "Vocal Europe" magazine, a not-called officer who sought asylum for the attempted coup for fear of persecution abroad warned that the Turkish army would be "full of extremists and salafists" in a few years.
If this happens, such a development could not leave NATO cold.
In any case, there is doubt in the Alliance after the cleaning of the Turkish army about the willingness to use it.
Leadership structures and operational skills are "weak", say NATO diplomats.
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
There will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card, said President Donald Trump, quoted by the media.
It provides for a reduction of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, stricter rules for obtaining visas for temporary work permits and restrictions for family-oriented visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the President.
The draft law is to be discussed in the two Chambers of Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers, and will do so by changing the way the US spends Green Cards on citizens from other countries."
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system.
This new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English, who have the financial resources to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy," said Trump, quoted by the American media.
Ministry wants to renovate route for racing ladder shuttle
Over and over in the past few months, the future of the race ladder shuttle had been disputed - now it is time to go quickly.
Even before the end of the year, the marod route on which the tourist train runs is to be built.
According to the Ministry of Transport, in order to secure the future of the racing ladder shuttle, construction work on the track is scheduled to begin this year.
"With the decision to continue ordering and renovating the Ilmenau-Rennsteig route, the country confesses to this important connection especially for tourism," said Transport State Secretary Klaus Sühl in Erfurt on Friday.
The cost of rehabilitating the route amounted to approximately EUR 2.5 million.
Of this amount, the country takes over 75 percent.
The contract, on the basis of which the shuttle will continue to be ordered by the country in the future, is currently being finalised, says Sühl.
The Ministry and the South Thüringen Railway as operators already agree on the technical details.
"This means that the timetable, the vehicles used and the quality standards are negotiated," said Sühl.
The planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company was concluded for a period of 11 years.
This meant that the race track shuttle should be ordered regularly on December 2017.
The Rennsteig-Shuttle is a railway connection between Ilmenau and Rennsteig stations, which is particularly popular with tourists.
Over the past few months, it has been tested in the course of a pilot operation whether the route is used by enough people to order it again regularly in the future.
The route is also strongly built in parts.
The rise of sex robots is real, and we should worry.
Just when you thought it couldn't be more crazy in 2017, a new report on the technological developments in the field of sex robots comes.
Yeah, actually.
Sex robots are a big deal right now.
Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Sharkey, an emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we must begin to take her ascent seriously.
Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingernail.
"People make fun of them, but the companies deliver a lot of them, and we will see them much more often," said Mr. Sharkey when he published his new report.
Modern sex dolls have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions achieved by artificial intelligence.
The user can also "adjust" his robot according to his beliefs and choose everything, from the robot's eye color to the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his fingernails.
But it becomes even more disturbing, as many robots have the "personalities" that would make a stepford woman look progressive.
Modern sex dolls have developed into robots with a silicone skin.
For example, the RealBotix robot allows its users to adapt their robots to the features they find appealing, such as shyness.
And then there are the Roxxxy Gold sex robots developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities such as "Frigid Farrah", which conveys the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventured" personality.
"Roxxy Gold has a personality that is as well adapted to your personality as possible," says the True Companion website.
So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.
She also has her moods during the day - just like real people!
She can be tired, fixated on conversation or she can be "in mood"!"
There are many disturbing aspects to this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the subjugated female qualities, the allusions to rape, when one takes a step towards Frigid (here referred to as resisting) Farrah, trouble one the most.
On his website True Companion Roxxxy compared to a vibrator, but for men.
"If women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can't men have Roxxxy?" says the website.
However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy.
Their emergence and their increasing ingenuity indicate something darker and deeper in our culture, a withdrawal from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition.
Of course, most men will not hold sex robots, and while the FRR notes their increasing popularity, they remain temporarily on the verge of consumer culture.
But what permeates from the periphery can be very instructive with regard to the spirit of the time in which we live.
And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market gives them permission to do so.
There is a certain overlap in the fact that these highly developed sex robots appear at a time when women's rights worldwide are threatened, when there is a president in the White House who has talked about having sexually attacked women.
The most deterrent aspect of the television series 'The Handmaid's Tale' ('The Magistrate's Report') is not the graphic images, the devoured bodies and the protruded eyes, but the reality of this vision.
The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment this does not feel like a big leap.
The aim behind these sex robots is to produce a physical resemblance to actual women as realistic as possible (even with pornstar proportions).
Their builders want them to feel human, to imitate the movement of a real body.
But, brought to the point, when it comes to their "personalities", the robots are not real women.
You cannot separate from your companion or simply leave.
They have no mediation or background history, nothing that suggests independence or anything that could interfere with the imagination of total submission.
In other words, they are good slaves.
Or to express it in the 2017 speech: maid
Trump's great performance?
He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of common sense
It has become an ironic wisdom of the Trump era that the political divisions that have polarized the US empire have also split families in small format.
Around Christmas and harvest Thanksgiving there were newspapers in the USA advising on how to deal with the horror of Trump-elected relatives.
We all allegedly exert ourselves to let our filter bubbles burst.
Less has been noticed the power of Trump to bring families together.
I mention this because my cousin, a left-wing poet who lives in Chicago and has been dealing with the Republicans in our family for a long time, has visited me in New York this week.
She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican relationship with which she had been fighting for decades for politics, is suddenly and quite strange on the same side.
This is certainly a good thing about the dining table, but I am aware in another context that this also entails considerable risks.
The left was strengthened by Trump, but the devastating effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.
When we speak of "normalization" and Trump, we refer to the scary possibility that someday his mates will no longer repudiate us.
There is, however, an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump Republicans of the right wing "normalize" suddenly appear to be the concept of rationality compared to its standards.
Today I find myself affected by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's original version of the crazy - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew what his tax return looked like) - both of which, compared to Trump, are indeed a very mild crime.
When Trump goes, the next Republican candidate only needs to be spiritually healthy in order to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.
When my cousin was in town, we took our children to the carousel in Central Park, the largest carousel in the New York Park Department, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need a caffeine.
The horses are huge, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all the clowns are grumpy and the animals twist to look full of fear over their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climbing music conveys this in a strange way.
So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of high buildings become old, the skylines become too familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city does not satisfy the dream.
Thirty-five years later, and I'm still not quite over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is actually not a Swiss cottage - the theme pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage does not count - but a large roundabout in the north of London.
The Central Park Carousel, however, is still a strange magical experience, as here two two-year-olds, one 11-year-old and two women in the 40s can walk on it and all have a great time.
If I could have evaluated the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately nobody asked about it.
On the other hand, this week I was forced in a department store to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card.
In the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same, plus the option to compare the rating with a 15% tip - this to buy something over the barn table.
This not only results in slowing down what should be a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where none is necessary.
The poor woman in the department store was apologizingly grinning, while I was tired of the experience of reaching her my credit card with five stars.
Oscar Pistorius transferred from prison to hospital with chest pain
Pistorius left the prison for a hospital visit for the second time.
Last year, because of the treatment of cuts on his wrists, he was taken to the hospital, which according to the prison authorities suffered a case in his cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after an appeal by the prosecutors against a first death sentence.
He killed Steenkamp in the early morning hours of Valentine's Day 2013 by shooting them at her several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed that he considered his girlfriend to be a nightly intruder hiding in the cabin.
The prosecutors have announced their intention to object this time to the six-year sentence of Pistorius Appeal, which they say is too permissive.
The National Law Enforcement Authority said that it would raise an objection at the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the objection could be heard this year.
Pistorius runs the risk that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosecutors are successful.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
When Bauer Arnold finds a strange egg
As the last of the Blumberger schools, the four klässlers from Fützen and Epfenhofen were released into the holiday and into the secondary schools.
Three of the discharge students will go to high school in the future, four to the real school.
On Tuesday evening, headmaster Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Biesental Bürgerhaus in Epfenhofen.
The 29 students of the four classes under the direction of Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder chose a young eagle to grow up in the chicken farm, but then to be released into freedom.
For this purpose, the cheerful crowd performed a musical titled "The Eagle in the Chicken Farm".
Bauer Arnold found a strange egg, and had it hatched from his chickens.
Instead of a chicken chick, a small eagle came out.
But the hope of making a chicken out of him broke, and the eagle spread out his wings on a high mountain and disappeared.
After that, classes three and four showed a chicken dance in the study of Yvonne Frank.
The hens danced around the bet with the young gamblers carrying cylinders.
The eagle stands for integration, said headmaster Angelika Sitte.
The young animal is different from the other young ones (chickens), but this is part of it.
But he'll never be like a chicken.
His purpose is to be free.
She wished every fourth grader to feel accepted in his new school.
A word of thanks followed to the colleagues, former headmaster Michael Müller, who keeps getting involved in schooling sessions, and the parents' representatives.
The chick time is now over, said class teacher Sophia Schumacher.
After two years of teaching, she was very reluctant to let her students go, because it was a really great time.
Finally, she could have relied on the four-kläsler.
At the end of the day, all the students had a song of summer time and holiday time.
There was great joy among the children.
Eight first graders have already been registered for the new school year.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal camping in Greece, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, quoted by television, announced.
On the morning of August 1st, the police arrested a group of illegally camping people in Sithonia, including the two Bulgarians.
On the same day they were released while an investigation is ongoing.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported to bTV that the Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have tightened up control of the free camp and impose considerable fines on anyone who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose.
The checks will be continued throughout the season.
The Ministry said that the court can impose a fine.
Software update for diesel vehicles: What the affected people need to know now
How exactly does the software update take place?
Do diesel drivers have to take part in the action?
The most important questions and answers at a glance.
At the Diesel Summit, BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for a total of 5.3 million cars.
They aim to improve the exhaust behaviour of Euro 5 and Euro 6 emission class cars.
Euro-4 diesel or worse are excluded.
Anja Smetanine from ACE Auto Club Europe gives estimates:
Is the new action mandatory?
No, the negotiated software updates are voluntary.
"The mandatory updates previously apply only to the vehicles that have cloud software," says Anja Smetanin.
Their retrofitting has been ordered by the Federal Motor Vehicles Agency (KBA).
How and from when will customers be informed about updates?
Manufacturers have announced a rapid implementation in the coming months, but have not yet specified a precise date.
Daimler has informed us to write to each person concerned.
If an inspection was required anyway, it would be carried out within the scope of the inspection.
How long should the upgrades as a whole last?
"It's hard to say," said Smetanin.
This depends on the commitment of the manufacturers and on the political pressure.
"For we have seen that car manufacturers have not acted voluntarily on environmental issues so far."
How long will the update take?
The conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop.
It could be more time-consuming to get an appointment.
What do motorists do that don't drive a car from BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group?
The ACE advises to wait.
According to Smetanine, it is likely that foreign producers would move.
Does a massive price decline of Euro-4 cars now threaten?
The ACE fears this.
But in the regions where driving bans are at risk.
In rural areas, there are no losses in value for older diesels.
The ACE advises to wait with one more sale.
LL Cool J receives Kennedy Center award
The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington.
The first award ceremony under President Trump promises to become political.
One of the winners doesn't want to come - out of protest.
LL Cool J (49) is the first rapper to receive one of the coveted awards of the prestigious Kennedy Center.
As the cultural institution announced on Thursday, this year singer Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68) as well as choreographer Carmen de Lavallade (86) and TV producer Norman Lear (95) are among the honoured.
The awards will be handed over at the beginning of December.
Traditionally, U.S. President Donald Trump will host a reception and participate in the award together with his wife Melania.
The winner Lear, announced with progressive TV series, therefore already announced that he would not participate in the gala.
The "New York Times" he said, "This presidency has decided to neglect the arts and human rights completely - even to deprive them of the means - and that burdens me."
Estefan, 59, stressed that she would use the conversation with Trump to clarify her point of view.
The Kennedy Center, named after former president John F. Kennedy, is the largest cultural institution in the U.S. capital.
Former winners include Meryl Streep, Aretha Franklin, Robert De Niro, George Lucas, Tom Hanks and Sting.
We make the city worth living
Roland Wacker, Haslach's mayor, will retire next year.
The job is already advertised - however, suitable candidates are rare.
Wacker has been a city builder for 31 years.
And the work is still great fun for him, as he conveys in the press.
He reports of varied but also demanding tasks that await his successors.
At the same time, he is surprised that no application has yet met the requirement profile.
The city is looking for an architect or construction engineer at the nearest possible time.
Thus, taking into account the regular notice periods, there should still be enough time for inclusion.
As Haslach acts as the Lower Building Rights Authority for the administrative community, the applicant must provide appropriate clearances.
Because this function definitely wants to keep the city.
If they could no longer fill these out, citizens would have to go to Offenburg for advice.
But proximity to citizens is important to the city and to itself, says Wacker, who reports on a good business environment as well as a good mood between government and citizens.
In more than 30 years in office, some important projects have gathered, looking back on Wacker with pride.
"We make the city worth living", he is sure about the building office and his employees.
But also in the future, varied projects are on the agenda: for example, the transformation of the former Hukla area and the Niederhofen parking lot has begun.
The Kinzig bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is renewed, and the stadium renovation is still a topic.
The latter alone is going to hit the beech with around 1.5 million euros, "if we do it right," Wacker estimates.
"All in all, great tasks await my successors.
The work here is fun."
There is great room for a city builder.
With Haslach's own farm and gardening, you can react to many things quite flexibly.
"You can move a lot," says Wacker, and the design of the greenery is often praised by citizens and visitors.
Since the old town is under monumental protection as an ensemble, it is important to "have an eye for what fits in", when new buildings are approved, the outgoing mayor emphasizes.
In any case, the mayor bears high responsibility.
He's a builder, "in the end, everything runs over my table."
With support and coordination, he can count on many years of employees: Markus Neumaier (Hochbau) has been there for ten years, Manfred Schöner (Diefbau) has been there for 15 years.
Also, that his successor remains for a long time, Wacker wishes: "We are looking for someone who really wants to identify with the place and stay".
Continuity is important not only for a good business environment, but also for the further design of the city.
If you want to inherit Roland Wacker, you should be able to complete your studies as a diploma engineer or a bachelor with a specialty in architecture and have good expertise in the fields of building planning and building planning law.
The city building office is subject to civil engineering and civil engineering, construction planning, basic employment, management of urban properties, urban farm with building yard and urban gardening as well as the Lower Building Rights Authority including monumental protection.
Bicycle thrown on wires: Südbahnstrecke locked
According to the police, the so far unknown perpetrators had thrown the blue bike from the railway transmission in the area of Leobener Straße (B116) on the lines.
These were so damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped.
The investigators go from two male perpetrators and have been looking for them since the night.
Close to the scene of the crime, witnesses observed a pink scooter and a bicycle driver.
"This goes far beyond a Lausbubenstrich," said ÖBB-speaker Christoph Posch to the APA.
The perpetrator or perpetrators would have put themselves in great danger and also put the train at risk.
In addition to the damage to the locomotive and the installation as well as the delay minutes and the costs of rail replacement traffic, the rail customers could also be paid to the perpetrators.
Overall, the speaker said that a "significant" sum should be taken.
The damage had been remedied on Friday afternoon, the railway traffic on the southern railway line could be conducted without hindrance.
Almost ten passenger trains had fallen out on Friday morning, two of them related to long distance traffic.
Freight trains did not fall out, but they were late.
According to ÖBB-speaker Christoph Posch, about 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced.
Insulators and masts were also damaged.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help to relieve IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.
But a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
The incurable condition, affecting around 1.3 million in the United States and 300,000 in the United Kingdom, causes stomach cramps and flatulence, recurrent or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
While the affected people are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at Washington University found that the essential amino acid Tryptophan of proteins contributes to the development of immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine.
The lead researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells in the intestine are patrolling to ensure that harmful microbes hidden in the food do not penetrate the body.
Cells capable of triggering inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance tends too far towards inflammation, an inflammatory bowel disease can result.
Experiments found that a type of tolerance-promoting immune cell occurs in mice that carry a certain bacterium in their intestines.
And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.
Professor Colonna said: "We have established a link between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestinal microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.
The more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had of these immune cells".
He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan promote more tolerant, less inflammatory bowel disease, if the same system works even in humans.
Postdoctoral Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan investigated a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found out that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same strain, but which was separated, did not have this.
She suspected that the difference had to do with the intestinal microbiomes of mice - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The intestines of the mice were sequenced by DNA and six bacterial species were found that were present in the mice with the immune cells, but were missing without them in the mice.
Mouses were raised in a sterile environment, so they lacked a intestinal microbiome and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells.
To understand how the bacteria affected the immune system, researchers let L. reuteri grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - to immature immune cells isolated by the mice.
The immune cells developed into the tolerance-promoting cells.
When the active component was purified from the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of Tryptophan metabolism known as indole-3 lactic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the lining of the mice, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophan values were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerance-promoting cells as mice, and that most of us L. reuteri protect in our gastrointestinal tracts.
It is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
She said, "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote, as these cells control inflammations on the internal surface of the intestine.
Potentially, high levels of tryptophan in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an expansion of this population."
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United has committed a "genie" with Nemanja Matic
At Manchester United, when Nemanja Matic signed a "genie", Jose Mourinho believes that after the midfielder had his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening.
The 40 million pounds signature of Chelsea began with a 2:1 win in Dublin, the last preseason game, before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid starts on Tuesday, and impressed in the holder role when people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira acted as desired.
However, Matic was excluded from the Blues' preparatory Asian tour and managed only 45 minutes, which Mourinho admitted he had to improve before the Premier League season began.
"He needs time, but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football," said Mourinho.
"We will help him to be ready sooner than later."
In addition to Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku started in the Aviva Stadium when Mourinho formed his XI for the beginning of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wanted three further new commitments, but he insisted that the club had already done a "fantastic work" to fulfill three of his four priority new commitments.
"To get three out of four, for which I thank the club," he added.
"I'll be happier if they get four out of four for me, but they've made a lot of effort."
Boeing "malt" Dreamliner in the sky
The US aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the silhouette of a dreamliner in the sky.
The pilots flew from Seattle in Washington, but the drawing began in Marquette, Michigan, and moved over the United States in the form of a dreamliner, which are several thousand kilometers.
The action lasted 18 hours and one minute.
On the radar screens was the form of a dreamliner.
The whole thing was a endurance test for new engines.
Boeing had already made such advertising in the past.
Thus the number "787" and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky.
New impact for Martin Schulz - Hannover, we have a problem
How the wind turns: When Sigmar Gabriel was still head of the SPD, Social Democratic Prime Minister always looked to Berlin with some concern before elections.
Just no storm fire from the party headquarters, just no headwind from the union - that was the most important wish of the electoral fighters.
Since Martin Schulz led the party, this has changed fundamentally.
Since then, the employees from the Willy-Brandt-Haus have been watching the events in the SPD-governed state capitals with increasing horror.
What Schulz has got from there since the beginning of the year would not even be described by headwind.
It was a blowout.
One after the other.
After the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony, the Bundes-CDU sees a general signal against coalitions of SPD and Greens.
"This shows once again: Red-Green simply cannot rule reliably," said CDU Secretary General Peter Tauber to the editorial network Germany (RND).
The government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) has plunged into a serious crisis as a result of the surprising withdrawal of a Green MEP.
Five months before the election, his red-green coalition lost its one-vote majority to the opposition from CDU and FDP.
The Green Federal Managing Director Michael Kellner has asked the abject Dutch Green MEP Elke Twesten to give her mandate back.
The transition to the CDU means a clear falsification of the electoral will.
Elke Twesten has to return her mandate immediately," said the Federal Executive Director and campaign leader of the Greens to the editorial network Germany (RND).
"All this must not be true," sighs a SPD electoral campaigner when the new Job message reaches the party headquarters on Friday morning.
Stephan Weil, SPD-Minister-President of Lower Saxony, will be present without a government majority after the Green MEPs have passed Elke Twesten to the CDU.
It is the preliminary culmination of a whole series of major and small crises in SPD country associations.
And no one knows what's next.
The Misere began with the unexpected clear defeat at the Saarland elections in March.
A blue eye, no more, calmed the comrades back then.
After the Landtag elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia everything will be different.
That was the case - and things got much worse.
The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD to an end, the Düsseldorf-Pleite swept the party smooth.
In the weeks after that, the comrades came up again.
Then, when they had just taken on new courage, the G-20 summit came from Hamburg.
And with him came the next deep blow.
Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD governor, lost his Nimbus on that weekend because he was sitting in the Elbphilharmonie while his city was burning.
And because he did pretty much everything wrong in crisis communication after that, what can be done wrong.
Since then, Scholz has been fighting for his political survival.
So now also Stephan Weil.
The Dutch Prime Minister has been criticised for a long time because of the VW exhaust gas business and his role in the Supervisory Board.
Many survey values have been added.
Nevertheless, or perhaps just because, in recent weeks, Weil has been trying more and more to put emphasis on it.
The efforts of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin were not hidden from comrades in the vicinity of Martin Schulz.
They allowed him to be granted because they promised to stabilize the party from time to time.
Now the exact opposite could occur.
In this respect, because of the internal dispute between the Dutch Greens, there is no blame at all.
And Schulz isn't.
Sometimes the comrades try to keep their own ranks closed.
Their anger is directed at the Greens, and here, above all, at the apostate parliamentarian Twesten.
"It is unbearably and democratically damaging how Mrs. Twesten places her own career interests above the interests of everyone else," says Matthias Miersch, head of the party's left in the SPD-Bundestagsfaktion, the editorial network of Germany (RND).
Mrs Twesten has not been elected as a direct candidate because of her person, but has been elected to Parliament on the list of countries of the Dutch Greens, according to the Dutch MEP.
The logical consequence would be for her to return her mandate.
Thomas Oppermann, head of the SPD-Bundestag faction, complains of an "undemocratic manoeuvre".
"The electorate's will was clear four years ago: the people made Stephan Weil the Prime Minister," says Uppermann, who leads the Dutch SPD as a leading candidate in the Bundestag election, the RND.
"Now the personal career thinking of a future CDU member falsifies the election result," Oppermann continued.
He asked to clarify the background.
I want to know whether there has been more or whether there has been any further commitment from the CDU Niedersachsen.
Funding for local core III
If you want to renovate your home that has come into the years, you can soon get support from the country.
Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of STEG informed about city development on Wednesday in Empfingen.
At the beginning of the information event Schindler gave a review of what had happened so far.
Since 1991 there have been refurbishments in reception areas.
At that time, in Renovation Area I from 1991 to 2004, Baden-Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding.
In the Renovation Area II from 2005 to 2016, the grant was still 60 percent.
For Schindler, the previous renovations are a "successful project" - it is also important to promote internal development, and not just to develop new construction sites.
On April 4th, the President of the Government of Karlsruhe had received information that there would be a rehabilitation area III.
The total funding was EUR 833 333, of which EUR 500 000 would come from the country, the rest from the municipality of Empfingen.
How does a refurbishment area now come about?
Schindler continues to investigate where the "really old" houses are.
But it also plays a role whether there is any interest in renovating in the planned area.
If necessary, the boundaries of the territory could also be moved again.
The STEG represented Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel on Wednesday evening.
Keller presented the contents of the federal-country program "Sociale Stadt", in which the renovations would be carried out.
At the heart of the programme are the revitalisation of inner cities, the improvement of living and working conditions and the maintenance and expansion of infrastructure.
The measures would be carried out object-related, i.e. per plot.
The rehabilitation area would then finally be defined as a statute.
The grant period for the funding runs from 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026.
Until September of this year, however, the survey would be carried out only in the framework of which the persons involved in the rehabilitation area will receive a questionnaire to be completed.
In November or December, the Statute will be adopted as far as possible, so that the renovations can begin in the coming year.
Pietzschmann then explained that each municipality had to carry out the aforementioned preliminary investigations.
It is about assessing the urban failures and deciding when to clean up and to what extent.
A refurbishment notice will then be entered in the land register for the respective land.
Pietzschmann will come back to receiving himself and make a picture of the situation, she promised.
Gotzel stressed that a key success factor for the project was the participation of the parties involved.
That is why there will be questionnaires sent to citizens by post in the coming weeks and can be completed by the end of the summer holidays.
The yellow questionnaire is the "building and land sheet", which deals with, among other things, the structural state and the renovation intentions.
In the grey questionnaire, the "Household and Housing" sheet, information can be made about the size, distribution and residents of a living space.
The blue "operational bow" is only to be completed if business premises are operated in the building.
However, it should be noted that Gotzel points out that a completed questionnaire does not at the same time constitute an application for funding.
In addition, new construction measures are not eligible.
Schindler also stressed that the distribution of the means of support functions according to the "wind dog principle" - who comes first, first grinds.
You can't "reserve" funding money for later.
At the end, photos of the project "Ortskern II" were shown to make the present a renovation "tasteful".
British inventor sets himself a microchip to get into the house and car with a hand movement
A British inventor is the first in the country to be equipped with a microchip so that he can open his door, enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement.
Steven Northam, 33, had implanted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through their company BioTeq.
He has joined Dr. Geoff Watson, an advisory anaesthesist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure that the implant procedure is conducted according to medical standards.
The technology resembles a cat and dogs implanted microchip and takes only 30 seconds.
Mr. Northam's company also wants to change the locks on houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip, everything at an extra cost of £300 per castle.
The married father of one has now installed both at home and at his BMW Z4 technology, which begins when his hand is at the wheel.
The advertising costs of the White House cost taxpayers thousands
The White House's decision to fly a Marine Helicopter to South Lawn for an event that highlighted American production last month costs taxpayers up to $24,000 according to the military information given to the TIME magazine.
The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the president is on board, was the heart of the event on July 17 in the White House with American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior white house officials made a tour of products from all 50 states.
The helicopter manufactured in Connecticut was displayed next to a Maine yacht, a Wisconsin fire engine and a Mississippi forklift.
The White House military office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or FRAGO, just 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, after the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter.
"I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility," wrote the commander of the HMX-1 on the eve of the event of his superior, the deputy captain of the navy for aviation.
The news showed that the helicopter arrived at the South Lawn at around 7 a.m. on July 17th and stayed until the lawn was cleared between 18:00 and 21:00 this evening.
The note adds that if the departure from the White House was to be delayed, due to the limitation of duty hours, a second crew would be required for the return flight.
The original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event, while the safety staff of the unit remained on the ground at the aircraft during the time.
It was not clear from the records provided by the TIME whether a second flight crew was ultimately required.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes.
Data sets show that HMX-1 asked if the event could breach the determination.
"A question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case," said the commander.
"Sounds like you're locked up," the deputy commander replied.
The event "Made in America" was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.
But official events also have political overtones.
At the event, the president gave impetus to the reform of the health reform in progress in the Senate, and he promoted efforts to curb government regulations.
The use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are obliged to use them for the journey.
But requesting their use only for a photo-OP is unusual.
Trump conducted an investigation in February when the president aircraft did taxi services against the background of his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account is full of reports complaining about the use of the president aircraft by his predecessor.
"The White House is enthusiastic about the show "Made In America" - the products from all 50 states that are made by American workers with American materials," said Lindsay Walters, Deputy Press Secretary of the White House.
HMX-1 crews often perform training flights in the area around Washington and South Lawn to sell the U.S. President in the White House with precise centimeters.
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July, HMX-1 conducted 58 exercises in the White House.
The flight for the "Made in America" event counted in the training needs of the flight crew for the month, said one official.
Helicopter units flew 11 hours on this day for "non-presidency support missions".
The White House said that the taxpayers took over the burden for none of the other props presented at the event.
A spokesperson from Sikorsky said that the company was not involved in exhibiting the helicopter on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not have budget records for the presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.
However, according to the US Department of Defense's hourly rates for the 2017 financial year, the DoD refund rate for the VH-3D is USD 24,380 per hour of flight.
The unit records the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico, Virginia.
The White House argues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is far below that rate.
"To set the costs for taxpayers on the basis of the refund rates estimates is highly misleading," Walters said.
"These estimates include staff, maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual funds."
According to a 2015 RAND study, the reimbursement rates for DoD do not include personnel costs, but take into account the cost of fuel, maintenance and contract.
At this time, the former White House press spokesperson Sean Spicer defended the use of the helicopter for the event.
"The idea is to present this week things that are made in America," said Spicer.
"And I know that Sikorsky and Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security, and I assume that hundreds, if not thousands of people, are dependent on it.
And I think, like most Americans, we're all proud of the helicopters and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked tirelessly for.
It is, of course, appropriate to highlight this."
It was not clear whether Trump was interacting with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South Lawn for the event, but he sat in the driver's seat of a fire engine.
In the White House, Trump spoke to representatives of Sikorsky and joked with the media about his own fleet of company products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the president, "I have three of them."
TC BW Neuss vor snifflicher Problem
The top rider of the Second Tennis League takes up the table exit of Suchsdorfer SV.
The TC Blau-Weiss Neuss will join Searchsdorfer SV in Kiel tomorrow from 11 a.m.
Despite five games, the top rider of the Second Tennis League has still gained the sense of reality.
At least team leader Marius Zay has respect for the opponent.
"This is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation.
Especially on the rear positions, I like the team very well."
For class and stability at the Searchsdorfer SV, the imports from the high north are above all ensured.
"The Danes and Finns can even refer to operations in the Davis Cup.
And they are also strong in doubles," says Zay with a view of Harri Heliovaara (Finland), Andre Göransson (Sweden), Sören and Esben Olesen, Martin Pedersen and Andreas Bjerrehus (all of Denmark).
"It will be difficult for us as always.
You also need a good portion of luck."
The Neusser team for the trip in the high north is practically standing.
His debut for Blue-White could give Maxime Janvier.
If the currently active Frenchman at the Challenger tournament in the Italian Biella does not make it to the Bundesliga party, Zdenek Kolar (Czech Republic) who plays at the tournament in the Czech Liberec comes to his first bet in this season.
The Chilene Hans Podlipnik-Castillo, previously undefeated, was still at the ATP tournament in Kitzbühel at the ball yesterday with the white-breast Andrei Vasilevski.
He should be in Kiel as well as Botic Van de Zandschulp, Niels Lootsma (both the Netherlands) and the Belgian Julien Cagnina.
After his two victories against the club on the Alster last Sunday, Máté Valkusz could also re-enter the team.
If it is not enough for 18-year-old Hungary, which was still the number one of the junior world rankings in January 2016, someone from the training staff around Marius Zay is filling up the cadre.
How America can harm the OMV
Donald Trump did not seem very happy when he signed the law to tighten up the sanctions against Russia on Wednesday evening.
"In his haste to pass the law," the Congress had packed in a few "unconstitutional regulations", he ate.
The reaction from Moscow was also as sharp as expected, and even Brussels foamed against the US advance.
After all, the draft provides for the punishment of European companies that help Russians build gas pipelines into the EU.
In this way, investors of the local OMV, together with other European companies, have been worried about the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea Management Nord Stream 2 since then.
The dross is huge.
Nevertheless, it is too early for an assessment of the consequences, according to the official statement of the oil company.
In fact, Donald Trump himself would still have to bring the sanctions to life through the Executive Order.
Twelve weapons are his choice.
"The press" has looked at which the group could resist and which could really hurt him.
Narcos Season 3 Trailer: Without Pablo Escobar, the Cali Cartel is put in the center of Netflix's heat line
Despite the second season of Narcos, which Pablo Escobars Killer reveals, Netflix's series is far from over.
The seasons three and four were already confirmed by the streaming service, the first received its first trailer and showed the latest villains of the show.
With the third season, the DEA has focused its attention on the richest organization of the world's drug trade: the Cali cartel.
led by four powerful sponsors, they operate "like a Fortune 500 company" only with more government bribes and violent actions.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is her head, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) commands the Mexican connection, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) is located in New York.
In the newly published trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, the type who invites American and Colombian law enforcement authorities to support the war on drugs.
Other new actors are Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos will begin on September 1.
Role backwards: The city sets up 46 kitchen helpers
The city organizes the Kita lunch table itself again.
With fixed contact for the children and an assignment to the team.
The clock is turned back in the urban day care centres.
On 1 September the city of Krefeld will take over the food supply in the urban day care facilities (kitas) again in its own direction.
For Sonja Pomeranz, Deputy Head of Youth Assistance, this is a good news: "We have all been very happy".
Cooked still outside the house: A caterer takes over this task and supplies freshly cooked chilled.
The city operates 46 day care centres in the Krefeld area, in 44 children receive a warm meal at lunchtime.
In the past Kita year, 2800 children were sitting at the tables, and the need is growing steadily.
"In the meantime, not only do children who are cared for 45 hours a week eat in the kita for lunch," explains Pommeranz.
"The offer also applies in the 35-hour care if children stay until 14:00."
46 part-time workers will be in the kitchen from September 1st: they will heat the delivered food, supplement it with salad, raw food and fruit, portion the meal individually, give out the food, clean, rinse and clean the kitchen.
"Employees are permanently assigned to a kita," says Pommeranz.
The size - there are two groups as well as seven groups - decides on the hour.
"The kitchen helpers are now firmly part of the kita team," says Pomeranz satisfied.
"So they are much more involved and it is easier to implement pedagogical concepts for the kita management."
Because it is also about healthy nutrition and cooking lessons.
"The children should help prepare the food."
The direct connection of the kitchen power to the team makes sense.
Also for the children.
"They have a known power in the kita, a person who is familiar to them, and not constantly changing people."
This continuity is important for the children.
The cleaning of the Kita rooms - so far also the task of the kitchen staff - will be carried out by special cleaning staff in the future.
This variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has also shown the charm of improving the quality of the kitchen service, which it has shown to be the most economical in terms of cost comparison between self-regulation and foreign procurement for the city, says the Press Office.
And that, although 46 part-time workers are being readjusted.
"But for about 750 people in the education area, these hours are not so much in weight," says Sonja Pomeranz.
Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women, says the UN
Elections can only be representative if all members of society, including women, play a role, said the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, the official head of the United Nations mission, said that hundreds of women will run the council elections in the provinces. Three women are running the role of vice-president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overestimated," he said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women participate fully and are involved in all parts of the electoral process.
Afghan elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections will take place on 5 April.
The Taliban have published threats against an electoral process that coincides with the transition from international combat to an advisory role.
This year, for the first time, the elections will be passed on peacefully by a democratically elected government to the next.
Haysom said that a strong role for women will further strengthen Afghanistan's democratic success.
The Afghan Independent Electoral Commission reports that 1.2 million women are registered among the total registered 3.6 million voters.

Men try to rob 13-year-old girl
Two young men aged 19 and 23 are said to have tried on Thursday to rob a 13-year-old girl.
According to police information, the men spoke to the 13-year-olds who stayed with friends on Kolpingstraße at 2:55 p.m. because they wanted to call the girl's cell phone.
The 13-year-old rejected the request and went on with her friends.
Then one of the perpetrators tried to grab the girl's cell phone and necklace, but this failed.
Without prey, the duo fled.
The two young men were later arrested by the police.
The investigation is under way.
GMB concern about investments in the McVitie factory in Glasgow
A trade union wants to check with managers of the Biskuit manufacturer McVitie on the long-term commitment to production in their factory in Glasgow.
GMB Scotland said that the company had remained silent about the future of investments at the Tollcross site.
More than 500 employees work at the plant that produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea biscuits in addition to other products.
McVities owner Pladis said he has invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years.
He added that employees and trade union representatives would "experience as first" if their activities changed.
In a letter to the company's head of branch, GMB Scotland asked McVitie's to "dream that funding for the modernisation of production lines is not being advanced".
GMB senior organizer Drew Duffy said: "The fact that we cannot gain any clarity from the General Site Manager about the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross deeply affects our members.
Generations of families have worked here and the labour force is focusing heavily on the local community and the Greater Glasgow region, an important pillar for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social disadvantage.
Therefore, under the perspective of jobs, wages and wealth, and against the background of Brexit, rising cost of living and chronic decline in production, the eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a flourishing production presence at McVitie".
A spokesperson from Pladis said: "The branch manager at Tollcross received a letter from GMB Scotland only yesterday, and the company will respond directly to it, as we appreciate the continued commitment of employees and trade union representatives.
We had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross two months ago, during which some questions were discussed openly.
We discussed with our employees that, like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic environment, we constantly review our business – and this applies to all our business areas and locations – in order to remain competitive.
She added: "In recent years, we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our Tollcross site, especially in production lines and operational improvements.
We fully recognise the heritage of Tollcross as a production site. If our operations at the site change, the employees and their union representatives will be the first to learn about this."
Has the PSG warned Barcelona three years ago about Neymar?
The side of La Liga may regret her interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not abandon Neymar in her persecution after she has made an offer of £189 million to trigger his release clause, but did they warn Barcelona three years ago of the world record attack?
The sensational approach has heated the transfer window in the summer, because the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than twice the previous brand, with Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United for 89 million pounds last season.
After the end, Neymar becomes the world’s most expensive player and the world’s most paid professional sportsman. PSG offers wages of more than £500,000 per week.
Barcelona is angry at the way Neymar has forced his way outside, although a source near the Catalan board insists that the club has always done its best to take care of him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the world of football warned three years ago by the PSG President about this prospect?
When Manchester City expressed interest in the signing of Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaif had a strong warning for any association that wanted one of PSG's best players to sign.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we'll be in opposition to them, we'll contact their players," said Al-Khelaif.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to sign one of our players, this will have consequences."
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line, with the Spanish association expressing interest in the PSG midfield player Marco Verratti at the beginning of this summer.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the international to leave Italy under any circumstances, and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its prize offers for Neymar.
Roller overturned and damaged
On the night of Friday to Saturday, an unknown perpetrator deliberately overturned a scooter set up in the Königsfelder Straße in front of the estate number 30 and thus caused damage of more than 200 euros to the clothing of the vehicle.
The police, Schramberg, telephone 07422/27 01-0, ask for information.
The police are looking for witnesses to an accident on the B 215 between Stolzenau and Leese.
Because a car came across him on his lane, the driver of a VW Touran had to dodge and touch the guideboard.
On Thursday evening, the 34-year-old from Rehburg-Loccum with his VW was on the B 215 from Stolzenau, heading towards Leese.
In the area of the town surrounding Stolzenau, a car came to meet him on his lane, so he had to turn right.
The touran driver touched the guideboard.
Damage to property was caused at the car.
The driver of the arriving car, a Mercedes Benz, had overtaken a truck and continued his journey without taking care of the traffic accident.
According to the accident victim, it may be good that the Mercedes driver had not noticed the accident at all.
The police are now asking witnesses of the incident and the driver of the vehicle to contact the Commissioner in Stolzenau under Tel. 05761 / 92060.
Interview: "Doomspatzen Report relieves Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger"
The Regensburger Domsparzen report on the abuses relieves Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger.
That's what author and historian Michael Hesemann means.
The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen continues to hold discussions.
Christian Weisnder, spokesperson of the reform movement "We are Church", said after publishing to the German press agency, he expected an apology from the former Regensburg bishop and today's Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from the cathedral chapel master Georg Ratzinger, 93-year-old brother of emeritus Pope Benedict XVI.
It would be very helpful to see the Catholic Church if Muller and Ratzinger expressed their deep regret at their own omissions or at the time their false assessment of the proceedings.
On the other hand, the Vatican newspaper "Osservatore Romano" criticised the fact that "two measures" are being measured in the reporting of violence in the courts.
With regard to the abuses in Regensburg, no one doubts that it is a matter of "disgraceful and shameful acts" that would have to be punished and prevented in the future; however, the "degree of media manipulation" is striking, according to the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the national Italian bioethics committee.
"The habit of calling the Catholic Church the source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares the public opinion to consider it normal," writes Scaraffia.
Prince Gloria of Thurn and Taxis also said in an interview with the Bayerische Rundfunk: "You like to go to the church and that's a found eating."
They also pointed out that in their youth, "beats were a normal educational means" to "get rid of naughty children, as I was one of them."
She found it unfair to apply today’s standards to earlier decades, for the world has changed.
In connection with the reports on the abuses, Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared.
Completely wronged, says author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote the book "My Brother of the Pope" with Ratzinger (translated into 12 languages).
"I have to protect Georg Ratzinger," says Hesemann, "because all this had nothing to do with him," he evaluates the results of the final report.
What exactly does the 440-page report by the lawyer Ulrich Weber, appointed by the Diocese of Regensburg, say?
A total of 547 Regensburg Cathedral cloisters were sexually abused between 1945 and the early 1990s "with high plausibility" victims of assaults, 67 platoons.
The final report says of Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "In summary, then, it can be noted that in many cases Cathedral Chapel Master R. used forms of physical and mental violence.
Especially with high emotionality, the punishment for the students could also be more severe.
Nevertheless, contrary to many other accusations, many victims estimated the general humanity of R. and therefore, in many cases despite violence, even associate positive memories with him."
In the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger relieves him.
Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "Incidents of the exercise of violence in the protection of the Regensburger Domspatzen" gives a contradictory picture of Domkapelmeister Georg Ratzinger.
On the one hand, many students highlight their "humanity".
On the other hand, he also appears to be a choleric and perfectionist, who became more often tangible when a doomspatz didn't bring any top performance musically.
How do you rate this final report as his biography?
Michael Hesemann: If you make the effort and read the entire 440 pages long report from front to back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger is even found in it.
He is dedicated to just eight pages and is clearly acquitted by any suspicion of complicity or complicity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.
The violence at the preschool also occurred outside his sphere of action.
At any rate, he can be accused of being too late or of not having taken first indications seriously enough.
The Domspatzengymnasium, on which he worked, was felt by virtually all respondents as - so literally - "redemption", "heaven" and "better world".
For example, the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger presents an excellent witness, describes him as "warm-hearted", "popular", "genuine", "competent" and "comprehensive", as a very kind teacher, who regularly supplied the boys with cakes, biscuits and candies and was "always surrounded by grapes from children".
Only a minority complains about his perfectionism and his high emotionality, which has also led to angry outbursts.
Not only did he bang chairs and throw the keychain on the ground, but he also spread earflies and too naughty boys to his hair or ears, he himself admitted years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for it.
It must be said, however, that such methods of education were widespread in the 1960s and 1970s, among parents and teachers.
Do you still know such methods of breeding?
Of course, I think every one of us was born before 1968.
I also experienced this in a secular school, a state high school.
Compared to what this report is all about, namely, the terrible sexual abuse and the violent excesses at preschool, these are, of course, trivial.
One wonders whether it has to do with his reputation and role as brother of Benedict XVI, that many media just fell on him.
Many who have never understood him still work hard at the Bavarian Pope.
But the truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every way!
In the media, much has been reported in connection with the report on the issue of abuse in the Regensburger Domspatzen.
Is Georg Ratzinger also charged with any involvement or involvement in sexual abuse in the final report?
Michael Hesemann: Clearly no.
None of the 67 victims of sexual abuse claim to have trusted the cathedral chaplain.
Not even the parents were inaugurated.
"I have never trusted myself to talk to my father or my mother about it," said one affected person, representing the others, "it was all very embarrassing to me."
The real problem in educating sexual abuse was and is that most victims are silent out of shame.
If they did not even confide in parents and siblings, then certainly not a choirmaster who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators in a professional way.
How do the judges judge Ratzinger's role in the cases of abuse?
Michael Hesemann: A student interviewed put it this way: "As regards sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he had (Georg Ratzinger) had timely knowledge and could have stopped the perpetrator.
I think it ... is also really absurd to assume that he has been charged with ... opening up more intrusive, clear or even more than their parents, head teachers, trust teachers, etc.
Talking to him about sex ... - unthinkable."
Thus, the report comes to the clear conclusion: "The fact that students affected in advance and/or their environment could not be confirmed in the course of the investigation."
So, as far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is acquitted of any fellow believer.
Nor can it be accused of not having prevented it or brought it to the fore.
Therefore, there is no reason to associate his good name with these repugnant crimes, as unfortunately happened in some cases.
In the media there was a lot of "violence" in the Regensburger Domspatzen.
The former cathedral chaplain Georg Ratzinger is accused of the report "Wegschauen".
Does he have to live with this accusation?
Michael Hesemann: This is the big problem that in reporting everything was mixed and mixed up into a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger.
But that is another abuse of the report.
There is a clear separation: between the preschool and the high school of the cathedrals, between sexual abuse and violent excesses, and, let us say, other accusations.
In addition, the report deals with incidents from the period since 1945, including four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not the head of the court.
All the terrible beating pedagogics, the cases in which boys of sadistic teachers were literally harassed and mutilated, and suffered terribly from among them, all happened at the preschool in Ederzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions must have prevailed.
But there was nothing to do with them, because he only got the boys to face when they were already in the Domspatzengymnasium.
On this, as most witnesses stress, the theme "preschool" was taboo.
One was only happy to have escaped and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paradise" states.
What else was at the Domspatzengymnasium?
Michael Hesemann: There was already discipline, but there was no sadistic violence.
And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that "many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore, in many cases, even associate positive memories with him despite violence".
At most this remains the accusation of having looked away.
Despite all the efforts, however, the report could only define two periods of time during which he was told about the conditions at preschool.
The first time in 1970/71, when he started to establish himself, and when he didn't want to hear anything about the events at a school where he didn't work and was responsible (if the witness) and then only about 1993.
Did Georg Ratzinger consistently close his ears before the conditions?
Michael Hesemann: No, because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium, which the report even reproduces.
In this he points out to them that "in preschool the beating penalty will continue to be practised".
In view of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent action.
This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed when beatings were long banned in Bavaria.
Before that they happened in a legal grey zone, as each of us probably remembers.
It was also difficult for him to estimate where the people concerned might have been exaggerating or dramatic and where the permitted limit had really been exceeded.
But you can't say he always looked away.
That's just not true.
It was not until 1980 that the beating of schools was officially abolished in Bavaria.
Prince Gloria of Thurn and Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today’s pedagogical standards to the time of the day.
How do you see that?
Michael Hesemann: We historians are talking about the "fall trick of anachronism", that is, the danger of evaluating the past according to today's moral standards.
The princess's right.
But this does not, of course, apply to sexual abuse, which at all times was abominable and not to what was committed in the preschool of resistance and violence to innocent children's souls, which goes far beyond what was then a common practice.
It's all awful and I'm glad it's finally being worked out.
But at the same time I have to protect Georg Ratzinger, because all this had nothing to do with him.
His means of discipline and punishment, i.e. to draw ears and hair and ears, were widely used in the 1970s.
When physical punishment was then banned, he also adhered strictly to it.
What picture of his Regensburg time did Georg Ratzinger give in the conversations with you for the book "My Brother of the Pope"?
Did the issue of beating punishment also come up?
Michael Hesemann: Well, the book is about the life of his brother Joseph, i.e. Pope Benedict XVI, from his point of view, because the platoons played only a minor role.
Nevertheless, I do not in any way hide the fact that he led a strict regiment there.
But this also has to be said: without this perfectionism, without demanding absolute discipline, it would probably not have been possible for him to form an institution of world-class from the so-called nationally known Regensburg Cathedrals, true cultural ambassadors of Europe and its musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).
With biscuits and candy alone, you don't make a big singer out of obscene boys and stand before every success, no matter what area, but always discipline, passion and self-control.
As what kind of a person did you experience Georg Ratzinger during the conversations with her book?
Michael Hesemann: Through the work on the book and beyond, I really got to know Georg Ratzinger very well and experienced again and again as wonderful, humorous, thorough, deeply believing and goodhearted people, who cannot be imagined that he could even do something wrong with a fly.
I regularly get along with how many former referees still today, 23 years after his retirement, keep in regular contact with him, visit him, lecture him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family.
Those who do not forgive him to this day that he was once strict with them are therefore clear in the minority.
Most of the platoons are grateful to him today for enriching their lives and bringing them the world of music.
And that he was always a good, fatherly teacher - a strict father, certainly - but he was also a kind respecter, to whom she still looks today and to whom she worships.
And please, once again quite clearly: all that is being proposed to him are educational methods that were on the agenda at the time.
We can be glad that we've been over this time for a long time.
But it is most unjust to make a man a man, only because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to make a media scapegoat.
The evil intention behind this is only too obvious.
Because the report that has just been published relieves him.
Now the decency would be to leave a 93-year-old man, who has earned great merit and who would not know the Regensburger Domspatzen without the one outside Bavaria and perhaps Germany, at last.
