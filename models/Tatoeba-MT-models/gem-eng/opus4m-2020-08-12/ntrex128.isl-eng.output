Many stewards are concerned about “looking like a fool ”
Some administrators suggest that their title be changed to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, member of Congress).
Concerns have been raised about a plan to change the Council’s name to the Welsh Senate.
All classes of stewards are concerned that this could make them a laughingstock.
One worker - class manager said that his group was concerned that “it is rhyming with Twp and Pwp. ”
For readers living outside Wales: in Welsh, twp means crazy and pwp means dirty.
A member of the Plaid Cymru group said that the group as a whole was "dissatisfied" and made other suggestions by name.
A member of the Welsh conservatory said that his class had an “open mind” about the change of name, but pointed out that there was no significant difference between the words MWP and Muppet (flon).
In this context it can be stated that the Welsh w is pronounced similar to the u in Icelandic.
The council, which is now working on the bill to propose the name changes, said: “The final decision on all the names above the members of the board will, of course, lie with the members themselves. ”
The Wales (The Government of Wales Act 2017) Law gave the Welsh Council the power to change its name.
In June, the Council published the results of public opinion polls that showed great support for calling the council the Velocity Congress.
In the case of councillors, the WMP (Welsh Parliament Members, Velschen Senators) was elected, but MWP received the greatest support from the public in the polls.
According to the news, other suggestions are now being made by stewards, but it may be difficult to reach an agreement with the Council’s chairman, Elin Jones, who is to submit a bill for the changes within a few weeks.
The reform plan will also include other changes in the way the board operates, including rules on the removal of staff and the organisation of the committee system.
When the bill is discussed, stewards will be able to vote for its final title.
Macedonians vote in elections for a name change in the country
The voters will vote on Sunday on whether to change their country's name to 'Northern Macedonia'.
This matter was put to the vote in an attempt to resolve a decades - long conflict with the neighboring country of Greece, which has its own region called Macedonia.
Athens City has long argued that the name of its neighbours in the north is equivalent to the requirement of its territory and has repeatedly protested their applications for EU and NATO membership.
The president of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, who disagrees with the vote on the change of name, has said that he will not consider the elections valid.
However, supporters of the vote, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, have said that the change of name is simply the price that needs to be paid for membership of the EU and NATO.
Church bells of St. Martin sound when churches in Harlem are in trouble
“ The older people I’ve been talking to said that in the past there was a bar and a church on every corner of the street, ” said Mr. Adams.
"There's none there today."
He said it would be understandable for us to go down.
"People have other ways of meeting" nowadays, he said.
“Bars are no longer the center of the neighborhood where people meet regularly. ”
As far as the churches are concerned, he is concerned that the money received from the sale of property will not last as long as leaders expect “and sooner or later they will be back on the ground. ”
He added that there were possibly churches replaced by residential homes filled with people who would not help to save the area’s remaining places of refuge.
“ The largest majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings become white, ” he said, “and will therefore hurry to ensure that these churches are permanently closed, because most people who move to these apartments are unlikely to become members of these churches. ”
Both churches were built of white congregations before Harlem became the center of the Black Metropolitan Community church was built in 1870, and St. Martin’s church was built a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved away in the 1930 ’ s.
A congregation of black people who had worked nearby took over the building.
The congregation of blacks took over St. Martin’s Church under the direction of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who had the initiative to shun shoppers on 125th Street, Harlem’s main shopping street, who longed to hire black workers or give them promotions.
The building was seriously damaged by fire in 1939, but members of Father Johnson’s congregation made plans to rebuild it and also had it built.
Father David Johnson, son and successor of Reverend Johnson, proudly called the game “the clock of the poor. ”
The expert who played the clock game in July called it a different name: “Human Resources ” and“ Unique Historical Instruments. ”
The scholar Tiffany Ng from Michigan University also stated that this was the first time a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, played, but he moved to the larger Riverside Church clock game 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin didn't have anyone else in his place.
In recent months many architects and contractors have made their way to St. Martin, some of whom have been hired by church leaders and others by the bishops.
The Church Council - who oversees the application and is appointed church leaders - wrote the Episcopal Office in July and expressed its concern that the Episcopal Office “would try to get the cost over to the Church Council, ” even though it had not been involved in the recruitment of the architects and contractors sent by the Episcopal Office.
Some parishioners complained of a lack of transparency on the part of the Episcopal Empire.
Shark hurts a 13-year-old boy looking for a lobster in California
According to the authorities, a 13 - year - old boy was attacked by a shark and injured on Saturday when the boy was diving for lobster in California on the first day of the lobster fishing season.
The attack occurred just before seven o’clock in the morning near Beacon’s Beach Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told the KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy crying for help and then rowing over with a group of others to help get him out of the water.
Hammel said that he had at first thought it was only a thrill to have had a whim, but then “he realized that the boy cried out“ I was bitten!
I was bitten!"
His whole beak was torn up," said Hammel about what he saw when he came to the boy.
“ I cried out to everyone to get out of the water, “There’s a shark in the water! ” Hammel added.
The boy was transferred with a helicopter to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is seriously injured.
It is not known what kind of shark attacked the boy.
At a media meeting, a coaster’s officer, Larry Giles, said that a shark had been seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but he was not of a dangerous type of shark.
Giles added that the victim had suffered serious damage to the upper body.
The authorities closed beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami’s beach in Encinitas for 48 hours, for research and safety purposes.
Giles said that over 135 different shark species were in the area, but most of them do not consider dangerous.
Sainsbury’s plan to step into the United Kingdom’s cosmetics market
Sainsbury’s plan is to compete with Boots, SuperDrugs and Debenhams with beauty shelves in a shopping mall style and with specialized assistants.
This is part of a plan to enter the cleaning market of the United Kingdom, worth 2.8 billion pounds, and continues to grow as sales on fashion and household goods go down.
The investment in cosmetics is part of a wholesale route to use a shelf that was previously used by TVs, microwaves, and household goods.
Sainsbury’s plans to double its beauty selection in up to 3000 product types, including brand names such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Current products from L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will also have increased space with marked areas similar to those found in shops such as Boots.
The store is also going to resell its boutique cosmetics selection so that the majority of the products are well-balanced, but younger consumers are increasingly demanding it.
In addition, the Fragrance Shop will test the supplier in two shops of Sainsbury’s, the first one opened in Croydon in southern London last week and the next one will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham later this year.
Internet shopping and an increased consumer tendency to buy a small amount of food every day in the neighborhood mean that supermarkets need to put more effort into getting people to come to their homes.
Mike Coupe, Managing Director of Sainsbury’s, said that the shops would be more and more like malls when the chain of commerce tries to fight the low-value stores of Aldi and Lidl with more services and goods than food.
Sainsbury’s has put Argos camps in hundreds of stores and has also introduced a number of Habitat camps since the purchase of both chains two years ago, according to which it has increased sales and made purchases more profitable.
The first attempt of the shop to revitalize its cosmetics and pharmaceuticals departments failed.
Sainsbury’s tried to work with Boots around the year 2000 but ended due to differences in how to share the proceeds of drug sales in the supermarket.
The new policy follows that Sainsbury’s sold its 281-year-old drugstore to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacovigilance system, over 125 million pounds three years ago.
According to the policy, Lloyds will play a role in these plans by adding a wide range of luxuries, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, market manager of Sainsbury’s, said: “We have completely changed the look of our carpentry shelves to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in special training for staff who will be available for advice.
Our trademark selection is designed to meet all needs. A fascinating environment and convenient locations make us an exciting beauty store that transforms old shopping habits."
Peter Jones "serious" after Holly Willoughby terminates 11 million pounds of contract
Peter Jones, the star of Dragons Den, became “stupid” after the TV channel Holly Willoughby signed an 11 million-pound contract with his company to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time for their home goods and their accessories label, True.
The company had been likened to Goop, the trademark of Gwyneth Paltrow.
Willoughby, 37 years old, introduced this Morning, announced his decision on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has left Peter Jones, the star of Dragons’ Den, with a painful forehead by withdrawing from a popular lifestyle company at the latest to focus on new and profitable deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones has been “the toughest ” at a difficult meeting on Tuesday at his business headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, when the television lady popularly admitted that she did not have enough time for the Truly home goods and accessories brand due to the new contracts worth up to 1.5 million pounds.
The company has been likened to Goop, the trademark of Gwyneth Paltrow, and was meant to double the property of Willoughby, but their estimated value is 11 million pounds.
When Willoughby, 37 years old, announced to Instagram that she was going to pull out of Truey, Jones from Britain flew to live in one of her many summer homes.
One source reported: “Truly was the longest on Holly’s priority list.
This was to be her future work that would take her for the next two decades.
Her decision to stop came completely to the fore.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, it was so short that the line was going to market.
It's full of lips at Marlow's headquarters that's ready to go for sale."
Experts believe that the elimination of This Morning, which is among Britain’s most popular stars, can cost the company millions because of large cargo iron fasteners, ranging from cushions and candles to clothing and household goods, and possibly cause further delays in the sale of the product line.
This too could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been friends of Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for decades.
Willoughby, together with Capp, founded in 2016, and Jones, 52 years old, joined them as chairman of the government in March.
Couples spend their summer vacations together, and Jones owns 40 percent of the company Baldwin, which produces television.
Willoughby will be the official representative of the M&S label and will replace Ant McPartlin as the director of the I'm a Celebrity ITV.
Last night, a source named Jones said: “We don’t want to say anything about his business. ”
Difficult discussion “and then we fell in love ”
He shuddered with the criticism he received from the media, for saying something that many would consider inappropriate for the president, and for being so positive towards the leaders of North Korea.
Why has President Trump left so much behind?
Said Trump and copied a reporter's voice.
"I haven't left anything behind."
He stated that Kim was interested in another meeting after Trump called their first meeting in Singapore in June a big step towards nuclear disarmament in North Korea.
On the other hand, discussions on the decommissioning of nuclear weapons have stopped.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, Ri Yong Ho, the principal ambassador of North Korea, told the international leaders of the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the North had not received a 'appropriate response' from the United States at the first steps of North Korea towards nuclear disarmament.
Instead, he said that the United States continued its business ventures for the purpose of maintaining pressure.
Trump was all the more positive in his talk.
"We are very close to North Korea," he said.
“We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have lost their lives.
Now our relationship is great."
He said his attempts to improve his relationship with Kim had brought back positive results — missile tests had stopped, hostages had been released, and the remains of American soldiers had been returned home.
He also warned of his unusual approach to discuss his relationship with Kim.
“ It’s so easy to act like a president, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into a crowded stadium, there were only 200 people standing there,” said Trump, pointing out the crowd in front of him.
Floods and earthquakes in Indonesia cause great damage to the island, hundreds of them have perished
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, international relief groups were told that they were not needed.
Despite the fact that more than 10 percent of Lombok’s inhabitants had to flee their homes, an emergency situation was not declared, which is why the international organization can have relief work there.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it clear that they are not going to ask for assistance from international organisations, so this is difficult," said Ms. Sumbung.
Although the Society Save the Children is putting together teams to travel to Palu, it is not yet certain when foreign relief workers can take up work in the area.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, said that Indonesian councillors were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international organizations should be able to assist in the relief work.
Considering the frequency of earthquakes in Indonesia, the country is sadly ill prepared to defend its natural forces.
Flood waves have been built in Aceh, a rare sight on other shorelines.
It seems that the shortage of flood - wave whistles in Palu has still increased the number of deaths, even though a warning has been issued.
Even in the best of circumstances, traveling between the many islands of Indonesia can be a challenge.
Natural disasters make planning even more complicated.
An ambulance that has docked in Lombok to guard the victims of the earthquake is now on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to get to the new location.
President Joko Widodo made it the main point of his campaign to reform the downgraded transport routes in Indonesia and has put a lot of money in the way and railroads.
However, lack of funds has plagued Mr. Joko’s government, but elections will be held next year.
Mr. Joko also has to deal with persistent tensions between religious groups in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted more conservative religious policies.
More than 1,000 people died, and tens of thousands had to leave their homes when Christian and Muslim gangs fought on the streets with swords, bows, arrows, and other primitive weapons.
See: Daniel Sturridge, Liverpool player, equal to Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge rescued Liverpool from losing against Chelsea in the U.S. by scoring for 89 minutes in Saturday’s game at the Stamford Bridge Stadium in London.
Sturridge got a shipment from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 meters from the Chelsea target when his team was below 1-0.
He rolled the ball to the left and then tried to shoot to the goal toward the far pole.
The ball flew high across the goal and toward its right corner.
Finally, the ball went over Kepa Arrizabalaga, who jumped up, and into the net.
"I just wanted to try to get into this position, to get the ball, and players like Shaq always play it as long as possible so I tried to create as much time as I could," said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante come and touch once and didn’t think so much about it, but just took the shot.”
Chelsea was over 1-0 in half after the Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in 25 minutes.
In the quest, Chelsea's visitor gave the ball with a heels shot to Mateo Kovacic and then sprang from the middle over to the playing half of Liverpool.
Kovacic made the ball move fast between the center.
Then he sent the ball on beautifully and sent Hazard in for a honeymoon.
Hazard ran off his defenders and scored in the feathered corner with a left - foot shot past Alisson Becker, Liverpool’s goalkeeper.
Liverpool is playing against Napolí in the first half of the senior league at 3:00 p.m. on Wednesday at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea attends Videoton in the UEFA European Union at 3:00 p.m. on Thursday in London.
The number of deaths increases to 832 after a tidal wave in Indonesia
The number of deaths caused by the earthquake and the tidal wave in Indonesia has increased to 832 as reported by the National Disaster Agency early on Sunday.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson of the Institute, said at a news conference that a number of people had been buried when buildings collapsed in the earthquake that occurred on Friday and was 7.5 points on the Richter scale.
The city of Palu, which has over 380,000 inhabitants, was covered with debris from buildings that had collapsed.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man suspected of murder after a woman was stabbed to death.
A murder investigation has been launched after a woman's likeness was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
A 44 - year - old woman with a stab wound was found at 7:55 this morning near Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32 - year - old man was arrested, suspected of murder.
Police have encouraged people in the area to turn themselves in if they saw or heard anything.
Detective Brian O'Hagan said: “The investigation has just begun, but I want to ask everyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead to contact us if they saw or heard anything suspicious.
I would also like to ask everyone, especially a cab driver, who might have caught up with his car cameras to contact us, because they could have important information for our research."
The police spokesperson has confirmed that the woman who died lived in Birkenhead and that she was found inside the apartment.
In the afternoon, people who thought they knew the woman have come to ask where she was this morning.
The investigation continues, and police say they are working to inform the nearest victim’s caregiver.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews tried to get back to his apartment, but the police told him that no one could enter or leave the building.
He was speechless when he found out what had happened.
People have now been told that many hours could pass until they can go back inside.
A police officer was told that the whole area was now considered a crime scene.
A crying woman came to the scene.
She keeps repeating, “It’s so terrible. ”
At 2:00 p.m., there were two police cars inside the marked area of the police and one car just outside.
A number of police officers stood inside the marked area and watched over the apartment buildings.
Anyone who might have any information is asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact the crime line by name on the phone 0800 555 111 and give the number 247 from September 30.
The British Senate's statue of Cromwell is the latest monument accused of "rewriting history"
The ban of the statue would be poetic justice for the Taliban destruction of his superstitious Puritan companions on so many of England’s cultural and religious treasures.
The Cromwell Society, on the other hand, said that Mr. Crick's proposal was 'poor' and 'an attempt to rewrite the story'.
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “In the discussion on removing statues, it was inevitable that the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster Palace would be for the battle.
The anticulturalism of the English Civil War was neither the order nor the execution of Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his forefather Thomas in the preceding century.
The magnificent statue of Cromwell, by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, marks the 19th - century period and is part of a man’s history that many feel is still worthy of praise.
Mr. Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more late in the 19th century than today, to be the protector of the Congress against external pressure, in his case the monarchy.
There is still a lot of historical controversy as to whether this description is entirely correct.
On the other hand, the mid - 17th - century conflict may have shaped our nation’s development and that Cromwell is a well - known individual who represents one side of their conflict.
It is worth saluting and remembering his accomplishments as the Protector of the Kingdom."
Pigs attack and kill a Chinese farmer
Pigs attacked a Chinese farmer and killed him in a Southwestern China market, according to local news.
The man, named only by his last name “Yuan”, was found dead with a broken artery and covered blood near a stela at the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou region, as reported by the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inject a vaccine into pigs in a pig sty on 30 May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
According to the report, he had traveled with his uncle from neighboring Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs in the market.
The next morning the uncle found him dead and saw a door in a nearby pighouse standing open.
He said that inside the stylus there was a big mouth with a bloody mouth.
According to the report, a court investigation confirmed that the 250 kg gallows had killed the farmer.
"My uncle's feet were bloody and wounded," said the uncle, with the surname "Wu", at the Guiyang Evening News news station.
Shooting from a security camera showed Yuan coming to the market at 4:40 a.m. to feed her pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not owned by Yuan or his uncle.
The owner of the market told Evening News that the pig had been locked up so that no one else could be attacked while the police were collecting evidence at the scene.
According to news, Yuan’s family and the owners of the market have discussions on the improvement of his death.
There are recorded examples of pigs attacking people, although rare.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their village in Massachusetts and seriously wounded the man.
Ten years earlier, a 300 - pound [300 kg] pig squeezed a farmer by a tractor until his wife chased the animal away.
After a farmer from Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, another Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that they may be aggressive about blood.
“They’re just playing.
They're curious and curious. They don't want to hurt anyone.
You just have to show them respect," he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa bring great results to the southwestern United States
As foretold, the strength of Hurricane Rose is diminishing as it crosses the cooler seas of northern Mexico.
On the other hand, Rosa will bring with her great results that could cause floods in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the next few days.
Rosa became a typhoon of class 1, with wind strengths of up to 130 miles [ 136 km] an hour, at 5 o’clock in the morning, on Sunday, and was located more than 200 miles [600 km] southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is estimated that Rosa will head north on Sunday.
At the same time, it is humiliated in the formation of the Pacific and will head east towards the western coast of the United States, so when Rosa arrives at the Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, there will be a great tropical rain in the north into the southwest of the United States.
Rose will follow up to 25 cm of the result in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the tropical ray will mix with the near - to - great and widespread precipitation of the southwest part of the next days.
Local precipitation of 2.5 to 10 cm may cause dangerous rapid flooding, movement of the soil, and possible creeps in the desert.
A large tropical rake will cause up to 5 to 10 cm of results in some places, especially in the south of Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 5 to 10 cm of results are expected in some southwest locations, especially in the majority of Arizona states.
There is a potential for rapid flooding with rapidly worsening conditions due to the distribution of tropical rain.
People are strongly advised not to walk into the desert when there is a risk of tropical rain.
Great rain can turn the tides into rushing torrents, and thunderstorms can cause a whirlwind and a storm of dust.
The area approaching will carry a local spill in certain areas along the southern California coastline.
There is a possibility of more than 1 cm of the result, which could cause slight movement of the soil and the neck of the road.
This is the first precipitation in the rainy season.
A few scattered tropical forests will begin to approach Arizona late on Sunday and early Monday, before the precipitation spreads over the larger area late on Monday and Tuesday.
Great rainfall will spread over four states on Tuesday and will last Wednesday.
Large changes in temperature can be expected in all parts of the United States in October, as the Arctic region cools down, but the tropical zone remains relatively warm.
Sometimes this can cause a high temperature fluctuation over a short distance.
What a fine example of a great deal of warmth in Central America on Sunday!
There is almost a 7 - degree temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa.
In the next few days, persistent summers will try to build up and disperse again.
It is expected that much of the Central and Eastern United States will have a warm beginning on October with temperatures around 25 degrees Fahrenheit [25 ° C] or more from the plains of the south to the northeastern states.
A fever could reach 25 degrees Fahrenheit [25 ° C.] in New York City on Tuesday, which is about 30 degrees Fahrenheit [6 ° C.] higher than the average.
Our long - term forecasts indicate that there is a high probability of temperature above the average for the eastern United States in the early part of October.
Over 20 million people were watched by interviews over Brett Kavanaugh
On Tuesday, over 20 million people watched the thrilling testimony of Brett Kavanaugh, appointed Supreme Court Judge, and the testimony of Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of a sexual offense that was supposed to have occurred in the 1990 ’ s.
At the same time, the political situation continued, and TV stations interrupted a regular program to publish the latest news on Friday: Senator Jeff Flake, from Arizona, filed a bill that the FBI could investigate the charges for one week.
Ford told the Senate Judicial Committee that she was confident that Kavanaugh had drunk her and tried to strip her off at a school party.
Kavanaugh stated in an emotional testimony that he was confident that this would not have happened.
It is likely that more people watched the trial than the 20.4 million that Nielsen reported watching on Friday.
The company measured the average TV viewers CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC.
Numbers were not immediately available for other TV channels that showed the interviews, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen, too, usually has problems measuring people’s audiences in offices.
To put this into context, this audience is similar in size to that of a football game or the Olympics.
According to Nielsen, most people watched the hearings that took all day, on Fox News Channel, or 5,69 million.
ABC took second place with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
After the trial, there was still much interest.
Flake was the center of the game on Friday.
After the office of this congressman of the Republican Party announced that he would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS took pictures of it when protesters shouted at him on Friday morning when he tried to go into an elevator to get a meeting with the Judiciary Committee.
He was humiliated for a few minutes while he was raining down on a live broadcast at CNN.
One woman said: “I am standing right here in front of you. ”
“Do you think he’s telling the truth to the people of the country? ”
People told him: “You have power while so many women are powerless. ”
Flake said that his office had issued a declaration, and before closing the elevator door, he said that he would express himself more at the meeting of the committee.
The cable and television stations were all broadcast directly later when the Judiciary Committee decided whether Kavanaugh’s appointment should be forwarded to the Senate for election.
Flake said that he would only do so if the FBI investigated the charges against the nominee next week, but the minority of democrats have encouraged it.
Flake was convinced in part after a conversation with his friend Chris Coons, the senator of the Democratic Party.
Flake made his decision after a conversation with Coon and several other senators thereafter.
Flake’s votes changed, as it was evident that the Republicans did not have sufficient votes to approve Kavanaugh without the study.
President Trump has authorized an investigation by the FBI into the charges against Kavanaugh.
May, British Prime Minister, accuses critics of ‘being in a political game’ for Brexit
During an interview with The Sunday Times newspaper, Prime Minister Theresa May accused its critics of withdrawing from the European Union 'being in a political game' for the future of Britain and burying its interests.
Theresa May, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, will attend the Conference of the Conference of the Conference of the Conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom, September 29, 2018.
In another interview, which was published alongside her interview on the front page of the paper, Boris Johnson, her former Foreign Minister, was awarded the so-called Chequers Plan on Brexit and said that the idea that Britain and the European Union should charge customs duties on each other would be "absolutely absurd".
The Wayde Sims Shot Attack: The police arrest Dyteon Simpsons in connection with the LSU player's death
Police have arrested one suspect for the death of Wayde Sims in a fatal shooting, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
The 20 - year - old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and imprisoned for charges of second - degree murder, according to the Baton Rouge police.
The authorities posted a video of the conflict between Sims and Simpson and said that Sims had lost his glasses in the fights.
According to WAFB, CBS’ sister companion, a police officer found the glasses on the scene and reported that they had been genetically engineered by Simpson.
Police say Simpson confessed to having shot Wayde and killed him at interrogation.
According to his lawyer, there was a certain guarantee that the sum would be $350,000.
The law firm of East Baton Rouge County issued a preliminary report on Friday saying the cause of death is gunshot into the head and into the neck.
The authorities wanted to thank the police in Louisiana, the police crime lab, the police at Southern University University and the local citizens for the help with the investigation that led to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, director of sports at LSU, thanked law enforcement for “their zeal and their search for righteousness. ”
Sims was 20 years old.
The tall, six - foot [2 m] advance grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
On average, he scored 5.6 points and scored 2.6 for each game in the last season.
Will Wade, basketball coach LSU, said on Friday morning that the team was "smoothed" and "in shock" because of Wayde’s death.
"This is something you worry about all the time," said Wade.
Mount Fire Spits Ashes Over Mexico City
Ash from Mount Popocatepetl has reached the southern capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention (U.S.A.) recommended that Mexicans stay away from the volcano on Saturday after increased activity in the gypsy, and 183 cases of gas and ashes were recorded over a 24 - hour period.
The center watched the vibrations and tremors from the volcano.
Social media images showed a thin layer of ashes on car windows in the vicinity of Mexico, such as in Xochimilco.
Earth physicists have noticed increased activity in the volcano, which is 70 miles [72 km] southeast of the capital, since the earthquake of 7.1 on Richter hit central Mexico in September 2017.
The Mount of Fire, known as “Don Goyo, ” has been active since 1994.
Police in conflict with the Catalan separatists just before the birthday of an independent voter
Six were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independent protestors took up the riot police, and thousands were taking part in protests on the occasion of the first birthday of the controversial elections in Catalonia to declare independence.
A group of masked separatists stoned riot police with eggs and threw powder paint that formed dark dust clouds on the streets, which were usually otherwise filled with tourists.
Later in the day, conflicts broke out, and police used bats to control the fight.
The separatists cried out, “We do not forget and do not forgive ” for hours while their opposers shouted, “Long live Spain. ”
Fourteen needed attention because of minor injury to the demonstrators, according to the local media.
There is a great deal of tension in the independent area one year after the national vote of October 1 was judged illegal by the Madrid authorities, but it was hailed by the Catalan separatists.
The majority of voters chose independence, but participation was poor because most of those who opposed separation ignored the election.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year when police tried to stop the polling in polling stations around the area, which resulted in conflicts.
A group of independents had spent the night on Friday to prevent protests in support of the nation’s police.
The protest march took place, but it was forced to go another way.
Narcis Termes, a 68 - year - old electrician, participated in the protests of separationists with his wife and said that he was no longer hopeful that Catalonia would gain independence.
“ Last year we experienced one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy at being able to vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite having achieved the necessary but limited victory in regional surveys in December last year, Catalonia’s independent groups have found it difficult to keep steam this year, as many of the best - known leaders are either in voluntary exile or in detention waiting for trial because of their role in the organisation of the vote and the declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42 - year - old mechanic who protested in support of the police, said that politicians had encouraged the conflict.
"The tension is constantly rising," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in prison and have been waiting for trial since late last year, announced that he would be present to the European Parliament next year.
"My announcement in the European elections is the best way to condemn the decline in democratic values and the oppression we have seen by the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Arrested after driving a car to a house
Three men, 33, 34, and 39 years of age, have been arrested after driving repeatedly to a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 7:30 p.m. at British time.
Detective Bob Blemmings said that the gates and the building itself had been damaged.
It is also possible that a crossbow was shot toward the car.
Menga scores 1-0 Liveningston wins against Rangers
First goal Dolly Menga won Livingston
The Livingston team, who came from the lower league, came to the open, and Steven Gerrard had to endure his second loss in 18 games as Ibrox’s executive.
Mark Dolly Menga made the fortune and the team Gary Holt's is now in second place with the Hibernian.
The Gerrard team has not yet won the championship in this season and is playing against Hearts, eight points ahead of top, the next Sunday.
For that game, Rangers will welcome Rapid Vienna to the European Union on Thursday.
At the same time, Livingston is still undefeated in the Six Victories Division, and Chief Coach Holt has not yet had to experience loss since he replaced Kenny Miller in the last month.
Livingston Loses Opportunity Against Bitless Guests
Holt’s team should have been over a long time before it scored a goal, but their directness caused Rangers great trouble.
Scott Robinson managed to break through but hesitated in his attempt to score, and Alan Lithgow then shot past after passing through the defense to receive a bald transmission from Graig Halkett across the field.
The hosts had Rangers play in front of them calmly, knowing that they could cause the guests trouble in the right places.
And that was the way the goal was challenged.
The Rangers won an extra competition, and Livingston worked to create a market opportunity. Declan Gallagher and Robinson helped Menga together, who accepted a shipment and scored from the middle of the show.
At that point, Rangers had mastered the ball, but the defense of the locals was unbreakable, and Liam Kelly, a goalkeeper, did not have to work hard.
So it continued into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos managed to defend from Kelly.
Scott Pitman was stopped by Allan McGregor, Ranger's goalkeeper, and Lithgow shot from the finish line after a visit from Livingston.
The competitions were constantly in Viitateg Livingston, but were kicked away, and two demands for vita - competition - after Halkett's defense against the deputy Glenn Middleton, and one by hand - were dismissed.
"Beautiful" for Livingston Analysis
Alasdair Lamont, BBC Scotland reporter at Tony Macaroni Stadium
Beautiful performance and finale for Livingston.
For a normal man, they stood out wonderfully and continued to exceed all expectations on their way.
Their game and team have hardly changed anything since they got back to the top league, but Holt is very commendable for having been polishing the team from his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Halkett, the chief was tremendously good and led the fully organized defense, while Menga held Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on his toes all the time.
Rangers, on the other hand, lacked inspiration.
As good as they've been under Gerrard's control, they played far below expectations.
They failed to complete their applications and only once managed to open up half of the locals, so this should be an alarm to Rangers, who are now in the middle of the department.
Erdogan receives mixed receptions in Cologne
It was smiled and brightly lit on Saturday (September 29), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met over breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve the relationship between the two nations of NATO.
Disputes have arisen between them on issues such as human rights, the media and Turkey’s entry into the European Union.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a new huge mosque.
The city is home to most Turkish residents outside Turkey itself.
The police used security reasons to prevent 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but a number of supporters were present in her neighborhood to see her president.
Hundreds of Protestants against Erdogan — many of them Kurds — also heard and condemned both Erdogan’s policy and the decision of the German government to invite him to the country.
The two Protestant groups reflect the controversy of this guest, who is hailed as a hero by some Turks in Germany and hated as a dictator by others.
Conflict in Deptford: A cyclist killed his life in a car accident
A cyclist killed his life in a car in London.
The conflict was near Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a multifaceted street in Deptford, southeast of the city, about 10:15 in British local time.
The car’s driver stopped, and the medical staff gave attention, but the man died in an accident.
A few months after another cyclist died in a collision where a driver drove away on Children’s Street, a mile [1.5 km] from Saturday’s accident site.
The police said that she was working on it, identifying the man and informing his closest associates.
The road has been closed and roads have been diverted, and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six guards were wounded in riots
Six prison officers were injured when riots broke out in a men’s security prison, as reported by a prison institution.
The storm broke out in Long Lartin Prison, Worcestershire, about 9:30 a.m., at British local time on Sunday and still irradiated.
"Tornado" specialists have been called to the area to try to control the riots involving eight prisoners and are only in one wing of the prison.
The guards were treated for minor facial injuries at the scene.
A spokesman for the prison institution said: “Special prison officers have been called out to deal with incidents in the Long Lartin prison.
Six employees have been treated for injury.
No violence has passed in our prisons, and we make it clear that the officers will be handed over to the police and could expect to spend even more time behind locks and bars."
Over 500 prisoners are in Long Lartin Prison, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June it was announced that the jailer had to go to the hospital after a prisoner attacked him.
And last October, a riot police officer was called in to deal with a serious peace disorder, where workers with billiard bullets were attacked.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with rapid floods (dried areas may benefit)
It is rare for a hypothermia to spread over Arizona, but it is likely that it will occur early next week when the remnant of Hurricane Rosa passes through the southwest, at the risk of rapid flooding.
The country's weather room has already issued rapid flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona and south and west Nevada, southeast California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is estimated that Rosa will cross Phoenix directly on Tuesday and arrive late on Monday as a result.
The Phoenix Weather Service reported on Twitter that only “ten hurricanes managed to maintain the strength to be classified as tropical storms or submerged at a distance of less than 200 miles [320 km] from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 64 km of the Arizona border."
The last predictions from the national hurricane center predict 5-10 cm of precipitation, with a single result up to 15 cm in Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
The precipitation is likely to be 2.5 to 5 cm in other areas of the southwest, including the central part of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, with a potential for individual results of up to 10 cm.
For those who are not in danger of experiencing rapid flooding, the results of Rosa could be a blessing because there is a great deal of drought in the area.
Although floods can cause great damage, some of these results will have a positive effect, since drought is now in the southwest.
According to U.S. drought monitoring, there is at least a very large drought in over 40 percent of Arizona, which is the second highest class, according to the weather.com news.
First, the Hurricane Rosa will land on the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa was still classified as a hurricane on Sunday morning with a maximum wind intensity of 136 km per hour, 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, traveling north at 19 km [19 km] an hour.
The storm goes over the cooler waters of the Pacific and so its power is diminishing.
He is expected to land in Mexico as a tropical storm in the afternoon on Monday or on Monday evening.
There is a potential for high rainfall in some areas of Mexico, with a significant risk of flooding.
“It is expected to reach 7.5 to 15 cm in Baja California and into the northwest of Sonora, with the possibility of up to 25 cm of precipitation,” reported weather.com.
Rose will then head north across Mexico as a tropical storm, reaching the Arizona border early on Tuesday morning as a tropical suburb, then continuing up through Arizona and coming to the southern Utah late on Tuesday evening.
“ The most likely threat from Rosa or her remains is very high in Baja California, northwest of Sonora and southwestern of the desert region of the United States, ” said the National Hurricane Center.
This result is expected to result in life - threatening rapid flooding and the movement of soil in the wilderness, and it is expected that it will lead to the end of the mountain.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Homicide Arrests
Three youths and a 20 - year - old have been arrested for murder, after a 16 - year - old boy was found with a knife wound in Somerset.
Adolescents were found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, about 4:00 a.m., at British time on Saturday.
He was transferred to a hospital where his condition is said to be “constant. ”
One 17 - year - old boy, two 18 - year - old, and one 20 - year - old were arrested at night in the Radstock area, according to the Avon and Somerset police.
The police have been waiting for witnesses who might have telephone recordings of what happened to them.
Trump says that Kavanaugh was “feeling evil and anger” from the Democratic Party
"A vote in support of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote which rejects the merciless and disgraceful methods of the Democratic Party," said Trump at a meeting with supporters in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh had “feeling evil and anger ” from the Democratic Party out of his entire process of appointment.
Kavanaugh witnessed to the assembly on Thursday, when he harshly denied the charges from Christine Blasey Ford that he had sexually harassed her several decades ago when they were both teenagers.
Ford also witnessed to the committee about his accusations.
The president said on Saturday that “United Statesmen would have seen the genius and quantity and courage of Kavanaugh the other day.
"A vote for the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote which confirms one of the most brilliant lawyers of our time, a lawyer with an excellent CV as a public employee," he said to the group of his supporters in West Virginia.
The president referred indirectly to Kavanaugh’s appointment when he spoke of the importance of the participation of the Republican supporters in the mid - term reviews.
“ There are five weeks in one of the most important elections in our lives.
I'm not volunteering, but I'm really doing it," he said.
“That’s why I’m going across a wide field to fight for great candidates.”
Trump claimed that democrats were working to “stop and stop. ”
The first key vote on the floor of the Department of Elders on the appointment of Kavanaugh should not be held later than Friday, according to the assistant of the leaders of the Republic during an interview with CNN.
Hundreds of people died from earthquakes and tidal waves in Indonesia, and likely many dead will rise
At least 384 died, and many were washed away when a huge wave hit the beaches, when a great earthquake and a tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, according to the authorities, on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered at a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday, when up to six feet [6 m] high waves were spilled on the beach at sunset, many people washed out on the sea, and destroyed everything that happened to them.
The tidal wave was formed by an earthquake of 7.5 points on Richter.
“When the tidal wave was formed yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not flee immediately, so they died,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia’s disaster agency, at an information meeting in Jakarta.
"The tidal wave didn't come alone, it pulled cars, trees, houses, it hit everything that was on the land," Nugroho said, adding that the tidal wave had traveled across the open sea at a speed of 500 miles [800 km] before it hit the beach.
Some climbed a tree to escape the tidal wave and survived, he said.
Some 16,700 people were moved to 24 centers in Palu.
Photographs from the atmosphere published by the Disaster Agency showed many ruined buildings and shops, twisted and destroyed bridges, and mosques surrounded by water.
Aftershocks continued riding across the beach on Saturday.
The order of the earthquakes occurred in an area of 2.4 million inhabitants.
Indonesia’s foundation for food and technology, declared that the energy that came out of the Great Tremor on Friday, had been about 200 times greater than that of the atom bomb that struck Hiroshima in World War II.
According to the Institute, the geographic location of the city at the end of the long and narrow rivers may have increased the size of the tidal wave.
Nugroho said the damage was “significant” and that thousands of houses, hospitals, malls, and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of a few victims were found trapped under the wreckage of broken buildings, he said, adding that 540 people had been injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the loss and damage to property could be greater along the shoreline 300 km north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the source of the earthquake.
Communication "is completely down and no information is available" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
“Over 300,000 people live there,” said the Red Cross in a declaration, adding that their staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"This has already become a tragedy, but could be much worse," said the Red Cross.
The organization was criticized by many on Saturday for not letting it know that a tsunami had swept through Palu, even though public representatives said that the waves had arrived within the time of the warning.
In a video published on social media, a man could hear a cry from the upper floor of buildings to warn the people on the street below about the approaching of a tsunami.
Just minutes later, the tidal wave strikes on the beach and carries off buildings and cars.
Reuters could not verify the video right away.
The earthquake and the tsunami caused an electrical loss that hindered palu’s communication and made it difficult for authorities to organize relief work.
The army has begun sending relief planes from Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, but people who have been helped by the area still need food and other necessities.
The city’s airport has only been reopened for relief operations and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is planning to visit the Palu refugee centers on Sunday.
The number of deaths goes over 800 after a tidal wave in Indonesia.
The situation is very bad.
World Vision workers from Donggala have reached the city of Palu, where they seek refuge in tents set up in the garden outside their offices, and destruction was on their way, according to Mr. Dosheba.
"People said they had seen many houses completely destroyed," he said.
The situation is very bad.
Helping groups have begun difficult relief work, but some have complained that foreign relief workers with extensive expertise are prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, foreign funding, supplies, and personnel can only start to arrive if the accident site is declared a disaster site.
It hasn't been done yet.
"This is still a local accident area," said Aulia Arriani, spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
Once the government has declared that this is a disaster area, we can open up to foreign aid, but no declaration has yet been made."
When the second night fell on Palu after the earthquake and the tsunami on Friday, friends and their families who are still missing kept in the hope that their loved ones would be one of the miraculous stories that shed hope for the humiliating headlines that follow natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was rescued from the sewer.
On Sunday, relief workers rescued a woman who had been trapped under ruins for two days with her mother’s body beside her.
Gendon Subandono, a trainer of the Indonesian glider team, had been the trainer of two now missing gliders for the Asian games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others who were locked up in Roa Roa Hotel were his students, including Mr. Monday.
“ As a person with long experience in flying, I have my own emotional burden to bear, ” he said.
Mr. Gendon reported that the hours after the news came from the float group because the Roa Roa Hotel had crashed, he had sent WhatsApp messages in desperation to the competitors who stayed in Palu and participated in the beach festival.
His message, however, showed only gray marks, rather than blue ones.
"I think that means that the messages were not received," he said.
Stealers steal $26,750 at the Newport on the Levee bank restocking
On Friday morning, thieves robbed $26,750 of Brink's staff, who were filling up a ATM in Newport on the Levee, as reported by the Newport Police.
The driver of the car had been emptying a bank in the entertainment area and was filling it with more money, said police officer Dennis McCarthy in the announcement.
When he was doing his job, another man came “running behind the Brink employee ” and stole a bag of money intended for delivery.
Witnesses saw many suspects fleeing the scene, according to the announcement, but the police did not reveal how many were involved.
Those who might have any information about the suspects are asked to contact the Newport police by phone 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes its name to Ye
The rapper Kanye West is going to change his name--to Ye.
He announced the change on Twitter on Saturday and wrote: “The formerly known being as Kanye West. ”
West, 41, has been called Ye for some time and used the name as the title of his eighth album released in June.
The change comes for his participation in Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to announce his new album, Yandhi.
He replaces Aryana Grandi on the show, who stopped for “emotional reasons, ” said the producer.
West has previously said that this name has a religious meaning for him, but it also shortens his present name.
“ I think ‘ye’ (you) is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you’,’ said West earlier in the year when he spoke the name of his record to the radio director Big Boy.
“So I am you, I am us, this is us.
It went from Kanye, which means the only one, and to just Ye--just being a reflection of the good in us, the evil, the confused, all.
The record is rather a reflection of who we are."
He is one of many famous rapists who have changed his name.
Sean Combs has been called Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he would rather be called Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, former West associate, has also written his name with and without a string and capital.
So the elected president of Mexico vows not to use the army against general citizens.
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, president-elect of Mexico, has promised never to use military force against the general public, now that the country will be silent soon to commemorate the 50th anniversary of bloody vengeful students.
On Saturday in Tlatelolco Square, Lopez Obrador promised: “Never use the army to oppress the Mexican people. ”
Soldiers took a peaceful protest march on October 2, 1968, and dropped up to 300 people at a time when the left - handed movements of the students were taking root throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to help young people in Mexico by giving all students monthly strength and opening up more free public universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of study opportunities attract young people to crime scenes.
The United States should double the amount of artificially intelligent funding
Now that China is increasingly active in the use of artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount of money it has in research in this field, says the inventor and artificial intelligence user Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments were made after the various departments of the U.S. government issued an announcement of artificial intelligence, even though the United States has no formal overall program of artificial intelligence.
China, on the other hand, announced its plan last year: it aims to be in first place in the creation of artificial intelligence by 2030.
“ It would be a good start to double the amount of money spent on artificial intelligence, compared with the fact that all other countries are so much further behind the United States, and we are waiting to see the next big discovery in the field of artificial intelligence, ” said Lee.
Double funding could double the probability that the next major discovery in artificial intelligence will be made in the United States, said Lee to the CNBC during an interview this week.
Lee, author of the book “Al Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order, ” published this month by publisher Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the president of the company Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in Face++, one of the major artificial intelligence companies in China.
He worked on an artificial intelligence system in the 1980 ’ s at Carnegie Mellon University, which won the best player in the United States at Othello, and later he was CEO of Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese department at Google.
Lee spoke of previous technical competitions held by the U.S. authorities, such as the Defense Division’s robotic contest, and asked when the next race would be held to identify the next initiative.
Scientists in the United States often have to work hard to get strength from the government, says Lee.
“ It’s not China that captures its main ideas, it’s the companies, ” said Lee.
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have hired university - based geniuses to work with artificial intelligence over the past few years.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could also help the United States to strengthen its artificial intelligence research.
“ I think those who have a doctorate in artificial intelligence should automatically be allowed to stay, ” he said.
China’s Congress published its future satellite intelligence plan in July 2017.
According to Lee, China’s Natural Science Agency provides funding to university - based staff, similar to that of the National Science Foundation and similar public agencies in the United States, but the quality of science is worse in China.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense set up a satellite - intelligence center to cooperate with both industry and educational institutions, and the White House announced the formation of a special committee on artificial intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced that it had invested $2 billion in a project called AI Next.
As far as NSF is concerned, it invests over $100 million annually in artificial intelligence research.
At the same time, U.S. legislation designed to create a Security Council on artificial intelligence has not made any progress for months.
The Macedonians vote in a referendum on whether to change the country's name
The people of Macedonia voted for a referendum on Sunday on whether to change the country's name to the 'Northern Macedonia Republic' in an attempt to resolve a decade-long conflict with Greece, which has closed its application for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a region called Macedonia and claims that its neighbours’ names in the north are equivalent to the requirements of their territory and therefore refused entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the new name, but nationalistic opposers argue that the change will undermine the identity of the majority of the inhabitants of Macedonia of slavery.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that he will not take part in the vote and campaign to ignore it has raised doubts that participation will reach the 50 percent minimum required for the vote to be considered valid.
The question of the ballot is this: ‘ Do you want to go to NATO and the EU by agreeing to the agreement with Greece? ’
The supporters of the change of name, including Zoran Zaev, prime minister, say that this is a reasonable price for Macedonia to join such alliances as the EU and NATO, but it is one of those formed by the fall of Yugoslavia.
“I came today to choose the future of the country for the young people of Macedonia so that they can live freely under the protection of the European Union because it means a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgijevska, 79 years old, in Skopje.
Although the conclusion is not legally binding, enough congressmen have said that they will follow it and bind it to law.
The change of name would require the approval of two thirds of Congress.
The polling committee said that nothing unusual had been reported at 1 p.m.
However, the participation was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last congress in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters voted.
“I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62 years of age who voted in Skopje, the capital.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son, Dushko, voted in the National Voices Grant in Macedonia on whether to change the country’s name, which would facilitate its entry into NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
In front of Skopje’s Assembly, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54 years of age, worked to prepare small areas and set up chairs in front of tents built by those who would ignore the vote.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to become members with our heads high, not go through the service door," said Kavardkov.
“ We are a land of poverty, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to agree with us as Macedonia, we can turn around like China or Russia and become part of a European Union."
Prime Minister Zaev says that participation in NATO will bring the necessary funding to Macedonia, where the share of the unemployed is more than 20 percent.
"I believe that the largest majority will agree that more than 80 percent of national citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after paying his vote.
He said that acceptance would be “confirmation of our future. ”
A survey published on Monday from the Macedonian Policy Research Institute showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the national vote, which is less than the minimum required.
Another TV TV poll showed that 57 percent of respondents were going to vote on Sunday.
Of them, 70 percent said yes.
In order for national votes to be considered valid, a meeting must be 50 percent plus one vote.
Failure to approve the vote could mean the first serious blow to the government’s policy in favour of the West since it was adopted in May of last year.
See: Sergio Aguero, Manchester City player, goes through all the defenses of Brighton and scores
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling took Brighton's defenses lightly to win Manchester City 2 - 0 on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy when he scored his goal at 65 minutes.
At the beginning of the search, the Argentine outpost received a broadcast in the middle of the field.
He sprang past three defenders of Brighton and then went out into the open field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four greek defenders.
He got past one defenseman and then ran away from a few more right at Brighton.
Then he sent him to the left and found Sterling there.
The English champion used the first contact within the banner to send the ball back to Aguero, who used his right foot to play on Mathew Ryan, Brighton’s goaltender, with a shot in the right side of the goal.
"Aguero has some foot problems," said Pep Guardiola, CEO of City, to reporters.
“We talked about him playing 55, 60 minutes.
Then this happened.
We were lucky he scored a mark at this moment."
But it was Sterling who gave them the first blue mark in the great league game.
That goal arrived at a 29 - minute interval.
Aguero received a shipment far inside the field of Brighton on that visit.
He sent a beautiful long ball on the left to Leroy Sane.
Sane kicked the ball several times and then sent it to Sterling toward the far pole.
Forthward City sent the ball to the net just before it ran out.
City is playing at the Hoffenheim Championship at 12:55 on Tuesday at the Rhein-Necker Stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play a match against Rockies
Since the Nationals have been excluded from playing in the finals, there was little reason to force another start.
But the zealous Scherzer hopes to be thrown on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if Rockies still have the chance to finish, but they have the same game lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the West.
Rockies got at least a Wildcard seat with a 5-2 victory at the Nationals on Friday night, but the team is still trying to win its first edition.
“ Even though we play for free, we can at least play for an electric atmosphere in Denver as well as the other team will surely play their best game this year.
Why should I not want to compete under such circumstances?"
Nationals will still announce who will be the first to caster in Sunday’s game, but they are thought to have Scherzer throw at these circumstances.
Scherzer, who was about to start the 34th game, took a round of exercises on Thursday and would throw on a Sunday, which is usually his rest day.
This right-handed pitcher at Washington is 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 blows in 220 2/3 rounds this season.
Trump visits West Virginia
The president referred indirectly to the case surrounding Kavanaugh, the appointed Supreme Judge when he spoke of the importance of the participation of the Republican supporters in the mid - term reviews.
“Everything is going on in November.
It's five weeks in one of the most important elections of our lives.
It's one of the big, big... I don't volunteer, but I do, that's why I'm going around the field to fight for great candidates," he said.
Trump continued: “You can see this terrible, radical group of democrats, you can see it happening now.
And they are determined to regain power by whatever means necessary, you see the cruelty, the evil.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to go over to gain power and government, they just want power and government, we don't give it to them.
He said that democrats were working on “suspending and hindering. ”
"And it has been seen for the last four days," he said, "and the democrats are angry and evil and cruel and untruthful."
He named Senator Diane Feinstein, a leading democrat on the Senate Committee, and was answered with a loud voice from the audience.
“Do you remember her answer?
You're the one who leaked the document?
Ha, what.
I waited for one... it was really bad body expression, the worst I've ever seen."
The working class is no longer a tolerant church.
He tolerates no one who expresses his mind
When the activist Moments in my group chose to make a statement to me, it hardly came as a surprise.
After all, I am the last of the many congressmen of the working class who have been told that we are not welcome, just for expressing our minds.
Joan Ryan, my fellow senator, received similar treatment because she protested harshly against the Jews.
In my case, I had the opportunity to make comments because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
The issue was the importance of having a responsible economic policy, of national security, of Europe, ironically similar issues to those on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The announcement of the Nottingham East meeting on Friday said that “we want the meetings to be inconceivable and effective. ”
In my eight - year career as a member of the Workers ’ Party, Friday meetings have been the most frequent of all.
Unfortunately, there are not many meetings today and the promise of “milder and better” politics has been forgotten, if it ever started.
It has become increasingly evident that different opinions have not passed in the Workers ’ Party and that all opinions are judged according to whether or not the leaders of the Party consider them acceptable.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, when colleagues whom I previously thought had similar political views to mine, began to expect me to take a complete turn and support opinions that I had never agreed before, whether they were about national security or a common EU market area.
Every time I speak in public -- and then it doesn't matter what I say -- there's a bunch of outrages on the community media calling for my expulsion, central government denial, and telling me that I shouldn't be in the Workers' Party.
And this is not just my experience.
I know I'm luckier than some of my colleagues, since most of the comments I get are usually political.
I admire the professionalism and affirmation of those who have to endure the plight of sexual or prejudiced insults every day but never retreat.
One of the most disappointing things in this political period is how attacks and insults have become a normal part of everyday life.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Workers ’ Party should take care of tolerant culture.
The reality is that we are no longer tolerant of the church, and with any distrust or change of choice, the class becomes ever tighter.
I have been given many advices in the last two years to be modest, not too loud, and then I would be “all right. ”
But I did not decide to participate in politics to do so.
Since I became a member of the Workers ’ Party as a student 32 years ago, motivated by the neglect of the government of Thatcher, who left my schoolroom in the abyss, I have fought for better public service for those who need it most, whether I was in town government or at the assembly.
I have never hidden my political views, nor at the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East can be in any doubt about my policy views and where I disagree with current leaders.
To those who supported the proposal on Friday, I would just like to say that when the country is heading for Brexit, which will harm the homes, businesses and our public service, I do not understand the desire to spend time and energy in my loyalty to the leaders of the Workers’ Party.
But my only message, which I want to send out, is not to Nottingham Moments, but to those who are within my jurisdiction, whether they are members of the Workers' Party or not: I serve you proudly and I promise that no threats of anomaly or political disfellowshipping will deter me from doing what I think is for the best of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Undefeated Team Ayr Goes to the Top
Two late touchdowns might have shaken the final result something, but there's no doubt that Ayr had won the victory in this absolute game of the day in the Tennent's Premiership department.
They are now at the top of the list and the only team of ten still undefeated.
Finally, their protection and better use of opportunities made the locals more victorious, and Coach Peter Murchie was fully entitled to be happy.
"We've had tough opposition in our games so far and are still undefeated, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said: “Oyr deserves commendation, they took advantage of their opportunities better than we do, ”
Mark Grant Anderson came across Ayr at the 14th minute after Frazier Climo turned the search around, but a yellow card on the Scottish leader, who was allowed to play the game with the Warriors, enabled Melrose to let the numbers speak and Jason Baggot reached the touchdown.
Clima increased to the leadership of Ayr with hell before he scored with a kick just before half a game and then touched the target and put Ayr over 17-5 in half a game.
But Melrose began the second half of his life forcefully, and Patrick Anderson, after Baggot turned his search around, reduced the difference to five points.
Then it took a long break to cover serious injuries at the Ruaridh Knott, which had to be carried off the playground, and then Ayr continued to increase his leadership with touch marks from Stafford McDowall, after Clima reversed the search.
Blair Macpherson, director of Ayr, then got the yellow card and Melrose used himself again to be a man over with a touchdown from Bruce Colvine, at the end of a tough quest.
The locals, however, came back strong, and when Struan Hutchinson received the yellow card for using Climo without the ball, MacPherson challenged the touch mark behind the Ayr search, after an extra kick.
Climo turned the search around, as he did again immediately after the resumption, after Kyle Rowe reached the kicks of David Amrstrong from Vitanteig and sent to Gregor Henry, who scored the fifth touchdown of the team.
Star the Still Game features ready for a new career in the restaurant sector
Ford Kieran, the star of the Still Game series, seems ready to move to the restaurant after he found out that he was the manager of a restaurant company.
Kieran, 56 years old, plays Jack Jarvis in the BBC plays popular, which he writes and plays with his old partner from the entertainment industry, Greg Hemhill.
The twin has reported that the future ninth series will be the last and seems to have plans for Craiglang’s life.
According to official records, he's the managing director of Astravmorn Limited.
The actor didn't want to say anything about the story, but the Scottish Sun source insisted that Klär wanted to be a part of the "living restaurant business" of Glasgow City.
"The sea is ours": The land of Bolivia without shore hopes that a court will reopen its way to the Pacific
Sailors are guarding the Navy headquarters in La Paz.
General buildings flag blue flags.
Fleet stations from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are marked with the slogan: “We have a right to the sea.
It's our duty to get it back."
Throughout the 19th century, Bolivia, throughout its land, echoed the reminder of the shoreline that was lost to Chile in bloody conflicts — with its desire to revisit the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes may be the strongest for decades, now that Bolivia is awaiting rulings from the International Court of Justice in The Hague on October 1 after five years of trial.
“ Bolivia has the power, the spirit of unity and the lack of respect, and, of course, waits for the decision with a positive mind, ” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many people in Bolivia will observe the international court’s ruling on large screens throughout the country, hoping that the court in The Hague will judge Bolivia in favor of their demand that Chile be obliged to grant Bolivia access to it, after decades of difficult conversation.
The decision on Monday is also very important to Evo Morales, the president of the country of Indian families, who will have a controversial battle for election next year.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he promised late in August.
However, some analysts believe that the court’s ruling in favour of Bolivia is unlikely to change much if he did.
The court, which has headquarters in the Netherlands, has no authority to give land from Sile and has ruled that the decision will not affect the outcome of the discussion.
The fact that the court’s ruling comes only six months after the final hearing indicates that the case “had not been complicated, ” said Paz Sárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
It is also possible that in the last four years, Bolivia has not been a cause for improvement, but has been a cause for decline.
"The current government of Bolivia has stolen the issue of access to the sea," said Zárate.
Morale’s hardy words have diminished all goodwill from Sile, she thought.
Bolivia and Sile will continue their discussions at some point, but after that it will be extremely difficult.
The two countries have not been divided by ambassadors since 1962.
Eduardo Rodriguez Veltzé, former president of Bolivia and representative of the country in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision had taken unusually short time.
On Monday, Bolivia will have a 'unique opportunity to open up a new relationship with Sile' and an opportunity to 'end a conflict which reaches 139 years back in time, to the benefit of both countries', he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, was using this subject as a political crutch.
“ Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific, ” he added.
“The decision is an opportunity to see that we need to recover from the past.”
North Korea says nothing will happen to nuclear disarmament unless it can be trusted by the United States
Ri Yong Ho, North Korea's Foreign Minister, says the country will never take down its nuclear weapons first if it can't trust Washington.
Ri gave his speech on Saturday at the General Assembly of the United Nations.
He called on the United States to follow the promises they made at a meeting in Singapore between the leaders of the nations.
His comment now comes from Mike Pompeo, U.S. Secretary of State, seems to be reopening talks on nuclear weapons, more than three months after the meeting in Singapore with Kim Jong Un, leader of North Korea.
Ri says it is 'dreaming' to think that continued business and US protests against the declaration of the end of the Korean War will ever kneel down North Korea.
Washington doesn't want to approve the declaration unless Pyongyang takes first clear action to take down his nuclear weapons.
Both Kim and Donald Trump, president of the United States, want to meet again at another meeting.
However, there is great doubt that Pyongyang is serious about taking down weapons that the country probably sees as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare the next meeting between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris present the latest line of big headwear that will come to fashion stores near you
If you want to expand your hat collection or be completely hidden from the sun, you do not have to look any further.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne showed a variety of strange hats in the supersizes of their SS19 line in the fashion field that fascinated the modus operandi during the fashion week in Paris.
The number of images of extremely unsuitable hats has been published on Instagram this summer, and these designers have shown their innovative creations at fashion shows.
The main work by Valentino was a large light - brown hat with a wide, featherlike structure that covered the head of the models.
Of other oversized components, watermelons set gemstones, a barber hat, and even pineapple, but these items are not designed to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also introduced a variety of strange masks, just at the right time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had assembled lips and were more like Hannibal Lecter than high - fashion.
One mask resembled a scuba diving device with a tube and a glass eye, while another looked like a melting ice in bread form.
If you want to toll on that bitch, you're lucky.
Fashion experts predict that the big hats could soon be sold at fashion stores near you.
Large hats come down on the heels of “La Bomba, ” a straw hat with a weight of more than 20 inches [60 cm], which has adorned the head from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The fashion mark behind the very inconvenient hat seen on all social media was the inspiration for another major feature on the fashion scene — a straw - made beach bag that was almost as large as the swimwear model that carried it.
The orange straw box, with a strawboard and a white leather handle, was the main part of La Riviera SS10 clothesline Jacquemus during the fashion week in Paris.
Luke Armitage, the stylist of the famous people, said in an interview to FEMAIL: “I expect to see big hats and beach bags appear in the fashion stores for the next summer - because the designer has had such an impact, it should be difficult to ignore demand for oversized items. ”
John Edward: Linguistic skills are a necessity for citizens of the world
The private schools in Scotland are known for the outstanding achievements of their students and have continued in 2018 with new, impressive test results, which are still supported by individual and group achievements in sports, arts, music and other social activities.
These schools have up to 30,000 students throughout Scotland, with The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) in their defense, and they strive to provide their students and their parents with the best possible service.
Private schools aim to prepare their students for further secondary education, the career they have chosen, and their position as citizens of the world.
As a teacher who can put together and teach by specialized study programs, we see that news continues to be a popular subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to a person in a language that he understands, it affects his mind.
If thou speak to him in his mother tongue, it shall touch his heart.
This is an important reminder that we cannot rely solely on English to build relationships and trust with people from other lands.
This year’s test results show that languages are at the top of the lists with the highest proportion of students taking private school tests.
68 percent of foreign - language students received the A.
The data collected from 74 schools within the SCIS showed that 72 percent of students received the quality grade A in mandarin, while 72 percent of those who learned German, 69 percent of those who learned French, and 63 percent of those who learned Spanish also received the grade A.
This shows that private schools in Scotland support foreign languages as necessary skills for children and young people in the future.
At the moment, languages as a choice are placed in the same place as science - related subjects (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) in private schools and elsewhere.
A survey conducted in 2014 by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills revealed that for the reasons given by employers that it was difficult to recruit was 17 percent because of a lack of language skills.
Hence, language skills are becoming more and more important in preparing young people for their future work.
Now that more and more jobs are required in languages, this skill is needed in a global world.
No matter what career people choose, learning another language will have a real advantage in the future, but it is a skill that lasts a lifetime.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically give a large - weight person a head start on the competitors.
According to an opinion poll conducted by YouGov in over 4,000 adults in the British in 2013, 75 percent of them were unable to speak another language well enough to hold talks, and French was the only language spoken by two letters of a percentage, or 15 percent.
Therefore, it is important for today’s children to invest immediately in language training.
Multitudes, especially in new markets, will give children better opportunities to find important jobs.
In Scotland, the language they teach varies from school to school.
A number of schools will focus on classical news, while others will teach languages that are considered to be the most important for Britain when it comes to 2020, such as mandarin or Japanese.
No matter where your child’s interest lies, it will always be able to choose languages in private schools with specialized teachers.
Scottish private schools commit themselves to offering a study environment that will prepare children and prepare them with the skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future may bring.
It cannot be denied that at this time, in a global business environment, language continues to be necessary for the future of the country, and this must be reflected in education.
Really, modern language should be viewed as “an international knowledge of communication. ”
Private schools will continue to offer choice, diversity, and excellence to young people in Scotland.
Il fout bien le faire.
John Edwards, Chairman of the Scottish Private School Council
LeBron plays his first game for Lakers in San Diego on Sunday
The wait is soon over for fans who want to see LeBron James play their first game for the Los Angeles Lakers team.
Luke Walton, Lakers coach, has announced that James will be playing on Sunday at the opening of the season against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
The number of minutes he will play has not yet been determined.
“ It will be longer than a minute and shorter than 48, ” said Walton on Lakers ’ official website.
Mike Trudell, a reporter for Lakers, said on Twitter that James would probably play for a limited time.
After an exercise earlier this week, James was asked out on his schedule for the six Lakers games before the start of the season.
“ During this period of my career, I don’t have to play games for the season to prepare, ” he said.
Timer for Trump election meeting in West Virginia and YouTube channel
President Donald Trump will hold a number of polls and the first one will be tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
He is one of five organized meetings next week, where he will also stop in friendly places, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that the vote to confirm his election to the new Supreme Court has been suspended, Trumpat is considering building up support for the next mid-term review, as the Republicans are at risk of losing control of the Senate when votes are cast in November.
What time is Trump's election meeting in West Virginia, and how can you watch it online?
Trump's meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled to begin at 7 p.m. this evening, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch the meeting with Trump in West Virginia on the web below through a live broadcast on YouTube.
It is likely that Trump will refer the case to Brett Kavanaugh, a designated Supreme Court judge, who was tense about the charges of sexual harassment, and the Senate's vote to confirm him as a judge for up to a week while the FBI is investigating the charges.
But the main goal of Trump’s meetings is to help Republicans make a better move, but they are facing difficult elections in November.
Thus, Trump’s election campaign that these five meetings held next week was aimed at “filling the zeal of volunteers and supporters who Republicans are trying to protect and increase the majority they have in the Senate and Congress, ” according to Reuter’s newsroom.
"Chairmanship is so necessary for the President's plan that he will travel to as many states as possible already a busy campaign period is about to begin," said an undisclosed spokesman from Trump's election campaign at Reuter's newsroom.
Tonight’s meeting will be held at the Wesbanco Stadium in Wheeling, and supporters are expected to come from “Ohio and Pennsylvania and the Pittsburgh media, ” according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday's meeting will be Trump's second visit to West Virginia this month, but he won with over 40 percent difference in this state in 2016.
Trump wants to try to help Patrick Morrissey, the Republican candidate in Western Virginia to the Senate, but he's at the bottom of the polls.
"It is not a good idea for Morrissey that the President should come and try to increase his popularity," said Simon Haeder, political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters' newsroom.
Ryder Cup 2018: The United States shows a willingness to fight to keep the hope alive for the individual race on Sunday
After three one - sided laps, the 4th game, which was in the afternoon on Saturday, could be exactly what was needed in this game of the Ryder Cup.
Successful swings are a concept of sports that has been invented and that players truly believe in, and never more so than in the competition like this.
Where would they say that success is now failing?
"They had a six-point head start, and now it's four points, so that our success is more on our side now, I guess," said Jordan Spieth as he set off in the race of the day.
Of course, Europe has a head start, four points ahead, with an additional 12 at stake.
The Americans, as Spieth said, think they have a little wind in their sails, and they can hope for many things, especially Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each got three points out of four.
Spieth has played a great deal beyond the surface and leads by his example.
As the ring went down, the cheering shout rose, and he put down a key piece to pick up all four points of the game after he and Thomas had been two points below two games.
His poacher, who won them in the 15th - hole game, received a similar shout of joy, a cry of the kind that tells you that he believes that the American people still have a hope of victory.
"You just have to dive deep and think about your own game," said Spieth.
That's all these players can do right now.
18 holes to win in points.
One player with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days is Francesco Molinaro and Tommy Fleetwood, the irrefutable history of the Ryder Cup.
This strange but fascinating European couple has won four games out of four and cannot do anything wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple to have had late afternoons on Saturday, but they also managed to avoid late Saturday mornings, afternoons on Fridays, and nine holes on Friday mornings.
The game and the way their energy seems to flow both to and from the loud audience clearly shows that they are the couple who have to win on Sunday, and it would be no popular player to seal the possible victory of the European team than Fleetwood or Molinari, as the sun sits over the Le Golf National Field.
The best option would be for both to do so at the same time in different holes.
However, it is still too early to talk about the victory of the European team.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson went lightly with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the fourth game in the morning, where he played with Alex Noren.
In the first nine holes, the Spanish and Swedish buried two doubles in a hole that they never scratched.
But on Sunday, no one can help you out of your hole.
The four balls and the quadruples are so exciting to watch in the vicinity because of the interaction between the couples, their advice, the advice they don’t give, and how a play schedule can change in one direction.
Europe has played better as it progressed to this point and has a considerable head start for the final day, but this round of four also showed that the United States team has had the will to fight that some had doubted, especially the other Americans.
Europe with a 10-6 lead for the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will have a good start for the end day of the Ryder Cup after a four-ball and four-game Saturday, with a 10-6 lead against the United States.
The astrologers Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the attack with two victories over the difficult Tiger Woods and have won four points on the Le Golf National.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who would like to get back the winner who lost it at the Hazeltine field two years ago, showed great superiority over the United States team in the four - ball game of the morning and won 3-1.
The U.S. showed greater opposition in the four games and won two games but failed to win the level difference.
Jim Furyk’s team required eight points from 12 individuals on Sunday to continue the cup.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row, and he and Molinari, who received the nickname “Molliwood ” after a wonderful weekend, are just the second pair to win four points from their first four games in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the four-ball game, they showed a great crowd and won the lap of Woods and American rookie Bryson Decambeau 5-4.
Woods, who pulled himself through two games on Saturday, showed his genius on occasion, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 games in four - ball games and quadruples and seven of them in a row.
Justin Rose, who was resting for the four-ball game of the morning, came back to his partner, Henriks Stenson in the four games and won them 2-1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - who are in the first and third seats on the list of the best golfers in the world.
However, Europe did not go far enough on this mild and mundane day southwest of Paris.
A triple winner in the golf championship, Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the goal for Americans with two points on Saturday.
They worked with difficulty 2-1 against Jon Rahm from Spain and Ian Poulter in four-ball games and later came back and defeated Poulter and Rory Mcllroy 4-3 in the quadruples after losing the first two holes.
It has only happened twice in the history of the Ryder Cup that a team won a four - point difference at the start of an individual race, although Furyk’s team would only need a level playing field to continue the trophy.
After being second best for two days, however, a counterattack on Sunday seems to overwhelm them.
North Korea says one-sided disarmament "impossible" without trust
The Foreign Minister of North Korea said on Saturday that continued business bans only boosted their distrust of the United States and it would be impossible for the country to take down its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho said at the annual General Assembly of the United States that North Korea had taken “significant action to show goodwill” in the past year, for example by stopping nuclear and missile tests, taking down the nuclear test area, and promising to stop the development of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"We have not seen any similar reaction from the United States," he said.
“Without confidence in the United States, there is no certainty about our country’s security, and under such circumstances it is impossible that we take our nuclear weapons down one side first.”
Although Ri repeated familiar North Korean complaints about Washington’s opposition to the “stage-shifted” approach to nuclear disarmament, where North Korea was rewarded for every step it took, his declaration appeared to be unique in that he did not disown one-sided nuclear disarmament purely out as Pyongyang had done before.
Ri referred to the joint declaration by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first meeting between the President-in-Office of the United States and the North Korean leader, in Singapore on 12 June, where Kim promised to work on the ‘nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula’ and Trump issued a promise to ensure the safety of North Korea.
North Korea has sought solutions to bring a formal end to the Korean War in 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must leave its nuclear weapons behind first.
Washington has also resisted calls to relax a strict ban on North Korea.
“ The United States demands that “nuclear disarmament takes place first ” and increases pressure by using a business order to achieve its goals, even protesting the declaration to end the war, ” said Ri.
“ It’s just the fantasies of people who don’t know anything about us that business calls can get us on our knees.
But the problem is that continuing business calls increase our distrust."
Ri did not mention plans for another meeting between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leader spoke about at the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the Minister spoke of three meetings between Kim and Moon Jae-In, the leader of South Korea in the last five months and added: “If the party to this nuclear disarmament matter were South Korea instead of the United States, this would not be the issue of nuclear disarmament in the Korean Peninsula.”
In spite of this, the tone of Ri's speech was very different from his speech last year when he said at the General Assembly of the United States that it would be inevitable to refer missiles from North Korea to the mainland of the United States after the "Devil President" Trump called Kim a "fireman" on a suicide mission.
Last year, Trump threatened to "bring" North Korea, but this year he praised Kim of the United Nations for his courage in taking steps towards disarmament, but said that there was still a great deal of work to be done and that a business effort had to continue until North Korea had destroyed all its nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday Trump said that he had no time frame in this regard, saying: “If it takes two years, three years, or five months, it doesn’t matter. ”
China and Russia say that the US Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps it has taken.
On the other hand, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council on Thursday: “The Security Council’s business package must continue until complete nuclear disarmament has taken place and is confirmed. ”
The Security Council agreed to increase the North Korea business package from 2006 in an attempt to close down funding for the Pyongyang nuclear and missile plans.
Pompeo met Ri on the sideline of the U.S. General Assembly and later said that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare another meeting.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times a year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said that success had been achieved, but only a few hours later, North Korea condemned him for making “criminal demands.”
North Korea promised a meeting with Moon this month to take down a missile area and a nuclear station if the United States resorted to 'corresponding actions'.
He said that Kim had told himself that the "corresponding actions" he was looking for were security assurances promised by Trump in Singapore and actions towards normal relations with Washington.
Harvard Students Take a Course in Enough Rest
A new course at Harvard University has given all students more sleep in an effort to resist the growing tendency of students to wake up and learn all night with the help of caffeine tablets.
Research revealed that students at the world’s best university often know little or nothing when it comes to the basics of thinking about themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of dormancy at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and the women’s hospital, designed the course and considered it to be the first species in the United States.
After giving a lecture on the effects of sleep deprivation on a study program, he got the idea of doing a course.
“ At the end of the talk, a girl came to me and asked: “Why is this only said to me now, in my final year? ”
She said that no one had told her anything about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," he said to the telegraph.
The first course of study this year explains to students the basics of how good sleep habits help study and sports performance and even promote general well - being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and director of the school’s health service, said that the university had decided to introduce the course after discovering that students were very sleepless over the week.
The duration of the study is one hour and includes various interactive projects.
In one part, there is a picture of a living room where students click on coffee cups, curtains, sports shoes, and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how sports performances can worsen in sleep deprivation, as well as the importance of a good routine for sleep.
In other parts, participants are told how long - term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the school area with interactive symbols then encourages participants to think about their daily habits.
“We know that this will not change the behaviour of students immediately.
But we think they have the right to know this, just as you have the right to know about the health effects of smoking cigarettes," added Professor Czeisler.
The culture that favors those who stay awake and learn all night is still there, he said, adding that modern technology and growing pressure on students meant that sleep deprivation was a growing problem.
Making sure that good quality sleep is enough should be a ‘ secret pen ’ for students to resist stress, fatigue, and anxiety, he said — even to avoid getting fat, for lack of sleep increases the brain’s call for food so that the body is hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student in chemical and physical biology from California, helped Professor Czeisler put together the course, but he sat one of the professor's curfews last year at Harvard.
He said that the course opened his eyes and encouraged him to call for a course for all students at school.
He hopes that the next step will be to ask all masters to complete a similar course before they start studying at the university.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider adjusting the alarm clock, which reminds them to go to sleep, and to wake them up, and bear in mind the harmful effects of blue light emitted by electronic monitors and LED light, which may confuse the inner clock of the body and lead to trouble falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Mark of Menga shoots down Gerrard's men
Rangers still had problems in the field when Stevens Gerrards had to deal with 1-0 loss of Livingston, after the Dolly Menga target.
The team Ibrox wanted to win his first victory at the field after his victory at St. Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team gave Gerrard's team only his second loss in his 18 games as manager. The team is now eight points behind the Hearts, which is in the top seat of the Ladbrokes Premiership Division.
Menga scored seven minutes before half a game, and Rangers seemed to lack all inspiration and was never likely to even.
The Rangers now fall to sixth place, but Livingston goes up to the third and is only following the Hibernian in the finish line.
Rangers may have had further problems after the lineer Calum Spence had to be treated for head injury after some thing was thrown into him from the field half of the guests.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that swept away Ayr and made a break in the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, kept to the same Livi 11 that reached a level of Hearts last week, and he would have been pleased with how well - trained members of his team overcame the resistance.
Rangers might have been more with the ball, but Livingston created more opportunities with the ball it reached.
They should have scored only two minutes after the start of the game when the first shipment from Menga came Scott Pitman in front of Allans McGregor's goal, but he missed.
A long sidekick from Keaghan Jacobs then ended up with Craig Halkett, but Alan Lithgow, his defender, shot past the remote pole.
Rangers regained control of the game but seemed to live in hope rather than belief in their game in the final third of the game.
Alfredo Morales certainly felt that when he and Steven Lawless got together, he should have had a hell of a fight, but Judge Steven Thomson dismissed the Colombian appeal.
Rangers only managed to take two shots in the first half, while Liam Kelly, a former target of Ibrox, did not have to have much to defend a baldness from Lassana Coulibaly and an easy shot from Ovie Ejaria.
Although the opportunity from Livi had come in 34 minutes despite the fact that the other team had the upper hand, no one can deny that they deserved it, even only because of their perseverance.
Rangers failed again to do anything of a long extra effort from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who held his peace and chose to send to Menga, who then easily scored.
Gerrard took his advice in half and sent Ryan Kent into place for Coulibally and the exchange had an effect almost immediately as the backguard entered Morelos, but Kelly reacted quickly and rushed forward to close the shot.
Nevertheless, Livingston continued to fool the guests into playing the very game they enjoyed playing, and Lithgow and Halkett reached each long shipment on their feet.
The Holts team could have increased their leadership on the final minutes, but McGregor did well to deny Jacobs an opportunity before Lithgow ran to the finish line from the corner.
Glenn Middleton, Ranger's deputy, wanted another hell when he and Jacobs fell down together, but Thomson turned it down again.
Almanac: The man who invented the Geiger counter
Here comes a page from our calendar “Sunday Morning”: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and AFRAM... this is the day that future physicist Johannes Wilhelm “Hans” Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of studying and measuring radioactivity, and this invention eventually led to a device called Geiger’s instrument.
Since then, the Geiger measure has gained a steady position in the scientific world, but has also been popular in pop culture, for example in the 1950 movie "Bells of Coronado", with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans in unlikely roles as scientists:
A man: “What in the world is this? ”
Rogers: “This is Geiger’s measure, used to find radioactive materials such as uranium.
When you put this hearing aid on you, you can hear the effects of the atoms because of the radioactivity in the rocks."
Evans: “It’s really breaking up now! ”
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the invention that bears his name survives.

The vaccine teaches the immune system to know dangerous cells as part of the treatment
The treatment includes taking immune cells from the patient and changing them in a laboratory
Then they can “see” proteins, which are common in many cancer cells, and are then injected back into the patient
Experimental vaccine has shown positive results in patients suffering from different types of cancer.
In one woman who received the vaccine, ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months. The vaccine teaches immune cells to know dangerous cancer cells.
The method involves removing immune cells from the patient and changing them in a laboratory so that they can “see” a protein called HER2 that is found in many types of cancer, and then the cells are injected back into the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. Cancer Institute in Bethesday, Maryland, said: “Our findings indicate that the vaccine is very effective. ”
HER2 “let various types of cancer stop growing, ” including breast, ovary, lung, and rectum cancer, says Professor Berzofsky.
A similar method in which immune cells are removed from patients and the “taught” to attack cancer cells has been shown to be effective in the treatment of one type of leukaemia.
Kanye West gave a long talk in support of Trump and wore a MAGA hat after appearing on the TV show SNL.
It didn't end well.
After a lengthy talk, Kanye West, a student in Saturday Night Live, commended President Donald Trump of the United States, said he would present himself to the president in 2020.
After rendezvous with the third song of the evening, Ghost Town, where he wore a Make America Great hood, he spoke against democrats for a long time and repeated his support to Trump.
“I’ve talked so often to white people who say, “How can you like Trump, he’s a racist? ”
If I were worried about racial hatred, I'd long have moved from the United States," he said.
SNL started the show with a pin, where Hollywood star Matt Damon made fun of Brett Kavanaugh’s testimony to the Senate Judicial Committee for the cause of Christine Blasey Ford’s sexual harassment.
Although the long - closed West was not sent out, the recording of it was put on a community press by the comedian Chris Rock.
I don't know if Rock wanted to make fun of West by publishing the tape.
West had also complained to the audience that he had received bad backstage receptions because of his hat choice.
“ I was bullied in the back.
They told me: “Don’t go up there with this hood. ”
They bullied me!
Then they say I'm in a deep hole," he said, according to the news from the Washington Examiner.
West continued: “Do you want to see the deep hole? ”
Try love."
According to Variety, his comments were made by a audience member at least twice, and the actors of SNL seemed shameful, and one in attendance said to the newspaper: “There was a silence in the studio. ”
West had been invited to replace the singer Ariana Grande, whose boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West surprised many with his stage performance when he sang the song I Love it, dressed like a bottle of Perrier.
West received support from Candace Turner, chairman of the conservative group TPUSA, who said on Twitter: “To one of the bravest souls, take a stand for the face of the mob. ”
But on Twitter Karen Hunter said that West was simply being “he himself and it’s wonderful. ”
“But I chose NOT to reward anyone (by buying his music or clothing or supporting his “list ”) who I feel supports and spreads ideology that is harmful to my society.
He's free.
That's us too," she added.
Before the show, the rapper on Twitter announced that he had changed his name and said that he was now “the formerly known as Kanye West. ”
He is not the first artist to change his name and feet in the footsteps of Diddy, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, has also called himself Snoop Lion, and it is not to be forgotten that Prince’s musical myth, which later turned his name into a symbol and called itself the artist who was formerly known as Prince.
Charge for attempted murder following a knife attack at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45 - year - old has been charged with attempted murder after being stabbed to a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Tuesday.

The defendant is expected to attend a trial in Belfast on Monday.
The DA will review the charges.
Kit Harington, the star of the Crown Games, criticizes toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow in the violent adventures of HBO, the Crown Games.
The 31 - year - old player, however, has criticized the standard of the male hero, saying that such a role on the screen means that young boys often feel that they need to be tough in order to gain respect.
In an interview with Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that he felt that “something went wrong” and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity during the #MeToo period.
Kit, who recently married his wife from the Crown Games, 31 - year - old Rose Leslie, admitted that he had “strong opinions ” on how to deal with this matter.
"Personally, I think at the moment - what has gone wrong with masculinity?"
“What have we taught men in their upbringing about the problems we see now? ”
Kit believes that television is partly responsible for an increase in toxic masculinity, due to a very male personality on television.
He continued: “What is innate, and what is taught?
What is taught on television and on the streets that makes young boys feel as if they must be made by a man?
I think it's one of the most important questions in our time -- how do we change this?
For it is clear that something has gone wrong with young men."
He also admitted during the interview that he would not play in any other Crown Games after the series was similar in the next summer and said that he had “plenty of battlefields and horses. ”
As of November, Kit will be playing in the reconstruction of True West, a picture by Sam Shepard, who tells the story of a filmmaker and his brother, a robber.
The actor recently said that the best thing about playing the Crown Games was to meet his wife, Rose.
“ I met my wife in these parts, ” he said, “so that they gave me almost my future family and my life after that. ”
Rose played Ygrite, Jon Snow's girlfriend, who Kit played in these Emmy Prizes.
The couple married in June 2018, on the land of Lesli’s family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new infections
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of people infected with HIV or AIDS.
Health authorities say that over 820,000 people are infected in the country.
Some 40,000 new infections were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new infections were transmitted through sex, which is a change from the past.
In the past, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China due to the donation of infected blood.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has fallen to almost zero, as Chinese healthcare professionals said at a conference in Yunnan Province.
However, the number of people infected with HIV or AIDS has increased by 100,000 from year to year.
Sexual HIV infection is a serious problem within the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality has not been illegal in China since 1997, but much discrimination against LGBT people is still said to exist.
Due to conservative values in the country, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who engage in sexual intercourse with other men eventually marry a woman.
Many infections result from inadequate contraception in these marriages.
Since 2003, the government of China has promised everyone access to HIV medicines as part of a plan to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that an employee has leaked data from the senators of the Republics, criticises "hazardous lies" and "conspiracy teachings"
On Saturday, Congresswoman Maxine Waters denied the accusation that one of her employees had published personal information on their Wikipedia pages by the three senators of the Republican Party.
The democrat from Los Angeles said that these claims came from “superrighteous ” extremists and Web sites.
"Lies, lies, and more horrible lies," said Waters in a statement on Twitter.
The information published contained the addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information was displayed on the Internet on Thursday from an unknown party at Capitol Hill during interrogations with the Board of Directors of Brett Kavanaugh, appointed Supreme Court Judge, for the charges of sexual harassment.
The lesson came sometime after the three senators had interrogated Kavanaugh.
Substantial pages such as Gateway Pundit and RedState said that the IP numbers identifying the source of the information were connected to the Waters office and published information on one of its employees, according to information from Capitol Hill.
"This unreasonable accusation is a totally wrong and pure lie," continued Waters.
“My employee - what personal information and security are now in jeopardy because of these false accusations - had no responsibility whatsoever for this information leak.
This unreasonable accusation is utterly false and pure lies."
Waters ’ statement was quickly criticized on the Internet, including by Ara Fleischer, former White House news agent.
"This denial is full of anger," wrote Fleischer.
“ It suggests that she does not have the courage to sit at a congress.
When someone is accused for no reason, do not react with anger.
It must not show opposition.
That is not to be asked for reasons of accusation.
There must be calmness and contemplation."
Fleischer seemed to compare the reaction of Waters with the criticism of a democrat against Judge Kavanaugh, who said critics seemed too angry at the trial on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, the provocative Republican against Waters in the mid - term reviews, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"A big deal if it's true," he shuddered.
In his declaration, Waters said that her office had informed “the appropriate authorities and law enforcement officials of these false claims.
“ We will ensure that the guilty will be found, ” she continued, “and that they will be held accountable for all the acts that are damaging and dangerous to all my employees. ”
A movie critic for Johnny English Strikes Again - spy joke with Rowan Atkinson turns out to be low-power
It has become common practice to look for the Brexit references in all new forms where Britain is involved, and this seems to be true in this revival of the Johnny English comedy series - which began in 2003 with the picture Johnny English and just woke up again in 2011 with the picture Johnny English Reborn.
Will this candid satira about how clearly we are a new export opportunity for the country?
Whether it is, or not, Johnny English’s debauched, greasy, and clumsy mind has been granted a second renewal of permission to mess up everything — his name shows above all that he is designed for a display in non - English - speaking lands.
Of course, he is the sage secret serviceman who pretends to have fascinating personal charms but is a bit mixed with Clouseau, dass by Mr. Bean and a little deleted by the man who played one note for the song Chariots of Fire at the opening festival of the Olympics in London in 2012.
It is also originally based on the traveler and the mysterious citizen of the world that Atkinsons once played in the forgotten Barclaycard TV ads, where he left everything in disarray.
That's one or two great things in this latest Johnny English movie.
I enjoyed watching Johnny English walk to a helicopter dressed in a medieval bear, and the choppers were wearing his helmet.
Atkinson clearly shows his ability to laugh, but the humor seems rather powerless and strangely superficial, especially now that “serious ” movies such as James Bond and Mission Impossible also offer hilarious jokes.
The joke seems to be more intended for children than for adults, and I found the fairy tale that Johnny English had not as imaginative and focused as the silent tricks of Atkinson in Mr. Bean’s procession.
Britain is now in serious trouble.
A computer hacker has been able to break into Britain’s secret spy network and reveal the identity of all British spies, to the detriment of the spy who is on duty - but unfortunately Kevin Eldon is in too small a role.
This is the final piece for the Prime Minister, who is arrogant and controversial about a person and who is already in a great deal of trouble because of enormous political adversities: Emma Thompson is doing his best with his role as a person to remind of Theresa May, but the manuscript is not about many fishes for her.
Her counselors tell her that all active spies are in danger and that she must find someone who had already sat down on a sacred stone.
And here comes Johnny English himself, now the headmaster of some fine school, but also a secret lesson in how to be a spy: here are some funny jokes when English offers a spy school reminiscent of the movie School of Rock.
Called back to Whitehall at an emergency meeting, he meets Bough, his former longtime partner, who plays Ben Miller again.
Bough is now a married man, his wife is a submarine manager, but in that energetic role Vicki Pepperdine does not quite let his light shine.
The spy diocese that blows up everything in Her Majesty’s service is now back in the gear and meets the high - risk woman Ophelia Bulletova, played by Olgu Kurylenko.
At the same time, the Prime Minister is thrilled by the magic of the fascinating billionaire in the field of technology, who claims to be able to solve Britain’s computer problems: the evil Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their fall-out journey: they set off in a fine French restaurant disguised as servants, they make trouble as they smuggle into Volta’s luxury nest, and English turns everything upside down when he tries to use virtual spectacles to explore the interior of Volta’s house.
There is nothing to be saved in that final point, but although the image is powerful and energetic, some of the child matter in it as a whole negates.
Medium - quality material.
And just as with the other Johnny English pictures, I couldn't help but think: can a British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really suits his abilities?
The working class denies that it is preparing a four - day workweek plan for the United Kingdom, with the same salary as five days ago.
The working class, led by Jeremy Corbyn, is now considering a radical plan that would allow the British to work for four days a week, but get paid for five.
According to the group, the company’s executives want to make use of the savings generated by the revolution in artificial intelligence, and give employees the benefit of one extra day off.
In this way, employees could enjoy three days of long weekends without reducing their salary.
Sources say that the idea would "match" with the Group's economic plan and its policy of improving the workers' interests.
The Trade Union Congress has supported the reduction of the working week for four days, which has led workers to make use of economic change.
A member of the Upper Division of the Workers ’ Party said to the Sunday Times: “It is estimated that a policy review will be announced by the end of the year.
"The change will not take place in one night, but four days of working week is a goal that fits the approach of the class to change the economy for the benefit of workers and the overall industrial policy of the class."
The working class would not be the first to support this idea, but the Green Party promised a four - day working week in its 2017 election campaign.
However, the objective is not supported by the Workers ’ Group as a whole.
The Workers ’ Party spokesman said: “Four days of working weeks are not on the agenda of the class and the class is not considering introducing it. ”
John McDonnell, Business Minister of the Ministry of Shadows, used the Workers ’ Party conference last week to describe his ideas about social revolution within the economy.
Mr McDonnell said that he was determined to regain control of 'unknown managers' and 'gathering' companies.
The shadow minister’s plans also mean that current shareholders in hydroelectric companies may not get all of their share back, since the government of the Workers’ Party could resort to “exodus” because of alleged iniquities.
He has also confirmed plans to put employees on the management committees of enterprises and to create a common equity fund to leave 10 percent of the property of private companies to their employees, who could receive 500 pounds of money from them annually in their pocket.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy say "60 minutes" whether an FBI study at Kavanaugh could get them to change their mind.
An investigation by the FBI into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has caused at least a week’s delay in the final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court, raising the question of whether her findings could get the senators of the Republic to withdraw their support.
During a Sunday interview, Scott Pelley, a reporter on the 60 - minute series of the Republicans and Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham, asked if the FBI could reveal something that would change their mind.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
“ I said when the trial started, I said that I was talking to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the accusations were made and asked: “Did you do this? ”
He was determined, steadfast, unmistakable."
But Graham's votes seem unchangeable.
“ I’ve made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh, ” he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but this I know: Brett firmly refused," added Graham and addressed Christine Blasey Ford.
“ And everyone she mentions by name couldn’t confirm it.
This case is 36 years old.
I can't see anything new is going to change."
What is the International Civil Festival, and has it done something to reduce poverty?
The Global Citizen Festival will be held on Saturday in New York City, an annual music event in which a series of stars will appear and with a similar impact; poverty worldwide.
This is the seventh year of the International Civil Festival, and tens of thousands of people will be transferred to Central Park, not only to listen to music items such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes, but also to draw attention to the real purpose of the festival to end the severe poverty by 2030.
The International Civilian Festival, which was first held in 2012, is part of the Global Poverty Project, which is an international struggle organization that wants to end poverty by increasing the number of those who are fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (except for those who want to pay for VIP tickets), musicians had to complete various tasks, or “actions”, such as volunteering, e-mailing to one of the world’s leaders, telephone calls, or use other valid means to help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has the festival been for 12 years?
Is the idea of rewarding people with free music really a way to convince people to call for action, or is it just one so - called “click ” operation, where people feel they are doing something that matters by signing an online requirement list or sending a message on Twitter?
Global Citizen says that since 2011, it has recorded more than 19 million ‘actions’ from its supporters, to name a number of different goals.
It says that these actions have helped to get the world’s leaders to declare commitments and policies equivalent to over $35 billion that will affect the lives of over 2.25 billion people by 2030.
Early in 2018, the group listed 390 commitments and announcements for its actions, of which at least $10 billion has been invested or collected.
The group estimates that so far the amount of money raised has directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
One of the key commitments comes from The Power of Nutrition, a company of investors and executives in Britain who are working to “help children enjoy themselves to the full,” promising to give $35 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country, after receiving 4,700 messages on Twitter from Global Citizens.
“With the support of Britain’s government, sponsors, governments around the world and international citizens like you, we can leave the social injustice that malnutrition is a thing of the past,” said Tracey Ullmann, representative of The Power of Nutrition at London’s concerts in April 2018.
The group also said that after 5,000 appeals were sent that Britain should improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced the financing of a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children and provide them with better nutrition.
A list of common questions on the group’s website raises one question: “Why do you think you can put an end to extreme poverty? ”
Global citizens replied: “There will be a long and difficult task - sometimes we will fail all the time.
However, we will reach our goal, as will movements that fought for the rights of citizens and the abduction of racial separation before us, for we are stronger together.
This year's events include Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, and Janelle Monae.
The United States could use the Navy as a "block" to prevent Russia’s energy exports, says the Minister for the Interior
"If necessary," Washington could use the Navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching the market, including in the Middle East, says Ryan Zinke, U.S. Secretary of State, as reported by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s assistance to Syria, especially where the country is working at the request of the legitimate government there, was a pretext for exploring new markets.
"I believe that the reason for their existence in the Middle East is that they want to do business with energy, as in Eastern Europe and its southern parts," he said, according to sources.
And, according to the official report, there are ways and means to resist it.
"The United States can use the Navy to ensure that sea routes are open and, if necessary, to create a barrier to ensure that their energy is not released," he said.
Zinke addressed a guest meeting at the Consumer Energy Alliance, a charity group called “the voice of energy consumption ” in the United States.
He continued, bringing Washington closer together to face Russia and Iran, and he said that she was more or less the same.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is more and less the use of energy and replacing it with others," he said, saying, "and he said that Russia has only one economic card that depends on fossil fuel.
These declarations are followed by Trump’s management wanting to increase its exports of natural gas to Europe and replace Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
In order to do this, public officials in Trump's management, including President Donald Trump himself, have tried to get Germany to withdraw from the 'inappropriate' Nord Stream 2 project to set up a new power line, which Trump says would make Berlin a 'capture' of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly argued that the 11 billion dollars of Nord Stream 2 power line, which will double the current transport capacity up to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Russians say that Washington’s strong opposition to the project is simply driven ahead for economic reasons and that it is an example of unfair competition.
“I think we share the view that energy should not be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose the supply,” said Alexander Novak, Russian Energy Minister after a meeting with Rick Perry, US Energy Minister, in Moscow in September.
The United States has been critical of Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industrial organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the United States not to interfere with the EU’s energy policy and bilateral agreement between Berlin and Moscow.
"I am very dissatisfied with the fact that the outside world was divided by our energy division," said Dieter Kempf, president of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a recent meeting with Angela Merkel, Chancellor of Germany, and Vladimir Putin, president of Russia.
Elizabeth Warren will "consider seriously" to present himself to the Presidential Office in 2020, she says.
Elizabeth Warren, Senator Massachusetts, said on Saturday that she would be “serious ” to present herself to the president after the mid - term reviews.
Warren confirmed that she would consider taking part in a civilian meeting at Holyoke, Massachusetts.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our government, and then also needs a woman as a leader," she said, according to a report from The Hill.
“After November 6, I will consider seriously presenting myself to the office of President. ”
Speaking of President Donald Trump at the meeting, Warren said that he “was taking the country in the wrong direction.
“ I’m very worried about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy, ” she said.
Warren has been oblivious to his criticism of Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, his appointed Supreme Judge.
On Friday, on Twitter, Warren said that “of course, we must have the FBI investigate before the vote is made. ”
However, a survey published on Thursday shows that the majority of voters in Warren’s state do not believe that it should be presented in 2020.
Fifty - eight percent of “more likely” voters in Massachusetts said that the Senator should not be offered, according to a poll published by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty - two percent said they supported her offer.
The survey showed greater support for the presentation of former governor Deval Patrick, who claimed 38 percent to support his potential supply and 48 percent to oppose it.
Among other popular democrats who were discussed for possible presidential representation in 2020 were former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders from Vermont.
Biden said he was going to make a public decision in January, according to an Associated Press report.
Sarah Palin talks about shock stress disorder Track Palin at an election meeting at Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26 years old, was in Iraq for one year after joining the army in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night
"My son is going through a lot of trouble after coming back, I feel like other families who are affected by stress and the spiritual wounds our soldiers return with," she said to the audience at an election meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest “the elephant in the room ” and said that her son and other warriors“ came back a little differently, they are harsh and wonder if there is any respect for what their comrades in the army and the Air Force and other divisions of the army have done for the country. ”
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, for trying to prevent domestic violence and for the use of alcohol - induced weapons, according to Dan Bennett, spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and Washington D.C. support challenge against new asylum seekers
Eighteen states and Washington City support a legal challenge against a new policy of the United States that denies victims fleeing gang or domestic violence for refuge.
According to a report from NBC News, representatives of the 18 states and the city filed a trial report on Friday in Washington to support a protesting asylum seeker.
The full name of the defendant in Grace v. Sessions' lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy has not been given.
She said that her mate “and his violent sons who were members of the gang, ” used violence, but her application for asylum was rejected by American government officials on July 20.
She was put in custody in Texas.
The prosecutors who support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala as countries where problems related to gangs and domestic violence are increasing, with the number of asylum seekers in the United States coming from these countries.
In 2014, the new asylum seeker revokes a ruling issued by the Immigration Appeals Committee to allow unregistered immigrants fleeing domestic violence to seek refuge.
Karl Racine, D.C., declared on Friday that the new policy “needed more decades of federal and international law. ”
"The law requires a decision on all asylum applications based on the facts and circumstances of the application, and this policy violates this rule," said the Court of Justice report.
In addition, the U.S. Lawyers stated that the policy that denied immigrants entry would be harmful to the economy of the United States, claiming that immigrants were more likely to set up businesses and “provide important work force. ”
Jeff Sessions, State Attorney, ordered immigrants to stop sheltering victims who fled domestic violence and gang violence in June.
“Those who leave their homeland for persecution based on race, religion, nationality, or membership of a particular community or political opinion can apply for refuge, ” said Sessions in his announcement of June 11.
Secretaries were never meant to solve all the problems, not even all the serious problems that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue operations in the race to find survivors in Palu, who double the number of the dead
Conditions are becoming increasingly difficult for survivors.
“ There’s a lot of tension in the air,” said 35 - year - old Risa Kusuma, who comforted her sick son at the relief center in Palu City.
“A car comes here with a body all the time.
There's little clean water."
People were seen returning to their ruined homes and looking for their watery possessions to save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals are overcrowded and damaged by the earthquake, which measured 7.5 points on the Richter scale.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who broke back and shoulders, were outside the Palu military hospital, where patients were treated outside due to continued vigorous aftershocks.
Tears filled his eyes as he told him how he found the earthquake shaking his hotel room on the fifth floor, where he was with his wife and daughter.
“ There was no time to save ourselves.
I pressed up to the wallbusters, I think," said Haris to the Associated Press and said that his family had been in town to go to the wedding.
“ I heard my wife call for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. ambassadors accuse China of "perssecution" with "provocative advertising"
A week after a four - page newspaper in China published a four - page advertisement in an American newspaper to discuss the mutual advantages of business between the two countries, U.S. ambassadors in China accused Beijing of using the U.S. media to spread propaganda.
Last Wednesday, Donald Trump, president of the United States, spoke about the Chinese newspaper’s advertising in the Des Moines Register, which is the most sold newspaper in Iowa, after accusing China of trying to interfere in the U.S. congressional elections that will be held on November 6, China denies this charge.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing wanted to interfere in the U.S. Congress marked what official U.S. agents said Reuter’s newsroom was a new stage in a growing campaign from Washington to exert pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to publish advertisements to promote business, Beijing and Washington are engaged in ongoing business war, with new customs duties on both countries’ import goods.
Chinese and American experts say that early in the business war, China’s retaliation fees were designed to harm exporters in such states as Iowa, who supported Trump’s Republican group.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa for a long time, who is exporting a lot of agricultural goods to China, said that Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers, and businesses.
Branstad stated in his report in the Sunday newspaper Des Moines Register that “China is now increasing its persecution by publishing propaganda ads in our own free media. ”
“ By spreading their propaganda, the government of China is taking advantage of the United States’s beloved freedom of speech and our free media by publishing a free advertisement in the Des Moines Register, ” said Branstad in his article.
"On the other hand, few protestors can be found in newspaper sales booths on the streets of Beijing, and no true reflection can be found of the different views that the Chinese might have on the worrying economic policy of China, where the media are trapped under the heels of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that “one of the largest newspapers in China escaped the offer to publish ” his article, but he did not specify which magazine it was.
Experts warn that the Republicans are making female voters dismiss them for the mid-term reviews on the Kavanaugh case.
Experts have warned of negative reactions, especially from women, in the next mid - term reviews, because many Republicans have supported and defended Brett Kavanaugh, a designated Supreme Court judge who has filed charges of sexual harassment.
There have been very strong feelings about this, and most Republicans have already publicly demonstrated that they wanted to start voting.
"It is impossible to back these things," said Grant Reehr, professor of political science at Maxwell School, Syracuse University, at The Hill for a Saturday article.
Reeher said he doubted that in the last minute of an investigation by the FBI, Senator Jeff Flake, the Senator of the Republic of Arizona, would be sufficient to calm angry voters.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday, they will not forget it tomorrow and not in November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, chief executive and spokesman for the liberal group MoveOn, on Friday, according to Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, Protestants sang “November Approaches! ” when they protested on the steps of the Senate when the Republicans who chaired the Committee decided to continue with Kavanaugh’s appointment, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, according to Mic.
"The enthusiasm and enthusiasm of the electorate will rise above all else," said Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst, at the news section.
“ People will say that the interest has already been great, and it is true.
But he might be greater, especially for female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18-29 years old, who dislike the President, but rarely choose."
The reporters predicted a setback if the Republicans urged Kavanaugh to be confirmed, even before Ford’s testimony, in which she described her charges of sexual harassment.
"This has become a big mess for the Republican Party," said Michael Still, a former member of the Republican Party National Committee, early last week, according to NBC News.
"The case is not just about the votes of the committee or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh is allowed to sit on the bench, it is also about how the Republicans have handled this and how they have dealt with it," said Guy Cecil, president of the United States of America, a group helping to elect Democrats, at the news station.
On the other hand, Americans seem to disagree with who should believe after both Ford and Kavanaugh’s testimony, and a small majority support the latter.
A new poll from YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents probably believed the Ford testimony, while 35 percent said that they believed, or likely, the Kavanaugh testimony.
In addition, 38 percent of respondents said that they thought Kavanaugh likely or certainly lied in his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After the Flake call, the FBI is now investigating the accusations Ford has made and from at least one other woman, Deborah Ramirez, reportedly from the Guardian.
Ford witnessed the oath before the Senate Committee last week, saying that Kavanaugh had attacked her when she was 17 years old and that he had been under the influence of alcohol.

The man who invented the Internet has plans to start a new Internet to fight Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the man who invented the Internet, is going to set up a spitting company to fight Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technical legend, Inrupt, is a company based on Solid, open-ended project of Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people are allowed to access which information.
In a private interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee laughed that the intention behind Inrupt was "world domination."
"We have to do this now," he said about the spray company.
"This is a historic moment."
The program uses Solid technology to enable people to create their own "personal data store on the Internet" or POD.
There is a list of contacts, tasks, calendars, music collections, and other personal and work - related devices.
It looks like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in one browser and all simultaneously.
The unique feature of the personal data store is that it is entirely up to the user who can access what information.
The company calls it "personal choice by using data".
According to John Bruce, CEO of the company, the idea is that Inrupt provides the company with resources, processes and appropriate skills to help make Solid accessible to all.
The company now consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a safety workshop purchased by IBM, a number of developers hired as contractors to work in the project, and a team of developers in volunteering.
As of this week, technology developers around the world could make their own independent programs with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team should not discuss with “Facebook and Google whether or not to initiate a complete change that would put their current business model on their heads in one night.
"We will not ask them permission."
Berners-Lee wrote in an article published on Saturday at Medium that Inrupt had “a goal to create energy in business and ecosystems that helps protect the honesty and quality of the new website based on Solid.”
Berners-Lee revolving the Internet in 1994 when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on the neutrality of the network.
Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and president of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation of the Open Data Institute, even while he is getting Inrupt established.
"I am full of optimism for the next period of the network," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Reverend of World War I Victory Cross Honored
The only English priest to be honored with the Victorian Cross during World War I that a soldier has been hailed in his hometown 100 years later.
On September 29, 1918, Father Bernard Vann, who served as the military colonel, received the cross in the attack on Bellenglishe and Lehaucourt.
On the other hand, a sniper killed him four days later, and he never learned that he had received the highest honor of the British army.
Two of his grandfathers revealed monuments about him in a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandfather’s sons, Michael Vann, said that it was “wonderfully symbolic ” that the monument was exposed exactly 100 years after his grandfather’s feat of honor.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Vann led his sub-committee army over the Canal de Saint-Quentin Canal “through a very thick fog and under a heavy gun attack from guns and machine guns. ”
Later, he ran to the firing line, and with “great courage, ” he led the line forward before attacking a single-armed cannon and overpowering three soldiers.
On October 4, 1918, just a month before the end of the war, a colonel was killed by a German sniper.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather’s heroic actions were “something I could never do, but something that humbles you. ”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also placed a flowering crane after the parade, which was led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he felt “a great honor to participate in the parade ” and added that“ the death of a true hero is demonstrated by the support shown by so many. ”
MMA fans woke up all night to watch Bellator 206 instead of seeing Gurra pig
Just imagine, having woken up all night to see an overcrowded Bellator 206, just to be denied access to the main event.
The program featured 13 battles from San Jose, six of them on the main program, and they were shown live all night in Britain on Channel 5.
At 6 o’clock in the morning, just when Gegard Mousasi and Rory McDonald were preparing to fight, British spectators got a surprise when the broadcast turned into a Gurra pig.
Some were not happy to watch the battle all night.
One Twitter fan described the changes to the subject of children as “any kind of sick joke. ”
"According to official regulations, the material was not suitable for audiences at six o'clock in the morning, so they had to switch to child care," said Dave Schwartz, vice president of marketing and communication for Bellator, when he was asked to the broadcast.
"Poor pig, yes."
Scott Coker, president of Bellator, said that they would review their schedules and take the audience in Britain into account in the future.
“I think when I think about the show, we could probably solve it,” said Coker.
“ But it is six o’clock in the morning on Sunday, and we cannot resolve it until Sunday at our time, which is their Monday.
But we're working on this.
Believe me, when the transmission was changed, many text messages were sent back and forth, and not all of them were friendly.
We were trying to fix this, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was an official problem.
I can promise this won't happen next time.
We limit the night to five fights instead of six, as usual, but we tried too much and outdone ourselves.
This is an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt “impaired” because of sexual orientation
Olympic diver Tom Daley claims to have felt a lack of power toward other people in his upbringing because of his sexual orientation, but he was encouraged to succeed.
Daley, 24 years old, said that he did not realize that “he was different ” until he went to high school. ”
On the radio show Desert Island Discs on the Radio 4 channel, with Lauren Laverne, Daley said that he was talking about homosexual rights to give others “a hope. ”
He also said that his parental role had diminished his interest in winning the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the usual director, has taken several months off because of illness.
Daley was singled out for the first part of Laverne and said that he felt that he was a “smaller man ” than anyone else when he was a child because“ it was not agreed in society to like both boys and girls. ”
He said: “Until today these feelings of feeling inferior and different have given me the strength and strength to succeed. ”
He wanted to prove that he was “something, ” he said, so that he would not disappoint anyone when his sexual orientation finally became manifest.
Two times the Olympic Bronzeman has been a supporter of the LGBT, using his participation in the Commonwealth Games in Australia to call on more nations to legalize homosexuality.
He said he would let himself be heard because he felt lucky to be able to live publicly without punishment and wanted to give “a hope ” to others.
The world champion three times said that he had been “surprisingly ” to fall in love with the man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he first met in 2013.
Daley married the 20 - year - old Oscar winner last year but said that the age difference had never been a problem.
"When a man goes through so much at an early age" - but he took part in his first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said that it was difficult to find peers who had experienced similar success and difficulties.
The couple adopted a child in June, a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that his "all aspects of life" had been squandered.
"If you asked me last year, it was all about winning a gold prize," he said.
“You know what, there are more important things than a gold prize at the Olympics.
Robbie is my Olympic gold prize."
His son was baptized in the head of his father, Robert, who died in 2011, aged forty, after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father had not accepted that he would die, and one of the last things he had asked was whether they had received their tickets for London in 2012 -- because he wanted to sit in the front row.
“ I couldn’t tell him that he wouldn’t live long enough to sit in the front row, ” he said.
“ I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and it wasn’t until his breath stopped and he was made to admit that he was not invincible, ” he said.
Next year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze prize.
“I just knew that I had dreamed about this all my life, immersing myself in front of the audience at home at the Olympics.
It was also inspired by the choice of the first song -- Proud by Heather Small -- who had inspired him to the Olympics and still gave him goose bumps.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11.15 a.m.
Mickelson in bad shape and let sit on the class in the Ryder Cup on Saturday
U.S. Phil Mikkelson will score on Sunday when he plays his 47th game in the Ryder Cup, but he needs to find his old beats again so that the score is not surrounded by bad memories.
Mickelson, who plays the 12th time in the championship, was put on the bench after the decision of chairman Jim Furyk for the four - ball games and four - game matches on Saturday.
Instead of being the center of the action, as it has been so often before for the United States, the five - time master’s day is divided between being a cheerleader and rehearsing the plays on the field in the hope of correcting what is wrong with him.
Mickelson, 48 years old, was never the one who shot directly with the dredging, and is not the best player for the Le Golf National Golf Court, where long bells often punish for bad shots.
And not only is the golf course a big challenge in itself, but Mickelson has to compete against Frances Molinari, British Open winner, in the ninth game on Sunday. Molinari is with the rookie Tommy Fleetwood and together they have won all four of their games this week.
If the four - point Americans take the first of the 12 singles, the game of Mikkelson could make a big difference.
Furik declared confidence in his husband, but he could hardly say much else.
“ He completely understood the role he had today, clapped my back and embraced me and said he would be ready tomorrow, ” said Furyk.
“He has a lot of confidence.
He is in the palace of fame, and he has been so much improved before and this week.
I guess I didn't expect him to play two games.
I saw more, but that's how it ended, and we thought we had to go this way.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else."
Mikkelson will score Nick Faldo in the number of games played in the Ryder Cup on Sunday.
This could mark the end of the process in the Ryder Cup that has never achieved quite as much as other achievements on his record.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 losses, and 7 equals, but Furyk said that his presence had a negative effect on the team.
"He's funny, he's ironic, he's hilarious, he likes to make fun of people and it's great to have him in the team room," he explained.
“ I think the younger players enjoyed teasing him this week too, and it was fun to see.
He's giving so much more than just the golf game."
Thomas Bjorn, President of Europe knows that a lot of headway can disappear quickly.
From experience, European leader Thomas Bjorn knows that a good start to the last day of the individual competition in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an unpleasant experience.
The Dane first played in Valderrama in 1997, with five-point advantage over the Americans under the chairmanship of Seve Ballesteros, but achieved the right to win at the end with the lowest possible score difference, with a win of 141⁄2-131⁄2.
“You keep reminding yourself that we had a lot of head start in Valderrama, we had a lot of head start in Brookline, where we lost and in Valderrama, where we worked, but just then,” said Bjorn, who is shown here, after watching the 2018 vintage win 5-3 both Friday and Saturday and get the 10-6 lead on the Le Golf National Field.
History will show me and everyone in the team that this isn't over.
We'll all work out tomorrow.
Let's go do everything right.
This is not finished until all the levels are on the table.
We have our goal, and it's trying to win this cup, we focus on it.
I've always said this, I focus on the 12 players on our team, but we're very aware of our opponents on the other team -- the best golfer in the world."
Bjorn was most pleased with how his players had coped with difficult situations and added: “I never get over myself in this.
Tomorrow's gonna be all different.
Tomorrow, the most important thing is the performance of the individuals, and that is another thing.
It's great to play with a partner when everything goes well, but when you play one, everyone's ability as a golfer is tested.
It's the message that has to be sent to the players, to get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind and he also has to play his own best game."
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent, Jim Furyk, will seek to make his players do better in individuals than in associates, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three points out of four.
Fury has personally experienced both sides of this great change on the last day, but he was victorious with his team in Brookline but ended up losing when Europe carried out “the miracle in Medinah. ”
"I remember every goddamn word," he asked, "how Ben Crenshaw, who was born in 1999, had continued to encourage his players last day.
“We need to play 12 important games tomorrow, but you want to start fast, as happened in Brookline and Medinah.
As the process progresses, it exerts great pressure on the games in the center.
We arranged our players according to that and let them play like we think it's going to be the best tomorrow."
Thomas has been given the task of trying to lead the defenses and playing against Rory McIlroy in the first game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Paulter as the other European players in the first half of the games.
"I chose these players in this sequence because I think they're going to cover all the way through," said Bjorn about their choice of players in the individual race.
Germany’s New Warship Re-Postponed
The latest German Navy warships should have been built in 2014 to replace old warships from the Cold War period, but it will not be ready until next year, first of all, due to broken systems and rising costs, as reported in the area.
The building of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the lead ship of the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg class, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the sources of the military spokesman who spoke to the Die Zeit newspaper.
The ship should have been taken into account by the Navy in 2014, but serious problems after the delivery of the project.
The four ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ordered by the Navy in 2007 are to replace the Bremen-Class military ships, which have been assigned for years.
They're supposed to be equipped with a powerful cannon, a lot of anti-aircraft and anti-shipping missiles and hidden devices like reduced radar infrared, and sound signals.
Other important features are longer usage times - the latest ships should be available for up to two years away from their home ports.
However, constant delays mean that these new - type ships - which are said to enable Germany to show its strength at sea - will be outdated when they are finally taken for advantage, says Die Zeit.
The F125 arrived at the news last year when the German army publicly refused to accept the litter and returned it to the Blohm & Voss release in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy has returned a ship to the manufacturer after delivery.
Although the reasons behind the divorce were not known, many German media spoke of serious “malfunctions in software and machinery ” that would make the warship useless if it were sent to war.
The faults in software were particularly important as a Baden-Wuerttemberg ship will be controlled by 120 crew members, which is half the size of a Bremen-class military ship.
It was also found that the ship was far too heavy, which reduces its performance and limits the ability of the Navy to make adjustments to it in the future.
The 7000 tonnes of 'Rheinland-Pfalz' ship is estimated to be twice the weight of a ship similar to that used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to the faults of mechanical equipment, the cost of the entire project - including the training of the crew - has begun to cause problems.
It is said that it has reached EUR 3.1 billion ($3.6 billion), but was originally to be EUR 2.2 billion.
Problems affecting the most recent ships are particularly important in view of the warning that the Germans ’ advantage in the open is diminishing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, acknowledged that the Navy was in fact becoming "suffocated with a working ship."
The agent said that the problem had developed over time, for older ships were taken out of service, but no ships replaced them.
He regretted that none of the orders of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could be used by the Navy.
The National Trust Conservation Agency is spying on the secret life of bats
A new study conducted in the highlands of Scotland aims to find out how bats use the landscape when fishing for food.
It is hoped that the results will shed new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation measures.
The study conducted by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland Society will monitor different species of bats in the Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording devices will be installed in key locations around the area to monitor the conduct of the leather blades over the period.
NHS and volunteers will also undertake monitoring missions with handheld sensors.
Experts will sound all the recordings to find out the frequency and types of callers the bats give off.
Maps of residential areas and reports will then be published to provide a precise picture of their geographic behaviour.
Rob Dewar, NTS’s Natururveillant Counsellor, hopes that the results will reveal which habitat is most important to the bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the cost of managing residential areas, e.g. by creating meadows and how best to maintain forests for bats and other related species.
Bats have decreased considerably in the last century in Scotland and throughout Britain.
They are at risk from building and development projects that affect their nests and reduce their habitat.
Windmills and light can also pose risks, including fly paper and certain chemical treatments on building materials, as well as domestic tax attacks.
Bats are not really blind.
On the other hand, their ears are much more useful than their eyes are when it comes to catching prey because they are used to fishing at night.
They used sophisticated echo - imaging technology to locate insects and objects that are on their way of flight.
NTS, responsible for maintaining over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens, and 76,000 acres [76,000 ha] of land, takes bats very seriously.
Ten experts in the organization perform regular examinations, scaffolding, and sometimes rescue operations.
The organization has even established Scotland’s first and only bat land at the Threeave farm in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight out of ten bat species of Scotland live.
David Thompson, the caretaker of the farm, says he is a perfect area for them.
"The area here at Threeave is great for bats," he said.
“We have old buildings, plenty of grown trees, and lots of good living areas.
But there are still many unknown things about bats, so the work we do here and in other places will help us to understand better what they need to do."
He stressed the importance of checking for bats prior to the maintenance of housing, since possible accidental destruction of one nest may kill up to 400 female bats and young and completely destroy all bats in the area.
Bats are protected, and they are forbidden to kill, harass, or disturb, or destroy their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish representative of the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to help.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about bats, and we don’t know how well many of them are doing. ”
Ronaldo denies the charges of rape when lawyers prepare legal proceedings against a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has accused him of raping 'false news' and says that people want to 'pay attention to themselves' by using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue the German newspaper Der Spiegel, who published the charges.
The leader of Portugal and Juventus has been accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is said to have paid her $375.000 after the incident, as reported by Der Spiegel on Friday.
A few hours after the charges were made, 30 - year - old Ronaldo, in a Instagram Live video with 142 million of his followers, said that they were “falsified news. ”
“No, no, no, no, no.
What was said today is false news," said the world champion five times to the camera.
“ These people want to draw attention to themselves by using my name.
That's normal.
It wants to be famous by using my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," added the player to smiling.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for the accusations they have called “an unacceptable publication of private suspicions, ” according to Reuter’s newsroom.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that Ronaldo would demand compensation for “a lesion of the same amount as the severity of the breach, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years. ”
The alleged incident was said to have occurred in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and the casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at the nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga went back to the player's room, where he was supposed to have raped her in the rectum, according to documents filed before the Clark County of Nevada.
Mayorga says that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the incident and told her that he was a “99 percent good man ” who fell into temptation because of the“ 1 percent. ”
The papers claim that Ronaldo agreed that the couple had sex but that they both agreed.
Mayorga claims that she went to the police and had her injuries taken in a hospital, but finally she agreed to go outside the court because she was “afraid of revenge ” and worried about becoming“ depressed publicly. ”
She now says she wants to cancel the sweets because she is still in shock after an incident.
Ronaldo was close to going to Real Madrid from Manchester United when the rape was due, and this summer he went over to Italian giant Juve with a 100 million Euro contract.
Brexit: Britain would “repent forever” losing car manufacturers
Britain would “repent forever ” if it lost its position as an international leader among the vehicle manufacturers of Brexit, says Greg Clark, Minister of Business.
He added that it was "anxiety" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a contract, the company would temporarily cease manufacturing at its plant in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the effect of delay on the border would be if Brexit without a contract that reality would cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which manufactures Toyota Auris and Avensis cars, produced almost 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to other European countries.
"I believe that if Britain falls out of the EU by the end of March, we will see manufacturing plants in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Managing Director of Toyota, Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers have expressed concern about the exit from the EU without agreement on how to engage in cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW says, for example, will shut down his factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concern is that what car manufacturers say is a captive chain risk if Brexit without a contract becomes a reality.
The Toyota production line is based on a ‘last minute’ reception, where parts are delivered every 37 minutes from supplies in both the UK and the EU for cars produced after ordering.
If Britain withdraws from the EU without a contract on 29 March, the border with the industry could be disrupted by a lack of assets.
It would be impossible for Toyota to store more than a day's work in its Derbyshire factory, said the company, and therefore production would cease.
Mr Clark said that the Chequers programme Theresa May for a future relationship with the EU "was specifically aimed at preventing these views at the border".
"We must have a contract. We want to have the best deal that allows us to enjoy not only success in today's world, but as an opportunity that we can take advantage of," he said on a radio show on BBC Radio 4.
“The evidence, not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers, shows that we must be able to continue with very effective approaches.
Toyota could not predict how long their production would be stopped, but it indicated that for a longer period of time, increased costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and who is a union confidant at the factory, said that his colleagues are increasingly concerned: “My experience is that when these jobs go away, they never come back.
The government spokesperson said: “We have presented an accurate and comprehensive plan for our future relationship with the EU. ”
Found between Trump and Rosenstein might be delayed again, according to the White House.
The White House announced on Sunday that an important meeting between Donald Trump and Rod Rosenstein, the Assistant State Attorney, could be “postponed again for one week” now, the dispute over Brett Kavanaugh, appointed Supreme Court Judge, continues.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Robert Mueller, a special prosecutor, who investigates Russian influence in elections, links between Trump’s assistants and Russia, and possible obstacles to the progress of justice by the President.
For many weeks, stories have been going on in Washington as to whether Trump is going to fire an assistant prosecutor, thus jeopardizing Mueller’s independence.
Earlier this month, the New York Times said that Rosenstein had discussed carrying tape recorders to engage in dialogue with Trump and the possibility of rolling the president out of office using the 25th additional section of the Constitution.
Rosenstein denied these claims.
Last Monday, however, he visited the White House, among news that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced on Thursday, when he was with the United Nations in New York.
Trump said that he would not like to run Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed so that he would not be at the same time as the hearing of the Senate Judicial Committee, where Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who has charged him with sexual harassment, witnessed both.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week - long investigation by the FBI into the charges against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the election of the Senate.
Sarah Sander, Trump’s media representative, was on the Fox News Sunday program.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “It may not have been a date for him, it may be this week, and I think he may be postponed for another week because of everything else going on at the Supreme Court.
But we see, and I'm always happy to inform the media."
Some reporters disagree with this statement: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since September 10.
The stage manager Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that a small number of meetings were not due to dissatisfaction with the fact that TV reporters had “visibility, ” but she said:“ I don’t agree with the fact that they have a vision. ”
She then gave evidence that a direct relationship between Trump and the media would increase.
'The President answers more questions to the media than any other president has ever done before,' she said, without referring to the sources: 'We have reviewed these figures.'
“ If the media have a chance to ask the President of the United States directly, ” Sanders said, “it’s much better than talking to me.
We're trying to do a lot of it, and you've seen us do a lot of it over the past few weeks, and it's going to replace media meetings when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or media meetings with other leaders who visit him.
Media meetings with him alone are rare.
The president may have shown why in New York this week, when he was showing off an unbridled and strange behavior in front of a group of reporters.
The Health Minister writes to EU healthcare professionals in Scotland because of Brexit concerns
The Health Minister has written to staff from the EU working within the health system in Scotland (NHS Scotland) to express their gratitude and wish that they will continue to work after Brexit has passed through.
Jeane Freeman sent letters within six months until Britain leaves the EU.
The Scottish Government has already promised to meet the costs of EU citizens working in the public service sector.
In her letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: “Over the summer, talks between Britain and the EU have continued for reasons of history and are expected to be made in the fall.
The British government has also been preparing if possible not under contract.
I know this must be a lot of uncertainty for all of you.
That is why I would like to reiterate my appreciation for the work of all the staff, regardless of their nationality.
EU and other partners provide valuable experience and expertise that strengthens and improves the health services and benefits for the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is indeed your home and we want you to stay here very much."
Christion Abercrombie had an emergency surgery after having had a head injury
Christion Abercrombie, a lineman for the Tennessee State Tigers, had to undergo an emergency surgery after having had a head injury in a 31-27 losing game against the team Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, according to a report from Mike Organ, Tennessee's journalist.
Rod Reed, chief coach of Tennessee State, told reporters that the injury had just occurred.
"He came to the sideline and fell down there," said Reed.
Trainers and nurses gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before he was placed on a stretcher and drilled for further inspection.
A Tennessee State representative told Chris Harris, radio operator WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had had surgery at the hospital in Vanderbilt.
Harris added that there was “no information on the type or severity of the incident yet ” and that Tennessee State was trying to find out when the accident occurred.
Abercrombie, who is in high school, plays her first season with Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
He had a total of five hits on Saturday before he left, which increased his total number of hits to 18.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp fees when buying real estate in Britain
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp fees when buying real estate in Britain.
The operation will nullify Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters
Increased stamping charges will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in Britain
A government fund plans to raise £120 million a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp fees when buying real estate in Britain. The extra money will be used to help the homeless. Theresa May will report this today.
The operation will be considered an attempt to nullify Jeremy Corbyn’s campaign to attract young voters by promising housing at a manageable price and taxing more high - paying people.
Individuals and companies that do not pay taxes in Britain will have to pay higher stamp fees, and the excess will take action by the government to help the homeless.
The increase - in addition to the current stamp charges, including the two - year increase in extra - home and real - estate purchases for rent - may be up to three percent.
A government fund estimates that the increase will produce up to 120 million pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of new London buildings are purchased from foreign parties, which makes it more expensive for those who want to buy property for the first time to enter the market.
Many wealthy areas in the country - especially in the capital - have become “driving cities ” because of the number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy comes only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in stamping fees to help more young people get their first home.
He accused a large building company of keeping property prices high by buying land but not using it, and urged May to cancel home allowances at a manageable price to fix Britain's 'household's allowance.
Mr. Corbyn has reported on a number of significant improvements in housing, including rent and the end of a rental house without charge.
He also wants to give advice on how to build a new home.
Theresa May said: “Last year I said that I would dedicate myself to the restoration of the British dream in my first period — that each new generation should enjoy a better quality of life.
And that includes adjusting our ruined real estate market.
The door of Britain will always open to those who want to live here, work and build their lives.
However, it cannot be right that it is as easy for a foreign party to buy a home as it is for a company with foreign headquarters to buy a good British citizen.
For many, the dream of their own dwelling place is far too far off, and the shame of the homeless is still too real."
Jack Ross: "My main goal is to train Scotland"
Jack Ross, coach Sunderland, says that he is “the greatest goal ” of his life to become a coach in Scotland at one time or another.
This 42-year-old Scotsman now enjoys the challenge of breathing a new life in the North-East Club, which is now in third place in the first division, three points from the top.
He moved to Sunderland this summer after returning to St. Mirren in the Scottish elite during the last season.
“I wanted to play for my people as a player.
I was injured on my knees and so it was over," said Ross in an interview with the BBC Scotland Sportssound.
“ But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my father, as a child, and there’s always something that has pulled me back.
But that opportunity would only be given if I managed to train the team."
The predecessors of Ross as trainers for Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former Coach Alloa Athletic Club said that he did not feel any fear of following in the footsteps of such a big club, but he had previously rejected training positions at Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“ Like that, I will measure my success by thinking, ‘ Can I get this club back to the top department? ’
This club is definitely at home in the department because of its structure and situation," he said.
“ It’s not an easy job to get him there, but I’d probably only think of myself as a success here if I got the club back up there. ”
Ross has only three years of experience as a trainer after a period of assistant training at Dumbarton and 15 months as part of a training team for Hearts.
He helped Alloa to recover from falling into the third division, and turned St. Mirren, who was about to fall into the league, into the league champion next season.
Ross says he's more confident now than he was ever in his career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren, and Hamilton Academic.
"This was probably a real milestone," he says about the period when he became the coach of Alloa.
“ I really believed that the coaching work was suitable for me, even more than playing.
It sounds strange, because I was doing well, I had a decent income, and enjoyed a decent success.
But changes can be difficult.
You have to go through a lot every week.
I still go through it in terms of stress and pressure from my work, but the coaching work just seems right to me.
I always wanted to train, and now I do. I've never felt better with myself in all my adult years."

The heat wave this summer has proved to be beneficial for British bars in difficulty, but pressure on restaurant chains has increased.
Sales at pubs and bars increased by 2.7 percent in July, while sales at restaurants decreased by 4.8 percent, according to numbers.
Peter Martin, from the CGA, who collected the figures, said: “The continuing sun and the unexpected success of England in the World Cup meant that July followed a pattern similar to that of June, when beatings increased by 2.8 percent, except what restaurants sold even less.
Sales fell by 1.8 percent at restaurants in June and worsened again in July.
Pubs and bars, mainly for the sale of alcoholic beverages, stood out with more excitement as restaurants went down.
Poppies who sold food also had difficulty in the sun, but not as much as restaurants.
It seems that people just wanted to go out drinking.
The sale of drinks at pubs and fights increased by 6.6 per cent before the month, but food sales fell by three per cent."
Paul Newman, from RSM, said: “These results are the continuation of the swing we’ve seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of important social events or sporting events are still the most important factors when it comes to selling in markets outside the home.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups are still in difficulty, although sales reductions of 4.8 percent between months are particularly painful on continued pressure from cost.
This long and hot summer could hardly come at a worse time before food stores and only time will tell whether the temperate temperature, as we have had in August, will improve the situation."
Total sales growth in papules and restaurants, including in newly opened locations, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the slow pace of openings.
Coffer Peach Tracker, the monitoring company with sales in the British pub and restaurant sector, collects and reports data from 47 business groups, with a combined roll-over of 9 billion pounds and is the industry benchmark for the sector.
One in five children has secret accounts on social media that they hide from their parents
One in five children, up to 11 years of age, have secret accounts on social media that they hide from their parents and teachers, according to the results of a survey.
A survey of 20,000 students showed an increase in the "insta" site
The news has heightened concerns about the publication of sexual material
Twenty percent of students say they have a 'primary' account that they show parents
One in five children, up to 11 years of age, make secret accounts on social media that they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 students showed a large increase in “insta” bills — a reference to the Instagram website.
The news has heightened concerns about the publication of sexual material.
Twenty percent of students said they had a clean 'primary' account to show parents, as well as keeping secret accounts.
One mother who fell on the secret website of her 13 - year - old daughter found a teenager who encouraged others to “rape me. ”
The study, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and HMC, showed that 40 percent of children between 11 and 18 years of age had two accounts and half of them admitted to have classified accounts.
Mike Buchanan, chairman of the HMC, said: “It’s a concern that so many youths were tempted to create areas on the Internet where parents and teachers cannot find them. ”
Eilidh Doyle will be "the voice of athletes" in the Scottish Athletics Sports Committee
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Scottish Athletics Committee as a nonexecutive director of the annual General Meeting of the Government.
Doyle is Scotland’s most successful free sportswoman, and Ian Beattie, chairman of the committee, said that the appointment was a great opportunity for those who led the sport to benefit from her extensive international experience in the past decade.
“Eilidh enjoys great respect within sports communities in Scotland, Britain and internationally, and we are sure that sports in Scotland will make a lot of money to get it to the committee,” said Beattie.
Doyle said: “I am very interested in speaking on behalf of athletes and hope that I can do my part and help to continue the sport in Scotland. ”
The U.S. winner of the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, a total of four Olympic gold, now a regular BBC guest, was paralyzed after a transient ischaemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “One month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors said that only time would tell if I was normal and how much.
It has been hard work, but I got used to it, learned to walk again and do sports today!
Thank you for your encouragement!"
Breast pump advertising, which compares mothers to cows, causes online differences
A company that manufactures a breast - feeding pump is now referred to on the Internet for advertising that carries lactating mothers to lactating cows.
The company Elvie published a bold advertisement to mark a presentation of what is said to be “the first silent breast pump in the world to be carried on. ” The advertisement is inspired by music videos and is to show the freedom that the new pump gives to breast - feeding mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of hay and we dance with lyrics such as, "Yes, I'm milking, but you don't see a tail on me" and, "If you didn't notice, it's not a udder, it's my breasts."
The appendix continues: “Pump, pump, I feed the children, pump, pump, I pump milk from the July. ”
However, the advertisement, which appears on the Facebook page of the company, has led to a discussion on the Internet.
The video features 77,000 viewers and hundreds of comments and has received a different response from the audience, many saying that it was accompanied by “the horror ” of the dairy industry.
“A really bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Just as we do, they must be filled with calves, and bear to make milk, except what the calves are taken away from them only a few days after they are born," said one comment.

Another observer wrote: “Really difficult for both mother and child.
But why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their children?"
Another added: “This advertisement is completely out of date. ”
Others came to the defense of the advertisement, and one woman admitted that the song was “rapidly funny. ”
“I think this is a great idea.
If I still had a baby, I'd have bought one.
I felt exactly like a cow when I was pumping milk out of my milk.
The ad is a little crazy, but I took it the way it is.
It's a genius," wrote one of the audience.
Another said: “This is a fun advertisement that is directed to mothers pumping milk (often at work or inside a toilet) and feels like “cow. ”
This is not an advertisement that commends or condemns the dairy industry."
At the end of the advertisement, the women’s group showed that they were all dancing with the breast pumps hidden in their chest arms.
The idea behind the advertising campaign is based on the fact that many women say that they feel like cows when they pump their milk.
The Elvie pump, on the other hand, is completely silent, has no wire or wire and fits comfortably into the breast-feeding holder, which gives women the freedom to move, hold their child, and even go out while they pump.
Ana Balarin, co - owner and director of Mother, said: “The Elvie pumpkin is such a revolutionary warning that she deserved a prominent presentation that would give a mention.
By likening women to cows, we wanted to focus the spotlight on breast - pumping and all of its challenges, even showing in a fun and familiar way how much freedom the new pump would bring.
This isn't the first time the Elvie pump's got the news.
During the fashion week in London, a mother of two children presented a fashion show to designer Martha Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of immigrant bears quietly moved to camp at the Texas border
The number of immigrant children in custody has increased suddenly, even though the number of those crossing the border each month has remained somewhat the same. Part of the reason is that the hard talk and direction put forward by the government of Trump has made it harder for the children to get into a temporary fetus.
Usually, the foster parents have been unregistered immigrants themselves, and they have feared that they might continue to be at risk in the country by offering to foster a child.
The risk increased in June, when the public authorities announced that potential foster parents and other adults within the home had to submit fingerprints, and that the data would be shared with the ICS.
Last week, Matthew Albence, head of the immigration and customs commissions, witnessed to the Senate and said that his agency had arrested a number of people who applied to foster single children.
The Agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested were not on a criminal record.
“ Nearly 80 percent of those who are either foster parents or in a home that fosters children are illegal in the country, and a large proportion of them are illegal immigrants on a criminal record.
"That's why we keep looking for their individuals," said Mr. Albence.
In an effort to speed up the work of the children, representatives reported on new rules requiring some of the children to appear in court within a month of being detained, rather than after 60 days, which was the first criteria, according to employees working in the workplace.
Many of them will come through videotapes, rather than in their own person, to give evidence of their legal standing before judges in immigration matters.
The children who are condemned to enter the country are quickly sent out of the country.
The longer children are in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which may lead to violent or refugee attempts, according to the staff of the shelters and reports published by the system in recent months.
Speakers said that these problems were even more likely in a larger institution, such as in Tornillo, where no one is likely to notice that a child is having trouble because of the number of them.
They added that the move of their children to the tent city without giving sufficient time to prepare them spiritually or to say goodbye to friends could add to the shock that many of them are already experiencing.
Syria says that the United States, France, and Turkey are “retiring immediately. ”
Walid al-Moualem, Minister for Foreign Affairs, also said in his speech at the UN General Assembly that Syrian refugees should return home, even though the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also plays the role of Deputy Prime Minister, said that the foreign army was illegal in Syria, under the false condition of fighting terrorism, and that “they will be treated accordingly. ”
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he said to the Assembly.
Moualem firmly argued that “the war against terrorism was almost over ” in Syria, where over 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have had to flee their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue “to wage this holy battle until we clear all Syria’s territories from both terrorist groups and“ all illegal residents. ”
The United States has some 2,000 soldiers in Syria, where most of them train and advise both Kurdish troops and Syrian Arabs who are fighting against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops in this war - torn country.
As far as refugees are concerned, Moualem said that circumstances were good enough for them to return, and he taught “some Western countries ” to“ spread unwarranted fear ” that encouraged refugees to stay away.
“ We have called on international society and humanitarian organizations to facilitate their return, ” he said.
"They make politics out of something that should be only humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not provide any funding for reconstruction in Syria unless there is a political agreement between Assad and the resistance to end the war.
According to the U.S. ambassadors, a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a neutral area at the last major battlefield of the Resistance created an opportunity to continue political dialogue.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevented a major attack by the Syrian troops supported by the Russians, in the region where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had a 'clear deadline' and expressed the hope that military action would be directed to jihadists, including fighters from the Nusra Front, who are linked to Al-Qaeda, and that they would 'be exterminated'.
Staffan de Mistura, U.S. Secretary, hopes to be able to attend the first meetings of a new committee consisting of members of the government and the opposition, to draw up a constitution for Syria after the war and to prepare the street for elections.
Moualem set out the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, saying that her work should be limited to ‘ reviewing the provisions of the current government, ’ and warned against any intervention.
Reasons why Trump will win a second election period
According to that reasoning, Mr. Trump would win the elections in 2020, unless accusations and scandals put an end to his presidential career, as many liberals probably hope.
In what would no doubt be “the most dramatic end of President Peter ever! ”
At present, the audience has no signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, viewers at the best time have more than doubled to 1.05 million at CNN, and almost triple to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
Fox News averages 2.4 million viewers at the best time, an increase from 1.7 million viewers four years ago, according to Nielsen, and the feature of MSNBC, “The Rachel Maddow Show, ” has peaked with up to 3.5 million viewers on important news nights.
"This is a fire that people are attracted to, because this is something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, director of ABC's "Designed Survivor" drama about a government employee who will be president after the Congress House is completely destroyed.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedian and author of the book “Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Snowing Into the Hollywood Boys” Club, adds another hypothesis.
She remembers going to a taxi in Boston for the 2016 elections.
The cab driver told her he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? she asked.
"He said, 'Because he makes me laugh,' said Miss Scovell to me.
There's entertainment in the mess.
Unlike television, however, stories from Washington may determine the fate of Roe v. Wade, whether families of immigrants can unite and health the global economy.
Only those who enjoy the greatest privilege can afford to stop watching.
And yet this is more than being an enlightened citizen when you look at the sixth hour at a group of experts reasoning on Bob Woodward's use of "very close" sources for his book "Fear," or $15,000 ostrich leather jacket that Paul Manafort wore ("a garment that is bred with pride," said Washington Post), and the consequences of the accurate biological descriptions of Stormy Daniel on Mr. Trump.
At least I'll never see Super Mario the same way again.
"The part of what he does and lets you feel like a reality factor is that he gives you something every night," said Brent Montgomery, Managing Director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the author of the "Pawn Stars" feature, when he spoke about the employee role in Trump's show and the daily changes in the history (e.g. starting a fight with N.F.L. and commending Kim Jong-Un).
You can't miss one thing, or you'll lose the thread.
When I got in touch with Mr. Fleiss, there was a 26-degree temperature and sunlight outside his home on the north coast of Kauai, but he stayed indoors and watched MSNB while he was recording CNN.
He could not break away, not when Brett Kavanaugh was to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was at stake.
"I remember when we were making all these crazy things in the old days, and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," said Mr. Fleiss to me.
“I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turned out that people were right. ”

Money Outflows in the Nearest Elections of the Middle Ages
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania sees the money flowing to it, thanks to the reorganization of elective areas that led to two representatives competing for the same seat.
The newly reorganized Pittsburg area is sending out the Democrat Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another constituency in the special elections last summer.
Lamb is presenting himself to another representative, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who is now the representative of the 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is very close to the 17th district.
The maps of the area were reorganized after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled in January that the old areas were organized for the benefit of the Republics and that they were in violation of the Constitution.
The race in the new 17th district has begun to finance the campaign between the main funding providers of both categories, the Democratic Committee (DCCC) and the Committee of the Republics (NRCC).
Lamb became a familiar name in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a special election in March for the 18th district of Pennsylvania, many of whom attended.
The Republicans had once warmed that seat for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won a 20 - point victory.
Political experts have given some headway to democrats.
The United States considered punishing El Salvador for support to China, but then cancelled.
Nationalists noticed that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already acknowledged Beijing, with little objection from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with Juan Carlos Varela, president of Panama in June 2017 and stayed at a hotel in Panama until the co-owners drove the management team of the Trump corporation away.
Representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs decided to recall the U.S. ambassador in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Panama because of “a new decision not to acknowledge the Taiwan anymore, ” said Heather Nauert, spokesperson of the Ministry of Finance in early this month.
However, punishments against El Salvador alone, estimated to have received $140 million from the United States for relief work in 2017, including for drug surveillance, development work, and economic support, were considered.
The penalties imposed, which included a reduction in financial support and restrictions on the use of residence permits, would have been painful for the Central American country, where there is a high level of unemployment and murder rates.
As open meetings continued, US and Central American representatives postponed a conference on security and economic prosperity and were to follow a similar meeting held last year, which was considered to be a step forward in efforts to prevent people from moving to the United States.
By mid - September, however, representatives from the top ranks made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, thus ending all the misgivings about punishment against El Salvador.
Vice - President Mike Pence is now to address the conference, which is to be held in mid - October, as a symbol of how important it is to the government, the ambassadors said.
The three U.S. ambassadors also quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic, with no new hard messages or punishments from Washington.
The White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton refused to discuss in more detail the discussions described by the three U.S. representatives, including two ambassadors who agreed to discuss the subject against being anonymous.
Their descriptions were confirmed by an outsider who works closely with the government and also spoke about the issue of anonymity.

The next scandalous issue could be the report by Robert Mueller, Special Prosecutor, on possible measures by Mr. Trump to prevent justice, but there are a number of public evidence for this.
It is also said that Mr. Mueller is also turning his investigation into whether Mr. Trump’s election campaign worked with Russia in its attack on our election.
If the council is to be ruled by a second-tier group, Trump may have to bear responsibility for it, at the time he prepares to meet his electors again, and perhaps his euthanasia appointed by his peers.
However, this is very uncertain and I do not want to suggest that Trump's fall is unmistakable, nor the fall of his colleague in Europe.
We all have to choose, on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect how long the battle will be.
In 1938, German councillors were ready to rob Hitler of power, only if Western countries had given him resistance and supported the Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the calamities that followed.
History revolves around such important points, speeding up or delaying the unstoppable course of democracy.
The United States is facing a few such important points now.
What do we do if Mr. Trump runs Mr. Rod Rosenstein, the man responsible for the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a bad position since this magazine reported that last year he had suggested making secret recordings of the president and discussing whether he was unfit for office.
Mr. Rosenstein says the news from the Times is not right.
“How will we react if the newly requested investigation of the FBI at Brett Kavanaugh is not detailed or reasonable, or if it is confirmed as the seat of the Supreme Court judge despite credible accusations of sexual harassment and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we elect a congress in the mid-term, which will make Mr. Trump take responsibility?
If we fail these tests, democracy will have to endure a long winter.
But I don't think we're going to fall because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother, a Jewish from Czechoslovakia, was sent to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime and was formerly in my home of ambassadors.
She survived, moved to the United States, and 60 years later she sent me to light Sabbath candles on the table with the crosshairs.
With such an inheritance, how can I not look to our future with a positive eye?

Graham Dorrans, Rangers' teammate, optimistic for the game against Rapid Vienna
Rangers will welcome Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that victory against the Austrians will put them in a strong position to emerge from the European Union's G-group. Rangers made a magnificent match in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month.
A knee injury prevented the center guard Graham Dorrans from playing his first game in the season until the game against Villareal, which ended with a 2-2 draw, but he believes Rangers can use the results as a jumping board.
"It was good to get this stage for us, because Villarreal is a strong team," said Dorrans, 31 years old.
“ We started playing in the belief that we could get something and end up taking one step.
Perhaps we could have achieved victory at the end, but in general, a reasonable conclusion was likely reached.
They were probably better in the first half, and we got into the second half and played better.
Thursday is another important evening for the European Union.
I hope we can make three points, but it's going to be a tough game because they did a good job in their last game.
Last year was difficult, both because of my injury and because of the changes that took place in the club itself, but now there is a good feeling.
The team is good and the boys enjoy themselves, the training is good.
I hope we can move forward now, put the last season behind us and achieve success."
Women lose sleep because of the fear of losing retirement savings
Although the survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few of them discussed this with their family members.
About half of the individuals in the Nationwide survey said that they talked to their mate about the cost of long - term care.
Only 10 percent said they were talking to their children.
“People want a family member to take care of it, but it doesn’t take the right step to have that conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of National Security.
Here's how to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to care for them if you do not respond to your wishes with good warning.
Talk to your counselor and family about where and when you are being cared for, for these options can make a big difference in terms of costs.
Include your financial adviser: Your adviser can also help you find a way to pay for this cost.
Among the options you have to pay for long-term care are traditional long-term life insurance, mixed life insurance that pays in cash, to help pay the cost, or self-insurance with your own money - as long as you have it.
Prepare all legal documents: Avoid legal differences in advance.
Get your health care provider so that you can appoint someone you trust to supervise your health care and ensure that healthcare professionals do what you want if you cannot tell them directly yourself.
Consider, too, the need to get a lawyer for your finances.
You would choose someone you trust to make financial decisions on your behalf and make sure that your accounts are paid if you cannot do so yourself.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your elderly father or mother is in an emergency and is on her way to a hospital.
Could you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Enter the details of your written schedule exactly so that you are ready.
“ It’s not just about finance, it’s about who the doctors are, ” said Martin.
“What are the drugs?
Who's gonna watch the dog?
Be prepared with that plan."

Earthquakes and tidal waves in Indonesia
At least 384 died after a powerful earthquake and a tidal wave in the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, said representatives, and it is expected that the dead will rise.
Since all communications are down, relief workers have not been able to provide any information from Donggala County, which is north of Palu and lies near the center of the earthquake, which was 7.5 on Richter.
Over 16,000 people were allowed to leave their homes in Palu after the disaster raged over.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital city of the Central Sulawesi region and is located at the bottom of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi. The estimated number of inhabitants was 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th birthday when the earthquake and the tidal wave struck.
Donggala is a county that covers more than 300 miles [380 km] of coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The county, which is a district under the jurisdiction, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main industries in the Central Sulawesi region, especially in the Donggala beach area.
Nickel mines are also important in the region, most of which are located in Morowali, on the shores of Sulawesi.
Flood waves have roamed Palu and Donggala several times in the past century, according to the Indonesian disaster organization.
In 1938 more than 200 people died when the Deluge struck, and hundreds of houses in Donggala were destroyed.
Also, in 1996, a wave of floods struck the western part of Donggala, where nine died.
Indonesia sits on the active ring of fire in the Pacific Ocean, and there are regular earthquakes.
Here are the main earthquakes and tidal waves of recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the western coast of Aceh in the northern part of Sumatra raged over December 26 and started a tidal wave that struck 14 countries and killed 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coastline, of which more than half were in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong quakes crossed the western coast of Sumatra late in March and early in April.
Hundreds die on the island of Nias, from the coast of Sumatra.
2006: Earthquake of 6.8 on the Richter road across the southern part of Jöva, Indonesia’s most populous island, resulting in a tidal wave that struck the south coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of 7.6 on the Richter River, located near the city of Padang, the capital of the region of western Sumatra.
Over 1,100 people died.
2010: An earthquake of 7.5 on the Richter River over one of the Mentawai islands, near Sumatra, raised up to a hundred feet [10 m] of flood waves that destroyed a number of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: Founding earthquakes over Pidie Jaya County in Aceh caused destruction and terror when people remembered the destruction of the deadly earthquakes and the tidal waves in 2004.
No tidal wave was formed this time, but over 100 died as buildings collapsed.
2018: Big quakes over the tourist island of Lombok, Indonesia, and more than 500 people died, mainly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed hundreds of buildings, and thousands of tourists were temporarily trapped on the island.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of Sarah Palin, former Alaskan governor and president of the United States, has been arrested for assault.
Palin, who is 29 years old and from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for suspected domestic violence, for trying to prevent domestic violence and resist arrest, according to a report from the Alaskan State Police, published on Saturday.
According to the police report, Palin took the phone from her friend when she tried to call the police to report a suspected crime.
Palin is held at the Mat-Sa station where he is waiting to be heard for judgment, and he is held for $500 insurance, as reported by KTUU.
He was sentenced to Saturday, when he declared that he was “not guilty, certainly ” when he was asked to declare guilty or innocent, according to the news station.
Palin is charged with three Class A crimes, which means that he could be sentenced to prison for up to one year and would have to pay a $250,000 fine.
He has also been charged with Class B crimes, which are punishable by one day in prison and $2,000 in fine.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged.
In December 2017, he was charged with attacking his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is now under review for the Alaskan surrender court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, of preventing domestic violence, and of carrying weapons under the influence of alcohol in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend has claimed that he punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by a group of surrender soldiers in 2016 after she blamed a shock - stress disorder on the violent behavior of her son, after his military service in Iraq.
An earthquake and a tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds dead
At least 384 people died after an earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 - on - Richter earthquake set off a tidal wave and has destroyed thousands of homes.
The electricity and communications systems are down and are expected to speak to the dead more and more in the next few days.
The earthquake was right in the middle of Sulawesi Island, located northeast of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
Videos that show when the incident took place are now on the social media.
Hundreds of people had gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tidal wave hit the beach.
Prosecutors seek rare death penalty for a suspected terrorist attacker in New York City
New York prosecutors want death penalty against Sayfullo Saipov, a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people, a rare punishment that has not been used in the state for crimes against the federal law since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, is believed to have rented a Home Depot truck to attack people on the roadway along West Side Highway in the lower part of Manhattan, where he drove down walking and cycling passersby in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors must prove that Saipov killed the victims eight “wildly ” and caused serious body injuries“ deliberately, ” according to the willful declaration to use a death penalty recorded in the Southern District of New York.
Both of these defendants may lead to possible death penalty, according to the court document.
Several weeks after the attack, Saipov’s 22-member federal sentence, including eight charges for murder for criminal purposes, was usually used by prosecutors in charges against organized criminal organizations, and Saipov was also charged with violent crime and for destroying the car.
The attack involved “a massively planned plan, ” said the accusers, describing Sapiov’s actions as “abominable, cruel, and immoral. ”
‘Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused physical injury, injury and loss to families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleveland, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco,’ said the statement of intent.
The five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It was a decade ago that the South of New York last took a death penalty case.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The death penalty was last carried out in a New York court case in 1953, against Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who had been put to death after being convicted of spying on the Soviet Union in the Cold War two years earlier.
The couple were both killed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, showed no sign of repentance during the days and months after the attack, according to the judicial documents.
He told an investigator that he was comfortable with what he had done, said a police officer.
Saipov told the authorities that he had got the idea of the attack after watching videos from ISIS on his phone, as stated in the charge.
He also asked to show the ISIS flag in his hospital room, said a police officer.
He has declared his innocence in all 22 of the charges.
David Patton, one of Saipov’s public defenders, said that they were “of course disappointed ” with the decision of the prosecution.
"We believe that the decision to ask for the death penalty instead of approving a declaration of guilt against life imprisonment without the possibility of a trial solution will only prolong the shock for all the participants," said Patton.
Saipov's defenders had previously asked the prosecutor not to seek execution of the death penalty.
The congressman says that NIGEL FARAGE should conduct negotiations for Brexit.
Nigel Farage promised to "trigger the people's army" today at a protest at a conservative conference.
This former leader, Ukip, said that politicians would have to be “under pressure” from EU skeptics, at the same time as one of Congressmen, Theresa May, suggested that he should conduct negotiations with the EU.
At the protest march in Birmingham, a conservative named Peter Bone said that Britain “would have gone out ” now if Mr. Farage were the leader of Brexit.
However, the challenge that May faces in resolving a deep disagreement between her own team members was even more evident when the city's citizens, who want to remain in the EU, took part in other protests against Brexit.
The Prime Minister is having trouble keeping his Chequers plan on track and is criticised by those who are in favour of Brexit, those who are opposed, and the EU.
Allies claimed that it will continue to fight to reach an agreement with Brussels despite opposition and force those who oppose Brexit and the Workers ’ Party to choose between her plan and her “disturbing. ”
Mr. Bone told the Leave Means Leave protest march in Solihull that he wanted to “get rid of the Chequers plan. ”
He proposed that Mr Farage be involved and assume responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he were in charge, we would have gone out now," he said.
The Senator from Wellingborough added: “I will support Brexit, but we have to get rid of the Chequers plan. ”
He explained his opposition to the EU and said: “We did not fight world wars to serve others.
We want to write our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bone referred to indications that the public’s opinion had changed from the elections in 2016: “The idea that the British public changed its mind and wants to stay is totally false. ”
Andrea Jenkys, a conservative supporter of Brexit, also attended the protest, said to the newsmen: “I just want to say, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is unpopular among the public, and the opposition will not vote with it. It enjoys unpopularity among our platooners and activists who are on the streets and elect us.
Please, stop the Chequers and start listening."
In direct messages to May, she added: “The prime ministers will keep up the work when they keep their promises. ”
Mr. Farage said that the politicians would have to “feel under pressure” if they were to escape the decision made following the vote in 2016.
“ This is about trust between our people and our political party, ” he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here together today to tell them, "We won't let you get away with this."
He added in his messages to the crowds: “I want you to put pressure on your political party, which is failing Brexit.
We're building the army of the people in this country that won us victory in Brexit and we'll never rest until we've become independent, self-governing, proud Great Britain."
At the same time, EU supporters held a protest march in Birmingham, which ended with a two-hour protest meeting in the city centre.
A small group of activists waved the flag guard against Brexit after the group was set up this weekend.
Lord Adonis, a member of the Workers ’ Party, made jokes about security problems that occurred in the group’s telephone program at the opening of the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can have all the computer systems okay and all the technology for Canada plus, for a border without barriers, for free trade with Ireland without a border," he added.
“This is a complete scandal.
There's no such thing as good Brexit," he said.
Warren is going to “consider seriously” to present himself to the President’s office.
Elizabeth Warren, U.S. Senator, says that after the November election, he is going to “listen to the President’s office for a serious offer. ”
According to a Boston Globe report, the Massachusetts Democrat discussed his future at a civilian meeting in the western part of Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who has recently criticised President Donald Trump of the United States, offers himself for re-elections in November against the Republican Geoff Diehl, who was in charge of Trump’s 2016 election campaign in Massachusetts.
She's been the center of her dismay that she could volunteer for Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon Holyoke meeting was held in the form of a public meeting with residents in her district, since Trump took up office.
One attending the meeting asked her if she was willing to present herself to the president.
Warren replied that it was time for “women to go to Washington and fix our government, and then they also need a woman as a leader. ”
Arrest after a fatal shooting on Sims from LSU
The Baton Rouge police in Louisiana announced on Saturday that she had arrested one suspect in LSU basketball player Wayde Sims, who was shot to death on Friday.
The Baton Rouge police reported an arrest on Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old at a news conference at 11 a.m.
She had previously published a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for assistance in identifying a person who was seen on the tape.
Sims, 20 years old, was shot to death near the University of Southern University early on Friday.
"Wayde Sims got a gunshot wound in his head and died from it," said Murphy J. Paul, police chief, at the press on Saturday, as reported in 247sports.
Wayde came to his friend's defense and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and confessed that he had been on the scene, with weapons in his way, and admitted that he had shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without any trouble and held in custody by the eastern Baton Rouge Police Department.
Sims was six feet [2 m] tall and grew up in Baton Rouge, he played 32 games, of which 10 were in the lead in the last season and played an average of 17.4 minutes, scored 5.6 points, and scored 2.9 in each game.
Grand Prix, Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaches the World Championship after Sebastian Vettel gives him the victory seat on the order of their side.
It was evident from the time Valtteri Bottas took a seat in front of Lewis Hamilton before the launch on Saturday, that orders from a team of Mercedes would play a major part in the competition.
Bottas got off to a good start at the start and almost left Hamilton behind when he defended his position on the first two turns and invited Vettel to fight his teammate.
Vettel went first into the pit and let Hamilton drive into the traffic at the end of the group, but it should have been able to make a final decision.
The Mercedes car went into the pit one round later and came out after Vettel, but Hamilton got out of a little fight where the driver Ferrari was forced to leave the inner gate after having been in danger of being left, after the defense attempts in the third turn.
Max Verstappen started in the back of the group and was in seventh place at the end of the first round, on his 21 - year - old birthday.
He then led the majority of the race when he delayed changing tires to try to finish quickly and get out of Kimi Raikkonen and finish fourth.
Finally, he entered the pit in round 44 but could not speed up the remaining eight rings, and Raikkonen took fourth place.
This is a difficult day, for Valtteri did well all weekend and was a true gentleman to let me go.
The team has done great to achieve this success," said Hamilton.
It was really bad body expression.
Donald Trump, president of the United States, made fun of Senator Diane Feinstein at a meeting on Saturday, because of her claim that she had not leaked the letter from Christine Blasey Ford, accused of sexual harassment by Brett Kavanaugh, a high - court judge.
The President spoke at a meeting in West Virginia, but did not address the Ford witness directly to the Senate Committee, saying that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were “bad and cruel and unspeakable.”
“ The only thing that could happen and the wonderful things that have been going on in the last days of the Senate, when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry and cruel and cruel and unspeakable, ” he said.
“ When you see the lights and leaks and then they say, “Oh, I didn’t.
I didn't."
Do You Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you lick that?
Do you remember her answer... You lied to the document - “Oh, what?
Oh, no.
I'm not gonna close it."
Wait a minute.
No, we didn't lie, he said, and he copied the Senator.
The letter was sent to Feinstein in July, where the accusations from Ford against Kavanaugh were made, and it was leaked early in September. Feinstein denied that the leak had come from her office.
"I didn't hide the accusations of Dr. Ford, I didn't tell her story," said Feinstein to the committee, according to a report from The Hill.
“She asked me to keep it in secret, and I did as she asked me to. ”
But her denial did not seem to go well with the president, who said at Saturday’s meeting: “I tell you, it was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't close anything, but it was the worst body expression I've ever seen."
The president continued his defense against Brett Kavanaugh, who has been accused of sexual harassment by three women, calling for democrats to take advantage of the charges.
“They are determined to regain power, no matter what methods are needed.
You see the cruelty, the evil, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to elect in order to gain power and control," said the president, as reported by Mediaite.
Elite League deildin: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two limits for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars made up for their Friday loss in the Elite League Division against the Belfast Giants by winning the next game next, 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants received an early two-point advantage from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie evened for the locals, but Dwyer came over the Giants again.
Francois Bouchard regularly for Dundee, and two borders from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen won their victory.
This was the third loss in the season for the team Adam Keefe of the Elite League, who had won Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth game between the teams during the season, and the Giants had won the three previous games.
Dwyer scored the first goal in the fourth minute at 3:35 p.m., following a support from Kendall McFaull, and David Rutherford came with a support when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
Then it was a big deal to be in the first few minutes, and Sullivan came back to the game when the clock showed 13.10, and Cownie usually followed a support from Matt Marquardt in 15 minutes.
Dwyer saw to it that the Giants came across half a game when he scored his second goal in the game at the end of the first third.
The home team gathered, and Bouchard returned to the goal when they were one man over to the 27th minute of the second third game.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran worked together to help Nielsen get over Dundee for the first time in the game late in the second quarter, and he won his team with the fifth goal when half of the last quarter was over.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, welcome Milton Keynes to their next game on Friday.
A pilot kills to ensure that hundreds of passengers on a plane escape from an earthquake
A pilot in Indonesia has been hailed as a hero after he died to ensure that a plane carrying hundreds of passengers could take off safely.
More than 800 people have died, and many are missed by the great earthquake that ensued the island of Sulawesi on Friday.
Large aftershocks continue to plague the area, and many are trapped in ruins in the city of Palu.
The 21 - year - old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave, despite the fact that his associates had fled the control tower that swung violently at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He remained to ensure that the Batik Air aircraft number 6321, which was on the runway when the earthquake raged over, could certainly be lifted.
He then jumped out of the control tower when he thought he was falling.
He died later in a hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said that his decision might have saved hundreds of lives, according to the ABC News in Australia.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Sadly, this morning before the helicopter reached Palu, he died.
"We are very sad to hear this," he added.
Authorities fear that the number of dead could exceed a thousand, as the country’s disaster agency says that access to the towns of Donggala, Sigi, and Boutong is limited.
"It is estimated that the number of dead people is still rising because many bodies are still under ruins and cannot be reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the Agency.
Up to three feet [6 m] high waves have caused massive destruction in Palu, where a mass funeral will take place on Sunday.
The army and the passenger aircraft are working to bring supplies and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35 - year - old mother, interviewed Sky News: “Every minute an ambulance comes with a body.
There's little clean water.
The mini-markets have been robbed everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said in an interview to CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is competing to find survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
It's already a tragedy, but it could get worse."
Joko Widodo, president of Indonesia, came to Palu on Sunday and told the nation’s army: “I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the work associated with the evacuation.
Are you ready?" said a CNN report.
Earlier this year, earthquakes struck Lombok, Indonesia, where more than 550 people died.
Micronesian Air Accident: Air Niugini now says that the same thing is missing after the plane crashed into a lion
The airline, which had a plane that crashed into a lion in Micronesia, now says that one person is missing, after having previously said that all 47 passengers and crew had been rescued from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini announced that from Saturday afternoon on, it did not know about the outcome of one male passenger.
The airline said it was working with the authorities, hospitals, and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately answer questions about further information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Boats in the area helped save the other passengers and the crew after the plane crashed into the water when she tried to land at the airport on Chuuk Island.
Representatives said on Friday that seven people had been hospitalized.
The airline said that six passengers were still in a hospital on Saturday and that all of them were stable.
It is still unclear what caused the accident and what the exact sequence of events was.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both said that the plane had landed in the lion just before the runway.
Some witnesses thought that the plane had crossed the runway too far.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said that the approach to the plane was very low.
"That was really good," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and others could dive into the middle of the water and find emergency exits on the sinking plane.
He said that the Air Forces were afraid and shouting and that he had suffered minor head injuries.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors who were working close to building a dock also helped with the rescue by using an inflated boat to take people ashore, before the plane sank to about 30 feet [30 m] of deep water.
Data from the Air Safety Agency show that 111 people have died in the accidents of PNG-registered aircraft in the last two decades, none of which were related to Air Niugini.
An expert describes the timeline of the evening when a woman was burned alive
Prosecutors closed their case on Saturday in a retrial against a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an expert from the U.S. Department of Justice, was in the courtroom for hours as an intelligence expert.
He explained to the abdominal surgeon how he used cell phone records to piece together the travels of the defendant, 29 - year - old Quinton Tellis, and the 19 - year - old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night she died.
Rowlett said he had received location data from several cell phones that showed that Tellis was with the Chambers night she died, on the contrary to his previous claims, as reported by The Clarion Ledger.
When data showed that his cell phone was with Chamber at the same time as he said he had been with his friend, Michael Sanford, a police officer went to Sanford to talk to him.
Sanford witnessed on Saturday and said that he had not been in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford’s car that night, Sanford said that it was “a lie, because my car was in Nashville. ”
Another disagreement was that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers for about two weeks before she died.
Cell phone records showed that they had only been known for one week.
Rowlett said that sometime after Chamber’s death, Tellis had deleted text messages, phone calls, and her contact information from his phone.
"He destroyed her from her life," said Hale.
It is estimated that defenders will deliver their final address on Sunday.
The judge said that he expected the matter to be brought before the court later that same day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
Hip hop trio wants to fight a negative view of the music by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims that hip hops were distant from their origins, where they contained political messages and discussed social issues.
They want to look for the source again and make conscious hip hop again popular.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently seen an upswing in Britain through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
Nanny in New York Lawyers Married for Disfellowshipping After “Prejudiced” Text Message
Nanny in New York legalizes a couple for illegal expulsion after she received an unexpected text message from her mother, complaining that she was “another black person. ”
The couple therefore refuse to be prejudiced and liken the lawsuit to “fiction. ”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, declared dissatisfaction when she learned that her new foster, Giselle Maurice, was black when she first came to work in 2016.
Mrs Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
But instead of sending the message to her husband, she sent them twice to Miss Maurice.
After discovering her mistakes, Plasco-Flaxman fired Ms. Maurice and said that their black-haired ex-nanny had done badly, and that she had expected a Filipino woman, as reported in the New York Post.
Miss Maurice was paid for one of her work days and then sent home to Uber's car.
Maurice now sues the husband and wants to receive compensation for her expulsion, a sum of $350 a day for the six - month job she had been originally hired, even though no contract had been signed.
"I wanted to show them that you shouldn't do this," she said in an interview to Post on Friday and added, "I know this is a difference."
The couple have protested that they are prejudiced and say that it was the right thing to run Maurice because they felt that they could not trust her after insulting her.
“My wife sent her a message that she was not going to say.
She's not prejudiced.
We're not prejudiced people," said Joel Plasco to Post.
“ But who would trust their children with someone after showing such rudeness, even though it was surprising?
His newborn child?
Come on."
Plasco likened the lawsuit to “fiction, ” saying that his wife was seven months away and was in“ a very difficult situation. ”
“ Are you going to attack someone in this situation?
It's not very nice done," said Plasco, who works in the investment sector.
The matter is still under trial, but the public has spoken harshly about the couple on social media and has disgraced it for their conduct and reasoning.
Paddington’s publishers feared that readers would find it difficult to like a talking bear, says a new letter.
Commenting on the letter, Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after her approval, said: “It’s hard to put herself in the footsteps of someone who reads it for the first time before it was published.
“It’s very funny now that we know about Paddington’s enormous success.”
She said that her father, who worked as a cameraman at the BBC before he was inspired to write a book about a small toy bear, had accepted the rejection of his work with calm positivity, and added that the 60th birthday of the book was “a sweet - hearted one ” after his death last year.
As for Paddington, whom she describes as “a very important member of the family, ” she added that her father had been silently proud of his success in the end.
“ He was a very quiet man and not used to boast, ” she said.
“But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like when you have a child who does something, you’re proud of it even if you haven’t really done anything yourself.
I think he almost looked at Paddington's success that way.
Though Paddington was a creation and his imagination, he always gave Paddington the credit."
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye through the phone.
By the time she landed, her daughter had been transferred to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors did everything in their power to save her life, but without success.
“Nad called me regularly and told me that the situation was very bad, that she was not expected to survive,” said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
“ Then Nad called me and said that she would die within two minutes and that I had to say goodbye.
And I did.
I said, “Tashi, I love you so much, my love.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs that the doctors had given her to keep her heart rate up were gradually losing its function and being eliminated from her body.
She had died a short time before, and it was the body that was giving up.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing this was all happening.
I could not sing or scream or cry, for I was surrounded by family and other people.
I had to be in control."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who now mourned her dead daughter, went aboard the plane with the other passengers who knew nothing of the difficulties she had experienced.
"No one knew anything," she said.
“ I dropped my head and tears fell all the time.
It is difficult to explain, but during the flight, I felt a great deal of sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Worrying women hang up messages to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who had loved ones who committed suicide are now trying to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted messages on a bridge in Wales, with encouraging messages and phone numbers that people can call and get help.
At the age of 18, Tyler, a son of Miss Davis, was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide.
“ I don’t want a parent to feel the way I have to feel every day, ” she said.
Ms. Davis is 45 years old and lives in Lydney and said that her son had been a successful cook with a contagious smile.
“He was known for his smile.
Everyone said his smile could light up any room."
He stopped working before he died, for he was “sucked down into a very dark place. ”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, at the age of 11, found his brother dead after taking his own life.
Ms. Davis said: “I’m constantly worried about the consequences. ”
Ms. Davis made the message “to let people know that it is possible to go and talk to others, even a friend.
Don't sit and say nothing--you need to talk to someone."
Ms. Humphreys, who has been a friend of Miss Davies for years, soon lost his wife, Mark, to 15 years of age, after his mother died.
“ He didn’t talk about feeling sick or depressed or anything like that, ” she said.
“ A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his mood.
He was at his worst on Christmas Day. When the children opened their gifts, he didn't look them in the eye, nor look at anything."
She said that his death was a great shock to them, but that they had to work themselves out: “This will tear a hole in the family.
It'll tear us apart.
But we must persevere and fight."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh hangs on blue thread when the FBI has its investigation
"I thought that if we could have something similar to what he asked for - a study of limited time and scope - we might be able to reach a little agreement," said Mr. Flake on Saturday and added that he was afraid that the committee would be "split up" in the middle of a dispute between the groups where everything was going backwards.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate the case?
Their hesitation is due to the timing.
In just five weeks’ time, on November 6, when the Republicans go badly, as expected, their serious efforts to get their man elected to sit in the Supreme Court of the land weaken.
George W. Bush has been calling Senators to encourage them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush in the White House and met his wife, Ashley, through him, who was Mr. Bush’s personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI publishes its research report?
A vote will be held at the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It is not yet certain whether Mr. Kavanaugh can receive at least 50 votes on the floor of the Senate, which would enable Vice - President Mike Pence to break up the level and confirm him in the office of the Supreme Court.
The number of those fleeing North Korea “reduced” under Kim
The number of those fleeing North Korea and going to South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a Senator from South Korea.
Park Byeong-zeug, quoted data from the South Korea Joint Council and said that 1127 people had fled last year, compared to 2706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that a tighter border guard between North Korea and China and higher charges charged by traffickers with people were key factors.
Pyongyang has not issued any official statement.
The vast majority of those fleeing North Korea are invited to receive South Korean citizenship rights.
Seoul reports that over 30,000 people from North Korea have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them flee to China, but it has the longest border to North Korea, and it is easier to cross it than the well-off of neutral areas between North and South Korea.
China views refugees as illegal immigrants rather than refugees, often forcing them to return to their homeland.
Technically speaking, relations between North and South Korea, which are still at war, have improved considerably over the past month.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks mainly on delayed nuclear negotiations.
This was after a historic meeting in June between Donald Trump, President of the United States, and Kim Jong-un, Singapore, where they agreed to cooperate with one another on nuclear-free Korea.
On Saturday, however, Ri Yong Ho, Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea, taught American business volumes about the lack of progress since then.
“Without confidence in the United States, there is no certainty about our country’s security, and under such circumstances it is impossible for us to take our nuclear weapons down one side first,” said Ri in his speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh a "mother-sick" and says he is unfit to perform the duties of a Supreme Court judge
Nancy Pelosi, the chairman of the Senate, called Brett Kavanaugh, the nominee of the Supreme Court “Motherly Sick, ” and said he was too quick to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi had these words heard during a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“ I couldn’t help but think that if a woman had ever let her go like this, she would have been called a mother’s disease, ” Pelosi said about his reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony to the Senate Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied the accusations that he had sexually harassed Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
In his opening address, Kavanaugh was very emotional, and at times he cried out and got a cake in his neck as he spoke to his family and his school years.
He also publicly condemned democrats on the committee and called on him to “condemn and organized genocide, ” organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton had lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said that Kavanaugh’s testimony proved that he could not serve at the Supreme Court, for he showed that he was partial to democrats.
"I believe that these claims and how he attacked the Clintons and Democrats show that he is unfit for the job," she said.
Pelosi did not answer when she was asked if she would try to get Kavanaugh out of work if he was confirmed and if the democrats got the majority in Congress.
“I’ll say this: if he’s not telling the Congress or the FBI the truth, he’s not only unfit to be in the Supreme Court, but also in the court he’s now,” said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh now serves as a judge in the appeal court in Washington, D.C.
Pelosi added that as a democrat, she was concerned about the possible decisions of Kavanaugh against the Affordable Care Act or the abortion law of Roe v. Wade, as he is considered a conservative judge.
During the hearing, Kavanaugh turned away from questions about whether he would overturn certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“This is no time for a motherly, biased person to go to the Supreme Court and expect us to say “a lot is wonderful.” ” said Pelosi.
And women need to take advantage of it.
This is just talk, months and years of rage, and it will not come out without weeping.
"We cry when we get angry," said Ms. Steinem to me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's uncommon, do you?"
She continued, “I got a lot of help from a woman who was a manager somewhere and said that she also cried when she was angry, but she had developed technology so that when she got angry and started crying, she said to her interviewer, “You might think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then she just kept crying.
And I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are allowed to express anger in part because they are misunderstood in principle.
One of my clearest memories of my previous job in an office with men in the majority, where I started to cry out of rage that I couldn't express, an older woman came and took me into the back of my head.
"Never let them see you cry," she said to me.
They don't know you're angry.
They think that you are sad, and rejoice to have entered into you."
Patricia Schroeder had worked with Gary Hart when he was in the presidential service, but she was then a congressman of democrats from Colorado.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was embroiled in cheating aboard a boat called Monkey Business (Apaspil) and withdrew his offer, Ms. Schroeder, thought that there was no reason why she could not consider presenting herself to the president.
"It wasn't a well-designed decision," she laughed at me 30 years later.
“ There were already seven other candidates, and the last one they needed was one more.
Someone gave this name, "White and the Seven Dwarves."
Since the campaign was over, she was behind in terms of fundraising, so she vowed not to volunteer unless she was able to raise $2 million.
It was a lost fight.
She learned that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men gave her only $250.
“Do they think I’ll get a discount? ” she wondered.
When she gave her speech and announced that she would not present herself formally, she was so overwhelmed by the feelings of gratitude to the people who had supported her, the resentment of the system, which made it so difficult to raise money and direct her eyes to the voters instead of representatives, and the anger of the genital mutilation--that she burst into tears.
"It might be thought that I had a nervous breakdown," said Ms. Schroeder, recalling how the media responded.
“ Kleenex could be thought to be my sponsor.
I remember thinking, what will be written on my tombstone?
"She cried?"
Why Business Wars Between the United States and China Could Be Good for Beijing
The first shots in the American - Chinese business war were raging, and even though the war was far from over, a gap between countries could be beneficial for Beijing for a long time, say experts.
Donald Trump, president of the United States, shot the first alarm earlier this year by taxing China’s major exports, including solar batteries, steel, and aluminum.
This week the highest rate came with new customs duties covering goods worth $200 billion ($150 billion), taxing almost half of all goods imported into the United States from China.
Beijing has responded in the same coin each time, and recently, 5 to 10 percent of American products have been taxed at a price of $60 billion.
China has promised to respond to the customs regulations of the United States, and it is unlikely that the second largest economic system in the world will soon give way.
To get Washington to jump, demands must be met, but it would be far too humiliating for Xi Jinping, the president of China to bow publicly from the United States.
Experts say, though, that if Beijing holds the cards properly, the pressure from the US business war could have a long - term positive effect on China by reducing the mutual need for both economies.
“The fact that a rapid political decision either in Washington or Beijing could lead to the economic downturn in the other country is, in fact, far more dangerous than the audience has previously admitted,” said Abigail Grace, a researcher who focuses mainly on Asia at the New American Security Center.
Syria “prepared” for the return of refugees, says Foreign Minister
Syria claims to be ready for refugees to return to the country willingly and to seek help to rebuild the country, which is now in a bad state after seven years of war.
Walid al Moualem, Minister for Foreign Affairs, spoke at the United Nations General Assembly and said that the situation in the country was improving.
“ Today, ” he said, “the situation on earth is more stable and secure, thanks to success in the fight against terrorism. ”
The government continues to come under normal circumstances by building up areas that were completely destroyed by terrorists.
Everything is now ready for refugees to return to the land they were forced to leave because of terrorism and one - sided economic decisions directed against their daily lives and jobs.
The U.S. estimates that over 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Six million more still living in the country need help.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian authorities would be happy to accept assistance in rebuilding the country.
On the other hand, he stressed that they would not accept assistance on conditions or assistance from countries that supported the rebellion.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The team of Europe has won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the United States team with a final score of 16.5 against 10.5 points on the Le Golf National Field outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained its crown when, under the leadership of Danish leader Thomas Bjorn, the team reached the 14.5 points required to conquer the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who was in trouble most of the race, struck his first strike in the 16th hole, which is par 3, and lost his game against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari shone brightly in all his games and became 1 out of 4 players to get the 5-0-0 result, from the start of the race using his current format in 1979.
The United Statesman Jordan Spieth lost 5/4 against Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark, who was the lowest in the order of the players in the European team.
Dustin Johnson, who is at the top of the list of the best golfers in the world, lost 2 and 1 against Ian Poulter from England, who possibly played in his last game of the Ryder Cup.
The Spanishman Sergio Garcia, who has played eight times around the Ryder Cup, became the most successful European in the race with 25.5 careers.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t do anything else.
It's been a tough year.
I am so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy to get the cup back.
It's about the team, and it was my pleasure to be able to help," said Emotional Garcia after the victory of Europe.
He handed the torch to his country John Rahm, but he won the American golf legend Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in a solo game on Sunday.
“ I was incredibly proud to have conquered Tiger Woods, and I grew up watching him, ” said 23 - year - old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his games in France and is now registered with 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup competition.
This is a strange conclusion for one of the best players in history, who has won 14 major titles and is second only to Jack Nicklaus.
The American team had a hard time finding themselves on the field all weekend, apart from Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau, who played a good game throughout the race.
The U.S. leader Jim Furyk said of disappointment with the performance of his team: “I’m proud of them, they fought.
It was sometime in the morning that we put pressure on Europe.
We lost him.
I'll take it from Thomas.
He's a great leader.
All 12 of his players play very well.
We'll get back together, I'll work with the PGA in the United States and name the Ryder Cup, and we'll continue.
I love these 12 men and I'm proud to be their leader.
You have to take it down.
They played better than us."
