A Republican strategy to counter the re-election of Obama
The leaders of the Republicans justify their policies with the need to combat electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Center considers the latter a myth by affirming that the election fraud in the United States is more rare than the number of people killed by the lightning strike.
Incidentally, the Republican lawyers have recorded only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in 10 years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on the turnout.
In this sense, these measures are partly undermining the democratic system of the United States.
Unlike Canada, the US states are responsible for the conduct of elections in the individual states.
In this sense, since 2009, the majority of American governments have announced new laws that make registration or urn entry more difficult.
Following the November 2010 elections, 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states were able to register this phenomenon.
As a result, 180 draft laws were introduced in 2011 alone which restrict the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states.
The new electoral laws require voters to present a photo identification and proof of US citizenship.
In addition, these laws also shorten the time-limits for the early vote, declare the right to register as voters on the election day invalid, and give citizens the right to vote for which a legal act exists.
Before the 2006 elections, no US state required voters to show a photo ID.
Indiana was the first state to raise such a demand.
The Supreme Court of the United States confirmed in 2008 the constitutionality of the law of Indiana.
The Republican authorities rushed to extend this practice to other states.
Over the last two years, they promoted draft laws in 34 federal states that force voters to show a photo identification.
It is important to note that, unlike Quebec, US citizens do not have a universal card such as the health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of US citizens, i.e. 21 million persons entitled to vote, do not have a photo ID issued by a government authority of their state.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such a card.
However, there are often more than a hundred dollars to be paid to obtain the required ID.
Young people, minorities and people with low incomes are disproportionately affected by the new restrictions.
In fact, 25% of African-Americans, 15% of people with less than $35,000 income, 18% of citizens over 65 and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 years of age do not have the required photo ID.
This is far more than that.
Students who are regarded as voters, who are increasingly voting for democratic candidates, are not allowed to use their photo ID issued by their institution in several countries.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of fishing or hunting associations who choose more closely for the Republican side to use the cards issued by these associations for elections.
Before 2004, no state called for the election of citizenship.
Arizona was the first state to introduce such a claim.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove their US citizenship.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting hispanic voices.
Because it is obvious that two out of three Hispanic voters prefer the democratic party.
In addition, Republican legislators in 2011 have promoted laws in eight states that have abolished the registration of voters on election day.
In addition, you have limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to those voters who wish to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, the campaigns to register voters in the 2004 general elections have helped to register about 10 million citizens.
The measures adopted since 2009 have reduced the number of new voters in 2010 by 17% compared to 2006.
In addition, the Republican legislators in five other states have adopted laws aimed at shortening the time period for the early vote.
For example, in the 2008 general elections in Florida, 33% of the voters who voted in advance were Afro-Americans, although they account for only 13% of the voters of the state.
The same applies to the Hispanic population.
The latter accounted for only 11% of the voters, but 24% of the citizens who voted in advance.
In contrast, the whites representing 76% of the voters made up only 46% of the voters who chose in advance.
Of course, democratic legislators and their supporters have strongly opposed the adoption of laws that restrict the registration of voters.
Several draft laws were blocked by the vetos of democratic governors.
The US Attorney General has intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
They could partially limit the damage.
For example, only 16 of the 34 states have passed laws requiring the presentation of a photo identification.
However, the new rules introduced in 2012 will undoubtedly make the exercise of the right to vote more difficult.
The democratic critics denounce the party political nature of the passed laws and see in them as a clear goal the influence of the results in the states that are decisive for 2012.
A 2011 Brennan Center report shows that those states that have passed these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes required by the electoral body to win the presidency.
It is too early to confirm with certainty that these changes to the electoral system legislation will have a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential elections in 2012.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on the turnout.
In this sense, these measures are partly undermining the democratic system of the United States.
Early detection of prostate cancer: should the test be performed or not?
In fact, the PSA test sometimes shows incorrect results, with false negative or false positive results that lead to unnecessary medical interventions.
This leads to greater hesitation among the men who are already indecisive about carrying out early detection tests.
Should the test be done or not?
We got the opinion of two specialists.
In the studies conducted in the USA, there were numerous disruption factors between control groups, making it difficult to interpret these data and make clear recommendations.
Another study, this time from Europe, concluded that there is a difference in the mortality of patients with and without early detection.
This study has also shown that the probability of metastases forming after 12 years is 30 to 40% higher when no early detection has been performed.
That is why I recommend the test from the age of 50 or 40 if you have a direct relative who has already been suffering from prostate cancer.
In men of African-American origin, there is also a higher risk.
The most important thing is to make the right decision once a cancer has been diagnosed.
There are cancers that are aggressive and others that are indolent.
The patient must really understand the extent of the risk of his cancer by showing him the possible options in which prostate cancer can remain untreated if it does not affect the quality of life in the long term, and in these cases it is more likely to be decided to actively monitor the disease.
Today, many men who have known cancer do not receive treatment because their cancer is not aggressive and does not pose a threat to their lives.
They are proposed to be actively monitored and treated as they progress.
It is with increasing accuracy that the criteria for a decision are defined, who should be treated and who not.
That is why I still recommend carrying out the test.
The most important thing, however, is to talk to his doctor to determine whether he should be performed or not.
In cooperation with the international Urology Society, Movember has developed an instrument to assess the advantages and disadvantages of the PSA test.

Prevention of the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle cure for cancer prevention.
Despite progress in research, adopting a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of illness.
It is estimated that 30% of cancers could be prevented if all would eat well and move sufficiently.
"If there were no more smokers, this value would increase to at least 50%," emphasizes André Beaulieu, spokesperson of the Canadian Cancer Society.
However, it is estimated that about 10% of cancers are caused by heredity.
Several remain completely unexplained.
The fight against tobacco dependence remains a priority for the Canadian cancer society, despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Smoking accounts for 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for several other cancers.
It is damaging people's health.
"Today there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," laments the speaker André Beaulieu.
Encouraging data: 10 years after abandoning the cigarette, the risk of dying of cancer is reduced by half.
The weight
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, overweight and obesity also promote the outbreak of the disease.
They appear to increase the risk of breast, mammary, oesophageal, pancreatic and uterine cancer.
"Research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against gout cancer," he adds.
Food
The organization also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In excess, it increases the risk of contracting from a cancer of the Grimm or of the mast.
Sauces should also be avoided.
The preservation of meat by smoking, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogens.
"Later, body cells can damage and lead to the development of cancer," he explains.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have investigated the relationship between vitamin additives and cancer.
However, their investigations are currently not conclusive.
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, the studies on vitamin E are contradictory.
While one study found the reduction of the risk of prostate cancer, another showed more of an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has also not yet been clearly demonstrated.
In addition, Mr Beaulieu stresses the importance of talking to his doctor about his concerns and his family pre-load.
"The conduct of an early detection test does not lead to cancer."
The Higgs Boson Analyzes
The announcement of the probable discovery of the Higgs boson has aroused a certain amount of excitement last summer, and this for good reason.
In fact, it is believed that this Boson is involved in nothing less than the mechanism that is responsible for the mass of all objects in the universe.
And finally, it is the last particle whose existence was predicted by the standard model - our best or "lowest false" explanation of nature and the behaviour of matter - but not yet empirically observed.
But for the physicists, it's not completely sure that it's really about the Higgs.
We know without the shadow of doubt that we have a real new particle and that it is very similar to the Higgs boson predicted by the standard model.
In addition, this seems to be confirmed by new data presented at a major physics conference in Kyoto this week, but there is still no data to be absolutely sure about it.
Nevertheless, let us assume that this is actually the Higgs, as there seems to be only a small risk of being deceived, and let us look at what it is about.
There is an indispensable law in this world that causes two objects not to be present at the same place at the same time.
It is not possible to violate this rule - and do not try it too hard as you will be hurting yourself.
For even if particle physics is a truly strange world, it turns out that such a law applies to it as well: the Pauli exclusion principle, which means that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time when they are in the same "quantity state", with this "state" largely consisting of some of its characteristics.
From this the physicists divide the particles into two categories.
In a corner are the good citizens, who are called Fermione and obey the Pauli principle.
And in the other, the Bosons, an evil gang of anarchists, who are nothing sacred - certainly not this principle, which means that they can actually be at the same place at the same time.
These bosons are divided into two groups according to the website The Particle Adventure from the Berkeley laboratories (which by the way is absolutely amazing): the mesons that we will not treat here and the "power particles", through which the great forces of nature spread and with which the Higgs boson would somehow be related.
But it must be emphasized here that these bosons are not all such exotic creatures as you might think.
If you are able to read this chronicle, then only thanks to a boson of exceptional banality: the photon or the "light particle", which is the "bottom" of the electromagnetic force.
If a particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes the direction, the electromagnetic field is "disturbed" at this very place, in about like a pebble that was thrown into a pond.
This "disturbance" creates an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.) and this wave is nothing but a photon and thus one of the bosons "carriers of force".
Stabilised field
The same applies to the Higgs boson, with the difference that another field, the Higgs field, must be "disturbed" so that this boson appears.
However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the pathogen must reach very high energies, a little like a frozen pond, whose surface could only be crushed by a very large rock.
That's why a huge particle accelerator like the CERN is needed - the Large Hadron Collider is a ring with a volume of 27 km! - to achieve such energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again helpful to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
In fact, not all particles and not all materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, such as magnets, do this, but others do not - for example, a sheet of paper would never keep by itself in the fridge.
And equally, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those who do have a mass, while the others (like the photon) have no mass.
For what can all these research be "good", asks Mrs. Plamondon?
For science, they are used to review the standard model (SM) and they also enable physicists to carefully examine all deviations between the observations and the predictions of the SM.
By the way, there are numerous physicists who most eagerly hope that such deviations are found, as the slightest difference could open a door to a "new physics" and plug some holes in the model.
One has to say that the latter still has great defects, as it offers no explanation for gravity (ups!) and the dark matter, which constitutes about 80% of the matter of the universe (again ups!).
However, such deviations have not been found in the CERN so far.
Impacts
The impact of these research on the general population is more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there was no such thing.
By the way, in the early 1960s, the pioneers of the laser in the Bell laboratories did not suspect that their work would trigger such a revolution.
They saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle - who worked in the Bell Labs, in which the laser was invented in the 1960s, and who developed the first permanent laser (the first were pulsated) in 1962 himself - has already told us that the laser was initially considered to be a "laboratory".
Imagine...
In addition, applications can also result from all the instruments surrounding research.
For example, Willard Boyle developed a small light sensor during his work in optics in 1969.
Although it was not the original purpose, today this sensor serves all digital cameras worldwide as an "eye" and has won the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics.
Of course, this does not mean that the activities of the LHC will necessarily change our lives, but it means that you can never really know it...
Palliative care - the best way to die...
Quebec has recently discussed with its Committee on "Death in Dignity" the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate must be resumed shortly, although a draft law is being prepared.
However, much remains to be done in this important area.
Le Devoir has tried to take a closer look at this.
A few weeks ago Mr. L. lived alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that devoured him had allowed him a period of two years.
"They gave me five years to live, I did seven years," he said half-heartedly, lying in his bed in the home for palliative care Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil, where he arrived the day before.
"However, it's always a shock, you can't be prepared for it," he says.
The disease does its work: an immeasurable weakness prevents him from going to the toilet alone and even eating himself.
Sitting at the table in front of a delicious lunch, he consents to let himself be helped in eating.
Courageously he can even smile and talk to the strangers who are busy around him, bring him his medications, and offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is to heal my diarrhea, as this is humiliating," he says.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this evil.
"Over the course of our lives, we learn that a man is peeping in the stand," says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at Victor-Gadbois' home.
Returning to the childhood phase is an unacceptable humiliation for certain people.
"That depends on the person's ability", he notes, taking a step back.
Because, in the opinion of several people working in palliative care, major events take place in the midst of this setback.
The patients who are admitted to the home for palliative care Victor-Gadbois all suffer from cancer.
You have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this stage, the doctors and nurses who care for them will no longer overcrowd them with so-called "healing" care.
For Mrs. A., 89 years old, the worst fear is to die "consciously and through suffocation".
But through the illness I really got to know my children.
"I have good children," she adds.
"I don't have any more desires in my life," she says before she accepts the idea of putting on a mask to help her breathe.
She still expects a last visit from her son, who comes from Italy, in the next few days.
At the home of Victor-Gadbois you can offer a group of volunteer body care and help with food intake.
Palliative care is then used if there are no other possibilities.
To make dying more pleasant.
At 11,700 inhabitants in Quebec, there is a bed for palliative care.
That's very little, considering that one day we'll all die.
Here life is continued under the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors in the home.
Both at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
Depending on your wishes, you give the deceased a mouth care with Brandy or Pepsi.
Diabetes patients should no longer control their blood sugar level.
And death is part of everyday life.
Last night we served Mr. X a beer that died during the night.
This morning his son will drink the beer at the feet of the deceased.
"We help family members and patients alike," reports Nathalie Savard.
Victor-Gadbois is not a day like the other.
In addition to an old man of 93 years who enjoys the last family reunion in the courtyard and is well supported by his pillows, as one approaches to his honor, a young man of 36 years, surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two small children, dies tragically after trying everything to survive.
"For six months, three to five beds have always been used for cancer patients under the age of 45," says Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of the patients admitted to the home Victor-Gadbois come from their home, 47% come from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, i.e. to care to alleviate the suffering of patients when the latter have reached the end stage of their lives, both at home, in a hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the home Victor-Gadbois and the Society for Domestic Palliative Care in the Greater Montreal area, are more or less exclusively specialized in the care of cancer patients.
Just this great inadequacy in the health care of Quebec ensures that several doctors specialised in palliative care look forward to the adoption of a law regulating death care and assisted suicide with concern.
Since October, a manifesto has been in circulation, signed by prominent personalities of palliative care such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe to express their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, Quebec’s health system is not efficient enough to ensure that everyone has a right to high-quality palliative care before accepting to go to death care.
Recently, she says, I saw a patient who had 14 days of severe pain in the emergency room without taking measures to alleviate them.
I fear that patients only want to die because they do not receive adequate health care.
And at the same time, several oncologists treat their patients in spite of worst predictions bitten to the last day.
Hélène Richard's chances of survival were already minimal when she stopped a difficult chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was going to stop the treatment, she replied that she regretted that I was giving up the fight, she told me.
However, she had told me that I was at the end!
No omnipotent care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who have asked to die thank the caregiver for not accepting this request after their pain has been eased by a team of palliative care.
However, it must be clearly stated that palliative care is not omnipotent in pain treatment.
According to Elsie Monereau, head of palliative care of the community of residential palliative care of the large Montreal area, 8% of patients do not respond to pain treatment.
Thus, at the very end of life, the doctors often resort to the terminal sedation, which leads to the patient sleeping either sporadicly or permanently until the time of his death.
We can no longer act as if we do not perceive this side of suffering.
Patients without pain relief will be increasingly able to resort to this terminal sedation.
Patients whose pain is not alleviated say the same sentence: "I want to die."
But that doesn't necessarily mean, "I want you to put me to sleep," but "I want my pain to be alleviated."
The implementation of this report was possible due to a journalism grant from Canadian health research institutes.
Real estate scandals in Quebec
Officials of the street construction office, construction industry companies, political party fundraisers and Italian Mafia specialists tell us every day what they know about a great "system" in which the construction industry, officials, politicians, trade unionists and mafioso are entangled.
An "industry" that was very expensive for the taxpayer of Quebec, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It is strange how the system breaks down since drastic measures have been taken," jokes Jacques Duchesneau, Member of Quebec and former Head of the Montreal Police.
The scandal was revealed by him on the basis of an in-depth investigation of the violations in connection with the contracts for road construction in Quebec, which the then Prime Minister had only reluctantly agreed to.
The "Duchesneau Report" established a direct link between industry, secret financing of parties and bribery of officials.
"Since the beginning of the 2010 survey," he stressed, "the Ministry of Transport alone had saved a billion dollars in the contracts, because some of them were fueling their instincts to get their share!
The Charbonneau Commission "has already brought two mayors down", he adds, hoping that it will succeed in "showing the tactics behind the individuals".
A permanent anti-corruption unit launched in 2011
The permanent anti-corruption unit set up in 2011 is also making great efforts with its troops of government auditors, investigators and analysts.
In addition, the policemen of the "Marteau" force, which has since 2009, made Montreal's "channelling cartel" more reticent in the artificial bulwark of the treaties...
In recent weeks, she has carried out a series of house searches and filed accusations of fraud and corruption against municipal mandate holders such as Frank Tampino and Richard Marcotte, who is the mayor of a suburb.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his office as mayor of Laval, Quebec's third largest city.
He is suspected of having repeatedly received lubricating money in exchange for public contracts.
Incidentally, engineers of the Montreal Street Building Office, as well as entrepreneurs of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambia, were charged.
The latter has aroused concern by declaring to the Commission the functioning of the "system" for the receipt of public contracts.
For several years he himself paid 3% of the value of the contracts received in Montreal to an intermediary related to the Mafia who transferred the money to the Union Montreal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
In the 2000s, Mr. Zambia had his hand everywhere in the game, giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially to the liberals who were then in power.
He also confessed to organising an illegal procurement for the former Liberal Vice-President Nathalie Normandeau.
sewerage contracts, the costs of which were artificially blown up by him
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked smoothly.
Former construction engineer Gilles Surprenant described this in detail before the Commission: in ten years he received gifts from the construction company, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants and ice hockey games, as well as bribery money of 736,000 dollars in return for sewerage contracts, the cost of which he artificially blew up.
Other road construction officials admitted that they let themselves be lubricated by artificially blowing up invoices with false additional services by 30-40%.
In addition, an organizer of the mayor's party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay of deliberately looking away at a shadow budget that filled his boxes with black money.
As a result of these revelations, Mr Tremblay resigned at the beginning of November, which plunged Montreal into a serious crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first Montreal MPs to sound the alarm.
As mayor of the district of Rivière-des-Prairies, in the east of the island, she rebelled against the sale of a municipal property from 2010 that was purchased for 5 million dollars and resold for 1.6 million to builders in the booming real estate market.
70% black money in the election campaigns
From the investigation, which is ultimately carried out, she says that she "draws on a thread that allows us to understand the functioning of the system underrund by ants, to stop the evil and to challenge the guilty."
She says the procedure is "painful but positive".
We are in the process of cleaning up the wound, however, need an investigation unit for Montreal only, as well as an oversight to prevent a return to questionable practices.
How to clean up.
Regular.
Jacques Duchesneau, for his part, notes that "officials have stolen several hundred million dollars," but above all, they are concerned about the role of "mandaters who are in the picture about the tactics" if they were not involved in the fraud!
Based on 70% black money in financing the election campaigns in Quebec, he jokes: "I was told that this is only a weak slip of reality."
The Quebec government proposes to limit the donations to 100 dollars to parties, which he says would not change the situation: "As long as electoral expenditure is not strictly limited, black money will be in circulation in politics."
He recommends a complete revision of the system for the award of public contracts and the financing of the parties: "We cannot fall deeper; by courageously going to the bottom of things, we can rebuild the house on a more solid basis with more controls and laws."
If this story damages Quebec's international reputation and that of Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau calls on those who laugh about taking a look at their own backyard...
"PSG is not the FC Barcelona!"
This season you have adopted a new dimension with PSG.
How do you explain this progress?
It can be explained by a personal insight, but also by the new dimension of the PSG.
Great players have come.
Every day I make progress with her.
The technical staff also gave me a lot.
These elements encourage me to improve my game level every day.
And this is even easier with a game.
In football everything is going very fast.
But I don't get excited.
From my beginnings in the centre of the preparatory training of the INF Clairefontaine up to my playing time at Saint-Etienne, I have always made progressive progress.
They thus take advantage of the competition introduced by Carlo Ancelotti...
The new additions to this summer are used to playing games very high levels.
You also know that each training unit is crucial.
This leads to a player like me who has to offer forehead and wants to do his best.
By the way, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot about my playing position.
He is supported by co-trainers like Claude Makellele, who played in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the right person for the task?
Of course.
Ancelotti brings respect to all technicians.
In Ligue 1 there is currently no comparable person, and he is one of the best trainers in Europe.
He looks back on a rich experience and has won many titles with respected clubs.
He had contact with big players.
I think he'll win more titles in Paris.
In January I had a encouraging conversation with him.
At the time, I had just recovered from an injury series.
The trust he has placed in me is also an explanation for my achievements.
What do you think about the first part of the PSG season?
In Ligue 1, Lyon took us to the top rider's seat.
But we're lurking in ambush.
One of our most important goals is the Champions League: we have qualified for the eighth final in this way.
What is the goal of the association in this competition?
We will try to get as far as we can.
From now on, everything is possible.
However, we will have to speak with our little words against very good European teams.
First of all, we want to become the first of our group before Porto, so that we can play back the eighth final as a home game.
Can the PSG become a large European association in the short term?
He already has the budget for...
In order to become a large European association, Paris must win the title and make a long-term name.
This is not the case today.
In financial terms, the PSG will provide the funds to make this project take on concrete forms.
Would it be a great failure not to win the title in Ligue 1 as this was the case in the last season?
Of course, this would be a great disappointment.
This year we really have the heart to dismiss this title.
Last season we were close.
In May we were disappointed because we were strong enough to bear the victory.
We finished the season with a very strong performance.
We have concluded with 79 points.
Normally you should be champion with 79 points...
But another team, Montpellier's, has achieved an even better season.
I think this year is the right one.
Even though the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are battling for the title, I think we have the stuff to win it.
Do you think the media expect too much from the PSG?
In view of what has been invested and the players we have, it is normal that much is expected of us.
We accept this perfectly.
However, if we win a home game against Troyes 4-0, and you still find something that can be blamed on us, that is certainly a little frustrating.
You wonder what people are expecting.
We could never win every weekend with 4-0.
We are not the FC Barcelona!
We're trying to set up a game concept.
A team builds up over time.
In the Champions League we have proved strength.
Consider Manchester City, an association that has not been able to qualify for the eighth final for two seasons, and which has also made huge expenses!
With regard to the invested sums, you were believed to have a 15-point lead!
That meant that our opponents and the French championship would be ignored.
Lyon and Marseille, which were not good last season, were "boosted" by this new PSG.
This shows that the Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we will be the smiling winner and say that we have finally won them despite all the difficulties.
The PSG seems to be completely dependent on the services of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
The better you're talking about a "Zlatan addiction".
This means that Ibrahimovic is powerful and shoots many goals.
That's why he came and he proves he's the star of Ligue 1.
Wherever he has played, he has shown that he is a great player and a world star.
Within the team we respect both the player and the person.
He also respects the people who surround him.
What he did is really extraordinary.
This encourages others to improve their level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the world's best defenders, also enables all others to make progress.
How did you experience the EM 2012 with the French national team?
Like a disappointment.
I had the heart to participate in this EM.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from playing out some time.
I've seen things that I've come out of.
Today I manage to realize good games in the national team.
This has been my hope since my baptism with the "Bleus".
From what has happened in Ukraine, we have learned our lesson, and today we must show exemplary behaviour.
What do you think about the first months of Didier Deschamps at the top of the "Bleus"?
He has achieved promising results.
We have a good position in the qualification group for the World Cup.
The National Trainer is strict, is close to the players and encourages victory.
Just as it was Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to make a comparison.
Blanc had achieved his goal by qualifying us for the EM.
I hope Didier Deschamps will lead the "Bleus" to Brazil.
Is this forced indecision in Spain on 16 October (1:1) a prelude game?
This game has given us confidence.
Everyone has worked for everyone else.
Before this meeting in Spain, I have never experienced a similar game in my career.
With Bitcoin you can pay and sell without a bank
The opposite of the current monetary exchange based on central banks, identified transactions and handling fees between the parties.
Moreover, as is so often the case in these technologies, a political vision is tangible: the conviction that the current monetary system, shaped by bank monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, the bitcoin invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) is both a virtual currency (but convertible into dollars, euros, etc.) and a protocol for safe exchange such as BitTorrent, which enables the direct exchange of files.
With 15,000 computers on the network, some 200,000 transactions have already been recorded.
Some thousands of websites accept Bitcoin as a donation or as a means of payment.
After reaching a peak of $30 (23 euros) in June 2011, Bitcoin's rate fell to $2 five months later, before recovering to around $10 today (the rates are listed on the bitcoincharts.com website).
Nothing particularly impressive compared to the world trade of real currencies or financial products.
Nevertheless, the European Central Bank (ECB) has shown interest in this in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
It describes Bitcoin as "the virtual currency with the greatest success", "in competition with the dollar or euro" and "similar to the traditional currencies".
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currencies such as the "Credits" that are used to advance in a video game that you can win or buy by playing (and sometimes also exchange back).
The social network Facebook has also developed such a system.
However, trade is checked and processed by a central authority every time.
With Bitcoin, all net notes are simultaneously held by the account book, auditors, money issuers as well as buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users actually takes place between two email addresses in the form of an email.
With the difference that the user can choose a different address for each payment, which ensures the anonymity.
A series of data related to this transaction is electronically signed by a double encryption system.
In this way, the network can verify the authenticity of the transaction.
With the help of the contents of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the traded bitcoins are present in the public accounts billing book that is distributed throughout the network.
The decisive step is to enter this new transaction in this book.
This is done through a mathematical task that is started on the computers, whereby the winner, who is a kind of preliminary central banker, has the privilege to add this additional line.
It is a fragment of the file, i.e. the conversion of a large file into a shorter and unique electronic fingerprint.
The computer "take" the new transaction and add a number to it before the whole thing is "hacked".
The goal is to find the number that produces a special fingerprint (many zeros at the beginning).
If this number has been found, the other nodes can easily check whether it is right.
The transaction is thus permanently linked to the chain of all other transactions, and any modification would change the fingerprint.
If one user wants to pay with the same money twice (less than 10 minutes) for fraud, only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network and the other will remain unconnected, as both have different fingerprints.
The computer that solved the task gets 50 bitcoins.
In order to prevent inflation, this reward will be halved regularly, probably before the end of 2012.
The Bitcoins in circulation are therefore limited to 21 million, but are only divisible by one hundred million, leaving some room for manoeuvre...
In addition, the difficulty of the task is increased with any improvement of the computing power.
The life of the network has already had heights and depths.
The websites providing services for Bitcoin were attacked and the bitcoin deposits were stolen.
"The vulnerability used does not concern the actual protocol," assures Pierre Noizat, who has just introduced Paymium, which is a company for real money payment and uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reports on the possibilities of money laundering using this anonymous service.
However, cash also shows these shortcomings.
Important actors like Wikipedia refuse to donate this kind.
They are accepted by others like the blog platform WordPress.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron from the Weizmann Institute in Israel analyzed the invoice book and showed that almost 80% of the bitcoins are not in circulation.
In November, a "Mega Lock Sales" was launched.
"Three thousand dollars have been exchanged," says Jon Holmquist, who works for the company Coinabul, who converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of a book about this currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
His system Paytunia corresponds to a credit card (with real money) or a contactless payment with a mobile phone, but uses Bitcoin to validate the transactions that are thus cheaper.
In addition, the holder manages his identity and can therefore remain anonymous.
The system can be easily implemented by dealers, and the latter do not need to install new terminals or computer programs.
You just have to specify an address that can be "photographed and recognized" by a phone, Pierre Noizat, who assures that he has thousands of users.
There is a general trend in the coverage of hierarchical systems in favour of more horizontal systems.
"It will take some time until Bitcoin prevails, but 2013 could be a turning point," he predicts.
Incidentally, the ECB's report provides for a reassessment of the various risks which are today highly regarded in the event of the success of this currency.
We're out of Afghanistan.
And after that?
French troops have left their responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the US are expected to follow by the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain ownership of its territory and for the Afghan people to decide their future without expecting everything from us.
In particular, we punished the Afghan farmers by viewing them as terrorists.
And ourselves with our 88 killed soldiers, as well as the injured and injured.
The Taliban consists of foreign extremists, former leaders who have fled to Pakistan, but often also of peasants who refuse an armed foreign presence, as at the time of the Soviets.
They want to defend their centuries-old and archaic traditions, even if they have joined jihadists, Pakistani, Arabs, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan.
Tolerated, sometimes supported by the local insurgents, the latter will no longer be there if the Western countries become more discreet.
The French troops were deducted from the base in Nijrab, which I observed from a hill planted with almond trees financed by French loans.
The truck and tank convoys flooded by helicopters have reached Kabul without being attacked.
As of the end of 2014, there will be no more influxes of the Taliban in Kabul.
Since its irresistible advance from 1994 to 1996, the conditions have changed.
At that time Kabul was empty and the country was overwhelmed by war because of the struggles of the various rebel groups.
Their takeover of power was then regarded as a kind of liberation and return to security.
The Afghan women have paid the price for the obscurantism of the peasants overwhelmed by the organization Al-Qaeda, but their situation has not improved to this day.
Former Mujaheddin, the Afghan government and the current Taliban have a common desire to keep women in a subordinate position.
The main personalities of the anti-Soviet war came back to power in 2001.
They have turned into businessmen by confiscating government land to sell it as a building land to refugees from Iran and Pakistan, thus benefiting from the massive American subcontracting.
They were in disrepute, and most of them were not themselves involved in the struggles.
As I have heard in the campaigns, people want a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave the country, as well as those who were able to make use of American subsidies: capital flight is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and its ideologies.
During their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they have had contact with the modern world and have enjoyed its advantages.
About 65% of the population is under 25; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, which is one fifth of the total population.
In the cities the state schools are full of girls like boys.
These young people, who do not want to return to the obscurantism of the former parties or to the corruption of certain leaders, will have to be given jobs.
All, including the armed parties, are obsessed with mobile phones; television with its Turkish series, which represent a modern world, is watched everywhere.
An army is now in place.
Are the authorities under whose command they will be considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already working to restore the militias in the province, who will escape the power of the central government.
Afghanistan, the country of the mountains with strong local identities, should have benefited from a degree of decentralisation based on the example of the Western nations, but by abolishing the office of the Prime Minister, which existed since the 1964 Constitution, the US wanted to make it a centralized state with strong presidential power.
President Karzaï does not want foreign controls, in particular during the elections planned for April 2014.
However, his country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and long before.
Industries have not been rebuilt, functional dams are not available and important irrigation systems have not been repaired.
Everything is imported; apart from fruit and vegetables nothing is produced.
The private initiative will be given priority.
In a country based on 30 years of war, a state control of the infrastructures would have been necessary.
The rumor has been spread that Afghanistan has vast land treasures.
This reinforces the impression that the Western countries were only on the ground to empower themselves to do so.
Without energy to process the iron or copper ore on site, or without means of transport for an export over the mountains, no mining is possible.
The Chinese have already almost abandoned the Mes Aynak copper mine, have international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) at the huge Buddhist site make their excavations and remain the main employers of the province.
One day, it will also be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan, which are largely dependent on imports and exports, to restore normal relations.
The withdrawal of the French combat troops was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the continuation of traditional assistance: girls' and boys' gymnasiums, Institute for French Studies at the Universities, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, a civil-military service of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), which was set up in 2012, has carried out in dozens of mountain villages numerous non-profit works and measures for the restoration of agriculture and has been carried out by a small French non-governmental organisation in order to try to achieve the "hearts and spirits" and the impossible task of reconciling aid and offensive actions.
This work, for which many local workers were required, has helped to suppress the uprising: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and the increase of agricultural land.
What souvenir do we leave behind after military spending of two billion euros?
A much more modest budget will help to improve local living conditions, which are often very harsh in these valleys at an altitude of more than 2,000 metres.
There are dozens of written requests for small agricultural projects from municipalities in the province of Kapisa.
In order to free farmers from the insurrection led by foreign groups, which is their own wish, it would be necessary to continue with less, well-controlled and directly related civil assistance to their benefit.
A Constitution With the Breaking Bar in Egypt
It is a new poker game by President Mohammed Mursi.
While Egypt remains more than ever divided as regards the declaration of constitutional power that temporarily grants it unlimited authority, it has decided to put everything on a map.
To surprise everyone, he announced on Wednesday that the constitutional assembly would adopt its final version the next day.
Just a week ago, the Head of State had granted this plenary two additional months for the completion of its work.
For almost two years now, Egypt has been relying on a provisional, multi-amended text, which weakens institutional stability and leads to legal confusion.
This new initiative has only led to an even greater division of the country.
For his opponents, the president persists in his "autocratic delirium" by continuing to "break his word" and "stepping the law with his feet".
On the part of its supporters, it is assured that it is a way to end the institutional and political crisis as quickly as possible and to speed up the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 14 days.
A very short period of time that compels the brothers to abandon their purpose to explain the text section by section to the Egyptians.
For the President, it is also a way of restoring his public and democratic legitimacy while the protest rages throughout the country.
After confirmations in an interview with the American weekly show Time, Mohammed Mursi seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote well.
In particular, with this recourse to an urgent vote, an ultimatum will be put to the Egyptian people: "either you vote for my draft or I retain the unlimited power of attorney," the latter should supposedly end after the adoption of the Constitution.
85 mostly Islamist members of this constitutional assembly adopted the text yesterday in a strange atmosphere.
The majority of liberals have not responded to the call.
Shortly before the Constitutional Declaration in mid-November, they turned away because they believe that they have not been able to bring their views into line.
Representatives of human rights organisations, religious minorities or civil society have acted equally.
In order to reach a quorum, 11 people, deputy members, were added in a hurry yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Moslem brothers.
It is not surprising that the articles have been adopted unanimously.
Incidentally, the commentators found it amusing that the only difference of opinion of the day... was expressed at the time for prayer, since some members of the body felt that the pendulum was not exactly what was going on in the constitutional assembly.
The text, which was adopted last night, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, which drew all attention to itself, finally remains identical with that of the 1971 Constitution and states that "the principles of Sharia are the main source of justice".
The Salafist parties, for which the establishment of Islamic law is an important demand, had the hope of replacing "the principles" with "the rules", which would have made it possible to apply more strictly.
For the Islamists, the fact that this article has not been changed is proof of their good will and respect for the other members of Egyptian society.
"Skin sanctity" returns the liberals, who see this only as a propaganda strike.
According to them, the Islamisation of the Constitution on other articles takes place.
In doing so, they have in particular Article 220 in mind, which confers an advisory role on the University of Al-Azhar, in particular with regard to the verification of compliance with the laws of Sharia.
According to Egypt's specialist Sophie Pommier, this is disturbing, since "the people who are asked for an opinion have not been elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
You can see the first signs of a theocracy in this."
The fears of the liberals are also nourished by the fact that the next rector of this university is likely to be far less moderate than the present one.
"There is currently no concrete religious commitment.
With this Constitution we remain within the framework of the bourgeois state.
Most lawyers who have worked on this text are not Ulema, but academics who have been trained in part in the French system," says Alexis Blouet, who writes a doctoral thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
He admits, however, "that in relation to Article 220 there may be a ambiguity, since the terms used are rejected by the religious vocabulary.
This refers in particular to the "Fiqh" [Islamic case law, Note d. Red.].
And in the future, the question could be raised to what extent civil judges are competent to decide."
In addition to its religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday is strongly criticised for the far-reaching powers it confers on the President of the Republic.
The Moslem brothers argue that these are significantly reduced compared to the former regime.
Another issue: the powers of the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the examination of the defence budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but to the National Defence Council.
Similarly, there will be no ban on civil proceedings in military courts, as the human rights defence associations have called for.
The latter also communicate their fears regarding the text which they consider to be a threat to freedom.
The practice of blasphemy is being maintained, and insults are now banned, which could have serious consequences for the right to free speech, especially for the press.
Furthermore, no more articles refer to the protection of women, emphasizes Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
In your opinion, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by Article 36.
This word was not included in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian president had to speak on television last night, demonstrations are scheduled for this afternoon.
The supporters of the Head of State will march on Saturday.
In Israel Ukrainian tourists expect sacred places, the navel of the world and a sea of Sole
The Promised Land unites in itself the glory of Bible truths, modern comfort and a pristine nature.
The AIF mentions the five main reasons for a visit to Israel.
Bend the Holy Sites
Visit the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
It means that everyone who swims in this river receives God's blessing.
Galilee is the place where Jesus performed his miracles: the transformation of water into wine at a wedding feast, the walking on the water, the breastfeeding of the seastorm and the fishing.
Here Jesus appeared to his disciples after the resurrection.
Most of the shrines, however, are located in Jerusalem.
Here believers take the path of suffering or the crossroads of Jesus Christ (in Latin: Via Dolorosa).
The path begins at the Roman fortress Antonia, Pretoria, where the court was, and leads through the streets of the old town to the grave church on Mount Golgotha, where the crucifixion, the anointing stone and the tomb of Jesus are located.
Here, according to the Christian view, is the navel of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of mankind.
The monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem stands at the place where, according to a Christian legend, the tree from which the cross for the crucifixion of Jesus was made grew.
In Jerusalem is also the most holy place of the Jews - the Lamentations Wall, the remains of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 A.D.
Traditionally, people of different faiths leave papers with wishes that then come true.
Make a trip in the heights
The ruins of the Fortress Massada form the remains of the secret hiding place from enemies, which Herod the Great built for his family in 25 A.D.
They are located on a rock wall in the mountains at 450 meters altitude above sea level.
Only climbers can reach the ruins from their own strength.
Everyone else will take an air cable car to this historic summit.
In the north of the country at 1600 to 2040 meters altitude is the famous ski resort Hermon, where it attracts countless tourists during the winter months.
From the foot of the mountain you can get there by shuttle bus.
The ski slopes have a total length of 45 kilometers.
According to an old legend, pagan gods supposedly lived at the summit.
Visiting Unique Museums
In this country there are almost 300 museums.
Not all of them can be visited on one trip.
But at least the five most interesting of them should be paid a visit.
Among these is once the Israel Museum near the Knesset (parliament).
There, ancient Qumran manuscripts or scrolls of the Dead Sea, found in rock caves in the Judean desert, are kept and about 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
The Museum of Art in Tel Aviv is also worth a visit.
There the collection of works by the Impressionists and Expressionists Monet, Pissaro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso is exhibited.
In Akko you can visit the museum in the Bad Al Basha, which houses several rooms of ancient Turkish baths with sculptures by the then visitors and bathers.
In Caesarea you should visit the unique private Ralli Museum, where you can admire sculptures of Dali and Rodin.
There are neither museum guides nor souvenir shops.
Admission is free, and donations are rejected in principle.
The fifth museum, the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, tells of one of the most disturbing chapters of history.
The most impressive section is the monument for the children, which was built to commemorate the 1.5 million children who were destroyed in the concentration camps and gas chambers.
When entering space, complete darkness prevails.
Stars sparkle.
And the names of the Jewish children and of the countries in which they died shall be heard.
Ukraine is also mentioned there.
Do Something for Health
The three main recreational areas of Israel are located on the banks of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
In each of the three places there are swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and oceanariums.
Amazingly, the Red Sea also bathes in the winter months, as the water temperature does not fall below 21 °C and the air warms up to 23 °C.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and is bathed all year round.
By the way, this unusual sea with a position of 417 meters below sea level is the lowest sea in the world.
Its turquoise-blue water has a high salinity and thus carries even non-swimming on the surface without any problem.
The surrounding landscape is indescribably beautiful.
Visitors come here for treatments using salt water (natural salt salts) and health sludge, as well as for the treatment of skin inflammation, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes, and the soothing of damaged nerves.
Touching the Secrets of Antiquity
These secrets hide the old town of Tel Aviv, the town of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
Through this city the famous sea route, Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia, was connected.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian legends.
According to tradition, Noah built his ark right here, and here Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda with which he lived a long and happy life.
Tourists like to stroll through the narrow streets, named after astrological signs.
Fortuna should be the legend of all who touch the walls in the street with their star sign.
In Jaffa you can meet newlywed couples from all over Israel and even other countries at photo appointments.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can walk through the Roman theater and conquer the fortress of the Knights of the Cross.
In Roman times Caesarea was the most important city of Judea and the residence of the Roman governors, including Pontius Pilate.
Today, evening concerts and operas are performed in the carefully restored theatre.
Favourites for tourists
If you go to Israel, don't worry about your poor English skills: about 30% of Israelis speak Russian.
The money in the trip is not taken in euros, but in dollars that can simply be changed into shekels (current exchange rate: 1 dollar to 3.8 shekels).
In the city you usually get on the bus, but in Jerusalem there is also a high-speed train and in Haifa the only metro line in the country with six stations connecting the sub-city to the upper city.
In fact, it is an underground cable car.
A journey within the city costs 6 Shekel regardless of the mode of transport, which is sufficient for a journey of up to 1.5 hours.
According to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is celebrated in Israel on Saturday.
From Friday evening to sunset on Saturday, markets and shops are closed, and public transport rests.
And on Sunday morning the working week begins.
In many cafés, restaurants and restaurants, only kosher food is served, which excludes pork, marine products, fish without dandruff and food containing both milk and meat products.
Instead, you have the choice between various dishes with mutton and beef, soups and desserts (prepared with coconut milk), traditional Jewish humus paste, various sauces, fried balls of pure beans and peas (falafel) as well as fruits and vegetables.
There are no straying dogs in the streets of Israeli cities.
For this there are many well-nourished cats who stroll through the streets comfortably and unhinderedly.
In the evening you can even see them sleeping on the roofs of parking cars.
The cats like lively places and don't say no to delicacies.
One car rental costs between 37 dollars per day (Hyundai Getz) and 188 dollars (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
The insurance costs an additional 15 dollars a day.
And bike rental costs 15 shekels a day.
Tickets for museums cost an average of 30 shekels.
In figures
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
Most adventurers and recreation seekers came from Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England, the USA and Ukraine.
From January to October 2012, 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists came to the Promised Land, which corresponds to an increase of 51% compared to the comparative period in 2010, prior to the lifting of the visa requirement on February 9, 2011.
"The Great and Powerful" leads to Moscow: Migrants save money for language
While MEPs and citizens are discussing the benefits of the law on mandatory language tests for migrants, criminals are already dealing with counterfeit certificates
Every year 13 million guest workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities of Russia.
Most of them are the citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money for the maintenance of families who remain in their home country.
A law came into force on 1 December, according to which every migrant worker must pass a test certifying the knowledge of the Russian language.
So far, this scheme applies only to migrants who want to work in the services sector, in the municipal housing industry and in the retail trade.
However, the tests will become mandatory for all guest workers over time, according to the Federal Migration Authority.
Not only do you have to take language tests, but you also have to take tests into Russian history and the basics of legislation.
Language skills must be demonstrated for both the receipt and the extension of the work permit.
Exceptions apply only to citizens of countries in which Russian is the official language.
Also excluded from this law are persons who received their certificates and diplomas before the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
Meaning, problem and protection of rights
The total number of examination posts will be under the aegis of the Puschkin Institute for Russian Language, the Russian University of International Friendship, Moscow State University, Saint Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
Migrants can take the tests in all cities; already more than 160 relevant centres have been opened in Russia.
The initiative to launch the tests was supported by the members of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Authority.
On the other hand, before the entry into force of the law in the press, civil rights activists asked the following question several times: what does the whole thing actually mean?
What changes does the requirement to show language skills bring, both for the Russians and for the guest workers?
Above all, responding to speakers from the Migration Authority, it is about reducing the number of forced workers.
"Many are now talking about the protection of the rights of migrant workers," says Viktor Sebelev, Head of the Representation of the Federal Migration Authority in Tajikistan.
However, their rights must already be protected from their departure.
Only organized recruitment will solve the problems of foreign workers to 90%.
Migrants face problems without work, education, language skills and medical evaluation.
Sebelev is convinced that a future migrant without language skills will inevitably meet people with evil intentions who will put him under the pretext of help in a dark, narrow barracks, where he will endure with dozens of his equal months without food and documents and will train him 12 to 14 hours a day.
We reach many complaints from our migrants.
"In your home country, the One is promised to you, and upon arrival you will cheat, get their passports taken off and not receive the promised wage," confirms the head of the Labour Migration Board of the Tajikistan Migration Authority, Tolib Schwaripow.
Don't yell, boss!
Nevertheless, many citizens of the Central Asian republics who want to earn their money in Russia admit that they cannot control not only the language of the target country but can hardly express themselves in writing in their own language.
Of course, this is not so much their fault as the evil: Only a few Turkmen, Usbeken and Tajik can afford even a reasonable primary education.
For in their families there is not even money to feed the children, let alone to buy them decent clothes, shoes and school supplies.
As a teenager, these children immediately take the first opportunity to earn money.
"It is difficult without language skills," they admit.
"You feel humiliated and inferior."
Citizen's lawyers stress the following important aspect of the law.
Only migrants with legal status must pass the test.
If you do not have this status, there is no test and therefore no official work.
Meanwhile, the majority of the guest workers continue to be illegally resident in Russia.
"Welcome" or "No access for unauthorised persons"
Many migrants confirm that it is not easy to obtain official status in Russia.
The reason is bureaucratic obstacles and, of course, the linguistic difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money: 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
A fake registration can be made quickly and only for one and a half thousand.
The Russian police staff know that our documents are mostly forged and we are not registered, and then there are cases of blackmail.
"They want one or two hundred rubles for cigarettes and tea," says Tajikie Umed Huschkadamov to journalists.
"Do not fear the cost of false papers only"
Already on the day the law came into force, it turned out that not only the registration documents of migrants could have been falsified.
Some false certificates certifying the completion of the language test have already been confiscated by employees of the Federal Migration Authority.
The falsified papers were printed with an ordinary color printer.
Of course, the new owners did not receive them for free: every migrant who hoped to save himself the tests paid seven thousand rubles for the document.
This is more than twice as much as the cost of the official test: this costs a migrant worker three thousand rubles.
The fact that the most important immediate task is to protect the system from corruption, so that the certificates cannot be easily purchased, both civil servants and citizens agree.
For the time being, the authorities can only promise guest workers who will pass the test for the first time that they will be given time for a basic language course.
In addition, new arrivals without language skills are offered jobs in areas where active communication with people is not necessary.
Interior Ministry Ignores Illegal Arms Market
Low share of legal weapons in crime
The Russian Ministry of the Interior is planning to tighten up the Arms Act for private arms owners.
The authorities thus react to recent events: Injured at shootings at weddings as well as seven dead at the amok run by Moscow lawyer Dmitri Winogradow.
The police want to ban the carrying of non-lethal weapons in public and raise the age for possession of firearms from 18 to 21 years.
The proposal was supported by the Chairman of the Duma Committee on Security and Corruption, Irina Jarrowaja, and promised that the amendments to the Arms Act will be presented shortly by the Duma.
Not all are satisfied that the Russian authorities want to fight the problems by "drawing the screws".
An open letter was published on the Internet, whose author - representatives of various arms associations - calls on the authorities to refrain from "sinless intensifications".
The percentage of crimes with registered weapons is very low, said the criminal lawyer, Wasilij Lesnikov, the Russian service of the BBC.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, 142 crimes involving the use of registered weapons were committed during six months in 2012, while a total of 1,168 thousand crimes were committed for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that a tightening of the law for private arms owners will not prevent criminals from using themselves in the black market.
Currently, according to the authors, in Moscow any weapon can be found for little money.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of the Interior stresses that the spread of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from the factories to the officers
The weapons reach the black market via several channels.
There are five such main channels, says a former Colonel Viktor Baranez, who worked for ten years in the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot of a website that accepts arms orders
The first channel is the army or the military, i.e. weapons stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were stolen by both the Russian officers and the Caucasians themselves," Baranez says.
On the second channel come illegal weapons that are stolen from criminals' order guards.
Baranez explains that these include weapons stolen from both police arms chambers and directly from law enforcement staff.
Other illegally sold weapons come from military arms camps.
There were frequent explosions in many military camps.
"There is evidence that in some cases it was arson to cover up the lack of weapons," says the former military member.
According to Baranez, weapons manufacturers also contribute to the black market.
"Today, there are countless private armament factories that do not stand up to international competition and therefore throw away the weapons under hand on the black market, for example in Moscow," the expert reports.
Another channel of the black market is smuggling.
Especially many pistols and guns come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is an own, sometimes craftsmanship production and a mafia that organizes the smuggling," explains the former military.
Where did the guns come from?
Experts calculated the proportion of each of the five channels in supplying the black market with illegal weapons.
In 2011, a report was prepared by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Government Administration.
The experts analysed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and the Federal Service for State Statistics, Criminological Literature and publicly available data on arms portals.
According to the investigators, the majority of illegal weapons originate from the army and the judicial authorities.
Half of all the weapons in the black market were there because of the "debt of those responsible for their work with weapons", says the report.
According to the data of the researchers, 17% of the weapons come from conflict zones, 14% from thefts in the production of weapons, and 5% from illegal excavations.
A sales advisor to an arms store who does not want to be mentioned by name assures us that weapons found in illegal excavations have long been bought by no one since they are outdated.
According to him, it is more common for traders to obtain the supply in an arms camp.
A gun, such as a TT-type gun, is bought via a enemy.
The weapon is displayed and handed over through the fence.
"The dealer takes the gun to the city and sells it there for 900 euros per piece with two magazines," he says.
"The police, of course, know everything and, therefore, if they cannot comply with the crime detection plan, periodically carry out control purchases from dealers offering illegal weapons," the sales consultant adds.
"Like in the luxury store"
Buyers and sellers find the most common about acquaintances with each other.
I had looked at websites and blogs when someone came to my attention and suggested that I come to the "Begowaja" station, where a person would wait for me to take me to a certain place, where we could then negotiate the price.
I only learned the price of the gun there
Military commentator Viktor Baranez
"To get a gun, I need a friend who has contacts," says the sales consultant. "I have such a acquaintance, but I don't trust him."
There are dealers in the markets, but you have to go there and meet with a code like "by Ivan Ivanovich, who makes sure that the daughter has lost a tooth".
I am currently even coming to a few punch rings about a friend I trust.
He only gives me the punch rings because he knows I don't give him a hand.
Newbies are looking for guns in different ways.
Former military member Viktor Baranez tried to buy illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he wrote an article on this subject.
The schemes did not change him.
He received a photo album in which "all possible" was pictured.
"I felt like I was in the luxury shop," remembers the military.
According to Baranez, the buyer does not get the cat in the bag, but can try everything.
As a potential customer, I do not just buy, but drive with the seller to the forest, and there we set up a target.
"I can then shoot there, and if I am convinced that the weapon has a good shot, we negotiate with each other," the expert describes the procedure.
Shopping from the sofa
Internet search engines show search results for websites and groups in "Vkontakte", where weapons are offered "for different purposes".
No papers are needed or there are personal meetings.
"You only need the right amount of money", says the advertisement on the website "Buy a pistol or gun".
There, users place your orders and ask questions.
Are they also sold to minors?
"Of course without a license", user asks "Iwan" (literally quote).
"Buy a TT. Moscow", is the laconic request of "Fedorenkow".
The Federal Security Service recently switched on countless fake websites, and buyers who want to acquire weapons go to the network to join the service.
People come like hungry fish when feeding and then land in Siberia and are allowed to scoop coal
Military commentator and former military member Viktor Baranez
I have heard of the following scheme: The website is usually registered abroad, and Russian laws do not apply.
The responsible persons accept the orders.
The buyer transfers the money via a ATM.
"As an answer, he receives a photo and a description of the hidden weapon," reports the press spokesperson of the non-profit organization "Pravo na oryzhie" Dmitrij Kislow.
Viktor Baranez emphasizes that when you place a request on a website you can also go out empty and get behind bars.
The Federal Security Service recently switched on countless fake websites, and buyers who want to acquire weapons go to the network to join the service.
"People come as hungry fish when feeding and then land in the Siberian labour camp and are allowed to scoop coal," he says.
A Makarov for 100 US dollars
According to experts, when buying illegal firearms, prices of between 100 and 900 US dollars are expected.
According to Dmitrij Kislow from the organization "Pravo na oryzhie", you can buy a Makarov gun for 100 to 300 dollars.
You have to wait up to a month and a half.
The weapon is issued in military weapons camps by middle-rangers.
According to the official statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, the number of crimes involving illegal weapons fell by 7% to 22.9 thousand throughout Russia between January and October 2011, while the number of cases of theft and extortion related to weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices fell by 7.8%.
In the US, fast-food and supermarket workers strike
Every fourth American youth is somewhere behind Mc Donald's checkout.
In recent days there have been massive protests throughout the United States against low wages in stores of Walmart and restaurants of popular fast-food chains such as Mc Donald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
No one can yet predict whether the protests will continue to swell or whether they will soon go out again.
The protests are supported by trade unions and several left-wing non-profit organisations.
In addition to raising the modest wages of simple Walmart and fast-food workers, the organizers of the protests pursue the goal of establishing trade unions.
So far, this sector of the economy has hardly been organised in a trade union manner.
46 cents a year?
The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, on so-called Black Friday, where sales took place in the United States, attracting millions of customers, which sometimes led to handcuffs.
On that day, some Walmart employees, of whom there are 2.2 million worldwide, laid down their work and struck off with trade unions and left activists branches of the chain, whose target group is people of low and middle income.
Walmart sells all products, from diapers to hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The product in the Walmart branches is on average between 8 and 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That is why many of the low-paid Walmart workers buy only at their own workplace.
The prices and product range made Walmart one of the largest companies in the USA.
According to critics, Walmart can often sell the goods only because the employees are paid poorly.
The latter also complain about difficult working conditions, such as missing forklifts or hand scanners.
The participants of the protests on "Black Friday" demanded wage increases and expressed their annoyance at the fact that the contribution for the company's own health insurance had increased from 30 to 100 dollars a month.
A typical Walmart employee who earns $9.5 an hour could not afford this increase, they said.
Researchers from the California University in Berkeley prove that if the company increased the average wage to $12 an hour, it would cost Walmart 3.2 billion dollars.
That is about 1.1% more than they are now donating for wages.
If Walmart were to completely turn the salary increases to customers, every purchase would cost them only 46 cents more in the future.
This would be just $12.39 for them per year compared to today's additional expenditure.
Advocates of Walmart are pleased to note that only in nine states there were protests and they did not cause any losses to the company.
The Black Friday lasted the next day in its 8:00 in the evening on Thursday to midnight, and during this period Walmart sold about 5000 articles per second.
In total, Walmart's cash accounts on "Black Friday" carried out almost 100 million transactions.
In an interview on the website of the left-wing Huffington Post, the spokesperson of the company, Dan Fogelman, claimed that "less than five" Walmart employees in total laid down the work and the protest action was only "another PR trick" by the union that organised the protests.
"Free cash!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where their goal, however, was not Walmart's facilities (which are not desirable in this advanced city and are therefore so far inexistent), but were McDonald's and other affordable restaurants.
McDonald's says the company sells billions of portions, and yet you are not given sick days, and you will not be paid for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, New York City Councillor
Currently, the minimum wage under federal and New York legislation is $7.25 an hour.
In fast-food restaurants, the minimum wage is gradually raised, but not too strong, and on average their simple employees in New York get $8.90 an hour.
Less than she deserves no one in this expensive city.
I find it hard to understand how little money can be spent in New York.
There was a time when almost a quarter of all U.S. youths were behind the counter after school at McDonald's, but the young people still lived with their parents.
Almost one saw in it the main source of income or planned to stay there longer.
Now, in interviews with employees of McDonald's, I constantly meet people who complain that they have to pay for this reward and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, there is a comment in the Wall Street Journal forum, whose author notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know how to feed them.
The participants of the protests, which began at 6.30 a.m. on Thursday morning in front of McDonald's on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that the cashiers and chefs of fast-food restaurants receive a minimum wage of $15 an hour, which is more than a doubling of the current minimum wage.
They continued to call for the formation of trade unions in the fast-food sector.
The U.S. law prohibits corporate management from standing in the way of this goal and warning or dismissing union members.
On the other hand, management does not make it easy for them.
The establishment of trade unions in the fast-food sector is also difficult for objective reasons.
The most important reason is the high staff fluctuation.
Unsatisfying
There were loud protests that day also in front of many other fast-food restaurants in Manhattan.
The highlight of the protests was a meeting at noon in front of McDonald's at Times Square, where some local Democrats spoke, including Mayor Jumaane Williams, who said: "McDonald's says it sells billions of portions, and yet you are not given sick days, and you will not be paid for your honest work!"
The demonstrators were also supported by other prominent New York Democrats, for example, mayor candidate Bill De Blasio, who said that "we should support the fast-food employees together so that they can get a fair wage and achieve the economic prosperity that every New Yorker deserves!"
According to the New York Times, this was the largest action of its kind in the history of the American fast food industry.
However, there were only a few hundred people on site, not all of whom work in the fast-food sector, where tens of thousands work in New York.
It is not yet possible whether the spark of these protests will mobilize whole masses.
"The brain can only be moderately surpassed so far"
Recently, the theme of expanded reality, popular with modern technology fans, has usually been perceived by the lens of a special spectacle.
First, Google presented a functioning model at its annual conference in the summer, in November it was announced that Microsoft had also filed a corresponding patent.
However, in conversation with the head of the Group for Interactive 3D Technologies at the Microsoft Laboratory in Cambridge Shahram Izadi, it becomes clear that the glasses were only a transit station for the scientists of the company.
It stimulates the ability to manipulate virtual objects in the air with bare hands and create virtual free space.
- Please briefly describe what research your group is carrying out.
- We are dealing with the interaction of man and machine, but want to expand the limits of this interaction.
So far, mankind has largely remained in the phase of working with pixels on flat screens, which are sometimes also touched.
However, we want to anticipate 5-10 years and anticipate the radical changes of this interaction.
For example, the Xbox consoles and Kinect sensors are progressing, and nowadays no Xbox is sold without Kinect, as everyone is interested in motion control.
- What else awaits us in the future?
- Although Kinect has brought the interaction to a physical level, a lot is still on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information (the system receives more data) could be improved, the output has not yet been decisive.
We are trying to change this, working on real three-dimensional representation systems based on different technologies, including projections.
We need to release the computer world into our physical world and make it more tangible.
However, it is necessary that not only the user, but also his environment be recognized.
Then we could complement the real world much easier with virtual objects.
And first of all, we should get rid of these stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think about language control?
She's popular, but isn't she overrated?
- It is certainly not the ultimate solution, as it raises questions about privacy, because one does not always want to inform all about his actions and intentions.
Actually, any kind of interaction with computers is good, but each in its particular niche.
For example, we worked in the area of control of objects at public places on a project where we experimented with short and short, instead of with exploding gestures.
The gestures were not recorded by the object camera, but by a bracelet that recorded the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is still relatively large, but could theoretically be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
But overall, the future belongs to mixed types of control, such as gesticism and language.
- How's that?
- For example, would you ask me to give you this sprudel case?
They say it and point to it at the same time.
- Normally, I'll just say it.
- Oh, that would be very hard to recognize.
- Does that mean you want the user to adapt to what a machine can and does not afford at the time?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual approach.
I think that in the next few days we will have to work primarily on developing new sensor types that allow people to capture reactions more accurately.
These can be laser sensors, for example, as they offer a good resolution in depth, which is very important.
- What are your demands based on your work with the Xbox Kinect sensors on modern cameras?
Is there a need for resolution, depth or something else?
- The present generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the area of three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, 8 megapixels at a speed of 1000 fps would not be bad.
But the main thing is not the megapixel itself, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
In this way, all current technologies are not good enough for us, as the developers of the algorithms have more work.
It must not only be considered the resolution along the X and Y axis, but also along the Z axis.
The speed and number of images per second are also important.
The movements of man are extremely dynamic and openly said, the present 30 fps are too little especially for gestures.
Stephen Betishes developed a touch sensor in our laboratory in Redmond with a adjustable processing delay between 1 to 100 milliseconds, with today's commercial sensors closer to the second value (60 to 100).
Not everyone understands how much this affects the interaction of man and machine.
For my work, I needed a device just like that, without touch control and with more images per second.
- Shouldn't the number of cameras be increased?
- Kinect currently works with three "cameras", one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the other is a receiver for the reflected signal.
And the third camera is actually an ordinary RGB camera.
It is not used to calculate the depth of the object.
More cameras might solve the problem...
Or reinforce the problem, as more calculations would be necessary.
It would be nice to have a flexible, Kinect-like system where we could play with different camera inclinations to see how this helps us in the three-dimensional determination of a position.
- If I remember correctly, Microsoft, unlike Google, did not present his glasses to the public.
Do you not think that with regard to the application of the technology of expanded reality in everyday life, the glasses have the best prospects?
- Of course, it is not pleasant to always keep a smartphone in the raised hand on the move, but I think this: the most amazing variant would be a "changing" extended reality in which we could switch over a cloud from the glasses to the smartphone,
The glasses are a personal gadget and in them lies their strength (privatees can only see you), but at the same time also their weakness, because an enlarged reality by means of glasses prevents you from working together with others on virtual objects.
- Imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holograms in the air is not only accessible to Tony Stark from Iron Man, but also to normal mortals.
There is a problem that often points to the critic of this idea: there is no sensitive reaction!
The hands don't feel anything!
What answers does your group want to give to this objection?
- In my lectures I often speak of the expanded reality as the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth breakthrough could well be the integration of tactile perception.
An interesting method is currently the use of the second hand as a somewhat unusual projection document.
She perceives pressure excellently!
But there are also technologies that are actually focused on giving the "pictures in the air" something firm, for example, the interference of some directed ultrasound beams in a particular point where the finger is located creates a feeling that is currently as weak as someone breathed over the handballs.
There are also bands for the wrist that affect the nerves in the fingers, also that is a potential direction.
- Have you tried to outsmart the brain?
It makes you think it feels what it should feel when it sees something?
- That's a good idea, so we haven't tried it yet.
Here is another task that we will have to fight with for a long time, namely to let a person who is physically in a closed room believe that he is in an open, practically infinite space instead; here we are working on concepts with treadmills (other than in gyms), mobile platforms and large balls.
So far, the brain can only be moderately overcome, and we still have many years to work.
This is precisely what makes work in the field of virtual reality so attractive for a researcher: on many topics we are only at the beginning.
Own taste instead of culture - rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt continues the project "Petersburger Avantgarde", dedicated to city dwellers who form the avant-garde of art and culture.
Already high-ranking representatives of the Petersburg art scene, whose successes go beyond the borders of the city and who often find recognition in Europe without being known in the rest of Russia, were on the list.
The new hero of Rosbalt is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, the bearer dressed in red, who you can meet at the Russian Museum, sometimes at the summer garden, sometimes at scene meetings or on vernissage.
Wherever the pictures of Kirill Miller are displayed, they attract great crowds.
Kirill Miller is one of the typical Petersburg social-philosophical artists who create new myths.
Kirill Miller is a shining personality of the Petersburg avant-garde at the end of the 1980s and early 1990s.
He is also a man of the city and by his presence on the street he conjures his fellow citizens a smile in the face and gives them a good mood.
Recently he snapped a rotary organ and became a Petersburg film organ player, as he finally felt ready for this difficult role in terms of his artist's existence, his philosophy and his image.
- Kirill, why are you always in red and not in yellow or turquoise in the city?
I chose the color red as a fashion designer that deals with the look and image.
In this world, red is the compromise between artists, image consultants and society.
In society, anything that deviates from the gray standard, triggers aggression and bad behavior.
But I want to talk to people through my provocations.
Each of my previous provocations was an invitation to talk.
- When did you know you had to be a painter?
- At an exhibition in the cultural palace of Newskiy, where my works were exhibited.
I understood I had to go this way.
Then the time of the old free, but not officially recognized painters ended, and new and free painters like me were incomprehensible.
I made friends with the painters of the new generation, i.e. with the representatives of the "Gazonewschina"; it created "Pushkinskaya 10", and then it was only finished.
It draws me to the theatre, to the fashion, to the music, actually to everything, except literature.
And all of this is in your art clinic... it was important for me to be at the centre of the Petersburg culture, where the best creative artists should gather.
In 1995 I occupied a room in Puschkinskaya 10, and there until the renovation work there was a musical-artistic club for the Bohemian Bohemian house.
Many were born there: N.O.M., Tequilajazzz, and I also remember how string with his project "Ucho Van Goga" got there.
Cords and his friends sang simple songs for the play-back, wore tight jerseys, and included today's trendy composer Igor Wdowin.
When the group started to play live, it became "Leningrad".
Trachtenberg moderated many programs before the time of "Halli-Galli".
We gave them Trachtenberg, and it began his great career, but the basics he learned from us.
The gallery "D 137" or the club "Griboedov" also have their origins in the art clinic.
Our employees and regulars went there.
I'm a hero of the last century when culture meant something.
In 2000, there was a survey in the press about the award of "personalities of our city".
I won in the category "Artists of the Year", and so I was at the peak.
It is not easy to work in new times according to old rules; I am a person of truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
Today it is easy to become famous, but culture and popularity are not the same: you can be famous without making a cultural contribution.
- Your work has an unmistakable style.
- Many of my images are real pearls and clearly express the topicality and sharpness of the thoughts.
I will have an exhibition with the theme "The Russian Museum as Clowns".
Clowns are timeless.
I used to be social, but now it hurts and makes me afraid to be that way.
In a clown, it blurs everything and loses its tragedy.
I love the grotesque, and I have grotesque ideas.
For example, let us save the world by providing that everyone has to dress completely.
Now everyone pays attention to the clothes and is oriented to the outside and not to the inside of man.
But maybe you can't give a man's hand, but you should spit in his face.
The deception disappears through the dressing.
- Recently we saw you in the role of the urban film organ player. - A cultural city should have such a hero.
Who if not me?
- Can commercial art be beautiful, too?
- Nowadays, commercial art must be cautious, considerate and flattering.
We see the decay of cultures.
In the past, people formed large groups: the Bohemians loved one and the simple people loved the other.
Now there are micro-communities, and it is difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a one-hundred-dollar note anyone likes.
Now you have to think about who you'll like.
Now every cult star has about 100 followers.
- There are several thousand of Stas Michailow's appearances!
- To him come abandoned women, there the sexual-social sphere plays a role.
For cultural reasons there are 300 people and not 10 thousand, so there is less management, money, and everything is ruined.
I have followers, and the most important thing is not to cheat them and not to destroy what has been achieved.
In my youth, I painted pictures that even hung with a collector in a series of works by Falk and Larionow.
I started with pictures that usually come only at the end of my career.
Today there are often misunderstandings.
It means: spiritual culture and consumer culture.
Consumption has no culture at all, that is something quite different.
I am a person of the past culture and grew up with artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty and rejected money to be able to paint.
That is the culture I am in favour of.
- Kirill, what's missing Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
They say: servants of culture.
But not every one of them can deal with culture.
With the real tsars it was different, because the tsars may not have understood much of culture, but they understood that real experts are necessary.
There are currently good consultants in Moscow.
In Petersburg, we have those who might be experts, but they are being blocked, because there is a need for higher-ranking experts to properly evaluate the first and clear the way for them.
Now only your own taste counts.
The same applies to the Erarta, but with the difference that they honestly say that they do not accept all contemporary art and some painters therefore have to look for other museums.
- What's Petersburg for you?
- Petersburg is not the cultural capital; in Moscow there is much more culture and a corresponding nourishment.
On our stones, art can only grow difficult.
We need a cultural nourishment because, for example, we now have more writers than readers, and that is not right.
There are many curious people in Europe who attend exhibitions or concerts.
That's a lot less for us.
Art must be modern again, as at the beginning of the last century.
The project is financed by grants from the city of St Petersburg
Birth in space
Earth in danger.
Global warming or collision with killer asteroid.
Karawans from spaceships with earthlings on board are looking for a replacement planet.
To save mankind, the important question arises, How can we reproduce in gravity or on the replacement planet?
I do not think there are many choices.
In fact, there are only two real planets that we could at least hypothetically inhabit.
"Mars and Venus," says the scientific assistant of the Astronomical Institute Vladimir Surdin.
However, while the conditions on Mars are comparatively life-friendly, on the surface of Venus there is a temperature of 500 degrees.
Life would only be possible at great height or in the orbit of Venus, that is, in space.
The question of reproduction in space was first addressed by the researchers with regard to the flora.
Already half a century before, experiments with plants were carried out.
The fourth generation of peas bred in orbit did not differ in the least from the earthly species.
It followed the breeding of insects, more precisely of tiny fruit flies (Drosophila), in orbit.
In 1979, watchmen were sent to space to explore the impact of weightlessness on embryonic development.
It develops a quite normal chick.
But then the problem begins.
"The problem is that the chick has to stop; it has to be able to stand on its legs and start moving," explains Vladimir Sychev, head of the laboratory at the Institute for Medical and Biological Problems.
Without solid underground, the chicks crossed wildly.
Ten hours later, the instincts of the newborns subsided completely.
The chicks did not respond to light and loud.
Four days later they simply died.
"Twice we let chicks hatch and then set the whole thing up because it is simply impossible to work with them there," says Vladimir Sychev for the failed experiment with the chicks in space.
The last brood cage with animals flew into the orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in spring 2013.
However, only same-sex species will be found on the biosatellite "Bion".
There was an experiment with rats that were already fertilized into space.
In principle, nothing special was found.
"It was just with the biosatellites, but again it was only a single experiment, and the research has to be continued," says Vladimir Sychew.
After the landing, the space rats became young.
The problem of reproduction directly in space has not yet been solved.
The task is difficult.
Animals torn from their natural habitat simply cannot follow their reproductive drive.
Unlike animals, man could do that in principle.
The homo sapiens are capable of abstract thinking and can create a similar emotional background.
For ethical reasons, such experiments are not carried out.
But women have been flying into space for 50 years.
There was the greatest risk at Tereshkova.
The most valuable thing humanity has is the female organism.
Our gulls flew away, and no one on earth could have answered the following question: Does it survive the space flight?
Will she be able to bring a child to the world after this flight?
"After all, no one answered this question," says space veteran Wachtang Watschnadse.
In June 1964, just one year after her space flight, the first female cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova, gave birth to a daughter.
The father of the child, Andrijan Nikolayev, was also Cosmonaut.
In 1988 the second woman in space, Svetlana Sawizkaja, who was in orbit twice and even worked outside the spacecraft, gave birth to a son.
Nevertheless, a risk remains.
We have only very few cosmonauts, where after long flights everything went well and they got healthy offspring.
"The more dangerous it is even when flying into the orbit," concluded Cosmonaut Waleri Polyakow, a hero of the Soviet Union and a hero of the Russian Federation.
And yet humanity must seek new ways in biotechnology, radiation protection and the production of artificial gravity.
The Hydro Lab in the Cosmonaut Preparation Center is a mandatory station during flight preparation.
Here in a state of suspendedness, the cosmonauts win routine for work in open space.
The water represents the weightlessness.
Even though adults find water to be pleasant, it is a strange environment; yet infants feel water as a natural element.
It is as if the little ichtyander testified to the fact that life on the land descended from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that a child is about 9 months in the belly of the mother in the fruit water, and the fact that it is easier to get used to water.
In principle, it makes sense, as from birth until the first swimming only 2 weeks pass.
"It's too little time to forget something," says baby swim teacher Marina Aksenowa.
So while for a newborn child, weightlessness is a much more natural condition, the woman does not come out without gravity.
In the state of weightlessness, the abdominal and pelvic muscles return enormously quickly and thus also reduces the ability to squeeze out the child.
All right, let's just get around this by means of birth control.
For example, the birth could also take place in a special chamber to blackmail the child.
"But what happens then?" is the not insignificant question of Waleri Polyakow.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without feeling the ground, the organism cannot train the skeleton and the muscles.
A newborn child cannot be put in an orbit like an adult to train in a stress suit.
He will simply lack what is of elementary importance to his life.
"This experiment, which we undertake together, namely the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will lead us to bring about a disabled person, a completely unadapted person," says the director of the Bioethics Commission of the Institute for Medical and Biological Problems RAN, Igor Pestow.
So far, the birth of children in the universe is mere theory.
At some point, however, it will become a reality when earth’s inhabitants break up in their spaceships into a distant planet that will be home to their offspring born in space.
NKÚ Chief: control of the black system fails due to political indebtedness
In the context of public contracts, the Czech Republic has good control bodies and appropriate laws, but falls under their application.
In a conversation for Aktuálně.cz, the Vice-President of the Supreme Control Office (Neavyšší kolminí úřad, NKÚ), Miloslav Kala, says this.
"A law is never perfect, but it has to be properly applied - and this is not, in my opinion, the case with us," Kala comments on the current situation.
A similar result appears to also be a joint control by Czech and German auditors.
As a negative example of practice, he cites the appointment of Prime Minister Petr Nečas to the so-called "black system".
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS would not bother the entrepreneurs with controls - is the system now prohibited or allowed?
"A law must have its validity, and if something is forbidden by law, then the chairman of the government cannot simply come, and the control office, whose duty is now once to control compliance with the law, cannot interfere with its activities," Kala notes.
At the meeting of the Supervisory Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, you spoke about a common Czech-German project comparing the laws of both countries on public contracts.
What was that about in concrete terms?
This is a parallel test, which we started about two years ago.
To put it simply, it is a question of European legislation defining how public contracts can be handled, on which national legislation builds up, and finally there is the actual practical application.
All of this we have compared with each other, and although the examination is not yet complete, we have been able to find very interesting differences. Generally speaking, the laws are perhaps even a bit "stricter and more perfect", but the actual application is better in Germany in some parameters.
This confirms that it is not enough to set up new and more precise rules over and over again, and it is also necessary to deal with the actual application of the law.
How can the project help you? What results from this project?
Such joint control could help us to stop constantly trying to perfect the laws and reduce and eliminate thresholds if this does not seem to have a particularly positive effect.
Economy means acquiring a thing at a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price) and excluding illegal enrichment or even criminal acts.
But lowering thresholds for orders does not guarantee that we will also achieve this goal.
Perhaps it is even the case that in this way we only burden the system with excessive "paperwork", and those looking for gaps in the system have it much easier to exploit the system than if the thresholds remained higher.
They talk about the problems of the practical implementation of the Czech Procurement Act.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there a similar authority to our NKÚ here, or does the system work differently?
As far as the authorities are concerned, the German counterpart to the NKÚ is the Federal Court of Auditors, which is similar to ours and also has a college, which is formed only slightly differently. In principle, however, both authorities work similarly.
The competences are also to a certain extent comparable, but Germany is a state, i.e. that there are these Courts of Auditors also in the individual federal states - in this the German system differs from ours.
The BRH can only control federal funds, which corresponds to our state resources.
Public funds administered by the districts and municipalities are subject to the control of the national accounting offices.
As far as German legislation is concerned, is it simpler than ours?
In general, I would not like to compare this with any specific information. Nevertheless, Germany is often referred to as a model in some respects, but it is certainly not possible to say that Germany is better in all.
Maybe that's because the examiners are better there?
That is not certain, but as I said, I do not like such comparisons.
To this end, it should be noted that those countries that are exemplary to us also have to contend with problems.
Otherwise, they wouldn't have anything from working with our authority, would they?
As far as Czech legislation is concerned, what impact did your authority have on the amendment of the Procurement Act, do you already feel any impact?
In view of the fact that this novel is only in force for a short time, it does not yet have an effect on our tests.
Since our controls are carried out afterwards, we have to expect a certain delay here.
We feel effects so far rather during the preparation phase of future controls - so we have introduced the new control instrument "Detection of risks of uneconomicity" and examined and analysed with this almost 14,000 public contracts - here the changes will of course have an impact, as the thresholds have changed, the conditions for certain types of tenders have been modified, among others.
Do you see the adoption of this law rather positive, or is the system being burdened with further bureaucracy?
I think that this law is certainly a step in the right direction and I hope that this adoption is confirmed.
However, the problem may arise that the rules become "stricter" and can no longer be complied with.
Under the previous rules, the persons subject to an audit shall be accountable to the institution (for example, in the case of an operational programme of regional policy, the Regional Council) that any non-compliance with the law on the award of contracts is equivalent to an infringement of budgetary discipline.
But does it make sense to make the law even stricter?
I don't think so.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse the system and not punish those who have made a form mistake that does not affect actual decision-making.
Such a system simply puts the bureaucracy under even greater pressure.
Where's the way out of here?
First of all, let's say which path is not effective.
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS would not help entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called "black system" - what exactly does that mean?
Is the black system now prohibited or allowed?
A law must have its validity, and if something is forbidden by law, then it cannot simply come to the chairman of the government, and the control office, whose duty is now once to control compliance with the law, hinders its activity.
He can say, "We change the law and allow the thing," but he cannot say that we do as if nothing were.
The Procurement Act contains relatively strict rules on the formal conduct of certain operations - and that is also right for the protection of public competition.
On the other hand, it is also tragic if the bidder is excluded with the best offer only due to form errors.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be properly applied - and that is what I think is missing.
On the streets there is isolated ice sheets, but mostly they are dry.
On the streets of the Czech Republic there is partly snow and ice.
Most of the roads, however, are well accessible, sometimes increased caution is needed.
KaribaKarlsbad
In the district of Karlovy Vary the streets were well accessible this morning, isolated snow and ice smoothness prevailed.
The temperatures dropped to -5 to -10 °C, it should get a little warmer during the day.
In the region it no longer snows, and in the lower altitudes only a thin snow cover remains.
On the combs of the Erzgebirge, however, there are about 30 cm of snow.
According to the district road guard, there was a limited view because of fog.
The R6 motorway and the first-class roads in the region are currently fully accessible.
However, attention should be paid, for example, to bridges on which the roads are sometimes required and smooth.
All roads of the second and third road classes, including the mountain roads, are equally traversable.
On these roads, however, the snow remains partially required or exhausted.
Increased attention is therefore needed especially in the higher layers.
Districts Pardubice and Hradec Králové
On some streets of East Bohemia there is danger because of ice glaciers, in higher locations and in the mountains there is sometimes an extended snow layer on the roads, the road and highway management communicates on their websites.
Street champions warn drivers against ice leveling, which can occur especially in higher locations in the district of Pardubice.
In particular, the second and third-class roads in the districts of Lanškroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavy and Vysoké Mýto can be found on ice.
Roads I/43 and I/34 at Svitavy are chemically treated.
Snow is especially located on the roads in the Giant Mountains and in the Orlické hory Mountains.
An extended snow layer lies on the streets of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov.
In eastern Bohemia today it is mostly sunny or cheerful, and it remains largely free of precipitation.
The temperatures move between -3 and +1 °C, it blows a weak wind.
Pilsen County
The streets in the Pilsen district are well accessible today, but local attention is needed, and the way to travel is adapted to the weather.
This is frosty in the morning, with temperatures between 3 and 9 degrees below freezing.
Since it has snowed before and the temperatures subsequently fell, it can come to ice plains on the streets.
Locally, fog is also expected, but the view will improve during the day.
This information comes from the district road championships.
The D5 motorway is practically fully accessible, but increased attention is recommended by the road championships between 80 and 131 km.
The first-class roads are mostly dry but frozen.
In the south of the Pilsen and Tachov districts, however, ice smoothing can occur.
The roads of the second and third road classes are wet, and therefore the reference to possible required sections is also applicable here.
Drivers should be particularly careful on the less frequent roads in the Bohemian forest area.
District of Olomouc
Today, snow has to be reckoned with by riders heading towards the altitudes in the Olomouc district.
After the use of scattered vehicles, snow is left on the pass Červenohorské sedlo and on the road towards Videlský kříž.
Nightly snow driving forced the road championships to use, in Šumperk County about 3 cm of new snow fell according to the road administration.
In the other areas of the district, the highways are usually fully accessible.
"In the Šumperk district, snow remains in the altitudes.
On the pass Červenohorské sedlo, the drivers have to expect snow on the road towards Jeseník," said an employee of the road administration Šumperk today to the agency ČTK.
Her colleagues in the Jeseník district also had to go out at night, according to their reports, the streets are free and wet to the heights after chemical treatment.
In the area of Olomouc the roads are fully accessible, but in the district of Šternberk the drivers have to drive carefully in forest sections, because the roads are still wet.
Ústí nad Labem District, Liberec District
In northern Bohemia, the road championships report several bad sections of the road.
In addition to several places with snow or ice, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice is blocked in the district of Ústí n.K. according to the traffic police.
The temperatures also remain below zero in deeper positions, so that snow and ice will stay on the streets. From the deep plains, especially southeast of the Bohemian middle mountains, however, no problems are reported, and the roads are usually dry there.
No traffic disruptions have been reported so far.
Ice smoothing is reported in particular from the perimeter of Štětí.
According to meteorologists there were ideal conditions for this at night - during the day rain and melting snow, during the night cloudless sky and frost.
Bad traffic conditions are reported from the main routes and from road I/13 at the border of the districts of Ústí n.L. and Liberec.
The blockage of the road between Telnice and Knínice was required due to branches pressed from the snow load to the roadway.
Šimon Ornest: At our concerts we want to gather positive energy
What do you think will happen in less than a month of the end of the world?
This is one of those disaster reports that we people are so eager to get started on.
With our band The Tap Tap, we are more fun about it and say that we are the only band in the world that can accumulate enough positive energy to stop or prevent the end of the world.
In December you will also realize a unique project with three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you introduce the project to our readers?
This is a nationwide benefit event that we have been planning for two years.
For this we want to take advantage of the marketing potential of the Mayan calendar, which is forecast for the end of December 21st at 11:10 a.m.
On the day before, i.e. 20 December, three concerts will take place in Prague, Brno and Ostrava at the same time from 21:00.
The end of the concerts should be about at the time when the Maya calendar ends on the Pacific island of Kiribati, which lies in a time zone about 12 hours ahead of us.
Who gave this idea?
Originally probably from me, then we designed the idea together with our graphic artist Honza Augusta.
Not only do we want to gather enough positive energy to prevent the end of the world, but we also want to think together with the public about the state in which we will hand over this world to our children.
At the end of the Mayan calendar, we also developed a unique collection of shoes, T-shirts, bags and keychains against the end of the world, with which people can also support us through www.e-tap.cz.
The band The Tap Tap, together with other performers, has also recorded the so-called anthem against the end of the world with the title "Walkdown Falls Off".
Even today, the anthem on YouTube is very popular. Will it also sound like the benefit concerts?
Of course, in the end, provided that everything works out and the end of the world does not take place...
The anthem is to be sung by all performers at all three concerts at the same time.
In addition, the anthems are transmitted live together in a direct circuit from Czech television.
The text of the anthem comes from Tomáš Hanák, who also plays the main character of Jesus in the video clip, Xindl X also sings with...
How did you get to work with both of them?
We also cooperate with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, which is linked to the fact that we realize many benefit events and concerts...
We strive to involve these people intensively in our projects.
This has shown that most people are interested in working with us and have fun.
What purpose is served by the proceeds of the concerts against the end of the world?
For the establishment of the barrier-free education centre Studeo, on which we have been working for six years together with the association Tap at the Jedlička-Institut.
The students of the Jedlička Institute are regularly supervised by lecturers who help them with different leisure activities.
Since the students themselves do not have the means to visit the lecturers, we would like to help them in this way.
As part of the completion of the Jedlička Institute, a building of our own will be built, into which we will then move with this project.
At each concert, several groups and performers appear.
What criteria did you select these?
We wanted to put together a program that all generations, including children, are addressing.
In Prague, for example, Chinaski, Lesbiens support, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Searchý occur.
You can find out more on the website www.kpks.cz.
Are similar "big events" also planned for the future?
In May we perform for the first time at Prague Spring, and also for this concert we prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year we would also like to perform in the Czech House in New York, and I personally - if we are already in the USA - would like to associate this with performances in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are not very small, so far you have been in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
However, The Tap Tap is a group composed of people with disabilities.
How do you manage these trips logistically and organizationally?
It is not as bad as it appears at first glance.
Five of our members are wheelchairs, i.e. the wheelchairs must be carried in the luggage compartment. We also have to take with us many instrument bags and other luggage...
Nevertheless, it has always worked out without problems so far, ČSA and British Airways were always very well prepared for us, that I have sometimes already wondered.
Even in Moscow, where we were recently, there were no problems.
Through your travel abroad, you have a comparison of how accessibility in each country looks like, how to deal with disabled people, etc.
How have you experienced these things so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities where everything works better than with us, we were just in Russia witnessing that everything in the East is still in its beginnings.
Moscow is absolutely not disabled compared to Prague. There it is still unusual if someone in the wheelchair is travelling alone in the city centre.
It is not even obvious that a wheelchair driver is given in the elevator, for example.
Fortunately, there are also associations that try to point out the problems of people with disabilities.
And in what way do we have to catch up with the more developed countries?
There's still a lot of things we're hanging out with...
It should be noted, however, that improving the situation is always dependent on the efforts of those affected.
In London and Madrid it is absolutely common that people with severe disabilities can move independently in public space, go to the museum, use toilets, etc.
But it is not common for a larger group of disabled people to be actively involved in social events there, we are a bit ahead of the West with the band The Tap Tap!
Respect for the public and accessibility is one thing, but only when important athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers come from our ranks will things really start to change.
So far, these are only isolated cases of particularly willful personalities.
The Tap Tap is currently very popular. But if we go back a few years: What motivated you to start a band in 1998?
At that time, I started as a caretaker at the Jedlička Institute, where I met many young people who were interested in dealing with something intense.
And since I am a musician myself and play saxophone, among other things, I have founded a music AG together with a colleague.
Well, and in time, that's how our moderator, Lá‰a Angelovič, used to say something out of control (laughs).
But the band has only become known in recent years, or am I mistaken?
It is true that cooperation with well-known singers has helped us; we have also started actively promoting ourselves.
We have become aware that if you do something and cannot see it outwards, your own performance does not exist in some sense.
Thanks to the EU funding, we can also provide good lecturers, high-quality equipment and so on.
Was it your goal to bring it this far with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I have felt the potential that things can be handled differently.
In the show business one often copies the other today.
This is logical in its way, since everything new is considered with caution and only accepted after a long time.
There are only a few really unique things, and I dare to claim that Tap Tap belongs to it.
The first impression that the viewer usually has is of course compassion; that's only natural...
But this compassion is absolutely superfluous, because people with disabilities are not lonely and abandoned beings that we should regret.
It is people who live a full life and can develop as long as they have the means to do so.
I always say that when people with disabilities succeed, this is not only a progress for them, but for the whole society.
Was it also helpful for this success that you are a strict boss, as you hear from many people?
If you want to do something good, you can't compromise in many things and you have to ask for a certain discipline.
In my opinion, however, this is perfectly normal.
Some come to us with romantic ideas, and when they find out that they have twice a week's rehearsal, have to complete preparatory phases and spend a lot of time on concert trips, then the enthusiasm quickly goes out for many.
But that's how it works everywhere, in every band that wants to work seriously and achieve something.
Currently, The Tap Tap has twenty members.
How many of these were there since the beginning, i.e. since 1998?
Only one: Lá‰a Angelovič.
We're an open group, people come and go, you can't stop it.
Whoever has the will and the desire to participate is always welcome with us.
Takes place on the day before the forecast global downfall, Thursday, December 20th, 2012 at 21 a.m.
The venues are: Incheba-Arena/Prag, Fléda/Brno and Plynojem/Ostrava; 12 Czech bands and other musicians
All three venues are finally connected by live recording and there is a joint interpretation of the anthem "The Tap Tap's World Fallout" by the band The Tap Tap.
The aim of the concert is to allocate funds for the provision of a multifunctional disabled education centre, which is to be created under the name STUDEO at the Jedlička Institute in Prague. Cost point: CZK 25 million
Admission costs 400 CZK, children up to 12 years free of charge, tickets are available on pre-sale at Bohemia ticket.
Poland and space.
Last week, at a Council of Ministers meeting of the Member States of the European Space Agency (ESA), Poland was admitted as the 20th member of this Space Agency. Poland is thus the second member country from the former Eastern bloc (after the Czech Republic, which became an ESA member on 12 November 2008.
Poland began close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and participated in several ESA projects in the following years.
Poland's path to space, of course, began much earlier.
Even before the Second World War, Polish cosmo enthusiasts were concerned with space travel, and they did not always meet with understanding.
I recall, for example, the lecture by A. Šternfeld on 6 December 1933 at the Warsaw Observatory, in which the author presented thoughts from his pioneering work "Entrance to Cosmonautics".
However, the ideas of the young engineer (b. 1905) left the audience cold, and after years Šternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski had shown interest in his work.
Šternfeld won the Prix REP-Hirsch sponsored by Robert Esnaut-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch in 1934 for "Entrance to Cosmonautics".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became an important advocate of astronomy and space travel.
In Polish magazines he published hundreds of articles and wrote several books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski's worldwide recognized contribution to the development of space travel was appreciated, among other things, by the fact that one of the craters was named after him on the earth-facing side of the moon.
Already in 1925 a railway draisine was built in Poland for which a rocket drive was planned.
Unfortunately, the author of the draft and the details of this project remained unknown.
It is not even clear whether the rocket should be used to start or brake the Draisine.
The information to this effect comes exclusively from the contemporary press.
In 1933, the Polish infantry began to deal with rocket-powered shots.
The research led the Institute Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi.
The documents submitted show that research has progressed to the stage of practical testing.
The research was then, of course, interrupted by the invasion of the German Wehrmacht.
In 1937, a photoelectric hunting kite was designed by Ing. Rohoziński in the press, and the following year the work "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" by the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocky appeared.
Both projects dealt with the military use of the rocket drive.
Shortly before the war, all projects for military use of rocket technology were coordinated by the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Doradczo-Naukovy Committee).
The committee was set up in 1937, but after two years of work his work was completed from the start of the war.
Further articles on space travel appeared after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Space Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne) in the Polish press.
The first mention of this society is made in 1954 in the November issue of the magazine Problemy, in which four extensive articles of space travel are dedicated.
The article by Prof. M. Subotowicz contains the proposal for the creation of a space company.
At the time, there were already the first satellite technology projects, and it was to be avoided that the exploration of space would have a future.
As early as 1956, the Polish space company PTA tried to join the International Space Federation, founded in 1951, and in fact, PTA became a regular member in the autumn of 1956.
The following year, the first PTA chairman, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), was appointed Vice-Chairman of the International Space Federation.
He held this office until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA has played a major role in the development of the most successful meteorological rocket (Rakieta Meteorologicczna), the first Polish rocket for scientific research.
The first type, the RM-1, was completed in 1957, the first start took place on October 10, 1958.
The rocket with a maximum flight height of 1800 m was about 80 cm long and did not weigh 5 kg.
Later, an improved version, the RM-1A, was built, and in 1959, flight tests began in the Błędów desert with the two-stage RM-2 rocket.
The rocket was 1.4 m long and weighed about 11.5 kg.
Another level of development should already be able to do real scientific work - the RM-34 rocket should reach an altitude of up to 14.5 km and be used for the observation of high winds.
In 1962, however, the further development was discontinued.
The first RM rocket was replaced by the Meteor-1 rocket developed between 1962 and 1965.
The rocket was designed as a two-stage rocket, its overall length was 510 cm and its initial weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types of rocket were developed (Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), which differed in the size of the transport space for scientific instruments.
The Meteor-1A rocket has a transport space with a capacity of 0.4 litres, Meteor-1B has a capacity of 0.34 litres and Meteor-1C has a capacity of 0.62 litres.
The maximum altitude for all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Meteor 2 rockets were developed at the Aeronautical Institute, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.
Meteor-2 had a starting weight of 380 kg and was able to transport a payload of 10 kg to an altitude of about 60 km.
The Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were then built.
It is also worth mentioning the accession of Poland to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960, on which two years later followed the establishment of a national COSPAR committee.
Poland also participated in space research with Soviet satellites as part of the Interkosmos programme, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became second intercosmonaut after the Czech Vladimir Remek.
The repeal of the Law on Non-Proliferation is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court lifted the Law on Non-Proliferation.
This decision raised a lively public debate.
It is certainly interesting to look at the problem from a broader perspective.
Liberal economic systems in the EU and in the globalised world are based on the principle of unregulated economic competition.
In the end, this means that the individual economies are in permanent conflict with each other.
The reason for this is the principle of free trade and the free, unrestricted movement of private capital, which goes hand in hand with unbridled financial speculation.
Because of the large differences in the value of labour (wages) there are price tensions.
This term is understood as meaning a condition in which the manufacturer tries to remain in economic competition by importing cheap goods by "undercutting" competition in order to break down a larger market share and increase its profits.
On a large scale, this means for most companies to move their production abroad or to purchase cheaply there, or to give up their business.
Since private capital bears no social responsibility and therefore no responsibility for the unemployment caused by it, public expenditure necessarily increases.
This situation is further strengthened by the fact that the employers are absolutely unwilling to pay their taxes and thereby replace the overall social and economic damage caused by them.
This situation is generally known, so that specific statistics are unnecessary at this point.
The reckless practice of private capital creates in individual economies a situation in which governments are forced to compete with each other in order to artificially reduce the social level of their own population and thus attract foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments provide private capital to their own people without regard to the social consequences.
This is expressed in particular in amendments to applicable laws.
The aim of these measures is to force their own people to accept the dictates of private capital, especially in the wage field.
This is done, on the one hand, by economic constraints on long-term unemployment, and, on the other hand, by the curtailment of workers' rights.
The result is growing poverty, as well as increasing differences between the poor and the rich.
In Germany there have been public food tax offices for poor people for several years, who are no longer able to feed themselves through their own work.
The number of people affected is already in the millions.
As a result of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, there are regular cases in which workers receive such a low wage that the state has to raise its income to a minimum.
Such a scandal was also revealed in the case of auxiliary workers employed in the German Bundestag.
The austerity measures of virtually all EU-South countries will undoubtedly lead to the same situation in which people are forced to emigrate (as was the case in the 19th century) under the pressure of a catastrophic collapse of their social level, or to promote a wage for hunger on the edge of society, hoping that someday private investment will flow into the country.
Here, of course, is the question of where this capital comes from?
When it comes from another EU country, only poverty migrates from one country to another; or capital remains completely absent, because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco, Egypt and Africa at all, employees work for a fraction of European wages.
This is true of all Latin America.
Liberal theories and media claim that the state must not participate with capital in its own economy and that planning economy leads to an economic disaster.
Private capital insists on its view that the State must not intervene in the economy.
But then one has to ask whether private capital does not influence or even direct politics and thus the whole state in its own selfish sense.
Here's the clear answer: Yes.
The proof of this is the existence of a practically omnipotent lobby in all states.
The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, mutual advantage, legislation in which practically everything is desirable, but nothing is punishable.
In Germany, the situation is that a Ministry of State does not have the financial resources to direct private legal entities, which are closely linked to the industry, to draft legislation.
These draft laws will then be adopted in the Bundestag.
All violence is no longer based on the people, as the Western constitutions proclaim, but on strong financial groups who prefer their own interests.
Apparently, liberal democracies are now quickly in a situation as they describe Appian in his work on the crisis of the Roman Republic at the time of Caesar and Pompey: "The state has long been in disrepair, and the offices have been filled with violence.
Against lubricating money, by unlawful engulfment of advantages or with stone and sword.
Corruption grew unbridled, and the people went to the elections with already bought voices" ... "People with character did not apply for offices, so that the state did not have a consul for eight months as a result of this downfall" ... "You really began to talk about the fact that the only medicine in this difficult situation was a single rule, and that a strong man had to be elected"... Appian thought of Pompey, but the strong man was finally Caesar, who permanently replaced democracy with sole rule.
As we can see, today’s society, as well as in antiquity, is founded on the reckless preference of its own advantage, without paying attention to societal interests.
Private capital, by its very nature, is not in a position to recognise and enforce the advantage for the whole of society.
The result, as it was at the time, is an unprecedented decadence of the elites, who are not at all concerned with deeper reforms.
The cause of fascism and communism must therefore be sought in the reckless liberalisation of economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
From today's point of view, the decline of these regimes in favour of liberal democracies can be seen as a certain break, during which the next round is already taking place.
Especially disastrous is the fact that today's elites face the potential losses of hundreds of thousands of lives, the humanitarian and social disasters of which we are already witnesses today, as well as the crimes against humanity, as we know them from older and newer history, in complete ignorance.
The repeal of the Law on Non-Proliferation is not a solution here, at least not a permanent one.
Under the pressure of global and European economic competition, the Czech Republic will be forced to continue looking for ways to push down the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore system-related.
The only solution is targeted political-social reforms that increase state participation in the economy, increase the influence of citizens on the government and weaken the monopoly of private capital in society in favour of the state.
Israel: Laboratory of Chaos.
"...that nothing arises from violence, or could ever arise," sings Sting in the song Fragile, whose most important verse in the chorus is: "...that we may not forget how fragile we are" .
"If my sons didn't want war, there wouldn't be," says the dying Gutel Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, in 1849.
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, there were, as always, a number of reactions.
The one stands behind Israel and argues with his right to self-defense while calling the Palestinians terrorists; the other, in turn, supports the Palestinians, argues with the racism of the Israeli state, with the genocide committed against the Palestinian Arabs, and calls the State of Israel terrorist.
I do not want to write at this point about who is guilty and who is the victim in these recurring waves of killing; ultimately, today's inhabitants of Israel, including the self-government areas, were born into the current political situation and have not experienced the beginning of violence itself.
It's about opening the readers' eyes behind the scenes, looking at who the 95 years of tension (calculated from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) are especially useful in the small spot country in the Middle East.
My thoughts are partly based on accessible historical facts, others are derived from them, and stem from my own understanding of who or what group of people is significantly influencing the events of modern history.
The history of mankind is primarily a history of the struggle for power.
In every era, we can make up an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is less obvious is whether it was really always these personalities themselves who determined their steps autonomously, or whether behind their throne was someone who directed their actions towards a predestined goal.
We must acknowledge that we are living in a time when the wealth of the world is concentrated in the hands of fewer individuals, and that this concentration of money and the resulting power has not arisen within the span of a generation.
Among these astronomically rich families, a special one that could be described as the head of the crow (I don't know if anyone is standing above them, but I won't shut it off) - the Rothschilds.
A lot is not written about them.
Understandably.
The first press agency (Reuters) was bought by the Rothschilds already in the 90s of the 19th century to prevent the connection of their name with highly criminal acts, in the background of which always stood the strengthening of their power, the increase of their wealth or both.
The Rothschilds are involved in almost all the central banks of the world, and against the countries in which they are not involved in the central banks they wage wars or prepare for them (before the attack on Afghanistan there were 7 countries, after the attack on Iraq there were 5 countries, after the fall of Ghaddafi only four remained, while Russia in the meantime submitted its central bank to the Russian government).
Whoever tried to oppose this family had to pay for it with his life.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of Rothschild's Bank of America as a central bank, began during the Civil War to issue his own bank notes and was murdered in 1865 in a theater.
J.F. Kennedy began to issue his own banknotes and wanted to abolish the FED - he was murdered in 1963; member Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after he tried to sue the FED for triggering the world economic crisis in 1929.
In the years 1859 - 1871, Rothschild's global desire for power led to the formulation of a plan for the detachment of three world wars by Albert Pik, a Freemason of the 33rd and thus the highest degree of knowledge.
The first war was aimed at eliminating the great monarchist powers of Europe, the second war was to break the colonial rule of Britain in particular, and the third war was to reduce the world population to about 0.5 - 1 billion people (such a number would provide their comforts and their luxury and would not consume so many resources), create a universal religion (Ecumenism is nothing more than the forerun) and eventually lead to the takeover of absolute power.
The method by which the group of the richest families works with the Rothschilds is the trigger of a crisis and the subsequent offer of a solution (order from chaos - order from chaos).
However, these solutions are wrong and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see the founding of the FED, so that crises such as those triggered by them in 1907 do not recur).
After they had succeeded in triggering the First World War through the murder of Habsburg Throne Successor Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed the Russian tsar kingdom by the revolution of the Bolsheviks.
The First World War ended with the sudden, military and economically unwarranted capitulation of Germany (for the destruction of the Russian tsar empire the war was no longer necessary), then the dissolution of the Central European Great Power of Austria-Hungary took place.
In order to make the Second World War easier, the banks created a latent conflict situation through politics by covering Germany with gigantic war repairs, thereby creating the condition of impoverished masses, so that they only had to cheer up a sufficiently strong leader who offered the guilty and simple solutions; another factor was the creation of the multi-ethnic state of Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, who was to take the function of a fifth column and also took over to relieve the war fire.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschild initiated the establishment of the Zionist movement, in which a branch sought to establish a Jewish state, as far as possible in the historical territory of Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour declaration mentioned above created the condition for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine; there were first clashes with the indigenous Arab population.
There were terrorist attacks on both sides.
The Second World War broke out, and whether Hitler broke free from the chain on which the international bankers had initially held him, or whether everything was going according to plan, is difficult to estimate, in any case the suffering of the European Jews in the concentration camps created the condition for the recognition of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was founded in 1948, and just as the war repairs against Germany prepared the ground for the Second World War, so the proclamation of the State of Israel represents the creation of the focal point for the Third World War.
If the international bankers succeed in unleashing this war, the Jewish people will be victims in the front line of battle, this time together with the Arab or Muslim population of the Middle East, as in World War II.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of strife and chaos, not only in the country itself, but also internationally (just think about how strongly the people are divided into supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is the culprit and who is the victim in the conflict between Palestinians and Israelis, where injustice only causes injustice in an endless spiral of violence, with in the beginning the greed of individuals and their striving for global power standing?
One has to distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and their leaders here, but the international bankers in Israel, as well as with us, the people, only choose their own candidates.
The current Prime Minister of Israel, the Falk of Netanyahu, is a typical example of a fascist politician loyal to international banks, who is doing everything in his power to unleash a war with Iran, who, in view of Iran's membership in the Shanghai Organisation for Cooperation (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), could quickly develop into a global conflict, and in that, because of Iran's control over the only 2 miles wide street of Hormuz, which runs across 20% of global oil supplies, could lead to a destruction of the world economy.
In what light do the words of David Rockefeller from 1994 appear: "The only thing we need is an all-encompassing crisis, and people will welcome the new world order."
In their vision, the new world order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the human population serves a small group of financial aristocrats.
A world in which every newborn is implanted at birth a chip to subject this being to total control.
"And it makes the little ones and the great ones, the rich and the poor, the free and the servants all give themselves a sign to their right hand or to their foreheads, that no one can buy or sell, because he has the sign, namely the name of the animal or the number of his name.
Here is wisdom! He who has understanding, he who is contemplating the number of the animal.
For there is a man's number, and his number is six hundred sixty-six."
The movie Argo: If it's the worst thing to call Hollywood
In November 1979, a mob of protesting Islamist students occupied the US Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats as hostages.
For their release, they demanded the extradition of the overthrown Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who had fled to the United States after the revolution, who had kept the patronage of his regime for decades.
There was no positive way out of this situation for the American government - it could not afford to throw the Shah overboard, as this would have seriously damaged the trust of its allies in other countries.
At the same time, she was unable to enforce the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution led to the establishment of a theocratic regime.
It was a severe blow to the reputation of the United States, and the subsequent failure in the violent attempt to liberate hostages only made everything worse.
The captured diplomats were finally released after 444 days after negotiations had been mediated by the Algerian government.
The fate of the hostages evoked at home a wave of solidarity as well as anti-Iranian moods.
The debacle in Iran contributed significantly to Jimmy Carter's defeat against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential elections.
The film Argo by director and actor Ben Affleck describes an episode of this story that gave the United States a small partial victory.
Immediately before the occupation of the message, six ambassadors managed to escape.
It ended after numerous complications in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities, managed to bring the refugees from Iran, helping them to cover up their true identity – they traveled with Canadian passports disguised as members of a film staff who allegedly visited film locations in the country for a science fiction film.
Combination of genres
The plan developed by the expert for "Exfiltration", Tony Mendez, also required the collaboration of Hollywood.
In order to make the cover credible, articles about this film project appeared in specialist journals, press conferences were held, and the fictitious production company had a real office.
The details of this operation have been kept secret for a long time, and the film is based on Tony Mendez's memories.
Affleck's film is a special combination of several film genres.
On the one hand he is a realistic political thriller, but at the same time also a so-called "caper movie", i.e. the history of a successful piece of housekeepers such as the movie Ocean's Eleven.
This changes the mood levels in the film - on the one hand the documentary scenes from Tehran (in the title sequence iconic contemporary photographs are shown, and also in the film version of the same situations there are no big differences).
On the other hand, the loose passages from Hollywood, which come ironically and slightly out of focus.
And then there are the scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions - men in suits at the conference table, on the halls, on the telephone...
Ben Affleck has succeeded in a remarkable relaunch of his career with this film.
From a smiling actor has become a respectable director, and also as an actor he is no longer the goal of ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film after the crime No children's play (Gone Baby Gone, 2007) and the thriller city without mercy (2010).
At the same time, it's Affleck's first film that doesn't play in the director's native Boston.
The feeling for the atmosphere of the place was one of the characteristics of this director's previous films from the Hollywood standard.
Affleck also proves this feeling in Argo, where Tehran is "played" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film play in the streets and show the reconstruction of events that have really taken place - the entrance sequence of the amazement of the message is very impressive in its clarity, and nevertheless conveys the feeling of confusion and unpredictableness that occurs when the story moves somewhere.
Affleck has a similar effect with his team even in fictional scenes (the false film staff on a bazaar in Tehran).
Too much action in too many places
The director also had to deal with the fact that the story does not actually offer many exciting scenes in the cinematic sense.
With the few, however, he works quite successfully, sometimes helping the reality a little - which then does not always seem so elegant (the scenes in which the impending crisis at the airport in Tehran is averted by a telephone call in America, or also the persecution hunt on the runway, seem somewhat artificial).
The weakness of Argo is its far too wide spread, which is due to the need to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in their roles as Hollywood employees, but their characters would have earned more space, so they are not alone in the film.
Affleck’s film loses a bit of traction. It is a film that can be watched with some interest and the design and the retro-style, reminiscent of a thriller from the 70th century.
However, he only stirs up enthusiasm.
However, as a reminder of a piece of history still living in a certain way to this day, and as proof of how exaggerated the notions of the omnipotent and all-knowing secret services are, it is sufficient.
Guidelines for the inflating of balloons, bananas and circuses
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which annually calls for a survey on the most absurd bank charges, has decided this year to organise the competition "The most absurd regulation or idea from the EU workshop".
"This idea was inspired by the recent EU plan to introduce a 40% female rate in the management of large European companies," said Patrik Nacher, who is responsible for organising this survey, in front of the Právo newspaper.
Among the nominees are, for example, the judgment of the European Court of Justice on the harmonization of insurance rates for men and women.
Until then, women enjoyed an advantage in life insurance because they objectively pose a lower risk to insurance companies.
"More incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be nominated by the end of this year.
The actual vote will then take place by the end of February 2013", Nacher informed.
Among the controversial EU regulations are the mandatory blending of bioethanol into fuels which are inherently harmful, the prohibition of reliable mercury thermometers only because they contain a relatively small amount of this dangerous substance, or also the directive on the size of chicken cages, which became significantly more expensive this year.
Criticism has in the past also reaped the actual ban on the use of the term "butter spread" or the ban on the sale of traditional light bulbs.
Bananas must be 14 cm long
The EU apparatus often decides under the pressure of this or that lobby from commerce and industry, whose demands are usually represented in Brussels by one or more member countries (the Czech Republic is currently trying to enforce the Czech banks' demands, for example, with the threat of veto).
Lobby interests also contributed to the fact that bananas of the highest commercial class in the EU must be at least 14 cm long and must not have "crushing anomalies".
In doing so, the European Commission defended itself by arguing that it merely harmonises the differing national standards which would hinder trade.
The EU's standards on fruit and vegetables have already been refuted by the opposition of some countries, indicating that the current directives would lead to a waste of food.
A candidate for victory in this survey may be the EU regulation of last year, which, according to balloons, must be given the indication that children under the age of eight must not inflate the balloon without the supervision of an adult.
The EU called for an American study which, according to balloons, is the leading cause of child suffocation.
A similar restriction already applies to children up to 14 years of age in the use of annual market streets.
Curiosity There are also ideas at home
Relatively absurd is also a directive that concerns European officials themselves - anyone who takes on an official role in the EU must not use the name Macedonia because of the sensitivity of the issue to Greece and must instead say FYROM (Former Yugoslavian Republic of Macedonia).
The Bankovnípoplatky.com server nominated, in cooperation with the Association of Liberal Economists Laissez Faire, in addition to the above-mentioned absurdities, the EU Regulation on the volume of food stocks in a Member State.
The EU thus established the maximum volume of food stocks that could be found on the day of our accession to the EU in the Czech Republic.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the fixed volume for canned mushrooms, which threatened us with a high fine.
The organisers of the survey were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should receive money for not having the sea, or for the idea of providing funding for applications for funding.
These ideas were, of course, not from Brussels, but from Prague.
"We are disadvantaged by the fact that we have no sea.
We will apply for a refund from the EU," said Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) Minister for Agriculture in autumn 2004.
As an argument, he argued that the cereal harvest had been very high and the state stocks had been overcrowded as a result of the so-called intervention purchases.
As the Czech Republic has another way to seaports, according to Palas, the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
Finally, the European Commission met the Czech Republic to the extent that it organised an invitation to tender for the purchase of cereals from countries that do not have access to the sea.
Funding for applications for funding provided to the municipalities the Ministry of Regional Development under the direction of Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), in concrete terms, should be used to finance the establishment of grant applications in Brussels.
EU: Bizarre regulations are the exception
While regulations are easily the target of criticism in the Member States, the EU's efforts to regulate and thus to ensure the effectiveness and development of the European Union as a whole are more worthy of recognition in the opinion of some experts.
In the opinion of these experts, a more serious problem is the EU funding for projects which have nothing in common with the deepening of European integration, but which have been forced in the budget negotiations of individual Member States.
Emotions also call for the Czech Republic, like other Member States in Brussels, to fight for the right to use specific terms of traditional products and not always win this fight.
Although the Czech Republic was able to defend the term "Olomoucké tvarůžky" after a six-year struggle with Germany and Austria, the interior (Tuzemský rum), whose tradition dates back to the 19th century, our manufacturers had to change their name to "Tuzemák".
The name rum may only be used for products made from sugar cane distillate, not for products made from sugar beet.
In the official list of products registered in the EU, the company of world-famous cheese varieties Feta and Gorgonzola, the Lübecker Marzipan or the Parma ham now also includes Karlovy Vonieback, carp from Pohořelice and Třeboň, or the Saazer hops.
With an EU brand, the Pardubic Lebcake or the Hořic Roles can grow.
"People want me to save the Republic, but I'm just an amateur," Okamura claims.
Mr Senator, how do you come up with the idea of running for the President's office?
It's not about being a senator or president.
If everything worked in our country without problems, I wouldn't run anywhere.
But I can no longer look at how the Republic has been looted for 20 years, how thieves run around freely, while people are being increased the taxes and retirement age.
I had no ambitions to become a politician.
But if I see something that I do not like, then I try to propose a solution to change it.
And since I am already over 40 years old, and I am independent and non-partisan, I have no other way of influencing things than to run for the office of a senator or president.
In the Senate you did it and then immediately set out on your way to the castle.
Don't you turn your back on your voters?
I've been telling myself all along that I'm going to take up the fight for the castle after the Senate election.
Later, I clarified this and said that I would run for the office of President if I were elected Senator.
But my goal is not the function. The function is an instrument by which I can realize my visions.
For this I need as much influence as possible and as strong a mandate as possible.
The difficulty, however, is not only that we, as a people in the pub and in front of the TV, are scouring, but that we are destroying anyone who wants to change something.
In addition, the media who want to rob you of the honor and who confuse the freedom of the word with the freedom to lie.
For example, I was told that I would bribe journalists or that I was a consultant to Jiří Paroubek.
Let's talk about your visions.
You have taken up the struggle for the castle with the thesis of the material and criminal liability of politicians as well as with retrospective asset declarations of over 20 million crowns.
To do so, you need to change laws.
As President, you have no competence in this regard, and only the Senate as a whole can make legislative proposals.
How do you intend to solve this problem?
As a simple citizen, I have worked to ensure that the guide remains a free trade and that this could be enforced.
The problem is the petty-minded policy - if someone comes from the right or from the left with a good proposal, it is deliberately rejected, and that only stops the population.
As an independent partyless person, I have far greater potential to gain support from all parties represented in Parliament.
My advantage is that without drawer thinking and party dogmas, I can take from each party what is best for our country.
Do you see yourself as a person in politics rather right or left?
From a Czech point of view, people seem to see me on the left.
For me, however, this right-left thinking is completely unimportant.
For me, it's important that we move on.
I am not concerned with whether someone belongs to the left or to the right camp; I want to connect people.
I always publicly support every good solution, even if it comes from the KSČM or from the ODS, and I will also turn against bad ideas.
You don't like it when someone calls you populists.
But don't you confirm that by what you just said?
If you create a business plan in a company, you also have an ideal goal and a vision.
And you want to get closer to this one.
This can be described as populism for my part, but all the proposals I have talked about are already working in the world, or they have been discussed by important experts.
But without Parliament's support, you will only remain a keyword.
And that means that you will not get far in politics in the long term.
Or do you think that if you only talk to people long enough, you will succeed in enforcing, for example, material and criminal liability?
I have no other way.
Politicians, journalists and the public to convince and try to bring them to our side to enforce these goals.
As President, it would not be a problem for me to call on the presidents of the parliamentary parties live on television to lay down the substantive and criminal liability of politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors legally.
And the speakers would then have to say, if necessary, why they refuse this.
A strong personality that points to abuses can exert pressure on the political scene.
Take only once the direct election of the President, who was a merit of public pressure.
I am quite clear that I am an amateur; I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.
I'm trying to find allies for my views and visions.
I have just started with politics and I am trying to find the support of the majority for my programme.
I always try to judge things myself; and if it doesn't work, I'll go back to the private sector in six years.
That sounds a little like Okamura should save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know I can't do anything alone; that's why I talked to several known personalities about whether they don't want to run for the Senate as well.
For example, I spoke to Radim Jančura, who, however, refused to do so because of work overload.
I also supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, who discovered the fraud in the trade in light heating oil.
I started my candidacy with the assumption that people are deeply dissatisfied, but now I'm not sure.
Sixty percent of voters have not gone to the elections at all, and those who have gone have mostly elected representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate, we're only two independents.
People have chosen such a Senate composition that changes will only be very difficult to enforce.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my visions, e.g. for the direct election of mayors and district chiefs.
Do you think about setting up your own party?
I have not thought about this yet, because I do not have time to review the past of any potential party member, nor do I have the money for it.
I don't even have money for the presidential campaign; in my transparent account there are only 20,000 CZK.
You don't have any money?
You're talking about asset statements, how do yours look?
My private assets are estimated at about CZK 60 million.
In Prague, I have a property worth 25 million, an apartment worth about 10 million, another for 8 million, an art collection worth about 10 million, and an Aston Martin for 3.5 million and a Škodu Superb worth about a million, and then I have a few million on the account.
By the way, Aston Martin was a child's dream - James Bond has always liked the way he drove in the car, was gallant to women, and at the same time fought against evil.
You drive an Aston Martin, have a fortune of 60 million and have no money for your campaign?
You say you want to change the Republic, but you don't want to invest your own money in it.
That's not exactly convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
You want me to make a debt?
I've already put 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I don't have sponsors shows that my program probably doesn't attract too much interest.
And I am not obliged to challenge the campaign from my own resources.
The costs of the campaign are basically covered by my salary as a senator.
But I couldn't live on the senator's salary alone; for example, I couldn't finance my son's English school, which costs 30,000 a month.
If I just wanted to make money, I wouldn't run for anything.
So do you continue to work as an entrepreneur to have your way out?
Didn't you say you were going to go back to these activities?
But that does not depend on the level of salary.
As promised, I have partly driven back my activities.
For example, my deputy will be the President of the travel agency in spring.
People want to see me as a Samaritan who saves the Republic.
But I have to live on something, too.
What monthly income were you accustomed to as an entrepreneur?
Some 200,000 to 400,000, and so on.
As President, however, I would be completely in a position to stop my activities.
The full conversation can be found in the Saturday edition of Právo.
The MVRDV architects prove that the true adventures are not just in the head - by example of Spiijkenisse and the recently built Bücherberg - 2 photos
"I find the building funny, it looks futuristic, and finally there is something interesting to see again," says Lisette Verhaig, a passantine on the roadside.
And Stefan Spermon, IT technician in a nearby large company, says: "But, it's already beautiful, the house."
But I wonder what we still need a library for today.
Everyone has Internet, iPad and e-books.
No one's volunteering to go to one of these old-style libraries today, right?
Spijkenisse, a sleep city in need of hardly a visit at the gates of Rotterdam, is an odd record holder.
The 80,000-inhabitant community has the lowest educational rate in the whole of the Netherlands.
To counteract this stupid circumstance, a few years ago it was decided to contribute to general education and to reconstruct the seven fictitious bridges depicted on the Eurocheques as beautifully painted concrete miniatures.
The success of the educational offensive was limited.
And so the city fathers realized that there was only one way to become the statistical master: a library had to come here!
Winy Maas from Rotterdam's architecture office MVRDV, master of the awesome beam diagrams and producer of funny, often cynical buildings, took the matter with usual serenity and appeared at the competition hearing anno 2003 with five books under his arm and a grin in his face.
And while the jury was still looking around and jerking around with his shoulders, the naughty Maas piled up his exquisite portence of greatness to a pyramid and finished his actionistly-substantiated speech with the words: "Dear City Community!"
So that's him, my proposal for the Bücherberg of Spijkenisse, for the so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the 30 million euros mountain is piled up.
It is part of a revitalization project, including underground garage, supermarket, post office and a few adjacent residential and row houses with a total of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November the Bücherberg was awarded the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project is nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
This is the faceless little town retorts, which so far had no more to offer than a postmodern pedestrian zone and an unimaginably ugly town hall, behind its white facades one would be inclined to suspect a dairy factory in order to make a piece of contemporary architecture richer.
Above all, however, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural construction in the history of its existence.
The long way to the book
The first impression: bookshelves under cheese lids.
There is a lift that leads through the middle of the mountain massif, but the true joys of space and reading open up when the topography climbs on foot.
The all-glazed interior is bright and clear, the burnt floor and the elegant street lights speak unmistakably the language of a public square.
The urban ambience is perfect.
You already look out for park bench, dog and football playing boys and girls.
And books, books, books everywhere.
"Normally the bookshelves stand along the façade, and in the middle there is a large, dark space that is mostly uncomfortable and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
We put the classic room configuration on the head and helped the reading area from inside to outside.
The interior of the Bücherberg is skillfully used: in the center are offices, Internet library, chess club, environmental center and home technology centre.
A special joy are the black bookshelves, which are sometimes wall coverings, sometimes scaffolding, sometimes scaffolding.
Optics, haptic and smell are foreign.
Even well-fledged architects and construction engineers shake their heads if the unknown building material.
"We wanted to work with recycling materials here," explains Joop Trouborst, project manager at the municipality of Spijkenisse, on request of the standard.
And so one day we encountered a suitable agricultural waste product in a Frisland farm.
For many years in the Netherlands, a millimetre thin plastic fleece has been used as a root layer in greenhouses and fields.
That's cheap and time-efficient.
The thin textile holds one, two seasons, after which it is ripe for the bulk waste.
For the library, the nonwovens - for the first time in these quantities - were pressed to four centimeters thick plates.
Under heat and pressure, the so-called agricultural plastic (KLP) becomes a dark, homogeneous, loadable material that smells a bit like new cars and a bit like sports shoes.
After 105 steps you reach the summit.
At the end of the almost 500 meters long hike you will be rewarded in the literary café not only with a fantastic view of the city, but also with Dutch crocets and table-top ficus trees.
They provide an atmosphere, but above all provide the right humidity in the literature mountains.
Donate for the New Soul
"You wouldn't believe it, but despite the many glass surfaces, this house is a showcase project in puncto ecology," says Trouborst.
It is heated and cooled with earth heat.
Although the Bücherberg is under a glass crash, even on sunny days the sun shines only briefly into the interior.
The wide wooden glue binders, which stand across the glass façade, serve as a shade and capture a large part of the sunlight.
The room climate is very pleasant.
The rest do fully automatic rollos.
Stefan Spermon, the initial skeptic from the IT industry, had already ventured the way into the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was there too.
And also the TCM teacher Cynthia Bogarde, who even calls Boekenberg the "longest overdue soul".
The reason: To be opened a few weeks ago, every resident was invited to donate a book from his personal inventory.
For the time being, this is to fill the optical gaps in the still incomplete library - currently 70,000 pieces.
The concept has come up.
The shelves are filled up to above.
"Nothing is worse than a half-empty library," says architect Winy Maas.
"I think, thanks to our invitation, every citizen now has a certain relationship with this new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
And if it's only for decoration.
Thus, MVRDV has succeeded in the king's discipline that is called in the professional jargon identity foundation.
Spiekenisse has written literature history.
So young and uneducated she may be.
This is at last a starting point for identity.
Szabo: "Germans must play a bigger role"
Germany abstained in the vote on the inclusion of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, expert on US-European relations, Berlin is thus balancing to a narrow degree of diplomacy.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week Germany had initially signaled that it would vote against the request for an observer status of the Palestinians at the United Nations.
But then Berlin remained.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis did in Gaza.
Now, however, Germany must be careful because of its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I don't think it supports the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - without, however, being too critical of Israel.
During the rebellion in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it was about establishing a no-fly zone.
This was finally enforced by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on important international issues?
Yeah, that's right.
This is because it is changing its foreign policy, away from a policy managed, as it were, by the United States, towards a German foreign policy.
Aggravatingly, Europeans do not have a coherent and uniform policy.
So the Germans find themselves between the fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I believe that she is still working on her role, but they are on their way to a more "normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy such as they have France or Great Britain.
What does a "normal" foreign policy mean from a German point of view?
It shows the willingness to take positions in national interests that are independent of those of the United States or European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, i.e. by exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are to a certain extent different from those of the other major powers and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests affected the attitude in the Middle East conflict and the vote in the UN?
On the one hand, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf States.
Therefore, it must be careful not to confront the public, but also the elites, in the Arab countries.
That certainly matters.
But I wouldn't want to give too much weight to that either, that's not a completely one-sided relationship.
But it certainly plays an important role in German deliberations.
Has Germany damaged its relations with the United States by abstaining in important decisions, such as voting on Palestine?
I believe that in Europe and even in the United States there is a great deal of understanding of the German position.
That is why I do not believe that this was such a dramatic break as in the Libyan question.
Perhaps Germany will even show some respect for it.
Because it signals that it is taken seriously as an international player and that its interests need to be taken into consideration.
There are various opinions in Europe about the Palestinian initiative.
The US, on the other hand, has clearly voted for a veto.
Are there differences of opinion between the United States and many European nations?
Because of American domestic policy, these differences have always existed.
I believe that under Obama the government has quite a lot of understanding of the European position.
But because of the political situation here, the government cannot, of course, represent this position publicly.
I believe that the real differences of opinion are not as big as they always appear.
If you look at the relations between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, Obama is not so thrilled by Netanyahu's policy.
Is it difficult for Germany to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the US on the one hand, and the position of the most important partners in the EU on the other?
I think that makes it so difficult for the Germans.
It would, of course, be a little easier for the Germans if there were a coherent and uniform European policy, which is not the case at present.
So they can't be part of a wider line and have to push things out of their own position instead.
That's what they're doing with the euro.
I believe that in the future Germany will take on a leading role in pushing Europe into a European position.
This is not easy for Germany, of course, even because of its relationship with Israel.
This has always been a sensitive issue.
But I think the Germans are aware that they need to play a more independent role.
Does Germany see itself as an important international player - does Germany even want to play a leading role?
Or does Germany still have a difficult leadership role?
Germany is not used to it yet, it is still unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult for the country to play a greater role.
For example, when we look at the euro crisis, every time Germany assumes a larger role, there will be a wide range of anti-German feelings.
That doesn't make it easy for the Germans.
This is actually the old problem: you don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
In this way, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It must be receptive to various neighbors and opinions and that is not easy.
Now the US's influence in European policy is steadily diminishing, but the EU is not filling this vacuum at the moment, who else is there?
The Germans will just have to play a bigger role.
Even if they don't like it, it's unpleasant to them and makes them even more unpopular - c'est la vie!

"Markenschutz" in China: When Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani is a world-renowned brand, Polo Ralph Lauren too.
But what is Armani Polo?
Behind this lies a name officially registered in China, which has nothing to do with the companies of origin.
Nevertheless, it enjoys protection for as long as the actual namesakes do not complain.
And even then it is not clear whether they are getting right.
"It is becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their trademarks in China," says Thomas Pattloch, lawyer at Taylor Wessing, a law firm specialising in copyright violations in Far East.
Every week, a new case lands on my desk.
The imitations already have a few additional letters to allow them to register their trademarks.
Thus, from Gucci it becomes simply Lu-Gucci, instead of Prada you have Prada-Kny entered.
German companies are also legally copied in this way, such as the sports goods manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens a folder with registrations from the trademark office in Beijing.
On 14 September 2010, a Chinese company had the trademark Zegna DF Puma protected, an art name that was also used by the fashion house Ermenegillo Zegna.
It is well known that the Chinese world champions are in copying and in hurting intellectual property.
In the big cities there are multistorey department stores that sell almost exclusively counterfeits.
But Pattloch's cases are different: on behalf of his clients, he argues that Chinese companies are officially granted the right to use a name that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call the "Bang Mingpai", a passenger brand.
The word is based on "Bang Dakuan".
This means women who fish for rich men.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt
"This is business-damaging, you have to fight it," says Pattloch.
"The brand is watered down, the seclusion disappears, the image damage is enormous."
The financial losses and the process costs of the sectors concerned go into the millions, especially in the case of expensive displays.
According to the market research company CLSA, China is the third largest market for luxury products and the fastest growing market with a volume of 15 billion euros a year.
However, deletions of dubioser entries in the trademark register are difficult to reach and go into money.
For up to nine years, the procedure can be drawn, with an uncertain outcome.
Pattloch reports of cases in which the court rejected actions because after the long term the defendant's name had become "market reality".
If the plaintiff was in trouble, he even had to pay the plagiarist because he violated his brand in China, says Pattloch.
Sometimes the law of the jungle prevails here.
Famous cases also concern graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a lawsuit with the construction machine manufacturer Sany, the company that recently took over the German concrete pump builder Putzmeister.
The Chinese can therefore still use an emblem similar to the Mercedes star.
The Volvo buyer Geely originally used a blue-white logo that reminded BMW; the dispute was settled, Geely had to change it.
The fashion manufacturer Lacoste lost in China against copyists from Hong Kong and Singapore, who let the famous crocodile look in the other direction.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
The CTMO brand office in Beijing admits that in 2010 there were bottlenecks due to insufficient staff and space equipment.
Last year, however, one had returned from the "emergency situation in the course of work to normality".
Thus, the existence of unaltered opposition proceedings had fallen by 22 per cent.
Almost 57,000 such cases had been closed, 75 percent more than in the previous year.
Nevertheless, 81,500 objections are still pending in the Office.
Dealing With It Costs Much
As so often in China, the figures are impressive.
Last year, CTMO received more than 1.4 million applications for trademark protection, almost a third more than 2010.
This is a record and means that for the tenth time in a row, China is on the list of new applications worldwide, the Authority communicates.
This also applies to the stock of all valid trademarks, a total of 5.5 million pieces.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan had been taken in fees.
This means that each registration costs on average 1280 yuan or 160 euros.
On the other hand, it costs a lot, as the case of the German family business Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the Group has been fighting against a Chinese plagiarist.
The Germans were able to achieve that their illegal manufacture of imitated vehicle parts was lifted.
However, the imitator continued to secure the Chinese rights on the Freudenberg brand.
One has failed this because in Germany family names could not be protected," says Hanno Wentzler, Chairman of the Management Board of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The CTMO brand office rejected the objections of the Munichers.
In the next two instances, Freudenberg got right, but the trial opponent fights to this day.
You have to watch the hell out.
Now the matter is pending before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident to bring the matter to a good conclusion, and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says, "The process is extremely expensive and costs us a lot of time, money and nerves."
Internal costs could hardly be calculated, the company archive even had to look through a hundred years old files to provide evidence.
Five years ago Freudenberg offered the opposite in vain a "high six-digit euro amount" to settle.
"You can see how much this is worth to us," says Wentzler.
The dangers in the Far East are even threatening to slip back to Europe.
Then when imitators secure unprotected brands there.
Thus, a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather.
This business line has long since been abandoned by the Group, yet he was able to opt out of registration.
"You have to be hellish," says Wentzler.
Both he and the lawyer Pattloch advise German companies to be very careful about business with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark rights, rather, the foreigners should "register everything that is somehow worth protecting also in China", as Wentzler says.
Otherwise, it can become much more expensive than registration.
In fact, if Freudenberg was subject to the last act of his brand drama, then one would probably have to pay the opposite license fees for his own name, explains Wentzler.
Or we will be forced out of the market in the segment in question.
World AIDS Day: Stamping, singing, helping
In Heidelberg, the choir Imbongi - and in Swaziland, AIDS orphans are happy about it.
The story of a connection that overcomes far more than 8733 kilometers.
First there is the stamping: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, women's pumps and men's slippers look for the beat on the parquet floor, find it quickly.
One-two-three-four.
Only then will the voices of the singers slowly swell - old, bass, tenor and soprano - force, deceive and persecute themselves.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor, almost takes it out of his shoes, when he brings it together with his softly wild gestures.
It is Monday evening, in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the choir Imbongi tastes a new song.
The fifty singers came, between 23 and 69 years old, from the human geneticist to the Hausmann.
"Om'Obani" is not a simple piece, each choral voice has a different text and it is also spoken in a very foreign language: Zulu, spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Self - Help
There are around 34 million HIV-infected people around the world, which estimates Unaids, the United Nations Programme to Combat AIDS.
23.5 million people live in South Africa.
245,000 AIDS orphans live in Swaziland.
More than 40 percent of the population are now HIV positive.
For 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Esitcheni, the Association Voices for Africa Paten has found in Germany.
70 of them attend a secondary school.
You can take a sponsorship for 15 or 20 euros a month.
It guarantees the child school fees, school uniform and a warm meal daily in the Gogo Center.
Imbongi means on Zulu storytellers or also praisers.
The Bantu language fluently speaks in this room no one can, but sing.
For almost ten years, the choir has been practicing songs in this foreign soft language and occasionally brings them back to where they originally came from: in the south of Africa.
After all, 8 733 kilometres from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is the village of Esitcheni, which depends on the power of voice of the German choir.
Forty percent are infected
Some 2,000 people live there, some still in simple mud and straw huts, most of which are children.
More than 300 of them don't have any parents anymore because they're dead to the HI virus.
In Esisteni, the small thing that makes the whole of Swaziland sick is: the highest HIV infection rate, the lowest life expectancy worldwide according to Unicef.
Circumcisions of the male foreskin, which are proven to reduce the risk of infection by half, are hardly accepted by the population.
More than forty percent of people in Swaziland carry the immunodeficiency virus in themselves, with mid-thirty to die is not uncommon.
During a joint Africa trip in spring 2005, the choir discovered the village, but above all the Imbongis saw many children on the streets, who lacked not only parental care, but simply everything: food, clothing, education.
Without graduation, you have no chance in a poor country.
At first, it was still the private commitment of individuals to send a child to school for a few euros a year and to allow him a warm meal a day.
A year later, however, the choir founded the association "Voices for Africa", which has been taking care of the AIDS orphans in Esitcheni almost professionally since then.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most important sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial STIs include syphilis, chlamydia and tripper (gonorrhea).
Common viral STIs are HIV, human papillomavirus, herpes genitalis or hepatitis.
Fillets and chalks belong to the parasitic STI.
Who are the main stakeholders?
Syphilis and Tripper occur mainly in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute assumes that at least four out of five cases of syphilis reported in Germany are transmitted through sexual contacts between men.
In heterosexual adults, Chlamydia infections, trichomonads, candidosis (pill), trippers and human pappilomaviruses are common sexually transmitted diseases.
The spread of HIV is relatively low among heterosexual adults in this country - nevertheless: around 20 percent of HIV new infections occur in this group.
Chlamydia infections occur much more frequently in adolescents than in other populations.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections affect young people aged 15 to 25.
In addition, human papillomaviruses are common in adolescents.
How did the number of infections develop?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to reporting.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections has more than doubled from 1697 diseases in 2001 to 3698 diseases in 2011.
The number of HIV new infections has decreased since 2007.
In 2011, there were around 2,700 cases.
That's about a tenth less than the previous year.
What are the signs of a sexually transmitted disease?
Infections may cause genital ulcers, urinary disorders, discharges, abdominal pain, blisters or warts.
However, they often do not cause pain or other symptoms and therefore remain unnoticed.
How can you protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but do not offer 100% protection.
Because in part, pathogens from sexually transmitted diseases can also be passed on through lubrication infections and close body contact.
Therefore, experts recommend regular investigations, especially in frequently changing sex partners.
Earlyly diagnosed, most STIs can be cured and later avoided.
Through sponsorships, donations and, not least, the gages that the choir sings all over Germany, some come together.
"In total, we have already sent around 200 000 euros to Esitcheni," says Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In the village itself, Zodwa manages Dlamini, a self-confident and assertive woman, the money from Germany.
She also takes care that the orphans are well accommodated, for example with one of the grandmothers.
The Gogos, as they call the old women on Zulu, are the supports of the village.
Some of them have taken up to 14 orphans, give them a roof over their heads and make sure that the children in their uniforms appear on time every day for school lessons.
Whoever has no one left comes to the shelter at Khanyisile, a single woman who is paid by the club as well as the two cooks who cook for more than 200 hungry children every day.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" has established a sewing school, built two chicken houses and organized together with the American health organization PSI that many in the village have had an HIV test done.
This is not a matter of course, because as obvious as the disease is in the whole country, you prefer to silence her dead.
A king with 14 wives
"AIDS is an absolute taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has to do with sexuality."
Actually strange in a country where the king officially holds 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
Among other things, it is also due to this state-sanctioned way of life that the HI virus has spread so rapidly over the past decades.
But also the many migrant workers who carry the virus through the country.
There would be free condoms at every corner, says Annette Lennartz, "but they are hardly used.
The culture is another - meat to meat."
In order to promote cultural exchange, the Imbongi choir travels through South Africa every two or three years together and sings songs full of anguish, spirit of struggle, confidence and black self-confidence, which many know on the southern tip of the black continent from times of apartheid.
A bus full of whites singing songs in a black language - so much recognition not only brings mood and joy, but also has already deflected some fierce border soldiers a few tears.
The journey always leads to Esisteni, where the singers visit their godchildren.
Even if you hardly find the small village on maps, in the valley of the river Ezulweni it is more known than.
"Go to Esisteni, there's the light," the people say.
And when you return the 8733 kilometers of air line to Heidelberg, to the stammering singers in the test room on Bergheimer Straße, you can see it shining there too.
Messenger: NASA discovers ice on the Mercury
The Messenger probe has found evidence that there is Mercury Ice on the planet.
The ice cover may be up to 20 meters thick.
The US Space Agency NASA has demonstrated the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is closest to the sun, there is also frozen water there, as three studies published on Thursday in the "Science" magazine show.
The Messenger probe has found evidence that there is an ice cover in the permanent shade of the planet.
This should be at least 30 centimeters and possibly up to 20 meters thick.
The water probably came from comets or possibly from asteroids that are on the Mercury.
But no one brings the discovery of ice into connection with the existence of life on the planet, said the chief scientist of the Messenger Son, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on the Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help to clarify how water and other building blocks of life have reached other areas of the solar system.
Unnoticed by earth’s citizens, probes, telescopes, and small robots such as Phoenix are exploring the depths of space.
From time to time, they send pictures to Earth: Small holes in infinite distances.
The picture comes from a camera developed by German researchers from the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, also the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, who circles around the sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not a "planet" after the new definition of the International Astronomical Union of 2006.
This picture of an infrared recording of the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless star generations: the oldest stars can be seen as blue dots, more difficult to identify are the pink "new born" in the star-circle room.
This star-forming region - called unromantic W5 by scientists - has discovered the telescope Spitter in the constellation Cassiopeia, at a distance of 6500 light years.
This dazzling glow of a dying star has captured the Nasa Spitzer telescope.
The donut-shaped ring consists of material that the star threw out in the dying process.
In the huge Trifid fog, 5400 light years away from the earth, new stars are created from gas and dust.

The Pleiades star cluster, also called "The Seven Sisters", can be seen with the naked eye at night.
With the telescope, however, the colors become more effective.
Like a red Age, the Helix fog looks at this infrared photo to the viewer.
It is located 700 light years away in the Aquarius constellation.
His similarity to an earthly continent brought this fog to the title of North America.
A combination of normal and infrared photo ensures spectacular coloring.
This baby star could only be captured in its full beauty by the infrared detectors of the Spitter telescope.

One of the largest and sharpest shots of the Hubble telescope: The Jacuzzi Gallery
Depending on the colouring, images of spiral galaxies become true works of art.
The image published by the European Southern Observatory shows the Trifid fog in the constellation Schütze, which is several thousand light-years away.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word trifidus (three-part, three-part), as dark dust strips triple the glowing heart of the star birthplace.
In the constellation of snake carriers, astronomers have photographed the foreshadows of a cosmic carambola: 400 million light years away from the earth, the cores of two melting galaxies collide with each other and will inevitably collide with each other.
This star birth recorded the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
If there are no technical abbreviations, they may be referred to by their nickname Southern Firewheel.
The photo of the Hubble Space Telescope shows an excerpt from the Irisnebel in the constellation Kepheus.
The 1400 light-years away fog consists of dust grains that are ten to a hundred times smaller than ordinary house dust.
This image was assembled from optical and x-ray recordings of various telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes, 430 million light years away from the earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, recorded the Hubble Space Telescope for the Nasa.
The larger spiral galaxy call scientists UGC 1810.
The brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way galaxy is located in this stellar ennebel.
The stellar cog always produces new youngsters.
Also these star clouds, connected to the rosette fog, constantly produce new baby stars - 5,000 light years away from the earth.
In this brightly radiant galaxy with a small black hole, there is no dust yet, but only gas.
Researchers suspect that it was only just after the big bang that hydrogen was found in the universe.
Our insights into space: The most important telescopes
The telescope is said to have been invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608 - even before Galileo Galilei used it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of the optical telescopes have become ever larger - and the insights they provide have become deeper and deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope in the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror, here in the picture, had an average of five meters.
In Arizona, U.S.A., there is the Large Binocular Telescope.
It allows views into space right over two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior life of the Gran Telescopio Canaria on the Canary Island of La Palma is huge - the mirror alone comes at 10.4 meters in diameter.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented - to save costs.
Nevertheless, it reaches a diameter of about eleven meters.
Disadvantage of the favourable construction: The telescope is fixed at its angle of elevation - and thus limited in its mobility.
The Hobby Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed at an altitude angle.
Its speciality: the high power of light collection.
In fact, despite a relatively low mirror diameter, this reaches the world’s largest mirror telescopes.
Using a radio telescope in Arecibo (Puerto Rico), researchers listen to space for extraterrestrial signals.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
With the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI), any computer owner can help by providing computing services.
View of the Observatory of the European Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope - which honors his name.
With its four mirrors in total, the telescope can also illuminate the medium infrared spectrum.
The European Extremely Large Telescope is also planned at the Chilean ESO Observatory.
Its main mirror is to be full of 42 meters - and made of almost 1000 mirror elements.
Pictures, however, are expected at the earliest in 2018.
Until 2007, the two Keck telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
They offer two mirrors each with an average of ten meters.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna-Kea Observatory, which looks into the sky alongside them with the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF.
Also on the Mauna Kea a new, huge telescope is to be created - with a mirror average of thirty meters.
Here it is to be admired on an illustration.
The most important impressions from space, however, provide the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since 24 April 1990 it has already provided images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Space Telescope Kepler has been searching for extrasolar planets - especially those that are habitable.
On February 2, 2011, Naza announced that 1235 planet candidates have been identified since the start of the mission.
In the picture the last preparations are documented at the Space Telescope Kepler.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be launched on board an Ariane5 rocket at the earliest in 2018.
The primary mirror of the space infrared telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope: It is to search for light from the first stars and galaxies for the big bang.
Scientists assume that there exists also at the southern pole of Mercury ice.
However, there is no reliable data for this, as the messenger travels much closer to the North Pole around the planet.
Radar measurements have been indicating for decades that there is ice on Mercury.
Through the Messenger probe - the first one to move around Mercury - the scientists now have certainty.
Drinking butter daily - and be 168 years old
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach a Biblically high age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A track search in the country where 97-year-olds are relatively young.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach a Biblically high age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A track search in the country where 97-year-olds are relatively young.
The journey through the Talysch Mountains is called wild-romantic.
The small bus rumbles over the winding road, past densely wooded hills, raging rivers and simple farmhouses.
Everything is green and juicy, you might think you're in the Black Forest.
But this is the deepest south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few kilometres away.
Here the Caucasian population of the Talysians lives, of which not much is known, except that it speaks perfectly Persian as well as Asian and is very durable.
End station is Lerik.
The small town boasts too much guessed architecture from Soviet times, which does not want to fit into the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe hardly come here, too difficult is the approach of Azerbaijan's capital Baku.
For the 323 kilometers you need eight hours because the road is only one-way.
The legendary wealth the country owes to its oil in the Caspian Sea has not yet arrived here in the province.
But Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has the stuff for the tourist attraction.
"Baku became famous in May with the Eurovision song festival - and next year we have a festival of the oldest people in the world," says Fatulalayeva.
She is the director of the Museum of Longevity, probably the only one in the world.
Here the Vita is documented by about eight dozen Talyschen from the area, which is older than 100. Fatulayeva points to a black and white photo.
This is my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
At the age of 136, still a child born
But the controversial star of the museum is the sheep shepherd Şirali Müslümov, who is supposed to be 168 years old.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And given the oldest documented person, who was 122 years old, Müslümov's age seems very doubtful.
"In 1805 he was born here in the region, in 1973 he died," explains Fatulayeva.
The man was married three times and had 23 children, and at the age of 136 he must have fathered another daughter.
So did Şirali Müslümov count at his age for a few decades?
But also Rembrandt Scholz, a senior researcher at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has heard of the elderly in Central Asia.
"Remarkably many very old people are also in some areas of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," says Scholz, "even in Sardinia live extremely many very old men."
However, due to the lack of documentation, there was no scientific evidence of age, especially in the absence of a register of persons.
Softly melted butter every day
However, the fact is that the people of the region around Lerik frequently reach a biblical age.
There are currently 20 people over 100 years of age.
So why do so many people in the South live in the middle of the day?
The Asian guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains this with the special genes of the Talysians.
Museum director Fatulayeva believes that it is on the diet.
But that calculated the high-calorie diet of the Talysian should be so healthy that meat, bread and, above all, dairy products love and many of them drink a glass of melted butter every day, does not seem plausible from a nutritional point of view either.
Or is it the original way of life that keeps people young? In Cengemiran, a tiny settlement near the city of Lerik, Rubaba Mirzayeva lives.
With its 97 years of age, it is relatively young for these widths.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house, which is typical of the entire Caucasus region.
She sits on the ground with a butter barrel that she tirelessly rolls back and forth.
Eight people live here under a roof, including one of Mirzayeva's sons and a daughter, both of whom have long been grandparents.
There are also two young children jumping around.
In the kitchen you prepare the guests tea, which is served in the typical, arched Armadu glasses.
Mirzayeva's white teeth stand perfectly in maturity and limb, under her head cloth she hides long, dark-blonde pots that proudly reveal her son to us.
I always washed my hair with milk, so they never left me and kept their color.
"I never used shampoo," says Mirzayeva.
Monthly pension is sufficient for life
She always ate only what came from her own farm, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
All my life, I didn't buy food once in the supermarket.
Then she tells of her husband who was in the army.
It was worst in the post-World War II period.
But everything got better when the "beloved father" Heydar Aliyew took over the row.
The propaganda sounds strange from the mouth of an old woman.
But the cult that is driven around the nation's father figure, who ruled his country like a dictator, knows little bounds in Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003, and later his son Ilham took over the rudder.
After all, there is no need among Azerbaijan's ancients.
230 Manat (about the same sum in Euro), Mirzayeva receives monthly as a pension, for local conditions an amount from which one can live well.
And perhaps Mirzayevas is also right for a long time: "The elderly enjoy respect in our culture."
They live in the midst of the big family, are loved, cared for and are happy.
If that's no reason to stay alive as long as possible
The word "human rights" is missing in the Constitution
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Rivalling rallies in Cairo reveal the deep division of the country.
The future constitution with the Sharia as the basis is fiercely controversial.
The Egyptian president did not spare Pathos.
We need to make the transition.
"And that he succeeds lies in my responsibility, in front of the people and in front of God," he said on state television.
His speech was addressed to all the people, but above all to the Christian Copts, the Liberals, enlightened Muslims and seculars.
For all of them, until now hopelessly disputing in a confucious opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a God-state at the Nile of graces of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
He, said Muhammad Mursi, almost apologisingly, temporarily curtailed the constitutional court's competences and expanded its competences to "save the revolution".
But what the 61-year-old engineer, who holds a doctorate from the American University of Southern California, really wants to save is the Egyptians, the world is not quite clear about that.
Should the Judicative be removed?
In fact, the 234 articles fed by the 100-member constitutional assembly, which is dominated by Islamist, are partly disturbing in a nightly, 15-hour parforcement.
As in previous constitutions, the draft states that case law is based on the "principles of Islamic law".
But what does "principles" mean?
This was and is a matter of interpretation and it is to be feared that the Islamists will use the floating wording and the legal scope associated with it for a more stringent interpretation of the Sharia.
This suggests at least a new article: In all matters relating to the Sharia, Al-Ashar University had to be advised, the country's most important Islamic institution with great radiant power throughout Sunni Islam.
This does not have to, but it may mean that the clergy oversee the legislation, which de facto would result in the emancipation of the judicative.
Much in the draft version is a matter of interpretation
It is also problematic: civil military justice should continue to be maintained.
These courts served during Mubarak's reign to suppress opposition.
Up to 11,000 civilians were held in military custody after the dictator's fall.
The state should also, according to the design, "protect the true nature of the Egyptian family" and "encourage their morals and their values".
This is legally so vaguely formulated that state institutions can control even the contents of film art and literature with the help of this article.
In plain text, that means nothing but censorship.
By the way, no article explicitly states equality between men and women.
For this another forbids insulting or slandering the Prophet Muhammad and his Messengers.
But what is an insult and how it should be done remains unclear.
Similarly, dubios assumes that the "injury of people" is forbidden.
Is there a caricature of the President or a joke at the expense of a lawyer?
Interpretation, as so much as is available in the draft, which Mursi signed and after his words "very soon" will be presented to the Egyptians for a referendum.
"The revolution has returned"
The opposition has been forming for weeks against the supremacy of the Islamists.
Tens of thousands gathered in unusual harmony on Friday evening at the Tahrir Square in Cairo and promised to bring the Charter down before it could enter into force.
"The revolution has returned and we will win," said Hamdin Sabbahi, third-placer of the presidential elections.
Nobel Peace Prize winner and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed El-Baradei stated that the draft constitution was "on the garbage mountain of history".
Through Twitter, he accused the supporters of Mursis of wanting to lead a "puzzle against democracy".
"If he calls the referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him," said oppositional Jasser Said.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers has not yet been atoned for," the Egyptian media quoted opposition politician Chaled Ali.
And several judges announced not to want to monitor the referendum, which would invalidate it.
"The Qur'an is our constitution"
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood, for its part, blew to the area demonstration, but for this reason, it was not on the Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other Nilefer in front of Cairo University.
Many veiled women and followers of the Salafists participated and cried out: "The people demand the application of God's law."
They asked of Mursi, "Clean the land!" and said, "The Qur'an is our constitution."
A struggle for sovereignty over the symbolic Tahrir Square, on which everything began, would have engendered civil war-like conditions.
Mursi's followers obviously didn't want to risk that.
The Muslim brothers explained that both the opponents of the draft constitution and the advocates had spoken loudly and clearly.
Now is the time to let the people at the ballot box decide in which direction the country should go.
A majority for the draft of Islamists is considered safe.
"The word human rights does not even occur"
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry about this forced constitutional process, which should have gone until February and involve all the social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and chairman of the Egyptian Human Rights Organisation (EOHR) defended the Muslim brothers when they were in prison or in court under Mubarak.
Not because he would share their view of the world, but because human rights are indivisible to him.
He was beaten, sentenced, imprisoned for that.
"And now the word human rights is not even in the new constitution," he complains in conversation with the "World on Sunday".
Mursi's extension of power to all three powers in the state had the lawyer resigned.
These measures are gross violations of democratic rules and will lead Egypt into a new dictatorship.
"In fact, instead of strengthening civil society, the President puts it out of effect," laments Saeda.
But without civil society organisations, a democracy could not work.
Saeda feels left alone, also by the international community, which considers the ideological direction struggle on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
This could happen.

Rakfisk from Norway: Is this the worst smelling fish in the world?
The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of living - not only in Europe but throughout the world.
Could the country’s secret of success have anything to do with the local appetite for rather foul - smelling fish?
You take a selection of overripe cheeses.
They are placed in the midst of a pile of dirty, damp sportswear.
And I want you to cover her there for a week.
About this one must imagine the nose-spraying smell of Rakfisk, one of Norway's great delicacies.
I am in the small town of Ferender, about three hours from Oslo.
There is snow here, spectacular landscapes - and this stubborn smell in the air that just doesn't want to disappear.
Rakfisk is sprinkled with salt trout, which - depending on how stinky one would like his fish - is fermented in water for up to a year.
When darkness gets over the country in Norway and the weather gets colder, Norwegians are streaming to a festival here in Ferender, which is dedicated to this, now, truly very impressive speciality.
"You eat it raw and then rinse it down with a glass of Aquavit," says Havard Halvarsen, who actually works in the local fire station, but as a so-called "Rakfisk General", the festival also organizes.
People around us eat small fish cubes and take in large amounts of alcohol.
"Some people like the Aquavit more than the Rakfisk," says Havard.
The spirit can replace the smell.
I'll cost you a few bites.
If you avoid bringing the Rakfisk near to the nose, it is not bad - like Sushi, who has a long bus ride behind him.
Rakfisk is the product of a completely different, much poorer Norwegian era, when there were no cooling possibilities and fish was drunk in autumn in airtight saltwater barrels.
In the deepest winter he was then taken out after long fermentation and - no doubt under alcohol-muffled senses - devoured.
Still before one generation, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work and were mainly in the United States.
Today the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by a thriving labour market, high wages and a comprehensive healthcare system.
Even from Sweden, the old rival, who was not too much richer than Norway a long time ago, immigrants flow.
Rakfisk is regarded as something important - as an essential, although strictly smelling part of Norwegian history.
He's one of the more expensive dishes you can buy here.
But actually everything is expensive here - a small glass of beer or a sandwich costs proudly 10 euros.
Norway doesn't often get into the world press, and most people don't seem to disturb it.
Here one still hates to call Anders Breivik by name - those racist right-wing extremists who shot 77 men, women and children last year.
Instead, we refer only to the "Incident of 22 July".
Norwegians struggle to accept that someone in their peaceful country is capable of such brutal murders.
Since the early 1970s, growth has been one of the largest oil and gas industries in the world.
"But oil is not the only reason why we are doing so well," says Anna, our waitress, who distributes round tablets with mature rake fish and embodies the Nordic ideal with her long blonde hair and the stinging blue eyes.
We are a cautious people, as they say.
Your English is just like most people here.
We're not very obvious, we don't like brawl.
Norway has dealt with its oil wealth very carefully - a large part of the industry income is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
In the years leading up to the global economic crisis, when all the money they didn't have was thrown around, Norway kept its wallet tightly closed.
"As long as we can ski in winter and go hiking in summer, we are happy," says Anna.
"And, of course, eat Rakfisk," she adds with unburdened laughter.
I stand in the snow and stand for another dish - I have enough of Rakfisk.
Such an elk burger is definitely something else.
But in the evening, the stink fish is back on the food plan.
The hotel where I stay is one of several venues that organize a Rakfisk dinner, where guests can vote for the best - or perhaps the smells of the most challenging - fish.
There is a live TV circuit to a showmaster dressed in fly, surrounded by plates with Rakfisk.
The spectacle is similar to the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What score do you have up there in the mountains for the best fish, Thor-Jürgen?"
"Here are our points, Havard."
You're going to slap and laugh.
A man falls from his chair, perhaps overwhelmed by the Aquavit.
But maybe it's the harsh tumult of the whole fish.
Mexico's Enrique Pena Nieto faces a difficult start
While Mexico's future President Enrique Pena Nieto is preparing for his office, Will Grant from the BBC analyses the challenges ahead and the mixed feelings of his people.
Currently, traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad.
Even on better days this is an ever-congested city, but on Monday a steel ring was built that blocks several important transport routes to the capital and provides chaos on the streets.
The aim, however, was not to disturb commuters on their way to work, but to prevent demonstrators from reaching Parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico's new President Enrique Pena Nieto will receive the Presidential Bond and take over the leadership of the nation.
It faces a complex task.
Under the outgoing government of Felipe Calderon, Mexico has been able to prove itself economically well, but the country is in the grip of a drug war that has already cost 60,000 lives in the last six years.
"My government is committed to reducing violence," said Pena Nieto in the Oval Office at the beginning of this week to US President Barack Obama.
I will propose a new security strategy with which we can achieve this objective.
Before going with the U.S. president, Pena Nieto worked as governor of his home state of Mexico.
In this densely populated, vast part of the country surrounding the capital, opinions on the new head of state are shared.
A direct man
In the remote small town of Valle del Bravo, for example, one likes to remember him.
Residents of the resort attribute to him the development of tourism and the construction of the infrastructure.
To reach the city, you can drive on one of the highways that Pena Nieto built and that represent a great improvement over the broken, bumpy streets that once existed here.
Posters with their names also hang outside a modern sports centre and an impressive interactive museum for climate change.
"We expect real and lasting changes from him," says his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, who works as congressman for the party Pena Nietos, who works for PRI.
In particular, as regards security and the economy, we hope for an interesting and real change that our country so urgently needs.
After 81 years in power, the PRI was replaced by Vicente Fox in 2000.
Congressman Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the Presidential Palace of Los Pinos, the party places great expectations on Enrique Pena Nieto.
The opposition's accusations, the new president's lack of substance, he rejects.
He was a very direct man, very committed and had great plans for the country.
He is an excellent statesman, but above all he is also someone who can listen.
But on the other hand, not many people share this view of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast to the paved streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
The town is hidden under motorway transfers and in many ways represents a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the community are of a crucial urban nature.
At the beginning of this year, the military was set up to combat the drug gangs operating in the neighborhoods, and violence against women is a particularly acute problem.
The bodies of dozens of murdered women were left alone in the last two years on a spot near a large garbage dump.
During the reign of Governor Pena Nieto, more than 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico - a statistic that even surpasses the city of Ciudad Juarez, which is notorious for its violence and murder of innocent women.
Critics Pena Nietos believe that he has at least not addressed the problem of women's murders properly during his term of office.
But in the worst case, his government closed its eyes to the problem.
In a concrete building, typical of the lower quarter, Irinea Buendia fights with tears as she shows me photos of her late daughter Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of the events, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
But her family believes that she was murdered by her partner.
"When I arrived at her home, it seemed as if her body had been washed," recalls Senora Buendia.
There were signs that she was beaten, and the body stare had already been used.
While her mother tells her story, a picture of Mariana looks down on us from the wall. It is placed next to a cross that bears a single word: justice.
But this one, the family said, has been denied to her so far.
The authorities have treated me like I'm a brawler, a troublemaker, a nörgler.
They want you to just accept your judgment and keep your mouth shut.
"But this is not possible if there were so many form errors and omissions," she says.
If President Nieto receives the Presidential Bond on Saturday, he will also take on a great deal of responsibility.
Tens of thousands of Mexican families have suffered violent crimes in the last six years, and the new president has promised to take special care of this problem during his term of office.
"I hope as president he is as governor," says PRI Congressman Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
But the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza are most afraid of it.
The Procuratorate claims: Bradley Manning did not complain about abuse
The Procuratorate contradicts Bradley Manning's allegations that he was mistreated in prison.
The hearing deals with Manning's time in the military prison in Quantico, Virginia
The defense seeks to reject the charge on the basis of harsh conditions of detention.
The freeing of the U.S. Army is accused of having stolen thousands of confidential documents
On Friday, the Public Prosecutor's Office tried to find that the Army-free Bradley Manning - accused of the greatest disclosure of confidential information in American history - failed several occasions to complain about the abuse he allegedly suffered in military custody.
During a cross-examination of Manning during a court hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, May Ashden Fein stated that documents on weekly visits by prison officials during Manning's nine-month term of detention in Quantico, Virginia, had no complaints about his treatment.
One day before the cross-examination, which was held as a result of a defense request for the rejection of the charge - Manning had already been sufficiently punished by the harsh period of imprisonment - Manning had stated that he had considered the suicide in prison.
The U.S. Army intelligence analyst arrested in June 2010 is accused of having stolen thousands of confidential documents during his service in Iraq.
The material was then published on the Internet by WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed Manning as a source of information.
In the hearing on Friday, fine-tuning went through the forms that officials had filled out after their meeting with Manning during his detention in Quantico Military Prison, where he had been in prison under increased conditions from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officials asked Manning questions and wrote his answers.
When Fine asked him about the forms on Friday, Manning admitted that he had assessed the treatment by his guards as "excellent" and the treatment by the institution as a whole as "very professional".
The forms, according to Fein, did not contain any complaints about abuse, although officials had questioned Manning directly about his treatment.
Manning replied that he had expressed his concerns orally and the officials had discussed them with him and indicated that they should be dealt with. However, they had not been recorded.
"They wrote down "no problems" (after discussion of the concerns), and that didn't necessarily mean that I didn't say anything at all," says Manning.
The judge, Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he did not complain about his treatment when he met with a committee in January 2011 to investigate the idea of suicide he had mentioned on a form a few months earlier.
Manning replied that his intention during this meeting was to lower his observation status to "prevention of injuries".
The military said it assigned him this restrictive status - one stage under the risk of suicide - to his and the protection of others.
"I wanted to convince employees that I was doing well, and to get rid of the observation status on injury prevention (...) in order to achieve a higher quality of life from my point of view," said Manning.
Manning announced on Thursday that he was arrested and transferred to Kuwait, where he was detained for almost two months before being transferred to the Quantico Marine Base in Virginia in July 2010.
He said that he had considered suicide in Kuwait and had once become unconscious because of the heat.
Not knowing what happened to him or in the outside world has been burdensome.
"My world shrunk on Camp Arafjon, on this cage together," said Manning on Thursday.
I thought I was gonna die in this cage.
When he was transferred to Quantico, Manning spent most of his days in a small cell - at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours - and without society.
He was only allowed a mattress, a blanket, flip flops, clothes and his glasses.
Manning said he tried to stay in motion, because on the day it was forbidden to sleep or even lie down.
Every time he had to sleep with light, which entered his cell from the outside.
If he turned around at night and could not see his face any more, he would have been woken up so that he would turn back.
In January 2011, Manning's lawyer formally objected to Manning's treatment.
In April 2011, Manning was transferred to Fort Leavenworth Military Prison, Kansas.
On Friday, Judge Manning also questioned an accusation he had raised in his statement on Thursday - so he had to sleep one night naked in his cell in Quantico and stand naked in front of guards and other prisoners in a morning count.
Manning had said he had never had the opportunity to cover himself with his blanket during this count.
At the Friday survey, Manning stated that he had closed an order from his guard that he should have dropped the blanket with which he could have covered himself. However, he admitted that no one had asked him to do so.
On Thursday, Manning had announced that he had been forced to sleep naked the previous night. He had tried to show an official that he did not pose any danger to himself.
Manning told the official that he could have used his underwear or his flip-flop to hurt himself, but he didn't.
That night, Manning said, his underpants, flip-flops and glasses had been removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that the judge will at least take his detention experience into account and drastically reduce his imprisonment should he be sentenced to trial before the military court, which is scheduled for the beginning of next year.
The defense has indicated that Manning will confess lower offenses for guilt, while other charges, which are considered too extreme, are to be challenged.
The continuation of the hearing is scheduled for this weekend. The prosecution is expected to justify the terms of the detention.
The Pentagon remains in its position that Manning has been detained in accordance with the provisions applicable to all prisoners under the highest security conditions in Quantico.
The charges against Manning include the promotion of the enemy, the unlawful publication of intelligence information on the Internet, the transmission of national defence information and the theft of public property or documents.
If he is found guilty in all charges, he is threatened with life imprisonment.
My Mexican-American identity crisis.
Many people were forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to accuse the emigrators - they call them hard times in memory, he says.
Navarrette believes that Mexican Americans are trapped between two worlds
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had just crossed the hall and had arrived at the pass checkpoint, when perplexity spread within me.
Signs referred to two queues: one for "Mexicanos" ("Mexicans"), another for "Extranjeros" ("foreigners").
I stood there for a few seconds, uncertain to whom I should go.
I grew up in Central California and was called "Mexican" all my life.
An ethnic shortcut - just like my friends in Boston call themselves "Iren" or my friends in New York "Italy".
Later, I chose "Mexican-American".
But this was Mexico.
And in the home of my grandfather, there was no need for shortcuts or hyphens.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, at least good enough to claim myself in this language at both ends of an interview.
But I don't have the vocabulary of a native speaker, and I'm not going to get rid of my American accent either.
So I took my American passport and put myself in the snake for Extranjeros.
I was thinking about that moment this week when future Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House to meet President Obama.
The agenda included all the topics that are expected when the heads of these two countries meet: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto was also very interested in talking about the growth of the Mexican economy. She is one of the reasons why Mexicans today are equally likely to stay in Mexico instead of emigrating to the United States.
He wants to unite with the United States and Canada and create a North American trading bloc, modelled on the European Union.
And Pena Nieto swore to continue the war of Mexico against the drug cartels, even if he did not mention details in this regard.
Mexico's relationship with the United States is complicated and full of resentment.
Most Americans probably never wasted a single thought that the United States invaded Mexico in 1848 and forced the leadership of the country under the supposed gun to leave them more than half their territory.
But for Mexicans who think in centuries and not in minutes, memories of this event are not to be overlooked.
So as soon as a US government official makes even the mildest criticism of Mexico, complaints are heard - in the Mexican press and among the elites of the country - about how Americans are pressing the sovereignty of their neighboring country.
And the children of Montezumas go on the path of war.
And yet the biggest challenge facing Mexico lies in the relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
Would you like to talk about resentments?
There's more than enough.
Mexico has winners and losers, people for whom the country offers opportunities, and others for whom it does not.
The only reason so many people of Mexican origin live in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that at one point in our family tree, a person - perhaps a parent or grandparents - was offered no chance in Mexico and emigrated north.
And in most cases this person corresponded to a profile - dark skin, uneducated, from a poor village, etc.
We are the descendants of these people, and our faithfulness is to them.
Not Mexico.
And although we may now be living the American dream, attending good schools and getting good jobs, we must never lose sight of the fact that it is the American dream we live - not the Mexican dream.
Our identity may sometimes be blurred, but as far as our loyalty is concerned, this is not the case.
This clearly applies to the United States.
In addition, we are aware that many members of the Mexican leadership do not like us.
This is based on reciprocity.
They see us as a monument of a humiliating defeat and look down on us because we are not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties to Mexico will never be strong enough.
In your opinion, our existence is a symbol of failure.
If our families hadn't failed in Mexico, they wouldn't have gone.
And then we wouldn't see ourselves caught behind the silk curtain - with a pleasant life in the United States, but somehow lost.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and legally immigrated to the United States as a child, reminds me that there are tensions between Mexicans and Mexican Americans, because Mexicans have a clearer idea of who they are - and Mexican Americans take this to heart.
While she is an American citizen, she sees herself as part of two countries.
But many Mexican Americans I know have the feeling of belonging neither to one country nor to the other.
We love the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
One enjoys the best of both worlds, but is not rooted in any of them.
In Mexico we are seen as Americans.
And in the United States we are seen as Mexicans.
As I should learn during my journey, there is something that makes this relationship even more complicated: some Mexican leaders and parts of educational citizenship want to resume their connections to Diaspora.
They want to use Mexican Americans as provisional "ambassadors" for Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We should tell our American colleagues how great a visit to this country is and exert pressure on the political leadership to intensify their ties to Mexico.
Well.
This won't happen.
Too many hurt feelings.
And given the unjust distribution of income, unbridled corruption and drug violence, many of us are not so sure whether this is really a great country.
I'm afraid you'll have to go through that alone, Amigos.
That's fair.
If at least a few Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States for dealing with Mexico a century and a half ago, they must also accept that some Mexican Americans have a grudge for how their family members were treated not so long ago.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're more "mexican" than I thought.
Old Fights, New Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could prove to be an unexpected pillar of peace
Can there ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The latest bloody events seem to suffocate such a hope in the germ.
In the midst of the usual indebtedness, countless buildings were laid in ruins and ashes, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis were killed - and for the first time rockets from Gaza were struck near the Israeli metropolis Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.
However, although Israelis and Palestinians appear to be trapped in their historical conflict, the Middle East is changing around them.
The Arab Spring has created a new, uncertain situation, and whether they want it or not - Palestinians and Israelis have become part of these turmoils.
Perhaps this will only lead to more bloodshed.
But there are reasons to believe that the deadly patch situation could finally end.
A war that is not lost or won
At first glance, optimism seems to be anything but appropriate in view of the current situation.
Even if the ceasefire agreed on November 21st, the weekly struggles have strengthened the heart-fellows on both sides.
Hamas leaders, the Islamist movement that has controlled the Gaza Strip since 2007, will claim to have pushed back the Israelis, even though his group itself had to suffer great losses.
Although several Hamas leaders are killed and the 1.7 million inhabitants of the Gaza Strip are clogged in one of the most desolate and densely populated corners of the planet, Israel has not yet succeeded in destroying Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank, controlled by the rival, temperate Palestinian group Fatah.
And the Hamas leaders could conclude that they have time on their side.
As Islamists in the Arab world gained influence, Hamas has been able to draw powerful and rich friends on its side.
Turkey, a reinvigorating regional power once considered Israel's closest Muslim ally, has taken hold of the Hamas Party - just like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf states.
Thrilling Hamas followers believe that there is an Islamist half moon around Israel - from Lebanon to the north, where militant Hezbollah has power over Syria, where rebels could stand before the fall of Bashar Assad, to Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.
And in particular, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under President Muhammad Mursi in Egypt - by far the strongest and most important Arab country - on the southern flank of Israel has permanently changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the laizist despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had little time left for Hamas.
In contrast, the brotherhood with Hamas is weakened and its leaders are more dependent on popular views.
In future diplomatic negotiations, Hamas could prove to be an actor who cannot even be pushed out of the way by Israel and the United States.
The Israeli hardliners, on the other hand, draw the opposite conclusion.
Militaryly, Hamas is no longer a danger.
The Israeli missile defense system, Iron Dome, has proved itself and many of the Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
For at least a while, Israel will be able to sleep more quietly.
In diplomatic terms, the United States is firmly committed to its position, and many European countries have made Hamas responsible for the latest scale of violence.
Israel has done well in recent years, especially under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who has largely ignored the peace process.
Although rockets from the Gaza Strip have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, the country has remained relatively free of suicide bombers - not least thanks to the lockdowns that have entered the West Bank and thus into the majority of any Palestinian state. These protect the Jewish settlements, which, although declared illegal, are still being expanded.
Netanyahu stands out well. His Likud party has joined an even more combative group in the run-up to the elections on 22 January under Avigdor Lieberman.
Why would these insidious Palestinians be stalking and leaving them a state of their own?
If they actually had control of the West Bank, would they not fire missiles just like their counterparts in the Gaza Strip?
No, it's better to keep them behind the wall in check and punish them if they dare to raise their heads.
Perhaps the hardliners will be able to enforce themselves, but the Arab Spring could make a mark on them.
Even if the Islamists who are now in power in Egypt and in other countries have little left for Israel, they will first focus on the difficulties in their own country.
Israel's defense seat is larger than that of its four Arab neighbours.
A war with the local superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments to restore their economy.
The fact that Pragmatic President Mursi joined Barack Obama in order to reach a ceasefire could be a promising sign - perhaps symbolising the beginning of a new era.
Israelis too should think longer term.
While the rest of the Arab world is taking sluggish steps towards democratization, Palestinians are still deprived of their right to self-determination - a powder barrel that will undoubtedly one day explode in the Israeli-occupied areas, just as this week a bus exploded in Tel Aviv.
The oppression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state, and with the growth of the Arab population this situation will only intensify.
Bloody missions to suppress Hamas in the Gaza Strip will increasingly demand their diplomatic tribute over the years.
Both sides need a boost from the outside
The right answer is one that is represented by the more reasonable representatives of both sides, the majority of the rest of the world and by this newspaper: two states in which Israel resigns for security purposes.
The hope for the near future is that the ceasefire will give outsiders more influence to enforce this solution.
Egypt must now, together with Turkey and Qatar, stop the supply of arms in the Gaza Strip and is better positioned than ever before to convince Hamas of the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, supplemented by territorial exchange and a common Jerusalem.
Foreign Arab nations should also move Hamas and Fatah to an agreement.
This would do more for the creation of a Palestinian state than with the forthcoming request for UN observer status.
Obama must also contribute to moving Israel to negotiations.
During his first term he failed to present his own peace plan.
Far away in the white house, it seems as if he was equally opposed to participation.
But that is a regrettable, short-sighted perspective.
The United States has a major interest in a stable Middle East.
This includes a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Australian laws on uniform cigarette packaging enter into force
Health warnings and body parts on neutral green packages that are the same for all tobacco brands
The world’s first laws for uniform cigarette and tobacco packaging have entered into force in Australia, replacing brand logos and colours with neutral, olive green lids printed with drastic pictures, showing sick body parts and infants and children suffering from cigarette smoke.
Apart from the different health warnings and pictures, the only difference between the packages in the brand names, printed in identical, small prints, is from next Saturday.
Australia thus introduces the world's most stringent rules for tobacco packaging.
The Australian federal government wants to get young people away from smoking by removing the glamorous image of tobacco consumption.
In doing so, the government starts from studies that have shown that people who have not started smoking at the age of 26 will no longer be able to start with a 99% probability after that.
"You can already see in young children that they understand the message that they are trying to apply to tobacco companies with their brand image," says Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek. She quotes studies that have shown, for example, that children associate the crown of a logo with the idea of a princess.
Although Australia has one of the lowest rates of smoking in the world and the changes will only have a minor impact on the profits of multinational corporations, other countries are already considering similar steps.
The tobacco lobby fought hard against the laws.
It was said that the laws would favour the black market trade, which would lead to cheaper and easier access to cigarettes.
"The laws will lead to serious, unintended consequences," says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Chinese and Indonesian counterfeiters will offer far greater quantities of these products on the streets of Australia.
Others, on the other hand, say that the laws have stimulated their business.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, notes that the demand for cigarette ketuis and silicone lids to cover the unbearable packaging has increased enormously since British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco failed to comply with the laws at the Supreme Australian Court two months ago.
Zico has sold up to 6,000 units to wholesale stores and is waiting for new stocks.
It's a good business for us.
According to experts, the hook in the popularity of social media lies with exactly the population group to which the plan is addressed.
A number of Australian laws have banned tobacco companies from the TV advertising, banned them from acting as sports sponsors and forced most traders to stop interpreting cigarettes in stores. Now tobacco advertising has changed to the Internet.
The Australian government has banned Internet advertising by local companies and sites, but has no influence on international sites.
"Whoever markets tobacco and only has a small area left to apply for its products does not come around the Internet," says Becky Freeman, a researcher in healthcare at Sydney University.
On social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, Freeman has noted an increase in experience reports on brands written by "very normal people".
You have to ask yourself: is this just a private person who finds such great pleasure in Marlboro cigarettes that she even takes a video for it - or does a marketing agency have to do with it?
British American Tobacco Australia says that instead of marketing, industry is focusing on dealing with the new laws.
It has even gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new rules - those countries complain to the World Trade Organisation about unfair trade restrictions, although none of the countries are engaged in major trade with Australia.
A WTO decision is expected for mid-2013.
According to Plibersek, the government has had talks with other countries that consider similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to issue photographic warnings in 2001.
These have now been extended to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Harder laws are being considered in Great Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many Australian smokers are defiant.
The pictures don't affect me.
I just ignore them.
"You just take a tip and put the box away," says Victor El Hage when buying a cigarette box where a photo with a mouth tumor is printed.
Frankly, there's only one reason I'd stop, and that's my little girl.
James Yu, operator of the tobacco trade "King of the Pack" in downtown Sydney, says that the uniform packaging has made it difficult to fill its shelves.
"I used to take an hour to sort a delivery, now I need four," Yu says.
"The government should have just banned cigarettes completely - then we would have said well, that's it, we'll close," he adds seemingly exhaustedly.
In a constantly electrified world, it's nice to be bored once in a while
This Thanksgiving I unexpectedly spent five hours at the airport when our plane fell off due to mechanical problems and we had to wait for another pilot.
So I had enough time to think a few thoughts about boredom.
I don't want to lie.
Waiting half a day at the airport for a flight is quite nerve-killing - even when books, magazines and iPhones (and of course tax-free shopping) are available.
But more and more academics and child development experts are leading boredom as something positive.
When it comes to them, it is okay for us - and our children - to be occasionally bored.
This forces the brain to lose itself in interesting ways of thinking, which may promote creativity.
And because most of us today almost constantly stare at one screen or another, the benefits of boredom no longer benefit us.
So should we welcome the boredom with open arms?
Yes.
And no.
I'll come back to that again.
However many people, I have always assumed that boredom is a relatively recent phenomenon that has developed with increasing leisure time.
But Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at Calgary University in Canada and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011) doesn't think so.
"In fact, boredom has a very long history," he says.
Pompeii's walls adorn a Latin graffiti about boredom dating back to the first century.
And then there is the question of how we define boredom.
According to John D. Eastwood, an associate professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada, the problem is that boredom has been defined and discussed in many ways.
After a long reading of research literature and the presentation of the idea in front of a focus group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues concluded that boredom can be defined as the experience of "wanting to engage in a satisfying activity, but not being able to do so".
Boredom is therefore different from apathy in that the person is not busy, but wants to be.
On the other hand, there is no urge to do anything about the apathy.
The key experience of boredom, he says, exists in a "disruption of the attention process, coupled with a bad mood and the feeling that time is passing only slowly".
Boredom can listen to it almost as much as depression.
But Professor Eastwood believes that although these two conditions may be related, bored people see the problem in their environment or in the world, while depressed people see the problem in themselves.
Sometimes we think we're boring, even if we're having trouble concentrating.
In her study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention" - to German for example: "The Idle Mind: The Definition of Boredom Under the Aspect of Attention", which appeared in September in the journal "Perspectives on Psychological Science", Professor Eastwood and his colleagues point to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a volume on which a person was given a magazine article.
Some groups heard a loud television program from the neighboring room that had nothing to do with the content. Others listened to it at a low volume, so it was hardly perceptible, while the third group did not hear these sounds at all.
The people who heard the barely audible television said to feel more bored than the other two groups - they had problems concentrating, could find no reason for them, and admitted their difficulties of boredom.
If one tries to focus on a difficult or strenuous task, the disturbance of attention can lead to boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, Associate Professor of Neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, if you do a monotonous activity - "like the search for faulty products on a factory conveyor belt, music can distract and help not to feel bored".
In fact, he says, we now know that round tablets and chalks, often interpreted as signs of boredom, can even fight them by staying physically more attentive.
"Studies have shown that children who are allowed to fight around learn more and keep more information than those who are forced to sit still," says Professor Fenske.
We all get bored at some point - my late flight, a thunderous speaker, a particularly tiring movie.
But some people get bored more easily than others.
To measure these differences, researchers developed a "scale of boredom vulnerability" in the 1980s.
On the scale there are statements like "Many things I have to do, repeat and are monotonous" and "I have so many interests that I don't have enough time for everything".
Using such scales, researchers have found that boys are often bored than girls, says Stephen Vodanovich, Professor of Psychology at the University of Westflorida - especially in terms of the need for more and a greater variety of external stimuli.
But in general, teenagers are a rather tense bunch.
In 1991, Reed Larson, professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted almost 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day with a pager.
He found out that 32% of the adults in school and when doing homework were bored, whereas 23% said they were bored when they were not in school.
But only 3% of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson says today, 21 years later, he does not know whether the percentages of boredom have increased or decreased.
However, he is sure that "youth is found to be particularly boring", mainly because children and teenagers have no major influence on their everyday life.
So back to my question of origin: Is boredom healthy?
Sometimes not, because in extreme cases it causes people to take extreme physical risks and fall off gambling or drugs to alleviate them - that's what studies have shown.
On the other hand, many philosophers and authors investigate the relationship between boredom and creativity. This opinion is Professor Vodanovich, who has been investigating the subject for more than two decades.
"With boredom, the brain wants to tell you that something else should be done," says Gary Marcus, Professor of Psychology at the University of New York.
But the brain doesn't always know what to do best.
If you're bored and you use this energy to play guitar and cook, you'll be happy.
However, television can provide a sense of happiness in the short term, but these flee again in the long run.
So if your bored child reaches an iPad, it can get rid of boredom. However, it has not learned to entertain or control itself, says Professor Fenske.
And he adds: "Self-control is transferred from one situation to another".
The child not only learns to talk but also receives more self-control in other areas.
I don't think we should celebrate boredom.
Nor should we see them too critically.
Instead, our aim should be to feel at ease even away from the constant revitalization of activity and technology.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"It sounds like we have to be bored more often than not, but boredom is the painful, constant desire to do something meaningful," he says.
He believes that people are really just looking for a way to turn off and relax.
"In an environment where we are constantly overstimulated, it is difficult to get busy when the noise is once muted."
In Colorado there is no clear guideline for the new marijuana law
The 19-year-old Community College student and football player Anthony Orozco stands for a crime in the South East Colorado court, which will soon be legal in this state: the possession of a few less marijuana pieces and a pipe with which he smoked them.
According to Orozco, he and some friends were on a September day by car in Lamar near the border with Kansas when they were stopped.
After the police officer found marijuana in the car, Orozco was charged with possession of drugs and drug utensils - cavalry crimes, each with a fine of $100 - and was given a court date.
"We are treated like criminals," says Orozco.
But is he one?
In the uncertain weeks following the decision of the state to legalize small quantities of marijuana for self-use, the answer for hundreds of smaller drug crimes depends less on the law than on the location.
Hundreds of mischiefs that revolve around marijuana are already dropped here and in the state of Washington, which approved similar measures.
The police authorities no longer persecute adults over 21 years of age for possession to a small extent. This is permitted by law as soon as the new laws enter into force in the next few weeks.
But prosecutors in the more conservative districts of Colorado have announced that they will continue to prosecute existing marijuana crimes and still quote people in court.
At the same time, several cities, from the suburbs of Denver to the Western Mountains, agree to prevent new government-licensed marijuana shops from opening up in their communities.
"This situation continues so quickly that I don't know what will happen next," says Daniel J. Oates, police chief in Aurora, located east of Denver.
And regulators in the state of Washington are also rattling their heads.
They are waiting for guidance to set up a licensing system for the production, manufacture, distribution and sale of the drug - and have a deadline of 1 December 2013.
In Washington, one believes that Colorado is in any case ahead of most states as far as the regulation of marijuana is concerned. There, the drug was first legalized for medical purposes and then for personal consumption.
"Colorado has a more regulated market. The state is therefore well-suited to orientation," says Brian E. Smith, spokesperson of the Spirit Authority in Washington State.
But Smith also admits that no place or system can do more than serve in the sense of a rough guide.
"We don't have a real precedent that we can follow," he adds.
The Washington Act, called I-502, enters into force on 6 December and thus also forms the end point of a grey zone in which the state licensing system does not yet exist, but the property is legalized.
And unpleasant practical questions need to be clarified at this time - for example, how the government's "adequate access" to licensed marijuana is to be agreed with the ban of cannabis shops within 300 metres of schools, parks, playgrounds and childcare facilities.
"Nowhere will it be more difficult to find a location for a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, especially the Seattle metropolitan area," says Ben Livingston, spokesperson for the "Center for Legal Cannabis", a recently formed research group.
On November 21st, Chief Oates sent an e-mail to his staff in Aurora stating that the prosecutor would no longer prosecute minor marijuana crimes in people over 21 years of age, and that the police "from now on" would not seek criminal charges for these crimes.
Chief Oates added that the police will continue to enforce urban regulations for the regulation of medical marijuana growers and continue to persecute drug traffickers.
In Weld County in northern Colorado, District Attorney Ken Buck has a stronger view.
After the vote, he stated that his authority would continue to pursue cases of marijuana possession, mainly to move consumers to withdraw.
At present, 119 people are responsible for the possession of about 50 grams or less of marijuana in court, although many have been charged with other crimes.
"Our authority has a duty to prosecute crimes at the time of the crime," said Buck in a statement.
The reactions are even at places such as rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the district, no longer show adults for the possession of smaller quantities.
District Attorney Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, but he also decided not to drop all outstanding ownership proceedings.
"I don't think I'm wasting my time enforcing the law until it changes," he says.
Although 55% of the voters in Colorado supported the measure, it was clear from the outset that it would not be easy to reconcile the personal consumption of marijuana with the complexity of government and legal systems.
And the contradictory reactions throughout the state promoted a profound discrepancy among local officials in view of the great green experiment.
District attorneys are about a "cultural barrier," says Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver, who represents the accused in court for marijuana crimes and acts as a spokesman for the national organisation for the reform of marijuana laws.
"They have spent such a large part of their lives punishing people for not being able to accept legalization," he believes.
As the first countries to treat smaller quantities of marijuana like alcohol, Colorado and Washington are treated as national samples for the legalization of drugs.
While advocates and state officials are preparing for a period of legal sale, they are also nervously waiting for instructions from the federal government, which wants to continue to treat the sale and cultivation of marijuana at federal level as a crime.
Advocates of the Legalization Movement hope that the Ministry of Justice will yield.
Despite several startling arrests of consumers and salesmen of medical marijuana, the federal government has largely allowed the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
Kevin A. Sabet, former drug policy adviser to the Obama government, believes that while crime officials are unlikely to enter doors to confiscate smaller quantities of drugs, they are probably going to trodden under the new legislation to tolerate legal, state-regulated marijuana business.
Several cities in Colorado do not even wait for the federal authorities to act.
Even before the election day, some local authorities approved moratoriums for new marijuana businesses, although they could only open in about a year.
Last week Montrose, a city in the west, passed a six-month ban, which is likely to be passed next week.
"We don't want to get into a position where we license someone and then face a big problem at federal level," says Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council.
Our community has voted against this amendment of the law.
We focus on what the community has decided and not on what the state has decided.
Many questions remain.
Petronella Wyatt: I was bullied from Oxford because I am Tory
Not only university students today are attacked for their views
It has always been my biggest dream to get a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother had attended the university I once considered to be the greatest stamp of knowledge in the world for a modern Greek symposia that promoted the great pillars of civilization - free thinking and tolerance.
But within two weeks of my entry into Worscester College at the end of the eighties - there I had planned to study history - I had packed my suitcase again and brought the first scandal of my life.
My father broke down in tears.
My friends were confused.
In Evening Standard it was said that I had gone because I had a problem with having fellow students having sex in the neighboring room.
Author A N Wilson said that I had left the university because I was forced to drink from damaged cups.
But the truth was less amusing.
I ran away.
Yes, I was running because I was suffering from systematic bullying and threats.
Not because of my rather unusual name, or because I had come from a private school.
I had only been harassed for one reason - a reason which seemed so narrow and cruel in this alleged cradle of enlightenment: My now deceased father Woodrow Wyatt was an important adviser to Margaret Thatchers and I advocated the Conservative Party.
Why am I mentioning this right now?
Well, according to current reports, a new generation of moderated right students suffer from similar persecution.
The organized and increasing hatred of Tory students in Oxford has developed such dimensions that a group of them last week demanded the same level of protection for gays, disabled people and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Junior Common Room (JCR) of the Corpus Christi College state that they are "often actively isolated, personally attacked and declared undesirable due to their political views".
They call for a place on the equal rights committee of their college to ensure that their opinions can be expressed freely.
Her situation was exacerbated by a recent documentary about political students on BBC Two, "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right", which Tories represented as Eccentric and Neonazis.
Among other things, it showed graduate Joe Cooke, former president of the conservative student association of the University of Oxford, who drove in a Rolls-Royce and propped with silver suit and silver-set walking stick.
At other universities, conservative students say that they are considered to be "sin books for the introduction of higher tuition fees".
The 20-year-old Luke Black, vice president of the conservative student association of the University of Nottingham, said in a Sunday newspaper: "There is a growing left-wing trend at universities.
People think we're like the Bullingdon Club without even getting to know us."
Samuel Roberts, 21 and a history student in Corpus Christi, who initiated the request for greater protection, believe that such a climate is "disadvantaged". 19-year-old Stephanie Cherill, president of the conservative student association of Oxford, says that she has observed a growing disapproval of moderate right-wing students among JCR members.
"This represents a danger to intellectual discourse and to the well-being of members," she says.
In my first weeks at Oxford, I belonged to such a minority.
As an incredibly shy 18-year-old, I arrived in September 1986.
The hatred of the Conservative Party had reached its peak.
In the previous year, the university had voted not to award any honorary title to Margaret Thatcher, an former student, due to cuts in the university sector.
The atmosphere would even have frightened Stalinists.
In the first days of the first semester week, when new students met and the tutors, I got a taste of the future events.
I had the experience that the tutors were not only tolerating the ridicule of Tory students, but even taking part in them with joy.
Political issues such as the mining strike, the privatisation and rejection of the government of sanctions against the apartheid regime of South Africa have found their way into the wooded spaces of the tutorial.
At my first of these events, I was supposed to translate French texts from the 18th century into English. I was not prepared for what was to come.
"Miss Wyatt," said the tutor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph."
I stumbled.
Pitt was a little man with a face like cake dough, and pretty ugly.
"Do Thatcher followers refuse to learn French, or are they just stupid?" he asked me.
The other students peed.
Tears came up in my eyes.
"I suggest that they take a few French hours in your spare time - so if you're not too busy with your social activities," Pitt murmured.
I returned to my room with my head hanging.
That night I was sitting in college alone at dinner, when someone tipped me slightly on the shoulder.
It was an English student from the second year named James who imagined himself as a member of the conservative student association.
"I know who you are," he said kindly.
Unfortunately, it's like it is.
Anyone who is suspected of being Tory is being bullied.
It's bad enough for me, but they know your father's close to Margaret Thatcher, that's why it's gonna be worse for you.
Most Tory First Semesters pretend to be supporters of the Labour Party.
Later, in a local pub, I tried to imagine myself.
I insisted that I did not agree with Mrs. Thatcher on all points.
This trick should prove to be unsuccessful.
A student in philosophy, politics and business, who had ironically visited Eton College as a conservative, said to me, "You are the daughter of a fascist pig."
You're dirty.
Other students shared his opinion.
I was perverted and dirty.
"How do Tories have sex?" one asked me.
They beat each other, don't they?
I felt as if homosexuals must have felt before the more liberal legislation of the United States.
Would I ever manage to live a normal life at Oxford University?
Would I be able to meet like-minded ones only after the dawn of darkness?
Should I turn to the Labour Party and suppress my natural inclinations?
The three years that lay ahead of me stretched in front of my spiritual eye to a purgatory of retribution and isolation.
The only tutor who openly recognized himself as Tory was Norman Stone, Professor of Contemporary History, who had his seat in my college.
He was hated not only to be a conservative, but also because he had advised thatcher on foreign policy and had written speeches for her.
He was only rarely there.
He hated the place, found it provincial and petty and rejected it for his Marxist-determinist history perspective.
In 1997, he received a professorship at the University of Bilkent in Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he told me.
I began to commute between Oxford and my parents ’ home and found refuge with more open friends and family members in the city.
My father told me that I hated Oxford and why I did it.
He seemed unbeliefful.
During his time in the Forties, all political views were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said.
They would never do such a thing, not in my city of dreaming tower peaks.
Even my Communist friends always displayed impeccable manners.
His wet eyes were drenched.
Give it a chance.
I'm sure they'll just fuck you.
It would break my heart if you left.
Tired out by my frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance became weaker.
One of my male friends, also Tory's followers, had given up the pressure and renounced his beliefs.
During a tutorial the following week, in which another historian had seriously claimed that I was "an enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
Although I was secretly disfigured by shame, I admitted that my parents had subjected me to a "brainwash" and called her "old fool".
The relief lasted only a short time.
It was my father who beat the last nail in the coffin of my Oxford career.
At that time he wrote two columns a week in the Murdoch press.
My door was locked.
I hid in my room, and after five minutes my hares gave up.
When they left, I packed a suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never returned.
You'd be happy to call me a whimsical slut.
But no 18-year-old should ever suffer from such intimidation and malice in an educational institution.
And even more tragic is that it was Oxford - a university that not only produced 14 Tory prime ministers, but still hides behind an undeserved call of equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance of fame"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino - Master of Couture", which was opened this week in London, ABC talks to Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous customers of the Italian fashion maker.
Somerset House, the former residence of Isabel I of England, is the only place in the British capital that is worthy of hosting an exhibition about Valentino Garavani.
This was recognized by the designer at the opening of "Valentino - Master of Couture", a magnificent retrospective for which more than 130 clothes of the Haute Couture have been put together, created by his "Maison" in the past 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says with his unmistakable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story whose only protagonist is "il signore" Garavani, who could not have been written without his distinguished clientele.
Valentino has always felt fascination for the stingy and distant world of the nobility.
In the first room of this exhibition, which will be on display until March 3, there are a variety of private letters and photos with the signature of the most exquisite aristocracy, beginning from Princess Salimah Aga Khan, and the Princess Marie Chantal from Greece and Margarita from England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino shows these personal memories as trophies of his social rise from the modest fashion maker in the city of Voghera in northern Italy to the idol of the international jetset.
To be in love with the nobility does not have to be of disadvantage.
"At least they don't step out on your magnificent carpet, as some beautiful celebrities from pop music do," says Baronin Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 1960s and 1970s, the two lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular, generous and elegant host.
"We were all happy when we were invited to his house in Gstaad," explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, close friends with forgotten beauties such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred the elegance of fame.
And yet he's a star.
Valeria Mazza, in a dress by Valentino
The Argentine model Valeria Mazza also does not forget the charisma of the fashion maker.
Many years ago we went home for dinner after a fashion show at the Piazza di Spagna in Rome.
We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
Every detail of his apartment, decoration, food and music was recognized and felt his influence.
"All invited people felt important and loved," remembers the "Top Model", which began their career at the Week of Haute Couture in Paris in 1995.
"He never comes out of fashion because his designs are artworks," she concludes.
Fashion show of origin
The life of Garavani is not a story of oblivion, rather of mutual love.
He likes people with good education and the highest titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries in Somerset House has been transformed into a glorious and 60-metre-long runwalk that proposes a roll change: the user takes the place of the model and walks along the runwalk to admire a dreamy "audinz" that carries masterpieces of Valentino, such as the dress that Jackie Kennedy chose for her wedding with Aristóteles Onassis, the costumes that Monica Vitti wore in "La Notte", or a coat of wool and leather that belonged to Emperor Farah Diba.
In this audience of fashion dolls shine names such as those of Sibilla de Luxemburgo, Gloria of Thurn and Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sofía of Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the fashion maker, 2006
Many of these customers say that the first Valentino is like the first love, "unforgettable".
I remember perfectly.
It was a trousers, a shirt, a vest type "gillette" and a jacket from the autumn/winter collection 1971-1972.
"It was a gift from him," says Naty Abascal, one of the designers' museums.
"I prefer him to everyone else because of his great love for women and because he emphasizes our beauty," adds Feria's ex-Ducal.
I like the colors he uses very much; they have a lot of light and underline the face.
The proportions are perfect.
Also the princess and opinionist at the fashion Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg cannot forget the first time she wore a Valentino.
When I was a teenager in Italy, I dreamed of finally having the age and the opportunity to wear one of his evening clothes...
Finally, at the end of the 1990s, it was added.
I bought myself my first Valentino dress for a feast in my father's castle, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress with flying skirt and a draped top with a décolleté that makes his name honor.
"It was a true dream," says the widow of Rodrigo d'Arenberg.
"Valentino does not depend on fashion, its obsession is timeless," explains these Italian aristocrats, who live between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D'Arenberg keeps her evening dresses of the fashion maker "with absolute care", "because a dress is not only a dress, but also the memories associated with it".
The "King" of Fashion
The grand finale of the exhibition in Somerset House is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress for her wedding to Pablo de Grecia in 1995.
Four months of work and 25 "Ragazze" (as the fashion maker called his closer steps) were necessary to make this ivory silk dress with beads, twelve different embroidery and a four and a half meter long tail.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the top authority of the specialist press, this dress was a milestone in the Haute Couture at the end of the 20th century, "the return to the customers of the highest society".
For years with the "savour-être" of the elite, Valentino is now her best copy.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (Italy's highest prize), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, awarded with the Legion of Honour, Garavani cumulates as many honors as each of his clients' husbands.
"I have always noticed his refinement, his calmness, his well-kept and perfect appearance," D'Arenberg admits.
I saw him last time a month ago at a gala dinner at the Museum of Orsay.
He was sitting at the table of Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a very good friend of mine.
"He was impeccable; time leaves no trace of him."
And this is what a princess says...
The most difficult occupation in the world: the human labor animals of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the carriers of the Indonesian volcano risk their lives and their health if they carry 70 kilos of sulphur over the steep, rocky roads.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and others work literally in hell.
This is the case with Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn their lives by extracting sulphur from the Kawah Ijen volcano in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
For this, it has to climb down to the bottom of its crater every day, where the sulfurous gas that flows out of the earth attaches itself to the air in contact with it.
After breaking out large sulphur stones that weigh up to 70 kilos in total, he transports them in two bamboo baskets on his shoulders over the abominable stone paths.
It is only 250 meters to the top of the volcano, which rises to a height of 2386 meters, but the exhausted carriers need more than 40 minutes for the ascent at the tortoise, while maintaining the balance and carefully setting their steps so that they do not slip out and crash.
They know that every step can cost their lives, as happened to a French tourist who fell down on the steep slopes of Kawah Ijen years ago.
The miners of Kawah Ijen earn 5 Eurocents for each kilo of sulphur they mine.
At the top, they pave the way between the tourists who photograph them like circus monkeys and walk with the tiresome heavy baskets three kilometers to the scale, which a mining company has set up a little further down at an altitude of 1850 meters
The company is PT Candi Ngrimbi, who since 1960 has exploited the deposits in the volcano and (never better said) its workers, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 Eurocent) for each kilo of sulphur.
It then sells it to the petrochemical industry for every 10,000 rupees (83 Eurocents) because this mineral is widely distributed in everyday life and is used for the production of matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even bleaching sugar.
"Since we normally carry 70 kg, we get about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each way," explains Anto, who normally makes three routes a day.
For each route it takes three hours to complete it, but at the end of the day it has 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros).
What looks like a miserable wage for such a seemingly inhuman effort, however, is the triple of what he would earn with the field work.
"The daily wage of the miners here, where 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) are paid a day at the coffee harvest and the average monthly income is two million rupees (167 euros), is very high," explains the carrier, who previously worked as a bricklayer on the tourist island of Bali.
There he earned 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day, and the work was not as hard, but Anto has returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village nearby, and that for a reason as important as the sulphur in Indonesia: "I have married a Bali girl where they are Hindus, and I have brought her to Java to convert her to Islam."
Anto has asthma, breathing with difficulty, coughing frequently and his eyes are irritated by the poisonous gases.
For three years, 27-year-old Anto has been risking his life on Kawah Ijen, whose sulfur has already left the first traces of him, even though he covers his face with a mask and special glasses.
Anto has asthma, breathing with difficulty, coughing frequently and his eyes are irritated by the poisonous gases from the volcano.
This is the price he has to pay for the attainment of his dream.
"I will work here for two years because I want to open a shop or learn Spanish or French," he promises in more than just acceptable English.
This sympathetic and intelligent but life-punished young man could work as a tourist guide, waiter or at the reception of a hotel, but instead he does the work of a tragedy.
He splits a dirty wooden hut with other carriers and stands up every morning at two o'clock, because the sulphur also pours out at night, where his characteristic yellow color shines blue in the darkness.
Challenging the shadows, he climbs into the crater in the light of a small headlight on his helmet, which he bought from his own money.
About 400 carriers load the baskets on their shoulders on the crater floor with sulphur.
Despite its large profits, the mining company has not mechanized the mining of sulphur in order to save costs, and does not provide any equipment to the carriers who work on their own account and are paid by weight.
You will also not receive a share of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) supplement per camera, which the guards of this nature park, along with the entrance fee of 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros), require from the tourists who come to photograph the volcano and the human carrier.
"This work is for the animals and not for the human beings" protests Madrusin, a tribal, 42-year-old carrier who has been working at Kawah Ijen for three decades since leaving school.
He is able to carry up to 110 kg and assures that he continues, "as long as it goes" because he needs the money for raising his three children between 10 and 18 years of age.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano was my whole life.
Even if the sulfur burns the throat and the eyes itch when the wind suddenly turns and the miners stick into the thick columns that rise from the crater, the men are so hard that no one complains about serious diseases ... of course, except for the usual breathing problems, arthritis, pain in the knees and blisters on the shoulders that have deformed themselves from the weight of the basket.
With the basket on his back, with its 53 years, Unainik is only able to carry 50 kg.
Every day he and his companions break 15 tons of sulphur from the volcano, which are transported by three trucks over a goat path between the bushes to the camp in Tamansari in 18 kilometres.
"I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano was my whole life," explains Unainik, opening his mouth wide, with some teeth missing.
Of his five children, the elder also works as a sulphur carrier at the age of 30.
Time passes, but poverty keeps generation after generation in one of the toughest occupations in the world: those who work as human donkeys on Kawah Ijen.
Singapore needs babies to save the economy
The Singaporeans blamed them for not having children on the career, stress and cost of real estate and child education.
"The population of Singapore must grow."
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife: we fulfill our civic duty and we create lives!
It seems unlikely that the verses are part of a advertising for mint bonuses, but nevertheless - or precisely because of that - they became a viral video on YouTube at the beginning of this year in Singapore.
The sentences are part of a rapper song, the local sayings such as "Move is a "bao" (Laib) in the oven to make fun of the low birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising company BBH, which has filmed the video, keeps the hope that the advertising spot can be reached in a funny way to draw attention to the problem.
Her creative director Douglas Hamilton says that he wanted to use the power of music to get people to fulfil their "national duty".
This is something only for the Internet, so we had to make it funny and funny.
This is the biggest problem in this country.
When it comes to reproduction, we are the worst in the world, so we noticed that this is a topic that we had to deal with.
We knew that the government had tried a lot, such as the marketing of perfume with pheromones or the organization of speed dating evenings (fast flirting).
Possible that many of these ideas were creative, but they did not necessarily lead to success.
So we thought, why don't we do something as creative as possible to tackle this problem, such as composing a rap?
1.2 Children
Those who do not take this issue lightly are the government of Singapore.
Every year it spends $1,300 on policy measures to encourage citizens to have more children.
A government package for couples and parents grants up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But everything has had little success so far.
Singapore is a rich, high-tech city state in south-east Asia, also known for the conservatism of its rulers and its strict social controls.
According to his national population authority, the birth rate is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time this rate was over 2 - which is also known as the replacement rate - was in 1976.
So why don't the Singaporeans have more kids?
Tan Wei Ming, Director of Marriage and Family Policy of the National Population Authority, says that this is due to "better training" and "larger career opportunities".
"This has made it possible for people to have much more options in terms of life goals and to set priorities besides marrying and forming a family," she explains.
These changes in social conditions have contributed to the higher number of single persons and to the delay in marriage and births, the result of which is the reduction of the birth rate in Singapore.
In the meantime, an immigration policy aimed at a drastic increase in immigration in order to counter the decline in the population led to resentments among the local population.
In Singapore there are websites where the barely cascaded Xenophobia is flourishing against many new immigrants, especially against the Chinese, who are criticized for keeping their wages low and not integrating themselves.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why the Singapore Government Party achieved its worst election result since independence last year.
Since the elections, an attempt has been made to correct the problem of higher contributions and contributions for foreign workers.
Unexpected Consequences
While the falling birth rate has a well-known impact on the economic growth of a nation, tax revenue, health costs and immigration policy, the example of Singapore also shows unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to reach that not so many small apartments are being built.
It has already had an impact on the housing market.
The Urban Development Authority has begun to control the number of small apartments known as "shoe boxes" and may be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have a living area of 46 square meters and show great sales success.
However, there is concern that they can promote the lifestyle of the single and that they deter the construction companies from building large homes for families.
But Lim Yew Soon, Director General of the real estate company EL Developers, says that his "shoe boxes" can be sold much faster than larger housing units.
They are so popular, and the units are sold out by days and even weeks faster than the larger housing units.
This means that they are much better for our cash flow.
He admits, however, that the new standards give the developers clearer orientations, which were previously placed in the way of obstacles if they wanted to build too many small housing units within a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city state.
Even if these new rules could pave the way for an increase in the national birth rate, talks with the Singaporeans working in the financial district can be seen as having little effect.
"People are very stressed, housing and education are expensive, which is why it is pushed out by many," says a young manager.
The children can have others.
"It is important for me to have my own money and time," says another, about twenty years old man.
Men and women lead their careers, stress and the cost of ownership and education as reasons why they cannot have children.
That is why the Singaporeians have the last word when it comes to having children - the government can still do so much.
The offline private offline is online private
Privacy
According to the dictionary, this is the property of private or "the area of private life in which one is entitled to protection from any kind of interference".
What's private for someone under 16 years old?
How is this definition applied to everyday life and social networks?
Does he understand the dangers he is exposed to when he makes known on the Internet situations that he would not share in real life?
El Periódico interviewed five young people aged between 10 and 15 who are often on the net.
In four of the cases, they associated the term with "something very personal" on a personal level and "to the password and the user" when they applied it to the social networks.
"My deepest secrets would not be revealed in a post," says the 10 year old Jorge trying to explain the meaning of "private" in websites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has accounts for two years.
"These are very confidential secrets, my mother may know them, but not the whole world," he confirms.
On FB I upload beautiful pictures or images of games.
I also sell my time with acquaintances.
"I wouldn't share a photo that's not mine, or someone who makes the stupid head," he says.
The boy is aware that it is wrong to publish obscene photos, naked photos, crimes, or write offensive or violent comments.
Jorge assures him to know 35 friends he has in F.B. and nine followers in Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
Including the mother who has the password to one of the accounts.
I signed up for Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if anyone will answer me, I'll just upload them," he adds.
"The social networks are entertaining, I can talk quickly to relatives in the distance or with friends," he says.
When asked, he replied that he would never accept an invitation from an unknown.
Even if someone recommended a stranger to him, he would ignore this.
The case of 14-year-old José is different.
The teenager has user accounts in Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask. In Ask he admits to not knowing 20 of the people he has added to his list of friends.
"This doesn't scare me because we have something in common, for example music," he says.
After the boy was given, no one gave him any clues or asked him for his address or telephone number.
"If someone's pushing me or asking her for me, I'll just get him out of my user account" he admits.
José joined Ask after he had read a recommendation in Twitter.
The boy is not unknown experiences that are known today as cyberbullying.
The friend was blackmailed in a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He never knew who it was," he assures.
According to José, the victim didn't close the user account.
"He only did it privately."
After that, he explains a number of steps to safely configure a user account.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yeah, I'd do that if he was unsympathetic with me or if I wanted to wipe him out.
"But I know this is cyberbullying," he explains.
Key issues
Marielos Porras, a teacher of English with a degree in education and learning, believes that in order to orient children and young people, it must be understood that it is the purpose of social networks to inform.
"The Internet was created as a medium for the search for information; but with the publication of these pages the rules of the game have changed," she says.
Porras explains that the academic Marc Prensky, holder of a master's title in pedagogics at Yale University and author of the "Digital Natives and Immigrants" work, formed these terms to explain the phenomenon.
The digital natives are the children and young people who have grown up with this technology.
"We are the digital immigrants who are supposed to teach them where we are still learning ourselves," he says.
He explains that this is a complex issue, "because we demand them to have a defined criterion on what may be spread, published or said, and this at an age where maturity is not sufficient."
"They should also be elective if it is most important for them to be popular, to have thousands of friends, without thinking about the consequences," he adds.
According to the expert, the most effective way to teach children and young people what is privacy is to ask them questions that make them think.
"To tell them not to do it doesn't work," he says.
Porras then mentions some possibilities: There are things you wouldn't tell a stranger. Then why do you do it on the Internet?
Or: Would it please you if you published a photo of you, such as what you published from a friend?
Do you know what the others are publishing about you?
Have you asked the other people for permission before when you labeled photos of celebrations?
And one more question: does everyone have to know what you're doing at any moment?
Another point is to give them that they need to act online as they do offline.
They're the same rules.
"Someone outside the Internet is acting with respect, morality and other principles, and the same must apply to social networks," he explains.
Monitoring
Estuardo Guardia, University Professor, Primary School Teacher and Educational Advisor, comments that it is essential that parents carefully read the guidelines of the social networks.
When they understand all sections, they have solid foundations to talk to their children about the importance of opening one user account on the Internet.
"Example the age, or what you can share or publish," he explains.
According to Guardia, the children must be reminded of the lesson "Don't talk to strangers".
Finalisation of the Unasur Summit without publication of the Lima Declaration
The 6th Summit of the Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru without publication of the Lima Declaration, previously announced and to be theoretically signed by the seven governments present.
Efe repeatedly tried to gain access to the signed document at the VIth Ordinary Meeting of the Heads of State and Government of Unasure. Sources in the State and Presidential Office initially informed that they would hand it over after the Klausur, however, thereafter stated that it would be published at a certain time on the website of the Peruvian government.
In the case of questions about the text, they stated that the content was presented to the press by the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala.
The access of journalists to information on the summit was limited at any time.
During the day in the press room only the picture of the president's meeting without sound was transmitted with the message "private session, limited audio".
The few information circulated among journalists was received by the press speakers of some of the governments present at the meeting, but not by the Peruvian press spokesperson.
The only document distributed during the day was the list of the participating presidents, which caused discomfort to hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who asked for more information.
Afterwards, the Presidential Office of Peru sent the media an e-mail with the "final declaration" of the summit, but this was the Humala declaration and not the official document for the conclusion of the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the Third Summit of South America - Arab States (ASPA), and the so-called Lima declaration that was announced earlier was not published in spite of the press's strong call.
On the official website of the ASPA you can be sure that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities stressed the existence of information systems for journalists, but to a large extent limited access to information.
The summit also ended with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to adopt a ruling by the Court of Justice of The Hague, which settles a border conflict between the two countries.
The Presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the regional meeting and confirmed that they would accept the decision of the IGH, which begins on Monday in The Hague, in the trial that Lima initiated against Santiago to hear the pleas of both sides.
"We will follow and execute the judgment on the differences we are currently presenting to the International Court of Justice," said Humala together with his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile was, is and remains a country that adheres to international law, seeks peaceful solutions to disputes, concludes agreements and submits to international courts," added Piñera, and greeted Humala with a handshake in front of the flags of both countries.
The two Presidents confirmed that they would submit to the IGH, after Colombia had brought an action against the Bogotá Agreement after a decision on the maritime borders with Nicaragua, which considered it a serious mistake, which agreed to submit to the judgments of this International Court.
At the summit, the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina were Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, which has been excluded from the Unasur since 2011 following the resignation of its President Fernando Lugo, did not attend the meeting.
Hosted President Ollanta Humala opened the talks in the morning and ended the summit shortly after lunch in Lima.
The Head of State left the final document stating that 16 decisions were taken and the lines of action for 31 projects between the South American countries were set at a total investment of 17 billion dollars.
On the decisions taken, he said that the countries of the Unasure "will take significant steps towards the goal of South American citizenship, to which we will extend the decisions on residence rights."
He said that measures would be taken to "improve cooperation in the fight against urban uncertainty and organised cross-border crime, as well as measures to improve access to drugs and the Internet at low prices in all areas of South America and to act jointly and efficiently in the event of natural disasters".
With the crisis in Europe, "economic consolidation (in Latin America) must not take triumphant steps, but should serve to expand our production performance and show our peoples a better future," added Humala.
"We have decided to give priority to a number of 31 emblematic projects aimed at improving the spatial links in South America and especially in rural and border areas... thus uniting our countries and opening up new economic forms," said the Peruvian President in a read statement.
Among these projects were also five Peruvian who were on the intersections of his territory from the coast to Brazil, and two of which were to ensure a better connection with Ecuador, although he did not give any further details.
The final document also referred to the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve for its resumption in the Union of South American Nations", from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain an integrated region for prosperity and peace and with good neighbourly relations was another aspect highlighted at the summit.
In this sense, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before taking part in the regional meeting that he expected a meeting on Saturday in Mexico with his counterpart of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, to treat the maritime conflict respectfully following a judgment of the IGH that was challenged by Bogotá.
"Maybe I will meet with President Daniel Ortega tomorrow (Saturday)," Santos said.
"We will check all these ways - they are not exclusive, and the agreement with Nicaragua also makes talks with Nicaragua necessary," he stressed.
"I hope to be able to tell President Ortega that we will deal with this matter as civilised and respectfully as possible," Santos added.
Santos and Ortega will meet in Mexico on Saturday, where they intend to be present at the office of the new President of this country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
As part of the summit, the Defence Ministers of the Block met in advance to adopt the 2013 Action Plan, which aims to strengthen dialogue and consensus on the defence of the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are members of UNASUR, even if the latter country is currently excluded.
Peru has the presidency at the time of the regional block.
"South America must learn to integrate its citizens," says Rafael Correa
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, today confirmed that the creation of a common citizenship is an objective, with "South America can actually learn something from Europe."
Correa, who attended the 6th summit of the presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which took place in Lima, explained to the state television in Peru that Europeans "killed themselves in the second world war and in other conflicts" and "today are practically a fatherland."
In this sense, he defended the project of creating a South American citizenship that drives the member states of the Unasur.
"The free movement of citizens and workers must be achieved in all South American countries, as is already the case in the Andean community; however, there are still reactionary sectors that seek to return to the past," he warned.
The President of Ecuador also supported the reform of the Organization of American States (OEA) with the aim of reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states and taking into account those who have signed the San José Convention on Human Rights.
Those who teach never commit to anything, and in return we always sign everything to the South Americans.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Human Rights Commission has its headquarters in Washington and is financed by the United States," he said as an allusion to the political asylum that Ecuador has given to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Correa assured him that he did not regret this decision because he had not betrayed his principles but had complied with his "deep democratic values and views on human rights".
He added that at the time there had been "founded presumptions that Assange would deliver to a third country and not comply with his procedures."
He also criticised the Swedish justice system, which required him to undergo an interrogation on his territory for an alleged sexual offence, while "Swedish jurisprudence allowed this by means of a video conference which could have been carried out via the Embassy of Ecuador in London."
Correa explained that there was a risk that Assange's health and mental condition would be affected.
"Since he was in our message, I haven't spoken to him, but the ambassador informed me that he has a slight problem with his lungs, but not a serious one," said Ecuador's head of state.
However, there is a danger that he may take physical and mental damage because he is trapped in a narrow space and cannot perform physical exercises outdoors.
"This would affect the health of every human being," he added.
Correa stated that the solution for the asylum granted to Assange since June in the Embassy of Ecuador in London was the granting of a free letter with which he could travel to Ecuador, and that this was in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe. He underlined that there had been talks with London to find a solution for the imprisoned founder of WikiLeaks.
We are not dealing with human rights, we are not using this word in this case, but there have been constant discussions.
"The solution to this problem lies in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities, because the lawyer of Assange, Baltazar Garzón, conducts a number of proceedings at various European bodies," he said.
And "if Britain grants this release tomorrow, this is done in my opinion."
And if Sweden interrogated Mr Assange at the Embassy of Ecuador in London or on Skype, how it allows Swedish case law and in other cases was done, the problem was solved.
Correa took the opportunity to confirm himself as a defender of the freedom of the press and said that what he does not tolerate is "the mediocrity, the evil intention and the lie that detracts from the free expression of opinion."
"The biggest enemies of press freedom are not the evil and perverse politicians, but bad journalists who strive for profit and blackmail," he said.
In this sense, he congratulated Ecuador for no longer being dominated by such journalists "and neither by the banks or hegemonic and spear-bourgeois countries," and anticipated that in a re-election he would "deepen the revolution in order to continue the path in this right direction."
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto against Paraguay in the Unasur at least until his next elections, arguing that the organism "must remain hard and not allow opportunism and no one to be regarded as a legally disguised coup d'état" because it "destructed the legitimacy of democracy in Paraguay."
The President of Ecuador also considers that the request of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, now and after the judgment of the International Court of Justice of The Hague, which favoured Nicaragua's maritime sovereignty, to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime borders between the two countries is "absolutely justified."
At present, this judgment is not being implemented.
It is a problem between a South and a Central American state.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome in the pursuit of a common path.
They must be treated in a comprehensive way so that they can be overcome and looked forward.
He also relied on a good conclusion to the dispute over the sea borders between Peru and Chile before the same Court of Justice and said that "it is right for Latin America to call on international bodies if both countries undertake to accept the verdict even if it is very harsh."
With regard to the possibility that he will stand as a candidate for the next presidential elections in Ecuador in order to reach his third term in succession, he stated that he sees this option "with much optimism and joy, although sometimes it also falls very hard."
Correa assured him that if he lost the elections in February 2013, he would withdraw from political life.
I have never personally been interested in power, but under as unjust circumstances as in Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
"My political movement believed that I was the one who guaranteed this likely victory, so I have to shoulder this responsibility," he said.
If I were to win, it would be my last period as president, after which I withdraw from public life.
This also applies if we lose.
"That's decided," he explained.
Correa also referred to the treatment of the health problems of the President of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, in Cuba.
I just spoke to the Vice-President of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro, who told me that he had gone there for a planned routine treatment, and that he would be expected to travel back to Cuba after the election campaign.
"It does not in any case mean a relapse in the state of health of President Chávez," he commented.
The Ecuadorian Head of State attended today in Lima at the 6th Summit of the Heads of State or Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which ended with the call for higher regional integration in order to ensure sustainable progress, equality and security.
Cause of death due to AIDS is today too late detection
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed by the results of the study: HIV positive.
"It was as if a bomb hit," he says about the moment he received the diagnosis that the doctor tried to "weaken" without recognizable success.
He hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness alone and began to inform himself about it; and this with such a commitment that he just celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients in the HIV unit of the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), into which he came after several battles in 1994.
Fabrizio has been living with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) for 22 years, which was hard to imagine at the beginning of the 1990s when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigmata.
At that time, the director of a clinic of the IMSS avoided saying goodbye, "because it led to a dead end."
At that time AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today it is possible to survive this syndrome even with quality of life.
However, many people still come to the clinic who know nothing about their disease and in which the virus has already done damage and exhausted their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the emergence of AIDS in the world, i.e. after the occurrence of the first reported cases, "the great success today means that the survival of a patient who starts the treatment in time and the survival of the general population is exactly the same," said the head of the HCG HIV unit Jaime Andrade Villanueva, saying that this information was supported by a respected scientific publication in April of this year.
The expert on infectious diseases and HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that since 2008, the scientists concluded that although AIDS was not a death sentence, the years of survival and quality of life depended on the degree of impairment of the immune system of the individuals at the start of treatment, and that those greater chances that are not drug-dependent: up to 30 years with a count of 200 CD4 and 50 years with a count of 500 CD4.
To put it simply, the above statements mean that anyone who receives HIV positive at the age of 25 "can easily become 75 years old as long as he is under control," said this expert.
In order to fit this progress properly, it must be remembered that today the life expectancy of Mexicans is an average of 76 years.
Even if mortality has decreased significantly in recent years (in Mexico, the number of people dying of AIDS has decreased from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (ONUSIDA annual report), it is nevertheless true that since the emergence of AIDS, 60 percent of the patients recorded in the national database have died.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and by May of this year there are already 187 deaths; however, it is assured that there has been universal access to antiretroviral medicines since 2005.
- So why do people still die from it?
- In my opinion, the problem is not access to treatment.
This is my opinion, and so is our hospital.
At least in the past 12 years we have had no health care problems with the drugs. The problem is that people get into a very advanced state because they do not know their condition of infection, i.e. in very late stages of the disease.
He makes a striking statement: "Nine out of ten patients come to us if they already have an accompanying infection. In order to influence global mortality, early diagnosis is required, which is why all people who need it must be offered massive recognition tests."
This proposal was approved by the experts and officials of the Consejo Estatal de Prevención del Sida en Jalisco (Coesida) (State Committee on AIDS Prevention in Jalisco) and also by the patients such as Fabrizio, who had his test carried out at a private laboratory, for the sole reason that it had made a friend of his who, despite his young age, was already in the AIDS phase and even had the Kaposi sarcoma (a cancer-like tumor), which is one of the usual complications.
Everything's different if you know you have AIDS.
Some think they will die, and don't want to hear anything.
"If I have to die already, I'd rather burst three times," they say in my case.
The change was to improve, I eat well, exercise and take the medications.
Today his parents only know that he had cancer.
I live a normal life, like anyone else.
"I work, do a lot, have an active but responsible sex life, I pay attention to my health and that of the other person," Fabrizio notes, who agreed to share his intimate details with MILENIO JALISCO in order to animate with his testimony those who are afraid today in the context of the global AIDS day.
They should take the test if they belong to the risk group. The sooner they know if they are HIV positive, the better, and if they already know the diagnosis, they should learn how to live responsibly like all people.
His message is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the barn table
Major gaps exist between the health programmes and the simple citizen, explains Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara, who has accepted the HIV issue.
And the most important thing is prevention.
In the places "the distribution of condoms was actually increased; in the past they were given individually, now they give us packages with a hundred pieces, which is already good, but there are still people who do not have access to a condom," he said.
Young people are at risk for new infections.
"Why do you need this?" is a common question of social workers, guidance staff in schools, pharmacies employees and in the health system that young people do not want to put up with, the correspondent assured.
He proposed to reorient this inefficient distribution; the condoms should be located not only behind the barn table, but in public toilets of facilities frequently visited by young people.
It is not intended to promote promiscuity.
They are not to be paid the beer and motel, as Governor Emilio González replied to the question as to whether he would be placed on a provisional basis under his administration.
"Sexuality doesn't look like that; it's best to bring the condoms closer to those who already engage in sexual activity," he brought it to the point.
Key data from Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The state lies nationally in the fourth place of new and cumulated AIDS cases, and in the 13th place of HIV.
92% of infections occur via sexual intercourse, 6% over blood, and 2% perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people live with HIV because there are 4 or 5 people registered for anyone who does not know.
After the United States Court of Appeal has confirmed a judgment that does not recognise the restructuring of the liabilities of the Vitro Group, which has been reached through a trade bankruptcy in Mexico, an unwholesome precedent is created for each national company with branches in the neighbouring country that has payment problems.
It could therefore be said that in the country of the stars and stripes, the procedures for the survival of companies which allow the Mexican laws are not valid in contravention of international agreements.
In practice, the recognition of the judgment given on 15 June by Judge Harlin Hale at the Bancarrotas court for the northern district in Texas leads to the Mexican companies being left helpless to seize their property beyond the Bravo River.
However, the decision opens the door and door to the largest glass manufacturer in Mexico to appeal to the United States Supreme Court for three inconsistencies.
While the judge points out that creditors must be subject to the bankruptcy law of the United States, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeal, based in New Orleans, first says that the main proceedings are the commercial bankruptcy dealt with in Mexico.
The first point would mean that international cooperation in insolvency proceedings of companies with a cross-border profile is not known.
To this end, the United Nations Model Law was created to bring international trade law into line, with the American Law Institute being used as a facilitator.
Second, the judgment states that, without the voting rights of the companies, after recognition of the liabilities in the bankruptcy mass held by Vitro's branches with their parent company, the necessary majority for the restructuring of the liabilities would not have been achieved.
However, this possibility is recognised by Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro is not the first case in which this scheme was approved.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose liabilities were confirmed by the Instituto Federal de Concursos Mercantiles (Federal Institute of Commercial Bankruptcies).
It is also true that, after the votes of the branches, the creditors of Vitro, the creditors who complained to the courts of the United States against Vitro, i.e. the vultures funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, had not reached a majority.
The vote would have been 45 per cent versus 37 per cent.
This is not taken into account by the appeal court.
On the other hand, Vitro is guilty of his difficult situation since 2008 in the context of the major economic crisis in the United States, which gave the country blows.
For this reason, the González Sada family is opposed to the same appeal court so that the vote in plenary takes place, i.e. from all judges, because only three of them voted.
If it is not accepted, the Cerciorare appeal, which requires the review of the proceedings by a higher court, is lodged by the Supreme Court of the United States.
The main point in this case is that the court left aside a document sent by the Government of Mexico under the Figura amicus curiae (Friend of the Court), which describes the proceedings conducted by Vitro under the Commercial Bankruptcy Act, and points out that it had strictly adhered to the agreements signed by both countries in order to comply with Chapter 15 of the bankruptcy law of the United States.
It should also be noted that the country has been subject to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the established rules for cases of cross-border indemnity guaranteeing equality between debtors and creditors.
Two-band carambola: a blow for Vitro and for the country.
General balance sheet
After the announcements by the Mexican air transport unions against the former owner Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, who is accused of fraud, did not come forward for several months, the Asociación Sindical de Pilotos Avianores (Federal Union of Pilots) finally made progress.
The request made by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau has now filed criminal proceedings against the National Banking and Securities Commission, which is accused of obstructing justice.
Subsequently, the supervisory authority has systematically refused to inform the head office of the Republic of a transaction carried out by the entrepreneur in order to withdraw from Bank IXE’s Trust Account the name of Mexicana de Aviación 198 million pesos.
These funds were used for the acquisition of shares of the Administradora Profesional de Hoteles (the professional hotel management).
As you know, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
Dragon Mart is surrounded
At a weekend meeting at a forum at the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, academics, entrepreneurs and general members of civil society decided to create a broad front to resist the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancún.
As you know, we are talking about a huge sales and sales center in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean with products from beyond the wall, complemented by a residential area for the employees of 150 companies.
In advance, the Canacintra (the national chamber of manufacturing industry) has achieved the unification of the governors in the south-east in order to resist the monumental institution which partly destroyed protected areas and represents the mother of all the threats of industry.
ACTA is dead
Because the government has signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, which is known under the English abbreviation ACTA, under what conditions and circumstances the Mexican ambassador in Japan has not complied with, the matter has already been archived in accordance with the Mexican Institute of Intellectual Property.
As you know, these measures took place even though the Senate had disregarded the possibility because it considered them to be a violation of the free expression of opinion in the social networks.
Homex long-term
In an effort to pay long-term liabilities without affecting the short-term liabilities, the construction company Homex brings stock market certificates to the market of over 500 million pesos.
The issue is the first of four same issues that promise an interest payment every 28 days.
Establishment of Competival
Established by NYCE, e-Quálity and Kernet, leading information technology companies, a group of companies has been set up under the name Competival, whose objective is the service market of the software clusters in Central and South America.
The corresponding investment amounts to over 1.5 billion dollars.
Héctor "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
Héctor "Hetin" Reyes, the world-bummer of basketball, was connected to basketball for more than 60 years and has travelled the whole world.
Few in Puerto Rico have such a large spiritual collection of the history of the country's basketball as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
Before being tied to the wheelchair by a stroke in 2008, Rexes was part of this sport for six years, whether as a player of lower classes, player of the first national league, agent and leader of the BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or president of the basketball association.
"I spent my life putting on a lot of hats in basketball, even several at the same time when I was President of the BSN, Chief Executive of the National Team and President of the Association in the 1990s," Reyes recalled when visiting Primera Hora at his home in Bayamón, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes does not exaggerate with this statement.
The walls of his house are almost all decorated with photos and memories of his long career and testify to them.
Bayamón in the heart
The most emotional memories are those that recall his time with the Vaqueros from the mid-50s as a player until 1982, where he celebrated his 15th anniversary as co-manager or managing director of the club.
"These were my best years that I enjoyed most because I was allowed to be part of eight of the Vaqueros championships since 1967 as Managing Director, Co-Chairman or Trainer.
It was many fulfilling years, including the five consecutive championships from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to a championship in 1981, the year of Jerome Mincy's debut at BSN.
From then on, "Cuco" took over Ortiz, who was a very good administrator," says Reyes.
I remember Gene Bartow, who worked here as a coach and worked at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said: "I have a very powerful and 2 m large player.
Do you want him?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico ever had.
Bartow then recommended the freelance specialist Raymond Gausse, who was one of our best pitchers.
I remember how he said that if Mincy had allowed a championship for Bayamon, Gausse would take care of another one.
The Vaqueros Championship with Gausse was awarded to him, but already out of a distance, because he was already in the top position of the Association in 1988.
At that time he preferred to enjoy his executions and those of Mincy in the national team.
I remember when we first won against the United States at the pre-Olympic tournament in Mexico.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we took fourth place, which should have been bronze, if not that Canadian referee who had allowed us to repeat the last move for the second time, Reyes said.
Was this group of the 1990 World Cup the best national team you've ever seen?
She is one of the best, as was the one who won the 2004 Olympics against the Dream Team.
But my favorite is the team of the 1991 pan-American games in Cuba, where we won gold and offered the team of the United States a fight, as they did when they won against us at the world championship bronze.
Not only were Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), but also the young players (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not attend in 1990 because of a knee injury.
A team that was perhaps not the best in terms of personalities, but with which we won a gold medal and which brought us great joy, was that of the 1995 pre-Olympic Tournament in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players such as "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitin as a substitute for the locked players due to the events on the Pan-American games in Mar del Plata, we won the gold medal against every prognosis.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
That was no doubt Piculín Ortiz.
His figures at the level of international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated on this level as much as Piculín.
And this, without taking into account his career in the different leagues in which he played.
Who was the best coach from Puerto Rico?
That is a difficult question.
We had a number of good trainers like Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
Of the boys, I like Leo Arill's work.
What do you think is the best you've achieved in the League?
I was part of the most successful era of the national team from 1988 to 1995, which included the BSN at the beginning of the 1990s up to 17 teams in one season.
What else do you have to do?
There are things I would have introduced, such as the regionalisation of the lower categories.
That the boys play in Ponce e.g. only in their territory and only meet in the national playoffs on teams from other corners of the island.
Today, the children make unnecessary travels and games.
At least I see the result of the required training and courses for trainers, table officials and referees.
I'm proud of that.
What are you doing today?
I like to listen to music, watch videos of music of my time in YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and occasionally go to a basketball game.
And of course I enjoy the company of my wife Isabel, who was always with me.
Larry Hagman is dead.
Larry Hagman was born on 21 September 1931 in Forth Worth (Texas) and became world famous with his role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R". in the television series "Dallas", where he played a unscrupulous, unscrupulous and manipulous businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the oil magnate J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, is dead.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who came back this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas", died Friday afternoon due to cancer complications according to a family press release to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., producer of "Dallas".
"Larry was back in his beloved birthplace Dallas, where he once again played the iconic role he liked most," said the family.
The family of Larry and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for the celebration of the Thanksgiving.
Linda Gray, who played the role of his wife in the original and subsequent series, was with Hagman when he died in Dallas Hospital, said her journalist Jeffrey Lane.
He made everyone who knew him happy.
He was creative, generous, funny, funny, loving and talented, and I will miss him very much.
"He was an original person and lived life in full accord," said Gray in a communication.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992, and he admitted that he had been drinking a lot over the years.
In 1995, a malignant tumor was detected in his liver, and he underwent a transplant.
In the years before "Dallas" Hagman became known on television as a nice guy from 1965 to 1970 with the sitcom "Magnificent Jeannie" at the NBC television station.
There he played the astronaut Tony Nelson, whose life is put on the head when he meets an attractive "Jinn" (played by Barbara Eden) who will live with him at home.
He was also an actor of two comedies that were broadcast only for a short time, such as The Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His cinema works included well-rated roles in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his masterful interpretation of the adorable J.R. that made Hagman a superstar.
The dramatic series of the CBS television chain about the Ewing-Clan and other figures in its surroundings was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The advertisement "Who shot at J.R.?", which was supposed to create expectation for an episode full of emotions, where Hagmann's figure was almost killed, led to international speculation, and millions of dollars were bet in bets.
The series thus reached an audience record at that time.
When the answer was announced in a chapter in November 1990, it was seen by an average of 41 million spectators who turned the "Dallas" into the second most viewed entertainment program since the end of 1983, which had 50 million spectators.
It was Kristin, the sister-in-law of J.R. (interpreted by Mary Crosby) who had shot.
J.R. had swayed her and threatened to represent her as a prostitute if she did not leave the city. But others also had reasons to want to see him dead.
Hagman interpreted the role of Ewing as a corrupt, insatiable man with a charismatic smile: an insidious businessman and infidel husband who sought to have his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray) expelled.
"I know what should be on the tombstone of J.R.," Hagman said in 1988.
It should be called "Here rests the honourable citizen J.R. Ewing".
This is the only business he didn't win.
Victoria Principal, co-star of the original series, remembered Hagman on Friday as an "enormous personality on and outside the screen".
He is unforgettable and irreplaceable to millions of worshipers in the world and remains in our hearts, who have been lucky enough to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast with great success in the TV channel TNT a few months ago.
The recording of five chapters for the second season was completed, and a sixth chapter was just turned, the sender informed.
There was no immediate explanation by Warner or TNT about how the loss of Hagmann was treated in the series.
Born in Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who played classic works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a teenager when she got Larry during her marriage to attorney Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck at the theater stage in New York in the early 1950s, then served in the air forces in England from 1952 to 1956.
There he met and married the young designer Maj Axelsson.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in the Californian city of Malibu, where many celebrities live.
In 2001, he named his memoirs "Hello Darlin: Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
"I didn't write anything that I believed could harm or harm someone," said the Associated Press back then.
After the liver transplant, he worked for liver donations and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist distressed patients.
"I advise them, give them courage, I will meet with them when their operations are imminent and afterwards," he explained in 1996.
I want to give them some comfort, for example, "don't worry, it's a little uncomfortable the first time, but you'll be fine."
He also opposed smoking and participated in several campaigns.
Beginning of the course that studies the "End of the World"
Every week, students study apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, virus and germs and global warming.
Every semester, when the professor of religion decided to take a course on the end of the world, he knew that he had an irresistible fishing hook: the end of the Mayan calendar's "long backward count" on December 21, of which many people believed it meant the end of the world.
But Charmé had no idea what he should expect in the following two months: the destructive hurricane Sandy, some of whom have called "Deudarmagedon", and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place of which the Christian theorists believe the Apocalypse begins.
"I haven't noticed that this will be the most apocalyptic semester that ever existed," said Charmé this week to students at Rutgers-Camden University (New Jersey).
If someone were to analyze what happened today in the world as if we were 30 days away, this would be a really good period.
And he reminds us that the bad is good for those with apocalyptic mentality.
And he is not the only professor who is offering courses on the "end of the world" this semester, which was supposed to be the last one in history.
In Temple, Professor Barry Beautiful gives the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World."
Every week, students study apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, virus and germs and global warming.
"We analyse why these ideas spread over time," he said, as well as the way in which hypothetical scenarios are offered that lead to a certain human behavior.
If nuclear material gets into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.
This month, students analyzed films with apocalyptic content and examined how they could be compared to real life.
"I have tried to inform students about what is possible, likely, credible and impossible," said Vacker.
On the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, the professor of Latin American history Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an associate professor of art history and anthropology, formed a team to offer a course called "The End of the World".
"We do not take up 2012 so that we always keep the option to stop the course in case the world does not go down," Restall said.
Despite the "preliminary downfall", students must study, create projects and participate in final examinations.
In Penn State, the final exam will be held on the eve of the Apocalypse, which is why the students have no other chance to "go on working until night, where the world is supposed to end," said Restall.
The courses were very popular.
"In two hours there were no more places," Restall said about his course for students with a high average who filled up with 35 students.
For weeks before the start of the semester, we received e-mails from students who asked if there were any places left.
The students, for their part, assure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"It's fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves," said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student in Rutgers-Camden for religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey.
The apocalyptic sectarian or religious mentality is actually just a matter of comfort or its lack.
The 25-year-old student Will Wekesa for psychology and nursing explains that he has seen all apocalyptic films.
"I have never heard anything of a lesson where this is taught," he said.
I enjoy it.
But none of the students interviewed - and less a professor - said that they believed in the last date of December 21.
"Our first project dealt with the prophecy of Mayas, and in a certain way we discredit them," said Julie Zegelen, a student last year in Temple, 21 years old and from West Chester.
The Mayas never predicted the end of the world; it is only a key point in the calendar, Restall said.
He notes, however, that in Western society there is an apocalyptic fear that takes centuries back when people reacted to changes in their environment with the prediction of the end of the world.
The Internet has increased these speculations.
"In other places people don't think so," he says.
This is mainly the case in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at the University of La Salle, who teaches in the Philippines this year, quickly answers the question of whether he would know a course there on the "end of the world".
"The Philippines do not participate in the end of the world," he wrote as an indication of an exception to a higher authority.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall pointed out that over the years many days were spoken by the last court, and said that if nothing happened on December 21, "people immediately think about a new date" or philosophized that the 21st December was the beginning of a seven-year period after which the end of the world would come.
Students and professors take this date easily.
Several said that they want to go to celebrations about "the end of the world".
"Maybe I'm calling a few friends so we can laugh together," said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old student for communications.
