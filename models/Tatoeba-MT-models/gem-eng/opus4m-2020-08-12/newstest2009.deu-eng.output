The Prague Stock Exchange is going to cut back on business.
After the steep waste in the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange was able to correct the losses.
The transactions with the shares of ČEZ reached almost half of the normal day-to-day business.
At the beginning of Tuesday's business, the Prague Stock Exchange started to break in from Monday, when it dropped by another six percentage points.
This time the reason for the break-in was on Wall Street.
In the Czech Republic, too, the reaction of the market to the outcome of the vote of the American House of Representatives, which had refused to support a stabilisation plan for the financial sector there.
Stocks in Asia
On Tuesday, a dramatic case occurred in the stock markets in Asia, although the indices were able to offset some of the losses during the day.
The Hang Seng Stock Exchange index in Hong Kong lost almost four percentage points during the business day, but was able to offset some of the losses later, thus decreasing to about 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index, which observes the movement of Chinese shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, fell by 3.8 percent, and in Shanghai the markets were closed.
Shares on the Sydney stock exchange lost more than five percent, but then lost to 4.3 percent.
The Taiwan stock exchange fell by 3.6 percent according to the index there.
"The timing for the rescue action in the United States is uncertain and will affect the financial markets worldwide," says the head of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong, although it belongs to China, determines its monetary policy itself, i.e. independently of the Chinese Central Bank.
Interest rates in Hong Kong are at the same level as those in the United States.
In the words of Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, the American legislators should return to the negotiating table as soon as possible and adopt the draft for support of the financial system.
Otherwise, other countries would also be affected by the invasion.
A bloodbath of American shares
On Monday, the American House of Representatives rejected the plan to support the financial system, for which up to 700 billion dollars (almost 12 trillion Kč) should be spent.
The legislators thus ignored the invitation of President George Bush to support the plan.
In Bush's view, the plan would regulate the fundamental causes of the financial crisis and thus help to stabilise the entire economy.
The American shares experienced a bloodbath on Monday, and the most important stock indices recorded the biggest burglary in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones Index dropped by almost seven percent, and it had recently recorded a similar burglary in 1987.
The index had already fallen before the vote, but there were hardly any indications that the draft would not get through in the House of Representatives, the index experienced a free fall.
Congress concedes: US government can pump $700 billion into banks
The senior representatives of the American Congress and the government of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form of a grant agreement for the US financial system.
The vote will take place at the beginning of next week.
In discussions on the adoption of a rescue plan in the form of a grant for the US financial system, the American legislators achieved a breakthrough of 700 billion dollars (about 12 trillion crowns).
However, this does not mean victory.
Congressmen must negotiate some details of the agreement before they can publish and vote on the final version of the law.
The plan to support the financial system will be negotiated at the American Congress on Monday.
On Sunday, the chairman of the Committee on Banking and Financial Services, Barney Frank, said this to the Agency Reuters.
According to the Senate, different figures could probably be voted on the plan at the earliest on Wednesday.
Economists argue that a communication that the plan is being adopted should be the first major psychological factor in boosting financial markets.
After that, however, there is a "disillusionment" due to the complicated mechanisms, how to help the markets in practice as well.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made significant progress.
We have clarified our differing views on how a package to stabilise the market should look like," said Democracy Nancy Pelosi to the Bloomberg agency.
According to your words, there could still be a final vote on Sunday.
Representatives of the legislators met with American finance minister Henry Paulson on Sunday to give the government fund its final form.
This provides for the purchase of unsaleable mortgage assets by financial corporations that plunge the financial corporations into severe losses and endanger the stability of the entire system.
"We are on the verge of a definitive agreement on a plan that will work and that must also be effective on the market.
You have to continue the recovery plan even further, but I think we are on target," says Paulson.
A signal for Asian business
The global financial crisis is also strikingly falling in the stock markets.
According to the words of the Democratic Senator of Nevada, Harry Reid, the legislators were trying to reach a final agreement before Sunday at Congress.
This is to reassure investors in front of transactions in Asian financial markets, which are located in the first time zone, where a Congress decision could affect the business on Monday.
So far, however, it is not quite clear when both chambers of the American Congress will vote on the law, nor is there any doubt as to whether the negotiations could still fail at the last minute.
The legislators hope that it will be adopted in the next few days.
However, the law will still experience some changes.
The total amount allocated to help the system is to be divided into two parts.
The initial 350 billion dollars will be made available as soon as possible, as President George Bush requested.
But Congress can block the distribution of the rest of the money if it has the impression that the program does not perform its function, at a further 100 billion dollars and later the final 350 billion dollars.
Bush assesses progress in negotiations positively
Although the President has a right of veto in this decision, the Congress may vote in favour of his veto.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the programme has remained based on obtaining finance for the purchase of bad mortgage securities whose value has fallen because hundreds of thousands of Americans are no longer able to repay their mortgages.
"We've worked everything out.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on Sunday on the law, the Senate then on Monday," said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
The American President Bush was also pleased with the progress he made.
His spokesperson Tony Fratto said that Bush was satisfied with the progress of Saturday and "estimates the mutual efforts to stabilise our financial markets and protect our economy".
Limitation of golden parachutes
The Chairman of the Banking Committee of the Senate Christopher Dodd, the Chief Negotiator, was told that the legislators had agreed on a responsibility for the money programme, the protection of taxpayers from losses, the conclusion of discounts and a timetable for financing the plan.
The new law is also intended to restrict the so-called golden parachutes for directors of companies involved in the programme and to set up a committee to supervise the fund.
The Ministry of Finance is responsible for this.
"We have worked very hard on this and achieved a great progress towards an agreement that works and is important to the market and to all Americans," Paulson said.
The plan also expects help for homeowners who have problems with the repayment of their mortgage.
The government should negotiate new rates for mortgages that it buys, with the aim of reducing the monthly costs for debtors and allowing them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological help
According to Patria Finance David Marek, the proposed plan is a good idea, but implementation will be very difficult.
"That's why you don't know by what mechanism and at what price the problematic assets are bought up.
This will be crucial for how the financial sector and the government share the losses among themselves," said Marek to the iHNed.cz server this week.
Whether the plan is adopted now or at the beginning of next week is not decisive, in Marek's view.
"It is much more important that Congressmen agree to support the plan and that they adopt it as soon as possible.
The psychological significance of the agreement that there is a adoption is the most important thing at this moment," said Marek.
Duel on Messer's cutting: MP3 player against cell phones.
We will advise you on your choice
While almost every mobile phone can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can still make calls.
That's why, of course, it looks better just to buy a phone.
In spite of everything, there are enough reasons why an independent player should be added.
The choice depends entirely on the type of use and the claims of the future owners.
Certainly you hardly buy yourself a great expensive record player at home to listen to Maxim Turbulenc's latest album.
Once such musical innovations do not appear on LPs, and from a qualitative point of view there is no objective reason for them either.
However, if you have LPs with Art Rock, Jazz or Blues on the shelf, you probably dream of at least one.
This is also the case with the music on trips, i.e. with compressed music, expressed simply - music in MP3 format.
Here too there are price and quality categories.
For one, it may not be acceptable to spend eight thousand crowns for a player, but also a Pink-Floyd fan will probably hardly withstand headphones for twenty crowns from the market.
Two extremes, between which there is enough space for everyone.
The selection is wide.
The life of the batteries is also crucial.
Some good music players can play much more than just music, but what mobile phones can do doesn't even create them in a sense.
No modern device can be used as universally as the phone.
In addition to the primary functions, the telephone and the swimming, it can play music and videos, both recording, it has a better, sometimes a worse camera and may also be able to navigate.
And if you still include the smartphones and communicators, you have almost a small computer in your pocket.
It's a little miracle, because no fridge can grill and no TV.
But the universality of mobile phones also brings disadvantages.
The more features you use on your phone, the more often you will have to recharge it.
And playing music is one of the greatest energy eaters.
Only a few mobile phones can play music for more than ten-twelve hours, mostly it is much less.
In this respect, music players (especially the simplest) are significantly more powerful.
Therefore, you should expect the cheap phones to play music for no longer than a few hours.
If you call from time to time, you'd rather buy yourself a charger for the office for safety - this also applies to more expensive devices.
With MP3 players you will not have this problem, even the less good keep at least 9 hours of uninterrupted operation with one time charging out.
There is another problem if you want to transfer the music to your mobile phone.
Unfortunately, only a small part of the devices have a USB record, and not every mobile phone can be connected directly to a PC without special software.
Of course, you can transfer the music directly to a storage medium, but only a few card readers will finish without any reduction with the tiny memory cards used in mobile phones.
For players, you do not need any special software except for exceptions (iPod).
You only need to feed the device via USB port with music from your PC.
Most mobile phones and players themselves set up a music library, ordered by the name of the performer, the title of the album, the genre or, for example, the evaluation by users.
Some devices only represent the tree structure of the address directory, similar to the Windows Explorer, some can both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, intelligent phones with operating system).
Players are easier to use, mobile phones can more
When selecting a specific device, you should in particular check the battery life, storage capacity, quality and type of sound and, of course, the operating comfort.
Is music especially setting for you and listen to it every day just for a short time, for example in the tram, then an arbitrary mobile phone that plays MP3 files is enough.
Which really can be almost any cell phone.
You don't have to control which music formats a mobile phone or a player can handle.
MP3 create all, and most of the music you get will be just in this format.
The format is one of the most widely used, and most devices can also play music in WMA format.
Less common is AAC (a format that uses Apple and its iPods).
Better mobile phones also enable the purchase of music online.
You only need to access the corresponding pages of a provider (or another provider) via mobile Internet, and you can already purchase a song or album.
This service can already be a striking argument for why you should add a music handicraft.
Unfortunately, the provider's offer is bad and usually only limited to fast radio hits.
Prices are not the lowest either.
In general, however, it is assumed that this kind of music sales (about GSM, Internet or wireless Internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
The cell phone carries most of it.
If you want to listen to something, grab the phone in the jacket pocket while the player is at home.
It depends, however, whether you always carry headphones or at least a wireless intercom.
If not, you can use the integrated speaker, which has almost every mobile phone, but only the least MP3 player.
The biggest advantage of the music handicrafts will probably be in the price for many.
The cheapest usually cost less than three thousand crowns.
For three and four thousand crowns you already get a very decent walkman.
The biggest handicap will be for most people that no normal headphones are present.
The best and technically matured phones with a 3.5mm opening for normal headphones cost up to fifteen thousand crowns.
The advantage of the player in turn lies in easy operation.
The simplest - and not necessarily cheapest (see selection) - player can really use anyone.
A minimum of functions that are similar when operating with the previous normal cassette recorder or, for example, the record player is obvious.
There is no danger of a collision in the form of an erroneously employed mobile Internet and a subsequently horrifying bill for data transmissions.
What device should you use now?
Also the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for removable storage media (type M2, microSD, etc.).
Even if you buy a corresponding card, two thousand crowns are enough.
But respect.
For base models, only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB are usually supported.
Only the most expensive can also read 8-GB memory cards.
If you already have a mobile phone and want to buy a cheap MP3 player, then go to Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB) you do not have to place more than 1100 crowns on the table.
Be among the more demanding listeners, take more specialized mobile phones - Walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some of Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have separate operating buttons for MP3, and the operating comfort comes to the one single MP3 player.
Sony Ericsson, whose mobile phones from the Walkman series have the same user interface as the single MP3 players sold.
The same services in the same price category of up to four thousand crowns, but with a higher storage capacity (up to 16 GB) and a long battery life (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours) provide you with MP3 players of the above mentioned manufacturers.
The first virtual provider is already coming to Czech Republic this year.
Maybe.
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite mature, the Czech providers offer virtually all services, as they are also offered by their partners in Western Europe.
Nevertheless, something is missing here - a virtual provider that forces the classic at lower prices.
Maybe he won't be waiting long.
We have often reported on Mobil.cz on the fact that the Czech mobile operators work at all to the most expensive in Europe.
Incidentally, this was confirmed by the ČTÚ Telecommunications Authority, which pointed out that the price for a text message here is higher than in the rest of the European Union.
Following the last steps of the European Commission in regulating roaming charges, there is likely to be a paradoxical situation - for some customers of Czech mobile phone providers, SMS from abroad will be cheaper than at home.
How is it that prices in the Czech Republic are so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, it lacks the competition that really makes a fight.
Perhaps it sounds paradoxical, because in the Czech Republic there are three mobile networks and a penetration of well over 100 %.
Mobile providers, on the other hand, like to scoff at the fact that there is an extremely high level of competition in the Czech market.
The chairman of the Czech Telecommunications Authority Council (ČTÚ) Pavel Dvořák, who had often stated in the past that there was no room for any other provider in the Czech Republic.
It is probably true that a classic provider with its own network no longer has much chance (by the way, it would probably hardly find any frequencies).
But there is still one possibility - a virtual provider.
The entry of virtual providers into the mobile market led to a significant price reduction, which the classic mobile operators had to react to.
Before such companies such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile entered the UK market, there were voices similar to those in the Czech Republic.
However, it has been shown that there is room for such providers and that they can be really successful.
By the way, one does not have to look for examples for long.
In February we reported on the launch of the virtual provider Mobilking in Poland.
In just half a year, this provider managed to win more than 100 thousand customers and thus rise to the country's fifth largest provider.
The financial group Penta, which owns U:fon in the Czech Republic, is behind Mobilking.
The advantage of virtual providers is that one can focus on a much more specific target group.
In order to function effectively, virtual providers need much less customers than a classic provider.
They do not need a relatively high cost for the construction, operation and maintenance of a mobile network.
In the world, virtual providers are usually seen as low-cost companies - they offer cheap phone calls and SMS, which is often accompanied by a less extensive service offer.
For example, Tesco Mobile in the UK offers SMS at least half cheaper than its competitors.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can also be a pretty good move to put on a non-scrupulous target group.
This provider is specifically aimed at men.
"Real guys choose Mobilking - the provider they like and trust," says David Seibert, CEO of the Mobile Entertainment Company, the operator of this virtual provider.
It is difficult to say whether a similar approach could be adopted in the Czech Republic as in Poland.
The press spokesperson of Vodafone Miroslav Čepický also doubts this: "The Czech market is relatively small for a market segment on which most virtual providers are based.
In addition, it is relatively saturated from the point of view of the service offer."
In the Czech Republic, mobile phone providers say no chance
However, it is almost certain that if a virtual mobile phone provider Czech Republic conquers, this will not be Mobilking.
"We are talking about an expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic the negotiations do not look particularly hopeful.
Mobilking will enter the market in other countries of our region," says a phone call for Mobil.cz Jana Studničková, press spokesperson of the financial group Penta.
Indirectly, she confirmed that the current mobile operators in the Czech Republic are not particularly inclined to this idea.
On the contrary, they try to do everything in their power not to create a potential competitor.
Their interest in starting a virtual mobile phone provider has long shown the group GTS Novera, who wants to take another step to become a real competitor of Telefónica O2 in the area of corporate customers.
"We have a great interest in offering our customers not only fixed network, but also mobile telecommunications services.
And the sooner, the better.
We have repeatedly negotiated this possibility with all Czech mobile providers.
With some of them, we have already been able to achieve negotiations," said the press spokesperson of the Pavel Kaidl Group.
Maybe we'll have better times now.
Non-official information indicates that the first virtual provider may be expected by the end of the year.
But so far this is surrounded by an insurmountable wall of silence.
"At this moment, we do not assume that there is room for a fully-fledged virtual provider in the Czech Republic.
The Czech market has a high degree of specificity vis-à-vis other markets.
So far, no subject has addressed us with a complex and serious project in this area," says Mobil.cz Vlastimil Sršeň from the Telefónica O2 press department.
Other suppliers also point to the specificity of the Czech market.
The press spokesperson from T-Mobile Martina Kemrová adds in rare agreement with the O2 statement: "So far we have not found a viable and mutually beneficial project on which to build further."
And she adds: "T-Mobile's network will hardly show up as a virtual provider until the end of the year.
At this moment, we would already have to have a concrete offer to be able to think so in the short term."
Vodafone focuses its attention on meeting the requirements of its own 3G licence.
Miroslav Čepický says: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual providers, especially in the area of sharing costs and infrastructure.
This is precisely what we regard as the best from the point of view of customers.
The main strategy of Vodafone in this area is the search for a partner to build a shared network for a fast mobile Internet."
The responsible authorities - hand in hand with the suppliers
The approach of mobile operators is easy to understand, another provider called more competition, this would lead to lower prices and thus also to a decrease in profits.
So why make it easier for such a competitor to enter the market?
The fact that suppliers can draw on a strand when it comes to something also demonstrates the long time to come about the emergence of U:fon.
Probably the strongest pressure towards ČTÚ came from the company T-Mobile at the time when U:fon came into the market.
This is also evidence of the publicly available information from the ČTÚ websites.
But now U:fon is right as an argument why you should not allow a virtual provider.
Martina Kemrová commented: "The competitive environment of the mobile market has recently also been strengthened by the market entry of a fourth mobile provider.
Taking into account the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that a new player would place high demands on the market itself and, above all, on its services."
In view of this approach of mobile operators, however, the absolute disinterest of the Czech regulatory authorities is astounded.
This is not just the attitude of ČTÚ, which, unfortunately - unlike the UK and other highly developed countries - does not have the competence to intervene in economic competition.
The latter shall have sole responsibility for the protection of economic competition (ÚOHS).
This, however, related to this whole problem his very typical attitude.
"The market entry of a virtual mobile provider would then be possible after a contract has been concluded between a mobile provider and a virtual provider through the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
So far, no such contract has been concluded, as the offer of potential interested parties was probably not sufficiently interesting for the classic suppliers," says Kristián Chalupa from the Department of External Relations of the ÚOHS in his reply to our request.
Such a formulation would not surprise representatives of the suppliers.
This is more than questionable by an authority representing consumer interests and, inter alia, by ensuring that no one abuses its position on the market.
In particular, if Kristian Chalupa adds: "In foreign countries, where virtual providers work quite normally, it can be seen that their market entry has contributed to a price reduction in mobile telephone services."
However, the pressure on the correct functioning of the market and a fall in prices are probably not among the interests of the ÚOHS.
In this case, it is really shocking to note that the three mobile operators are almost already in a state of harmony, which results from their reactions.
The question of whether it really is just a coincidence is obvious.
Just as the absolutely same petrol price at the gas stations is certainly just coincidence and the result of a hard competition.
"The Authority has not discovered any evidence of anti-competitive action in this matter and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way in the matter.
None of the providers has a dominant market position, so it does not have the corresponding increased responsibility for its market action.
The necessary instruments for opening up the mobile market to virtual providers are probably also missing from the regulatory authority for telecommunications," said Chalupa in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many contentious points.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets, prepared by the ČTÚ, according to which telecommunications from the point of view of economic competition is a single market.
In such a market, of course, none of the Czech mobile operators has a dominant position.
However, some legal experts offer a different view - the agreement of the network operator is always necessary for the market entry of a virtual provider.
And the mobile provider has - logically - the monopoly for its network.
This means that it necessarily takes a dominant position in a particular segment.
However, even if you do not agree with this argument, it should be at least a warning for the ÚOHS that three mobile operators are acting in a similar way.
Complaints from a number of interested parties (including the mentioned company GTS Novera) show that they encounter very similar obstacles when negotiating with all suppliers.
In the telecommunications services, the shift of responsibility to the ČTÚ is a rather common trick, with which the ÚOHS distances itself from the whole issue.
This has already been observed in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, in the recently adopted amendment to the Telecommunications Act, the extension of ČTÚ's competences to the field of economic competition in telecommunications has not succeeded, although a number of experts had promised to improve the situation.
The representatives of the ÚOHS only have to know this too well, but they probably have other interests.
It's all right when no one's looking.
First of all, the functioning of any pseudovirtual provider, of which there are several in the Czech mobile networks.
It is companies which issue their own price lists for mobile telecommunications services, but which are only partially public.
Usually they are companies operating in the field of multi-level marketing.
Own mobile phone services offer, for example, Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and others.
The price lists of these companies are usually only available to selected ones.
The joke is that the company appears to the operator as a classic company customer who orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important customer, he then receives special price offers (and other offers).
The problem is that the terms and conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit a similar type of resale.
"If there are cases that you describe, then it may be a breach of the contractual conditions with which we will then deal, which may lead to the termination of cooperation with the relevant society," answered Martina Kemrov to our question on this problem.
However, it is quite unlikely that such a thing does not go hand in hand with the controllers of mobile telephony providers.
Especially in the case of the three companies mentioned above, they can be thousands of customers.
However, no operator opposes such action.
In fact, from the activities of these companies, profits are not too negligible, and at the same time, unlike the actual virtual providers, they are not affected by the actual official marketing.
Miroslav Čpický draws attention to possible problems: "The law allows for such kinds of speculation, despite everything, the services of these companies are used only by a very small percentage of customers.
They also have to accept that the SIM card in their phone does not run on their name, so they cannot fully possess it like the normal customers of the mobile phone providers."
This alone, however, the ČTÚ should at least seem strange.
In addition, another question opens up for the ÚOHS.
Before such action, mobile operators close their eyes, why do they block themselves against a virtual provider?
It is to be added that the ÚOHS has quite strong competences to discover such activities, and if it does not want to, it does not have to be satisfied with the declaration of the providers, they do not know any of them and their terms and conditions would prohibit this.
When the Czech Republic is no longer the most expensive
As already stressed several times in the text, the market entry of virtual providers brought with it a significant price decrease in the various services.
In practically all countries where virtual providers have developed, the classic providers have tried to prevent their emergence virtually more or less.
The arguments used by them were practically identical - too small or too saturated a market, problems in the quality of services, etc.
In the highly developed countries, however, the regulatory bodies in these moments intervened, which did not in any way seek to safeguard the interests of mobile operators but of their customers.
If it was through formal measures or non-formal pressure, they achieved that the first virtual operator was created, and this was followed further.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory bodies are throwing themselves all over the place like a hot potato.
Based on our experience, we cannot lose the impression that in these cases ambiguity in the competences is more than favorable.
But let's not throw the flint in the grain.
If the background information is correct and a virtual provider appears soon, the Czech mobile market may soon be resuming.
If a provider allows the creation of a virtual mobile provider, the ÚOHS will not remain inactive when it comes to rejecting (discriminating) other interested parties.
And the Czechs will finally not call more expensive than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four versions of the new Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek presented the new recordings of the National anthem Where is my home country on the occasion of the Czech Statehood Day in a celebration.
The anthem was re-recorded by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions available - with male or female solo singing, in choral version and in an instrumental version.
The song version took over Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka.
The editors of the anthem versions are Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček.
On the iHNed.cz server you can listen to all four versions immediately.
For Bělohlávek the Czech national song is one of the most beautiful anthems.
Earlier he had told the Czech radio that he had chosen singers with young, representative voices for the solo variants, which are striking and popular.
"From the beginning, I tried to keep a clear diction with both and then with the choir, so that one can understand the text well so that a harmony can be achieved," says the conductor.
The Czech National Anthem will celebrate its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Kde domov můj resounded for the first time in 1834 on the stage of the Standetheater in the original Czech piece Fidlovačka by Josef Kajetán Tyl, the music was by František Škroup.
It became popular, and people took it spontaneously.
The first verse of the song became an organic part of the national anthem after the emergence of Czechoslovakia in 1918.
One of the seven symbols of state remained after the emergence of the independent Czech Republic.
How does the "new" anthem sound?
The Prague transport companies will also transport a chip on Wednesday for the first time.
Wednesday, 1 October 2008, will enter the history of Prague's transport operations as a date on which the first passengers will enter a subway, tram or bus, carrying an electronic coupon in their pocket instead of a paper ticket.
These can currently buy about one hundred thousand people who own the Opencard chip card.
Passengers can buy a 30-day, 90-day or annual coupon (valid from 1 January 2009) and simultaneously play it on their smart card, in the information centres and branches of the transport companies at the underground stations Muzeum, Můstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zhrada, Kačerov and Luka.
The coupons have also been available on the website of the transport companies www.dpp.cz since yesterday.
The service was used by over four hundred customers until the afternoon.
Those who use Internet sales can really forget the output window in the subway stations, where they have had to wait regularly for their paper tickets in long queues.
You buy the coupon on the Internet, it is played on the Opencard in one of the thirteen branches of the city library.
"At these places there is also a switch with trained staff at your disposal, which advises interested parties when buying the Internet and also plays the coupon on the map," says the speaker of the Martin Opatrný project.
In addition to the libraries, you can also play the electronic coupons on self-service vending machines on the Opencard, which are installed in some metro-vestibüls.
What do such vending machines look like?
They are red, reminding of driver's license devaluers, the passengers may have noticed them already in the subway stations Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"There are currently five of them in the city, but until the end of the year it should be eighty," Opatrný adds.
The coupon controls a machine instead of the driver
The operation of the machines that will work from tomorrow is easy.
All you have to do is insert the chip card, and the previously acquired coupon is self-playing.
The electronic coupons will apply from tomorrow not only in the capital, but also in the surrounding area.
So in the suburbs and on the bus lines with numbers 300 to 499, with which the inhabitants in particular from the municipalities of the region of Central Bohemia reach the capital.
"In the trains that are part of Prague's integrated traffic, the train attendants have reading devices that allow them to check the validity of the coupons according to time and zone," explains Filip Drápal of the organisation Robid. This organisation is responsible for preparing the timetables for Prague's transport operations.
The suburban buses have card readers at the driver's checkout.
When entering, the chip card must not only be shown to the driver, but the open card must be placed at a marked point on the side of the checkout.
The driver thus controls the validity of the played coupons.
"If a passenger wants to check the validity of the played coupons, nothing is easier than asking the driver for this information," says Drápal.
A passenger who does not drive by suburban buses and who does not know when the validity of the coupon ends can go to the self-service machines where the coupons are played on the card.
Here the information about the validity of his documents is displayed on the display of the device.
The Sudets called for a referendum from the USA
In 1945 the Sudeten Germans had asked for the annexation of the Bohemian forest to the United States.
This is reflected in a letter that is stored in the collections of the South Bohemian scientific library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live at least under the patronage of the United States of America.
With such a wish, in 1945 some groups of Sudeten Germans turned to the U.S. President.
This is reflected, among other things, in a letter that has been preserved in a private archive and is today stored in the collections of the South Bohemian scientific library.
The Germans of Krumau ask the American president in the letter not to allow the return of the "Sudetengaus" - which was taken on the basis of the Munich agreement by Hitler - to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation correctly and we really want to be sure that the American units do not enter German territory as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," says a letter signed with the words "People to whom the fate of the Sudees lies at the heart".
Since the follow-up to Czechoslovakia makes the Sudeten Germans, aware of the Czech national character, suspect that they would expect brutality, recklessness, incomprehension, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the American president to take over the protection of the Bohemian forest today and forever.
"We can't believe that without regard to the view of a quarter of a million inhabitants of this area, you are addressing a foreign state that is trying to suppress and eliminate minorities and has done nothing to help the Allies win," is the letter to read.
The reason why the authors cannot sign is allegedly the fear of revenge of the "Czech oppressors".
If the U.S. President had any doubts about the attitude of the Bohemian Forest Germans, it would be sufficient for him to initiate a referendum in the Bohemian Forestgau on whether the inhabitants wanted to become part of the United States or to live under the patronage of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may sound naïve in today's knowledge of post-war history, he feels, however, that some contemporary witnesses draw a good picture of the expectations of the Sudeten Germans at the time.
Even though the Bohemian Germans had to know at least that they would be negotiated about their deportation from the Republic, only a few of them admitted such a possibility at all.
Some were waiting for the United States and the United Kingdom to negotiate some kind of autonomy for the Sudets.
Still others believed that they could simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is also confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, who comes from Budweis.
He was used in the war as a Budweiser German at the Navy on the Baltic Sea.
When he was imprisoned in Britain at the end of the war and was taken to a prisoner-of-war camp in Holstein, dozens of other Bohemian Germans came to him to teach them Czech.
"They believed that if they came home, the Czech would fit them," said Chalupa.
None of the German prisoners of war who had lived in Czechoslovakia before the war, in his opinion, expected to be expelled from the Republic on the basis of the Beneš decrees.
Don't you think - then pay!
An emotional campaign is aimed at drivers
The most expensive road safety action in Czech history.
The emotional media campaign, which the Ministry of Transport wants to start on Wednesday, could also be characterized.
The authority of Minister Aleš ‰ebíček promises to disembark drivers from dangerous behaviour behind the steering wheel.
The campaign for 150 million crowns will run on television, on radio, in cinema, on the Internet, but also on flyers.
It's supposed to take the driver off the road too fast and get alcohol at the wheel.
And they also remember to strap before the start of the ride.
The campaign wants to talk to young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and, last but not least, professional drivers.
And what is shown in the spots?
Especially stories of people who appeal to emotions.
The "bloody" slogan of the whole campaign also testifies to this:
Don't you think - then pay!
The words "don't think" are in capital letters on a plate.
And then the word "pay" is in a blood lair.
This should mean that one can pay a moment of inattentiveness with one's own life.
The spots will "shock" the audience until 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where you can normally see pictures with drastic shots of victims of accidents.
It promises to reduce the number of accidents and the number of road deaths on the Czech roads.
The spots were compiled by the agency Euro RSCG.
Sugar bread and whip for drivers
"The motto for drivers is sugar bread and whip.
Sugar bread means, for example, that when they drive red, they save time.
The whip is then the threat of punishment or an accident.
The driver must be reminded of the risk," said the traffic psychologist at Na Homolce Hospital Martin Kořán.
That is why information campaigns in the press and, above all, negative advertising are necessary, says the psychologist.
In his view, it is less effective to draw the attention of drivers to a danger.
"If you put on a static board that warns of a danger, it will probably soon flow with the surrounding area, and the drivers will no longer notice it," says Kořán.
Olmert would return almost all occupied territories in exchange for peace
The chairman of the Provisional Israeli Government Ehud Olmert has spoken out for the return of practically all areas occupied in 1967, including the Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, if peace with Palestine and Syria could be achieved in exchange for this.
He stressed this in an interview printed on Monday by Jediot Achronot.
"We need to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all (occupied) areas, if not all," Olmert said to the newspaper.
"We keep a certain percentage of these areas, but we will have to give the Palestinians a similar percentage (Israeli territory) because there will be no peace without this," he added.
He admitted that a possible return would also include East Jerusalem.
"The one who wants security in Jerusalem and above all does not want tractors or bulldozers to roll over his legs, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to abandon a part of Jerusalem," Olmert pointed out, alluding to two attacks in the city in July, where several people were killed and dozens injured.
According to the Prime Minister's words, it will be necessary to find a "special solution for the temple beers and sacred and historical places" located in the territory of the Old Town.
"The person who wants to maintain Israel's sovereignty over the entire city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This will not work," he continued.
Deduction from the Golan Heights
Olmert advocated a withdrawal of Israel from the Golan Heights, which he felt is an essential condition for the conclusion of a peace agreement with Syria.
But this would also require some effort on the part of Damascus.
"My proposal is not to conclude peace with Syria alone on the basis of a withdrawal from the Golan Heights," Olmert reaffirmed.
"The Syrians only know too well what they have to refrain from to get back the Golan Heights.
They will have to renounce their current relationship with Iran; they will have to renounce their relationship with the (Shiite) Hezbollah movement; they will have to renounce the constant support they give to the terrorism of the Hamas (Shiite) movement, the Al-Khaida terrorist network and the Jihad (the Holy War) in Iraq," said the Prime Minister.
Questions about the accident: Are stewards illegal on the bus?
The law does not know it, in a long-distance bus is not allowed to walk around
In connection with the tragic accident of a bus by the Student Agency company near the Italian Padua, the question arises whether stewards and travelers may walk and go on the bus.
"If we wish to comply strictly and formally with the law, the activity of a steward is contrary to the law on road traffic," says the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka.
The accident, in which a twenty-two-year-old stewardess died last week, was probably caused by the driver of the truck who crossed the bus.
At this moment, the young woman was sitting at all misfortune next to the driver, in the least safe place in the car, although she had two more seats at her disposal.
However, a bus can also have an accident or severely slow down at the moment when the steward carries out coffee or newspapers.
It also plays a role whether the bus is equipped with parking spaces after the vehicle's letter.
If this is not provided on the bus, the travellers must sit.
Student Agency's long-distance buses have no standing places; what Radim Jančura, the director of the company, confirmed to Aktuálně.cz.
"We discussed this with the Ministry, and this first did not agree with the movement of travellers.
Later this was taken back, and we reached a consensus that travellers may go to the toilet during the trip if they have their seats," he said.
The law doesn't know any steward
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of a steward - no legislation describes this role.
However, there is also no legislation prohibiting the carrier from providing services.
The law on road traffic only knows the concept of vehicle attendants; however, its rights and obligations do not define it," adds the spokesperson of the Ministry of Hanzelka.
On the other hand, the director of the department of road vehicles of the Ministry of Transport Josef Pokorný believes that the law covers this issue afterwards.
"It is important whether the bus has parking spaces in the product authorisation.
That's all," he emphasizes.
Buses are divided into city buses, where there are standing places and the maximum speed is limited, local buses with standing places and a higher permitted speed and long distance buses without standing places with the maximum speed and seats equipped with safety belts.
As in the airplane, the expert says
The BESIP expert on road safety Jaroslav Hořín sees no fundamental problem in the movement of stewards on board a bus.
"In a liquid mode, there are not many dangers, the situation is comparable to the service on board an aircraft.
Even here, it is not certain when turbulence comes, and the stewardess can blow his head."
"But if a bus is sharp, then the laws of physics also apply.
Just like in the city bus or in a tram.
The safety of the stewards must be clarified by internal regulations," he says and also believes that this problem is not fully resolved from the point of view of the law.
Jančura is ready to delete the services
Student Agency offers as the only bus company services from stewards.
The company employs about two hundred people in this function.
The Director does not consider his profession to be risky even after the accident.
"But as soon as I get the impression that the steward's profession is risky, I will delete it.
Coffee and newspapers can be received by travellers when boarding.
That would also reduce costs," he says.
As an interest in safety, the director of Asiana Alexej Litvin explains the lack of stewards in his bus. However, his company operates only a fraction of lines compared to Student Agency.
"We don't have stewardesses, but we've been fighting from the beginning.
Sooner or later this ends with some fatal accident," he had not said a year ago for Týden.cz.
That was an incredible tragedy.
In the accident of a bus to Naples, a young stewardess from the Pilsen region, who had worked for two years for society, was killed.
The Slovenian truck was probably turned off without blinking from the stand and had the bus blocked the ride.
The driver of the bus tried to escape by a sharp maneuver, but collided with the right front part of the truck.
Jančura argues that the two places were sold for the stewards.
"These places cannot be reserved for remote connections, they are blocked."
Company wants to sue truck drivers.
With compensation for the young woman’s family, the Agency will not wait for the court judgment, but will also expect a financial compensation from the debtor.
A change in the law?
Not in sight
A more precise regulation of the movement of stewards on board a bus could bring about a legal regulation on which a thirty-member expert team of the Ministry of Transport has been working for over a year.
"This, however, has not yet come to a concrete conclusion.
Buses are also not necessarily on the agenda, rather the point system, the maximum speed on the highway and the use of mobile phones while driving", says expert Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of the stewards to be a major threat to the safety of travellers," says Hanzelka, who is responsible for the control of the safety of buses in the competence of the police and the health and safety authorities.
Düsseldorfer Hopes rest on Frankfurt
In large words, the letter of the WestLB board of directors to the employees of the house is not missing.
By merging units of the Düsseldorf financial institution with the Frankfurt deka bank, "the central capital market house of the Sparkasse financial group" could be created, says the letter published on Monday.
The WestLB introduced a "competence block" with sustainable profitability into such a business.
And at all, such a link could be the decisive impetus to further groupings in the national banking sector.
This is the case if a board of directors wants to demonstrate ability to act in difficult times.
Because the beaten WestLB is still under tremendous pressure.
Not only by the European Commission, but also by the Federal Financial Services Authority, which recently made clear to the state government of the North Rhine-Westphalia that it is time to find a solution for the future.
The connection between the deka bank, which Sparkasse customers know about because of their investment funds, as always, and the WestLB has been talking for some time - also on the Frankfurt side.
Although deka bank chief Franz Waas made known at the end of August, in a merger of the house on Mainzer Landstraße with a Landesbank, such as the Helaba or the WestLB, he sees no sense.
However, the Board of Directors of the Deka, each half of which has been supported by the Landesbanken and the Sparkassesverbanden, has commissioned the Management Board to conduct discussions on joint business activities with WestLB.
This could be about the capital market business or parts of it.
The discussions have, of course, just begun, so it is said at the financial square.
The deka bank, which with its 3000 employees is one of the more important employers at the financial centre Frankfurt, is not the first time that it has been mentioned when it comes to consolidation in the savings banks sector.
For a moment in 2003, it looked as if the deka bank could merge with the Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and the Helaba.
However, nothing came out of this trio.
The plans had almost become public, the Hessian state government objected to the participation of Helaba.
The other two houses did not find one another.
The Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz went instead to the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart.
However, there has always been a game of thought about a connection of the deka bank with state banks.
Most recently, however, Günther Merl, Chairman of the Board of Helaba, spoke out against scheduled games about joining his house.
Regardless of this, however, it seems to be becoming clear that a collapse of the various public-law houses is in need.
After the Landtag election in Bavaria is over, the first thing that could be a connection of the BayernLB with the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg.
For the Helaba, this is not necessarily a good news.
Should the pressure on further mergers increase, the partners gradually go out for it.
In the south, she would only be a junior partner, although she has survived the financial crisis far better than the houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
In turn, the Sparkasse- und Giroverband Hessen-Thüringen, which participates in the Helaba with 85 percent, launched a lock at the beginning of the year.
At least stay the North LB.
Such geostrategic considerations, however, are only the one side.
On the other hand, the question is how the different business models of the individual houses fit each other.
In June, Merl stated that the decisive question with which business model was to ensure the future viability of the Landesbanken had not yet been answered by the Deutsche Sparkasse- und Giroverband.
In the end there could also be a division of the West LB, which is, however, not desirable there.
Thus, in the letter from the board of directors there, there is also talk of a "total solution" for the house.
How this can be put under a hat with the association of individual units with the deka bank will still be shown.
The second meadow weekend is known as the "Italian weekend"
For Elena it is the first, for Luca already the third or fourth time.
But this time Elena is with him as his friend, and so everything is different, he says.
Behind them, at the five-litre beer barrel of the Kaiser brand, stands a massively built bearer and proves to the about 200 October festival traveller what deep tones his throat can produce.
Elena gives Luca a kiss first, then a kiss.
From Bologna they came to Verona.
From here, the bus parking lot next to the train station Puorta Nuova, starts on this evening at 23.45 four buses, "destinazione Monaco, festa della birra", expected arrival 6.30 a.m.
Three buses are mainly reserved for the Italians, on a bus travel exclusively Brazilians.
In a corner of the parking lot, the South Americans sing next to their flag, they have celebrated already at night.
And so loud, Marco Guarda says it's nothing for Italians.
Marco, who wears a long coat with fur and a wide silver frame, belongs to the buses.
For five years they have been going to the Oktoberfest, three tours are this year alone.
At night, during the day on the meadow, at 10:30 p.m. back.
Spending the night would only mean unnecessary food, says Marco.
75 Euro costs the trip, the welcome summunk with Kaiser-Bier, brewed faithfully to the Bavarian Purity Command, the health insurance and the German-language travel management - Marco has attended a language course in Frankfurt - included.
And already the buses roll into the night, on the autostrada towards "Brennero".
There's no beer, not yet.
Soon it will be quiet on the bus, the travelers will sleep.
All right, they're gonna need their powers.
It is held in Brixen and in Holzkirchen, where also several other buses with Italian signs on the 8 motorway take a break just before Munich.
When Marco's group finally arrives at the parking lot near the Theresienwiese at half past seven o'clock in the morning, there are already the 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco gives a final speech, explains the attack plan.
First, put on the yellow cap.
On this is left "Octoberfest", in Fraktur, next to the internet address of Marco's travel agency: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Second, "When the doors go up to the beer tent, it's called running!" Marco calls in the morning.
"Run!" Run and occupy the places in the back of the tent.
"Not at the front, otherwise we will block, and not all yellow hats will be distributed on the same benches, in the room!"
The measure, Marco roars, costs 8,25 euros.
And don't forget to drink.
"The security people show that we behave well!
As soon as you leave the places, they are gone!"
Third, "Today's evening point half eleven to come back here!"
And it's going to the meadow.
On the way, a yellow cap as a waymark binds to the trees, to signs and even to the electoral poster of a large Bavarian People's Party.
You want to be armed for the withdrawal.
It is the second meadow weekend, known as the "Italian Weekend".
There is no precise information on figures; the speech is of 50,000 who make their way across the Alps and enter the beer tent, ten percent of all visitors are to be extra from Italy this weekend.
The Munich police are reinforced by seven police officers from South Tyrol, Italian volunteers support the Bavarian Red Cross, which leads a national statistics in which the Italians take first place in front of the British (about 60 stakes) and Austrians (about 80) with around 200 medical supplies.
The farm is particularly popular with Italians.
Sleepless nights for creditors of the Hypo Real Estate
The German banking system is relatively stable, stressed Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück only last week.
It is good that the politician used the word "relative" and that the German banking sector is not spared by the crisis.
Because it has now arrived on the weekend.
Hypo Real Estate, listed in the Dax, is receiving a billion-dollar loan from a consortium of German banks to shield itself from the turbulence in the markets.
A person familiar with the situation said Reuters on Monday that the loan aid amounted to up to 35 billion euros.
The Hypo Real Estate only had to make up the part that it also requires.
The money comes from both private and public banks.
Background is losses with the daughter Deppa.
According to a newspaper report for long-term projects for which he has given money, the public financer had refinanced himself extremely short-term - which is no longer possible due to market mistrust.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's cash reserve decreased by 95 percent to EUR 2.37 million, and the equity ratio had also slightly declined from 1.6 to 1.45 percent.
Current income and net income from financial operations had fallen to zero over the same period of the previous year, income from subscriptions to receivables and certain securities and from the dissolution of provisions in the credit business by more than 70 percent to EUR 5 million.
Only thanks to higher revenues from reimbursements of deferred transfer costs from the restructuring of the former Deppa Group as well as the reimbursement of interest under the tax regulations and from the business services for group companies, the income reduction of around 16 percent had fallen at a moderate rate.
After its privatisation in 1990, the former sovereign had first speculated with commercial real estate loans, which had then been divided into Aareal Bank.
Due to the lack of money in the classical state funding, the Deppa had become increasingly involved in infrastructure projects and the financing of community projects by private investors and the state (Private Public Partnership, PPP) and international diversification.
On the value of the daughter, the Hypo Real Estate now has to make depreciations that will have a "significant material effect" on the group's profit and loss account, it is quite uncertain.
The fact is that the dividend has been deleted.
It had already been shortened by two thirds for 2007.
The Hypo Real Estate has been a major public and infrastructure funder since the Deppa takeover.
It is more dependent on refinancing on the interbank market than on other institutions, as it has no client deposits.
With the collapse of the U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, lending among the banks is again largely decommissioned, as the banks had their liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate requires short-term funds to refinance some of the credit portfolio of the Deppa annually - around EUR 50 billion.
According to the Hypo Real Estate Communication, the Group's financing needs are met with the loan in the foreseeable future and the company is shielded "from the influence of the currently largely incapacitated international money markets".
From other sources it can be heard that thanks to the funds, the refinancing will be secured by the end of 2009.
HRE CEO Georg Funke stated that the Hypo Real Estate Group would no longer have to use the money markets in the foreseeable future.
The Bundesbank and the Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsprüfung (BaFin) assume that the marketability of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now ensured.
This represents the hope of shareholders and creditors of the bank.
But given the dynamics and uncertainties of the crisis, there is probably no certainty.
In fact, it is not inconceivable that the funding should not be used to the full.
But neither is the opposite.
After the hearing of the bank was still before the insolvency on the late Sunday evening, the at least temporary rescue could not soothe the minds.
The share price breaks down by 75 percent to EUR 3.30.
On the other hand, the borrowing rates are quite good.
While the priority debt is barely moving, the rates of the after-rank bond are more clearly reflected.
In particular, the bonds of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo and, understandably, the maturity beyond 2009.
If Hypo-Real-Estate bonds appear to be a speculative investment alternative, their worth must be considered as dependent on the stability of the international financial system after the Bank's crisis and the Institute itself, which had only taken over the crisis.
As long as the central banks, governments and less-offed commercial banks are still ready to support the system, it can be assumed that pensions will be extinguished in due time.
Or what hardly anyone dares to hope at the moment is that the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months.
However, in view of the announcements made during the sub-nationalisation process, the likelihood of security being limited has only become a legitimate hope at present.
This should, above all, provide long-term believers with some sleepless nights in deciding whether to separate themselves from their engagements.
Short-term investors can at least use an end-point to make a loss presentation for the future tax payments on price gains later years.
Sylvana and the secrets of the Bento box
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, introduces herself on the first day of school at Tachibana High School, the girls start to pee: The German is totally "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from Mangas - in the new exchange log she tells about Japan.
"The first day of school in Japan.
I was excited.
Before school, I had a boom.
I live on the edge of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and drive for 40 minutes by train to Tachibana High School.
I had to find the way alone, fortunately I didn't go.
The beginning of the class does not seem to be as strictly defined at the Tachibana as at our home in Lower Saxony.
From 8 p.m. on, the students scramble until about twenty before nine a short meeting with the teacher begins, the 'home room'.
But before the class began, I was on my way to introduce myself.
I'm not the guy who likes to talk in front of people, nor in front of a class of 40 students.
Because I didn't have a school uniform yet, I put on an old skirt for my hostess, plus blouse, blue knee socks and black leather shoes.
So in this elevator I put myself in front of the desk and tried to say everything right: 'Sayonara Where she Sylvana...' - I'm Sylvana, come from Germany and have a birthday in a week.
At the moment, I was very happy that I had started learning the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class have all been cuddled, peeped and wobbled and constantly I have heard the word "Kawaii".
I already knew that from my mangas.
It belongs to the survival-important vocabulary of Japanese girls and means 'beautiful, sweet'.
Then I'm quick to get to my place.
The girl next to me had a pretty broad grin, she found it an honor that the exchange student should sit next to her.
The rest of the hour was quite quiet, but when the Gong sounded, I was really shocked.
Everyone talked and peeked and asked me holes in my stomach - it's really hard to understand Japanese English.
During the break, all her Bentos unpacked.
My hostess had also made me such a lunch box - this is something different from the desolate German break breads.
I had rice with herbs, small sausages, salads of cucumbers and algae, fruit and some sort of meat in the tofu coat.
Most of the time, I don't have a pale glimmer, what exactly I eat here in Japan.
Things look strange and taste completely new.
It's clear that everything's really good.
Well, except maybe the salty plums inserted, brrrr!
The Bentos are not just lunch at Japanese schools.
It sometimes happens that a girl gives a boy a self-prepared Bento, which she then makes especially artistic - in the hope of getting to know the boy more closely at the break.
That's what I read in my manga comics.
I'm excited if I can watch this one.
'Why Japan?' my friends asked me when I told them that I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
I always said,
"Because it fascinates me."
Finally, I have been reading Mangas for years.
And so that I can better understand the comics and the culture in it, I also started to learn a little Japanese at some point.
So for me, it was perfectly clear that I had to travel here sometime.
Because I also have a faible for tradition, customs and customs.
And they're very important here.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends - on the other hand, it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I haven't felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I've ever seen."
Even rats have feelings
A rat or a sheep flees in danger, does that mean that it also feels fear?
Neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux is convinced: Many animals also have feelings.
How can you check whether they feel the same way if they behave the same way we do?
For several years, the magazine "Edge" has been publishing contributions from famous scientists.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series of selected answers to the question "What do you think is true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have sensations and other states of consciousness, without me or anyone else being able to prove this so far, where we can't even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case, we can at least hope because all human brains have the same basic configuration.
However, as soon as we turn to other species and cut into questions of feeling or generally of consciousness, we enter unmoved terrain because the hardware does not match.
If a rat is in danger, it does the same thing as many other animals: it kills, flees or attacks.
People behave similarly to what some scientists conclude about a comparable subjective experience.
I don't believe in that.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to transfer our subjective experience to that of animals.
On the one hand, the circuits almost always associated with human consciousness include the lateral prefrontal cortex (because of its participation in short-term memory and in the execution/control functions).
This broad region is much higher in humans than in the other primates and seems to be completely lacking in other creatures.
At least in those aspects of our consciousness that depend on prefrontal Cortex, including the knowledge of who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, there is therefore reason to believe that man is even different from the other primates.
Another dramatic characteristic is likely to lie in the linguistic nature of man: Since such a large part of his experience is associated with language, it is often said that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
But even if consciousness did not depend on language, it would certainly affect it, so that animal consciousness, as it may be, probably differed greatly from most of our states of consciousness.
It is therefore difficult to determine what consciousness may look like in other animals.
If, as something internal and subjective, it is neither measured nor analysed on the basis of our own experience because of the special hardware, his research presents us with great problems.
Most of my remarks relate to the content of the conscious experience, but there is also another aspect of consciousness that should be scientifically easier to access.
One could examine the consciousness processes of animals without regard for their content, and that is what happens in studies on the short-term memory of primates, especially on the example of visualization.
But in this approach, which Christof Koch and Francis Crick followed, one shifts to the neural correlations of consciousness rather than to the causal mechanisms: both may or may not be identical.
Interestingly, this approach also emphasises the importance of the prefrontal cortex for the establishment of visualization.
What is the result of the sensations?
I put it back on that an emotional system like that of fear is activated in one of its own activities conscious brain.
So what we call "fear" is the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its consequences, such as physical reactions) proves memory.
In this way, sensations are closely linked to the regions of Cortex, which distinguish primates and, in particular, humans.
Linked to the linguistic nature, there are fine degrees of feeling, because with the help of words and grammar we can differentiate and categorize states, in order to attribute them to others alongside ourselves.
On the other hand, Antonio Damasio believes that sensations from more primitive activities in the body-feeling regions of the Cortex and the brain stem are similar to those of Jaak Pankseep, who is more focused on the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed much in the course of human evolution, it could well be involved in multiple sensations.
In theory, I cannot contradict it, but I do not think it is.
Pankseep argues what appears in rats and humans, such as fear, is likely to feel the same way in both cases: But how can one check whether rats and humans feel the same way if they behave similarly?
A sheep flees in danger of fear?
In my eyes, mere behavioral propensity cannot yet prove an equal experience.
Although the neural comparison helps further: rats and humans have similar brain stems, sheep, on the other hand, do not even have a brain.
But is the brain stem responsible for sensations?
And even if you could prove this to the human being, how would you prove it to rats?
I believe that rats and other mammals, perhaps even sheep (who knows?), have sensations.
But I don't know how to prove it.
And because their feelings are probably fundamentally different from ours (because human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I prefer to explore the emotional behavior than the emotional sensations of rats.
At any rate, progress on the neural level is wavering here, provided that the same is measured for rats and humans.
As I don't explore language and consciousness in rats, nor sensations, I don't know if they exist.
You might think this is shortsighted, but I'd rather move forward than constantly walking against a wall.
I'm just a practical emotionalist.
Uefa President Platini: grace period for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Wasjunik said that preparations would soon be placed under the direct responsibility of President and Prime Minister.
"The government sees Uefa's decision in Bordeaux as a proof of trust in Ukraine and its ability to organise the EM together with Poland," said Wasjunik.
"But this is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun and there is still a lot to be done in both countries."
The two hosts are lagging behind in the schedule for the construction or conversion of the stadiums, streets, hotels and airports.
Even the number of EM stages may be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We now have to work at the highest speed," said Ukrainian association president Grigoriy Surkis.
"The UEFA will constantly keep an eye on us."
An even more radical step was taken in Poland.
The leadership of the Polish Association of PZPN has been suspended by the National Olympic Committee after numerous scandals and replaced by independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The Commission had met at the request of Mr Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There is "the serious danger that the PZPN is unable to act according to the rules," said Drzewiecki of the Polish news agency PAP.
"We assured Uefa President Michel Platini in a letter that the preparation for the EM 2012 will not suffer."
Several first-time players had been convicted of forced degression in the past season alone, after all even the league had to be postponed in the short term.
Indignant Dennis Quaid Strikes Back
She wanted to promote a new film, talked in the interview about privates - and now has trouble with the ex: Hollywood-Star Meg Ryan outete her hasty Dennis Quaid as a adulterer.
It foams - and knocks back.
Late Rosary War with the ex-husband Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after her divorce, the two Hollywood actors now have an ugly fight with each other - in public.
Meg Ryan said for the first time in an interview with the US magazine InStyle last week about the reasons for the failure of marriage: "Dennis was unfaithful to me for a long time, and that was very painful."
The extent of the fraud had only brought them to their senses after divorce.
The occasion for the soul striptease was Ryan's press work for her new film "The Women" - the story of a adultery is told.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his outing as an infidel husband clearly failed: "Untoday", said the 54-year-old of the "New York Daily News" that "I repeatedly chew and re-tighten the story of our relationship."
It is also "a pity" that the 16-year-old son Jack is again "publicly reminded of the pain and upheavals that mean a divorce for each child."
While Ryan has lived alone since the divorce, Quaid is remarried and recently became the father of Gemini.
And so close his admissions with the page post: "My life goes on anyway.
I am happy that I have a wonderful family that is doing well."
Prices for tickets and hotels are falling
In the first half of 2008, flights and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, according to a recent study, flights were even up to 50 percent cheaper.
Flights and overnight stays in hotels have become more affordable again - this is the result of a study by the travel and financial service provider American Express.
The company analysed its accounting data from the first half of 2008 and, following an increase in prices in the first quarter, found a significant decrease in the second quarter.
After years of rising prices on the hotel market, the nights in many places have already been approved.
From January to March, prices in 41 out of 48 European cities surveyed rose by an average of 6.9 percent compared to 2007.
From April to June, prices were already 3.6 percent lower than in the previous year.
The most obvious trend was in Paris and Rome, where travellers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than a year earlier.
American Express sees the weak dollar rate that has led to a "decreasing desire of American tourists".
Financial sites such as Frankfurt or London are also more affected by the decline in hotel prices than industrial sites such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices with an increase of 26.3 percent even keep the record in Europe.
The trend in the first quarter also showed upward in flight prices:
Travelers in the Economy class had to pay an average of 7.1 percent more than in 2007, fuel-intensive long-haul flights even cost up to 29.2 percent more.
From April to June, the prices for economic class tickets fell by an average of 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, but in the business and first class, price changes were much lower.
In Germany, prices fell even further than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices had risen by 11.9 percent, while in the second quarter they fell by 23.6 percent.
According to the study, prices have even halved on German domestic flights.
On the one hand, the reason for the price break was the slowdown in economic growth, explains the company.
The demand in many segments of the flight market crumbles.
On the other hand, the open-skie agreement, which liberalises air transport between the USA and Europe, increases competition pressure.
There were signs of the tense situation of the removal of unprofitable routes at Airlines, as well as the high number of airlines that had registered bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 - these were 24 airlines in Europe alone.
HSV beats Gladbach 1:0
With a gate and simple methods, the Hamburger SV becomes a table leader.
At Borussia, Luhukay is still unable to find a functioning eleven.
By Kristoffer Klein enlarge breaking landing for national player Marko Marin.
The Gladbacher only came into play late and failed with a lifter on the latte.
His message was precisely formulated, she gave him convincingly of his lips.
He simply knew he was right.
"We need the second gate," said Hermann Rieger in the Hamburg Arena cabin.
Much was not lost in the catacombs, the half-time break was finished and most were sitting back in their places.
Rieger was the physical therapist of the HSV for almost three decades, and he enjoys a higher reputation than some of the caste actors.
And so his request also found hearing in the responsible place.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol nodded and raised his thumbs.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg's head coach Martin Jol.
Its command will have been similar: Here with gate two!
The implementation failed.
"Not everything was beautiful to see today," Marcel Jansen admitted later.
Bastian Reinhardt would also have wished for it to be "delighted".
The 1:0 (1:0) the Hamburgers owe to Mladen Petric's headball hit (11); and the fact that very weak Gladbachers could not hurt the weak Hamburgers.
"It was a dirty victory," Martin Jol summed up.
The Hamburg SV is now 121 years old on this Monday.
The viewers celebrated themselves on Saturday afternoon, the blue sky above the arena and the lightning table on the video wall, which showed their club as a class prime.
It's going to be a birthday without a real party.
"We know how to sort this out," said Marcell Jansen.
He suspects that the tabular intermediate is more for the unpredictability of the league than for the dominance of his HSV.
The team with its late engagements - the Brazilians Neves and Silva, the goaltender Petric and Jansen, who has been recruited by FC Bayern - can be found slowly, but it is not yet able to shine.
"We need more flair and more dribbles," said Jol.
After the vote has been taken
On Wall Street, there's fear.
First news of the failure of the rescue package allowed the Dow Jones to break in temporarily by 700 points.
That was the greatest loss of points within a day in his history.
Later, the Dow caught up again.
At 8:30 p.m., the world's most important stock market barometer recorded 10,579 counters with a good five percent in the negative.
The Nasdaq technology exchange stood at 1548 points with more than seven percent in the minus.
The biggest loser at the time was the Dow American Express, which lost almost 14 percent and the Bank of America with a loss of about twelve percent.
No title could be added.
The shares of Bank Goldman Sachs gave up almost ten percent.
Only a few days ago, major investor Warren Buffett had participated in the company.
Under the rescue plan, the funds are to be made available for the purchase of so-called lazy mortgage papers.
The sum should be paid out, but not on a single hit, but gradually.
In return, the State should receive share option notes from financial corporations that could be redeemed in the event of price developments in order to reduce the burden on the public funds.
Share prices in Europe and USA in the downwards
The billions of aid for banks in Europe and in the USA do not resolve the investor's doubts.
The share price of the German major bank Hypo Real Estate falls and rips down the Dax.
The U.S. Index Dow Jones loses despite the planned rescue of the financial market by the state.
Spectacular price losses of the Hypo Real Estate and the Commerzbank have torn the German stock index (Dax) deep to the bottom.
Despite the rescue action of the Federal Government and private banks, the Munich Real Estate Fund lost three quarters of its value, which Commerzbank gave up by more than 20 percent.
The Dax clearly slipped under the psychologically important 6000-point mark and recorded with a minus of 3.7 percent at 5,839 points.
The stock markets around the world went to their knees.
In New York, Wall Street opened with significant losses.
Investors feared that the US government's 700 billion dollar bailout package could not be enough to bring the financial markets back into swing.
The Dow lost 334 points in the first trading hour or 3.3 percent to 10,809,25 points.
The US House of Representatives wanted to vote on the rescue plan, and the Senate vote could follow on 1 October.
The other European exchanges also knew only one direction: In London, the FTSE index initially declined by 3.2 percent, the CAC 40 lost 2.9 percent in Paris.
In Asia, the Japanese lead index Nikkei fell 1.26 percent to 11,743.61 after initial profits.
In Hong Kong, the Hang-Seng index slipped by 2.1 percent to 18,286,90 points.
In India, the leading index Sensex lost 506.43 points or 3.9 percent and closed at 12.595.75 counters.
In the MDax, Arcandor's shares gave up after the announcement of a capital increase.
The private bank Sal. Oppenheim has drawn the 23 million new shares.
The trading and tourism group also announced that the shares in Thomas Cook will not be sold.
Dark matter affects flight of space probes
For years, a mysterious phenomenon in research has caused inconsistency: Dark matter affects the speed of space probes during so-called swing-by manoeuvres.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein's general relativity theory could not be quite correct.
For almost 18 years, the space probe "Ulysses" flew through space.
Because of the fuel lines that are freezing soon, you are now threatening the cold.
For years, among scientists, a mysterious phenomenon has caused confusion - the swing-by anomaly.
The Swing-by is a flight manoeuvre of space probes in which they receive additional momentum in the gravitational field of a celestial body, such as the Earth.
This allows the probes to save a lot of fuel.
The European-American research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick as well as the Ulysses solar probe.
What the researchers have been amazed at for years, however: The aircrafts do not behave 100 percent as would be expected under the old gravity law.
Rather, there are irregularities in speed.
The probes are unexpectedly getting faster or slower.
So far, physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
They named him Swing-by-Anomaly.
Some experts fear that perhaps even the general relativity theory of Albert Einstein, which describes the attraction of matter through a curvature of space, could not be quite correct.
American physicist Stephen Adler of the Princeton Institute for Advanced Study still firmly believes that Einstein was not wrong, and tries to explain the swing-by anomaly with the help of so-called dark matter that made up astronomers in the universe.
"Responsible for the anomaly could be dark matter, which could also be very close to the earth," he writes.
The space scientists have only known about the existence of dark matter for about ten years.
Obviously, it is an attraction whose effect on other celestial bodies can be observed.
It itself, on the other hand, is completely invisible, that is, it transmits and does not reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially any visible light.
According to the calculations of the scientists, the dark matter is at least a fifth of the total mass of the universe.
Tourists abducted in Egypt are free
After ten days in the hands of their abductors, the hauled tourists in Egypt should be free again, as confirmed by the Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs.
The kidnappers from Sudan had demanded several million euros of ransom.
Six hostages must have been killed in a shooting before release.
Five Germans were abducted in the south of Egypt.
Loose money negotiations are already scheduled to take place.
Again and again, Germans were seen by kidnappers.
WORLD ONLINE describes the most important cases.
The European tourists in the Sahara are apparently free.
This was reported by Egyptian state television, the Arabic TV channel Al-Arabija and Italian media in agreement.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release according to reports from the Italian television channel Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and the other hostages have been liberated.
We're just checking her state of health," said Frattini.
The five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian, as well as their eight Egyptian companions, were well up and safe, the Egyptian state television reported.
The 19 participants of a desert expedition should already be on their way to Cairo.
The background to a shooting before the hostages were released remains unclear: according to an Egyptian security officer, the kidnappers were prepared to end the kidnapping before the Sudanese army surprisingly killed six of the kidnappers.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed to a ransom," said the official.
It was "just about receiving the hostages", when suddenly "this surprise" came.
On Sunday, in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt, Sudanese soldiers killed six of the kidnappers and arrested two of them.
The hostages had demanded a ransom of six million euros from Germany; the money was to be handed over by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The daily newspaper "El Masri El Jom" reported under appeal to a German mediator who delayed the release of the hostages because the kidnappers feared for their safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers want to release the female hostages after payment of the ransom.
The men should be held until the kidnappers have a safe escape route.
The German Embassy in Cairo rejected an opinion on the report.
Abuse of the stepfather " led to suicide"
The years of abuse by her stepfather have led to the death of a woman, a court has been reported.
Michael Trerise, 57, from Stithians, Cornwall, was sentenced to six years in prison after facing eight cases of sexual abuse.
The Truro Criminal Court found out that he regularly tied up his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle when she was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote in a confession: "I feel responsible for her death."
The court found out that Mrs. Randle was killed at her house in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
When she lived in Coventry as a child, Trerise tied her up and tied her eyes before performing sexual acts while her mother was away to work in a restaurant.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s and moved back to Cornwall.
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
However, the court found that Ms. Randle, who worked for the National Trust for a large part of her time, was being persecuted by abuse that had been inflicted on her twice a week.
Prosecutor Ramsay Quaife reported to the court that friends had said that Mrs. Randle, who had been a zealous surfer and cyclist, had been "emotionally dead" since 2006 and had " given up her life"
In April 2007, her real father Terrance Randle found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
It is believed that she killed herself by suffocating using a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a letter of confession that ended: "I used to tie them up and connect their eyes."
"I didn't need them sexually.
I feel responsible for her death."
Judge Christopher Elwen said to Trerise: "They are an extremely strange fetishist and for their victim it must have been terrifying, especially since she was only seven.
This unhappy story ends with the victim's suicide.
Worse still is the fact that it is very unlikely that the matter would have ended before the court if it had not done so."
He added: "I take note of the effects, according to the description of Stephanie's father and mother, on her daughter over the years.
Otherwise, she would clearly have been a promising, successful and happy young woman."
Officials responsible for missing data shall be charged with:
The BBC has learned that the Cabinet Officer, who had lost strictly confidential documents on a train in June, will be sued under the "Public Security Act".
The man was dismissed by the Ministry of Defense when he lost two extremely confidential documents on a train to Waterloo.
The documents were handed over to the BBC before they were handed over to the police.
It is the weakest charge within the law and there is no indication of criminal intent.
BBC defense correspondent Frank Gardner said the action was a surprise for many in Whitehall.
He said, "You would have thought that this would be dealt with internally by the Ministry of Defence and Cabinet."
The employee whose name cannot be mentioned is accused in accordance with paragraph 8.1 of the Law, the clause dealing with the safe storage of information.
The Royal Prosecutor's Office recommended that the officer be accused by the Metropolitan Police of the highly sensitive nature of his work in the Joint Intelligence Committee.
The documents he submitted contained classified assessments of Al-Quaida and the capabilities of the Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was taken from his house to a secret place.
Housing construction companies see B&B costs in mind
British housing companies could face costs of over 80 million pounds after the rescue of Bradford and Bingley Bank.
The government provided 14 billion pounds to protect Bradford & Bingley's 2.6 million customers.
Interest on this loan is paid by all companies that receive money from investors, including the 59 construction companies
The Director-General of the Association of Housing Societies (BSA), Adrian Coles, said it was "unbearable" that the companies and their members would have to pay.
The 14 billion loan will ultimately be repaid if Bradford & Bingley's loans are extinguished.
But the interest accumulated in the meantime is charged each year to the 700 financial corporations that accept the deposits.
The financial services compensation programme confirmed to the BBC that the 59 housing companies were included in this figure.
It is bitter that those institutions which have acted prudently ... are now called upon to take over some of the costs of those institutions which were far less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It said that each company would have to pay in relation to the deposits it would hold, and that the companies would have to pay about 18% of the costs together.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that interest on the loan will amount to 450 million pounds in 2009.
This means that companies must raise 81 million pounds for the first year's interest.
Adrian Coles, the Director-General of the Association of Housing Construction Companies, informed the BBC that he believes this is unfair.
It is bitter that those institutions that have behaved cautiously during the real estate boom are now called upon to bear some of the costs of those institutions that were far less careful.
According to the BSA, no company has failed since the existence of the records in 1945.
"We will observe all aspects of this matter over the next few weeks to see what alternatives there are to protect housing companies and their members from potentially significant costs."
The interest due in 2009 covers the seven months from the end of September of this year until the end of March.
In 2010, interest will be due for a full year and that could be almost twice as much.
Since construction companies are both non-partners, their members will have to pay for the costs either by higher fees or lower interest on savings accounts.
Milk becomes five pence per litre more expensive
People in Jersey are faced with having to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy has announced that it will raise the wholesale price of its milk by another five pence per litre from Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after a two pence increase in February, and comes after investigations of a consulting firm have been carried out.
Retailers should decide for themselves whether they wish to pass on the price increase to their customers.
Prior to the price increase in February, Jersey's wholesale price of milk last changed in 2002.
Former Prime Minister of Bangladesh is denied bail
A court in Bangladesh has rejected a security request from former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, which means that she could be arrested when she returns to the country.
Their defenders said that the court refused to have blackmailed a businessman while she was prime minister regarding the charge of 50 million Taka ($729,700).
The case is one of several pending charges of corruption against her.
Sheikh Hasina's long-standing political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released against bail at the beginning of this month.
Sheikh Hasina is scheduled to return to Bangladesh in the next few weeks, but her party, the Awami Alliance, demanded that the military-supported transitional government should first grant her full freedom.
The correspondents say that, although their imprisonment was granted in order to go abroad for medical treatment, it is not clear in the context of their release whether she will be able to remain free when she returns to Bangladesh.
Their lawyers state that they will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the decision of the Supreme Court.
"The upper court has rejected Sheikh Hasina's bail claim because it says she doesn't have to get a deposit because she's already on detention abroad to be treated abroad," said her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
We will file a legal complaint against the upper court."
Your lawyers are asking that they need bail to return from abroad to the country to prepare for the December elections.
It is expected that Sheikh Hasina will return home after October 17th, said an Awami-Bündnis party president on Sunday.
She was detained last year after the Army-supported transitional government took over power, but was released from prison in June to go abroad for medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia deny all charges against themselves.
Fears of the Anti-Polio Initiative in Afghanistan
According to the United Nations, almost 200 000 children have not been vaccinated in the recent anti-Polio initiative in Afghanistan due to the violence associated with the Taliban.
Last week the United Nations carried out a vaccination programme in six provinces.
However, they could not reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for security reasons.
According to a UN spokesperson, this was the case despite the Taliban’s promise not to attack or hinder the thousands of personnel carrying out the vaccinations.
BskyB loses appeal in the case of ITV
BskyB has lost its action against the decision of the Competition Commission to reduce its share in the competing ITV broadcaster.
The Competition Court ordered BskyB to reduce its participation in ITV from 17.9% to under 7.5%.
The Commission had previously claimed that the share of BskyBs distorted competition and enabled it to have an unfairer influence on the ITV broadcaster.
BskyB acquired its share in 2006 by successfully blocking the purchase of ITV by NTL, now renamed Virgin Media.
In April 2007, the Competition Authority reported that the purchase of the share of ITV by BskyB would raise doubts about the independence of ITV, which led the Competition Commission to start an investigation.
The Virgin Boss Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and the Ofcom Communications Office, have voted against the purchase.
BskyB argued that the pressure to reduce its share of ITV was an unreasonable and exaggerated measure, especially because BskyB had announced its intention to give up its voting rights.
New investigation in the US U.S. Public Prosecutor's Office
The U.S. Attorney General has commissioned a Special Investigator to deal with the termination of the nine US prosecutors in 2006.
The occasion was a report by the General Inspector of the Ministry of Justice criticising the actions of the administrative staff.
The report criticised the White House officials, legislators and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was driven by fears that the lawyers had been expelled for political reasons.
The Special Investigator Nora Dannehy is now to determine whether the officials interviewed during the investigation have lied to the investigators in order to obstruct the judiciary.
Serious allegations including criminal action have not been fully investigated or clarified, said Inspector General Glenn Fine in his report.
The appeal of a specialist investigator with the power to force the witnesses to make a statement was one of his main recommendations.
The conflict began when the Ministry of Justice in December 2006 denied nine U.S. attorneys from their offices.
At that time, the Ministry argued that the prosecutors would be dismissed on the basis of poor employment.
However, it was later found that the dismissed prosecutors had not been judged worse than many of their colleagues, which led many observers to view the dismissals as politically motivated.
Some of these prosecutors were involved in the judicial persecution of high-ranking Republican congressmen, while others refused to investigate the allegations of the election fraud of the Democrats.
U.S. attorneys are commissioned to investigate and prosecute court cases for the government.
They may be dismissed at any time, but may not be suspended for political reasons.
The head of the Ministry of Justice, Alberto Gonzales, was shot in the face of redundancies and eventually resigned from office.
A number of officials from the Ministry of Justice have also resigned.
In particular, the report of the Inspector-General has addressed the role of Gonzales critically by bearing the "main responsibility" for the dismissals, "distinguishing" his leadership role and "extremely disinterested" in the process.
Other officials, including the former Chief Advisor of President Bush Karl Rove, were criticized for the lack of cooperation with the investigators.
Meat Loaf's epic song is to be honored
The Rockstar Meat Loaf is to be honoured during the music award "Q Award" for his epic anthem "Bat Out Of Hell".
The singer, who next week in London will accept his special golden prize during the award, said he was honored to be recognized.
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title of Meat Loaf's album from 1977.
"Coldplay" lists the nominations for this year's award after it has been selected in four categories.
The editor-in-chief of the magazine "Q Magazine" Paul Rees said that there were some songs that go beyond such materials as time and genre and "Bat Out Of Hell" was certainly one of them.
The song written by Jim Steinman required a strong voice delivered by Meat Loaf.
It starts with an instrumental part that lasts almost two minutes.
The song was released as a single in 1979 in the UK and reached number 15 in the charts.
However, Meat Loaf's "Bat Out Of Hell" has spent about nine years in the charts and sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf, whose true name is Marvin Lee Aday, has suffered from serious health problems in recent years. One of them was an operation in 2003 due to irregular heartbeats after he collapsed on stage.
In 2007 he had to cancel concerts due to acute head inflammation.
Later it became known that he had a cyst on his vocal cord.
Obscured street in town, often forgotten and possibly soon to sell
New York City has thousands of main roads, avenues, side streets and other bypass roads, some of which are famous and others are only comfortable.
Nevertheless, it is difficult to tell even experienced taxi drivers and longtime residents where Extra Place is, simply because most have never heard of it.
This tiny street is located in the East Village and runs north from First Street between Bowery and Second Avenue without reaching Second Street.
It is 30 feet wide and 120 feet long and looks more like a dusty street than an active passageway.
There are no signposts either.
It is practically impossible to find them on a standard road map.
This road still has its admirers.
For example, Avalon Bay, a construction company that recently built luxurious buildings on First Street.
It wants to re-flashing Extra Place to create a clean passage to the shops and boutiques that are expected in the new buildings.
Among the other admirers is the long-standing neighborhood, which says it is fascinated by the short street, simply because it is one of the remains of the past of the house block.
However, the city administration department, which is responsible for the protection and construction of the residential buildings and is responsible for the road, has no interest in obtaining them.
During a meeting of the Committee on Land Use of the Municipal Council this month, representatives of the City Council and Avalon Bay have made a proposal for the purchase of the road by the construction company.
Nevertheless, the Committee prefers the street to remain in the hands of the city, and has asked for a new plan to be presented next month, says Susan Stetzer, the district administrator in the municipal council 3.
"Only very little space has remained in the city's possession and we want Extra Place to continue to belong to the city," she said.
"There could be offers on how to repair and operate the road, which could be done by Avalon, but we also want public access to be guaranteed."
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that it would like to re-patriate the small street and refurbish seats that are intended, among other things, for a café to which the company would like to rent space.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the road was made public for the first time during the session this month.
Michele de Milly, a spokesperson from Avalon Bay, said that although the company wanted to use the road, it didn't want to own it.
"The main concern of Avalon Bay is to renovate this decayed street and make it a public meeting point," she said, adding that the city itself had proposed the sale.
Seth Donlin, spokesperson of the Department of Building Protection, said it was actually the city's desire to sell the road and stressed that the department's task was to develop the real estate rather than manage it.
Compared to his colorful neighborhood The Bowery, Extra Place has retained some of his historical impression.
Some believe that the road got its name in 1802, when a large farm owned by Philip Minthorne was divided between his numerous children and a narrow strip of land was not claimed by anyone.
The back door of the music club CBGB, the punk rock monument, which was closed in 2006, opened to the extra place and the street is most definitely known as a backdrop for the photo on the cover of the album "Rocket to Russia" by Ramones.
The patch was great, said Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones, who had taken the photo in November 1976.
The road was full of scrap, rags and parts of barrels, posters, leaves and ropes.
Some residents, including the bloggers who write about the gentrification of the East Village, have rejected the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that this public property, as modest as it is, should continue to remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rarity – a practically unchanged splitter of the city that should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs the blog called "Jeremiah's Disappearing New York" (subtitled with "The Book of Complaints: A Bitter Nostalgic View of the Dying City"), has published a part of the discussion of urban history about Extra Place, which was published in the New Yorker magazine in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote at the time: "Extra Place is a small narrow dead end, which remains dark even during the day and is characterized by rusted metal doors of the warehouses, closed windows and rain showers passing by flying weekly-old newspapers".
With a few exceptions, the road has just looked like this in one evening.
A rat ran through the back of the road, not far from the door that previously led to the CBGB, where today there is a more expensive clothing store.
Graffiti was seen on the walls and an empty beer bottle was on the floor not far from a fresh bundle of sorted newspapers.
Some passersby said they rarely thought about Extra Place, but suggested that the road could be polished up.
Fields, added that in his opinion, some people underestimate the appeal of the road in its current state.
The best years of my life, he said, were in the places that were dark, damp and disgusting.
Debate on bilingual education: education in English-speaking areas
In this edition of the Education Watch, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the positions of candidates for bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, a senior scientist in Californian studies and director of the Department of Education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is a co-author of the book "Not as good as you think: Why the middle class needs a school selection".
Addressing the Hispanic voters is a complicated task.
Barrack Obama's proposals on education are a typical example of this.
Obama's election campaign mentions that "the probability of Afro-American and Hispanic students finishing school successfully is lower than that of white students" - which is true.
In order to close this gap, Obama’s education plan recommends, among others, a bilingual transition in education for those who first learn English.
Nevertheless, the question to Obama is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which focuses on teaching in languages other than English, contradicts his interest in reducing the distance from school.
Consider the example of Sixth Street Prep, a primary school in eastern Los Angeles.
The majority of students are Hispanic and come from low-income families.
More than a third of the students, many of whom have only recently been in the country, learn English.
Nevertheless, in 2008, an amazing 100 percent of fourth-class students passed the state exam in mathematics at a good level.
Also surprisingly, 93 percent of children from the fourth year of school were rated as good in the English exam.
This amazing success has been achieved by other methods than those preferred by Obama.
The Sixth Street School places its emphasis on review and exercise, on constant control of knowledge and an attitude that does not tolerate exceptions.
In addition, the school practices the approach to training in an English-speaking environment. That’s exactly what Obama is supposed to take into account, according to school manager Linda Mikels.
This approach emphasises the almost exclusive use of the English language in technical education.
Ms. Mikels, who rejected the idea of bilingual education, said to me that the school had a remarkable success with a student who had just arrived from Mexico. 12 months later one would enter the classroom and not be able to recognize him anymore.
"It works," she remarked, "it works for us."
Would Obama take a school like the Sixth Street Prep as a model for other schools with a large proportion of Latin American and other English students?
The school's achievements would make the answer to this question easy, but the educational positions within its own party (the national associations of non-profits have long supported the idea of bilingual education) and its own consistent support for bilingual education make predictions of Obama's answer uncertain.
While agreeing to the point that immigrants should learn English, he recently trivialized the subject by noting that people should stop worrying about legislation in "English only".
Instead, he said, "You should make sure your child can Spanish."
If Obama really wants to close the performance gap, he should carefully take into account educational models that work rather than despise and trivialize them.
Oil prices are falling as a result of renewed economic fears
The oil price on Monday was greatly reduced due to fears that even the American rescue plan for the financial markets could not be enough to revive the economy.
In the morning session, the New York Stock Exchange's crude oil futures fell by 7 percent to $99.80 per barrel.
Since last Monday, the price has dropped by more than $20.
Over the last two weeks, the commodity markets have been shaken by both the financial turbulence on Wall Street and strong whirlpools in the Gulf of Mexico.
After the July prices had reached their peak of $145.29 per barrel, they fell this month to almost $90 per barrel to then rise again, as a result of the enormous uncertainty in the financial markets.
On Monday, investors showed concern again, although Congress representatives had announced that they had agreed on a rescue plan that should be the largest in history on the weekend.
This news was overshadowed by new concerns that the financial crisis has not yet been completed.
In the first last chapter of the growing crisis, according to a government announcement on Monday, Citigroup is expected to buy up the bank operations of Wachovia Corporation.
In the meantime, Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partly nationalised the European financial group Fortis.
After analysts at Barclays Capital, despite the tense negotiations that took place on the weekend and led to a rescue plan, it seems that it was not possible to revive the mood in the markets.
As the economic situation continues to deteriorate, demand for goods, including oil, is expected to continue to decline.
Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a communication to investors that forecasts for global capital markets, interest rates and exchange rates had become extremely uncertain.
We believe they continue to write that the goods markets will also be affected.
"From the perspective of the commodity markets, we are most concerned about whether the US virus is spreading worldwide, especially to China."
The bank's analysts have adjusted their expectations for oil consumption due to weak economic growth for the coming year downwards, and their forecasts for the oil and gas price for 2009 have decreased by 20%.
Team record by series in the second quarter
Internal defender Shaun Ellis thought he had seen everything after he had risen more often than anyone else in the Jets tricot in the last eight and a half years.
Then, on Sunday, he saw the second quarter, in which the jets turned an unprofitable game into a triumphal move.
"I've never seen anything like this before," said Ellis.
After a sluggish game between the jets and the Arizona Cardinals, which corresponded to the bad weather, the second quarter began.
However, when Quarterback Brett Favres Pass arrived at Lavernues Coles for a 12-yard touchdown, this marked the perfect start to an afternoon when her developing collaboration made a huge step forward.
Favre found Coles in this neighborhood for two more touchdowns, which once took off as an outside defender and the other one 10 seconds before the end of the half-time.
"I didn't put forth much effort," says Coles about the passports that went to Coles.
"He's a super player.
Our vote voted no matter what people think."
While Favre and Coles were playing catch, the defense took Kurt Warner apart.
Foreign defender Darrelle Revis took off an accident and turned it into a 32-yard touchdown.
Libero Erik Smith came to another pass and caught him.
Linebacker David Bowens then caused a loss of Warner.
The last ball loss, forced by Bowens, was probably the craziest.
The cardinals had won the ball with 10 seconds left in the game when the jets recaptured the ball and Jay Feely turned a 20-yard shot into a 34-to-0 lead.
These were the most points the jets had ever scored in a quarter.
When he was asked to describe the madness, Erik Mangini, the coach of the jets answered "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
Both replies, because the jets allowed 21 points in the third quarter without achieving a single one, Mangini said: "Believe me, I enjoyed the second quarter more than the third.
A lot of points were made in a short time."
Calmed-up Gebrselassie beats his world record
Haile Gebrselassie from Ethiopia has once again shown why some consider him to be the best long-distance runner of all time, after breaking his own record on Sunday in the Berlin Marathon and becoming the first person to make the 42.2 km route in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With the victory on the flat course in 2:03:59, Gebrselassie improved his previous result of 2:04:26 by 27 seconds, which he had achieved last year in Berlin.
Gebrselassie, 35, has thus set his 26th world record in his versatile career, in which he has achieved a world championship title or a world record on every route from one kilometer to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie left the Olympic Marathon in Beijing out of fear, which was perhaps exaggerated in retrospect that air pollution could exacerbate his asthma problems.
Instead, he signed up for the competition in Berlin.
In almost ideal conditions - at sun and 9 degrees at start and 13 degrees at destination - Gebrselassie has won at an average speed of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
Since runners like Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat have changed from Kenya on long-distance routes, the record time for marathon has fallen by more than 2 minutes in the last 10 years, since Ronaldo Costa won from Brazil in 1998 in Berlin with the result 2:06:05.
After his victory on Sunday, Gebrselassie informed the press that he had had convulsions in his vein two weeks ago and therefore could not train a week.
Apparently he was refreshed after a break and did not come back rusty.
"I'm so happy," he said to reporters.
"Everything has gone perfectly.
I resumed my training a week ago and had some concerns today, but in the end everything was great."
He was criticised for this - especially in Kenya, Ethiopia's rivals from East Africa - that he overly orchestrated his races, that many world's best marathon stars generally avoid relying too much on the race leaders as if it were a race, and that puts world records on the competition.
But this criticism hardly harms the size of Gebrselassie as a long-distance runner.
Accompanied by four Kenyans on Sunday, Gebrselassie had reached the center of the route in 1:02:04.
Two elite runners from Kenya, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi continued to challenge Gebrselassie after the tempo makers had left behind.
A little more than three miles before the finish, Gebrselassie made his last move to separate himself from Kwambai, who arrived second in 2:05:36 and thus improved his best time by almost 5 minutes.
Kamathi was third in 2:07:48.
For women, Irina Mikitenko, originally from Kazakhstan and now German, has completed a remarkable year by showing the seventh fastest result of all time at 2:19:19.
The world record of 2:15:25 keeps Paul Radcliff from Great Britain.
Last spring, the 36-year-old Mikitenko won the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She missed the games in Beijing due to problems described as back injury. However, she recovered to win in Berlin and improve her best time in her third marathon by five minutes.
She had planned her run by having a quartet of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners pulled out first, but overtaken after 30 kilometers.
Ascal Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia was second in 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop from Kenya was third in 2:25:01.
The pride and the tightness in the life of the black population, in a city of a very special kind
Hidden between the rises of the amusement parks in the vicinity of Orlando, a few miles from the glittering, loud and gigantic driving, is a quiet city where the pride and complications of African-American culture are evident.
Eatonville, the first completely black town in the country and the home town of Zora Neale Hurstons, is no longer as easy to describe as Hurston did in 1935: "the city with 5 lakes, three scratches, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, more than enough guavas, 2 schools and no prison."
Today it is a pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville to commemorate the most famous author of the Harlem Renaissance.
And yet, the city that she describes – and which made her a tourist destination by including her in the Florida tour guide, which was produced at the time of depression by the German author project – is, in many respects, a place of very special variety.
Eatonville is so independent, clever and private as in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural black communities in Florida often refused to share their true thoughts with the white man, who "knows so little about us that he doesn't know what is missing."
Even today, in a year when a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, calls for an open discussion on racial relations, many people continue to be saddened to be observed by outsiders.
"We are very concerned about how our story is told," says Hortense Jones, 59, from birth to a resident of the city and a parishioner of the oldest church in the city.
It has to be right."
Eatonville was long defined as a paradox of triumph and struggle.
It is both a historical example of the black movement and a community of almost 2,400 inhabitants, where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
It is, on the one hand, a stronghold of literature and, on the other hand, an example of the black culture of rural south - sometimes condemned, sometimes praised - that has its roots in American slavery.
It is not surprising that residents here are both proud and on guard.
And really, the concerns about Eatonville's image actually started with Zora, as all Hurston call here.
She introduced her hometown to the world in books that came from the heart and were written in the mouth, such as "Mules and Men" (1953) and "Their Eyes were watching God" (1973)
Five paragraphs in the Florida Guide changed the city, which is very close to Route 77, a street that leads through the often-forgotten center of Florida, to the scenes of black history and human drama.
Naughty as Oskar in both real life and literature, Hurston Reader led to Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then turned to more private business.
"Outside the street to the left," she wrote, "is the brown-white painted modern school, with its well-kept gardens and playgrounds, which Howard Miller always takes care of, although he can hardly read and write."
She also mentioned the new husband of Widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "sold drinks of any kind and what-even- always fits into hour rooms."
In just a few hundred words, Hurston associated Eatonville with self-government, but also with illiteracy, second marriage and sex.
This was certainly not a guide.
In fact, this was not a portrait that was appreciated by all.
"Zora described things as they were," said 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of the Johnson girls who immortalized Hurston by quoting the men who sang songs about their beauty that were full of sexual allusions.
She added, "Some people didn't like this."
One still remembers Hurtson as a lively eccentric who returned regularly after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Augustus Franklin, 77, remembered that when Hurston got into town, she usually did this without warning, in a noisy Chevrolet, smoking and wearing pants, in a city that imagines itself today something of its venerable style of dress.
According to Mr. Franklin, most people were fascinated, whereas many despised them.
"People were always happy to see Zora," said Mr. Franklin.
But "she never stayed too long," he added while rocking in his chair, on a back-facing terrace overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was probably baptized.
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books expired.
Together with most of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten them.
Although she was once a famous author, a contemporary Langstin Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she lived, in an anonymous grave.
In Eatonville there was no great commemorative celebration, no public readings in great style.
"I don't think they understood their contribution in the world or their heritage in the least," says Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows", a biography of Hurston published in 2003.
The turn came in the 1980s.
Orange County authorities wanted to put a five-lane highway through the city to replace the Kennedy Boulevard, the slow two-lane main street of the municipality.
Orlando's suburbs had already pushed highway 4 through the western outskirts.
The proposal was made when Eatonville was still recovering from a difficult phase in his history.
Forced integration, among other things, had put an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the congregation.
In the 1950s, the fight against racial mutilation brought hatred into the community.
"At this time, a bunch of white boys often came and they threw oranges and stuff at the people sitting away," said Mr. Franklin.
"There was even a woman who was killed.
They threw a watermelon out of the car."
In 1955, in a letter to the Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the request of the Supreme Court of Justice to force integration by calling its decision against the school council in the case of Brown "respecting insulting rather than my race".
People today say that although the abolition of racial segregation was positive in some respects, it weakened group cohesion in Eatonville and the self-confidence of its young people.
"Black children were used to being hugged - I remember - they hugged his teacher in the morning and they hugged his teacher in the evening," says N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and managing director of the non-profit group to protect the Eatonville community.
This could be maintained for so long, she added, until teachers and students no longer came from the same place.
"You didn't hug his white teacher, because he was a white teacher - I mean there's a cultural divide," said Ms. Nathiri.
However, civil rights have contributed to the creation of space for other Zora Neale Hurstons - black authors, actors, and artists who have moved beyond prejudices, as they did, with positive self-confidence and statements such as: "How can anyone deny the joy of my society!
I don't understand."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker set out for Hurston's nameless tomb and began to fight for the revival of her fame.
Five years later, a highly acclaimed Hurston biography by Robert E. Hemenway was to be found in the bookshelves, and once again made it part of the American literary canon.
The long distance road project came at a time when Eatonville's most famous daughter was once again exposed to the public.
And this time Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a savior.
The municipality began planning a Hurston Festival in 1988 to show what the district could destroy with the construction of the motorway.
Thousands of fans came to the opening event two years later, and every January many return for the celebration.
A few years later, the district turned away from its road construction plans.
"The plans of a five-lane highway revived the city, accelerated the whole thing at peak speed, aroused real citizens' pride," said Ms. Nathiri.
Ms. Boyd put it a little easier: "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory against the long-distance road project has contributed to a change in the city's self-image.
There were more and more trainees, such as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who has been going to church since 1993, and locals began to appreciate the past.
Eatonville was included in the nationwide historical register in 1998.
A new one-storey library (of course named after Hurston) opened in 2006 on the newly paved and beautified Kennedy Boulevard.
Today Eatonville is still a speciality in Florida: only 6 miles from Orlandos city centre, it can sometimes feel like a back street in the summer rain, as small as it was when it was founded by only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(Today it is 90% black.)
Outsiders looking for the history of Eatonville and its significance are often still treated with caution.
For most interviews a permit is necessary in advance and certain things - like the wall painting of Eatonville's oldest church, painted by a white man and representing black men in field work - are not allowed to be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Mrs. Jones, a courageous, self-confident teacher with a preference for dark red, are still afraid that their shielded community will be misunderstood.
And yet, at the same time as the Hurston Festival grew, an increased degree of home pride was also born.
Especially young people tend to see Eatonville as Hurston saw her whole race: beautiful, with all his problems, neither worse nor better and just as proud, creative and diligent, silly and mesmerized as any other race and people in America.
It is the sincere love for this city that can be heard in Mr. Franklin's Neffen's voice, the 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who is planning to return to Eatonville after college to work in the city administration or in the police, who according to him might need some help.
And even the younger ones, such as Alondra and Alexia Kenon, eleven-year-old twins from Winter Park, have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people who only pass through here will think, "Oh, this city is nothing compared to all the others," said Alondra Kenon the other day on a Sunday after the church.
"But if you actually stop and look at his story for a moment, it's a very beautiful city."
Here in New York we speak fluent financial Latin.
At first glance nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from the newspaper stands and the huge TV screens in Times Square, they wouldn't notice they were in the middle of a debacle.
They would never believe that over their heads, in the shoe-box offices with the glass facades, bankers and hedge fund managers who have the monopoly in New York, daily have the worst horror working day since the market crash of 1929.
The suppliers still push with loud flaps the metal teacombs along the sidewalks and transport tablets loaded with muffins for breakfast meetings.
Latinos still roam between apartments, like human packers loaded with around 50 wrapped t-shirts hanging on a yoke-like pole lying on their shoulders.
Office employees are still waiting for the food stands on the sidewalks and it is still impossible to get a yellow taxi on a day of the week between 16 and 19 o'clock.
It didn't feel like a crisis at all until Thursday afternoon, because of all the world's downturn, I decided to open a new savings account.
Although I had decided to put my duty on time on the quiet late afternoon in my JP Morgan Chase tribal branch, there were already about 20 people in line.
Not to the cash desks to withdraw or deposit money, but to the customer service desk where regular customers order checkbooks, ask tourists about the way to Macy's department store and where new customers open accounts.
Most of them in front of me, so I later learned from Starr, my "personal banker with license," stood for the same reason as I snaked.
Unlike me, however, they had already cancelled their savings from smaller banks, from places where they commuted, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They had collected money from so-called Thrifts (a little like a building savings bank), cooperative banks and those local savings banks that only have branches in a state, saying that they treat their customers like family.
Last year, 15 of these banks went quietly.
In the last few days, Washington Mutual, a bank with investments of $327 billion, went into bankruptcy management over and as the last Friday New Yorker went home over the weekend, Wachovia, another bank that owns savings investments of $440 billion, was looking for a saving buyer.
In fear of another collapse, the office and shop employees who were standing before me brought their bares to a bank that is considered a safe port, a bank that is responsible for most rescue purchases on Wall Street.
Very normal New Yorkers have acquired flowing financial Latin over the past few weeks.
A woman who phoned in my Chinese tribal supermarket took so much familiarity with Lehman Brothers, the bankrupt bank and their lean-looking CEO Dick Fuld as if she were blaspheming about a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, the 50-year-old uniformed concierge of my apartment block has come from our usual entertainment topics about Brad and Angelina and my food delivery.
"I now have all my savings in money market funds" she told me after my visit to the bank.
"I've changed, I'm not taking any more risks."
Muslim tombs damaged during right-hand slide in Austria
Heinz-Christian Strache, a left-wing judge of Austria's right-wing Freedom Party, and Filip Dewinter, a member of the Belgian right-wing Pertei Vlaam's interest, participate in a demonstration in Antwerp on Thursday, January 17, 2008, to represent the organization "Citys against Islamization".
They wear signs in the style of traffic signs on which a mosque is depicted, crossed with a red line.
The police accuse right-wing extremists of grave damage at a Muslim cemetery in Austria, on the same weekend at the extreme right parties, of having significant profits in the country's parliamentary election.
On the night of Friday to this morning, more than 90 graves were seriously damaged at the Traun Cemetery near Linz in an action organized, according to the police.
The perpetrators sprayed Jewish symbols like the David Star on some of the graves, but criminal officials consider this to be an attempt to disguise the motive of extremists driven by hatred for Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident is in any way related to the elections.
A spokesman of the local Islamic community said she was "deeply shaken" about the news of the tomb desecration that took place when the religious month of Muslim Ramadan tends to end.
At the same time, there is a round of conscience research in Austria after the country slipped to the right in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
The FPÖ and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, the two far right-wing parties that received almost 30% of the votes, advocated a strict anti-immigrant law in their election campaign and some of their election claims were criticized by opponents as xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, chairman of the FPÖ, who won 18% of the votes, advocated a ban on head cloths and Burkas and even made his aversion to food that is generally associated with Islam.
At his last rally in Vienna he spoke of a "European Brotherhood" to prevent the growth of Islam.
Both parties want to prohibit the building of mosques and minarets with the argument that these political symbols are a continuous Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Surveys and analyses carried out immediately after the election, which indicate that the extreme rights are the most politically strong bloc in the country, indicate that this new development is based on young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Foreign Travel Ban for Gary Glitter
Gary Glitter, the glam rock star convicted of child sexual abuse, was prevented from travelling to France and Spain.
Judge Glitter set up a six-month barrier after informing the authorities controlling him that he wanted to travel to Spain via France.
The Kent police were granted last Thursday to impose a ban on foreign travel after presenting proof to the judges of Glitter's convictions for the sexual abuse of children.
Glitter, the real name Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at the Ashford District Court in Kent, but was represented by Corker Binning.
One of the speakers of the Court of Justice reported: "On Thursday, 25 September, the police asked Kent at the Ashford District Court for permission to prevent travel abroad from Mr. Paul Glad to France and Spain until 25 March.
Paul Gadd was not personally present."
As required by the Sexual Criminal Register, Glitter, 64, had informed the authorities that he wanted to travel abroad.
He must inform the authorities if he wishes to travel abroad for more than three days.
He must also inform the police 7 days before his planned departure.
Failure to notify the authorities could lead to a five-year prison sentence.
The Kent police said that they would not discuss individual cases or glitter's possible place of residence in the country.
A spokeswoman from Kent's police unit said, "The Kent police will do everything they can to protect children in this country and abroad."
"In our opinion, it is easier to control someone who is in the UK because we have a comprehensive system to effectively prevent any potential risks."
"It is the chief concern of Kent police to protect Kent's residents and we work closely together to monitor the behaviour of registered sex offenders in the country to minimise any risk that might exist for the population.
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abuse of 2 girls aged 10 and 11.
When he was released, Glitter flew to Bangkok, where he was scheduled to take a flight to London.
But he said he didn't feel comfortable and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not let him through the passport control and he flew to Hong Kong after some time and again.
The Chinese authorities also refused him entry and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and border officers insisted that he return to Great Britain.
Finally, he arrived at Terminal 3 in Heathrow on August 22nd and stayed there while his lawyer David Corker went to the Uxbridge District Court in West London, since Scotland Yard had asked for permission to register as a sexual offender.
Glitter had previously been detained in the UK for 4 months in 1999 for possession of images of child abuse.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, Interior Minister Jacqui Smith was reassured and satisfied that Glitter was prevented from travelling to France and Spain.
`I receive the master behind the stage to hold his character', Günter Brauer, photographer.
No paragraphs, no ruffles, no costumes for appearance.
The nature of the great flamenco dancers who refrain from concentration and devote themselves to interpretation in order to get a relaxed appearance as a woman or as a man.
On the one hand, artists
On the other hand, personality
I look into private life, into these moments that are foreign to the audience, I know when I can find typical gestures for the personality, the depth of a stolen look or the expression of the hands that are concerned because they will not enter the stage.
In his project 'Flamenco-people' the German photographer Günter Bauer presents a variety of theatrical performances on stage with singers, dancers and guitarists. From this side he was still little known for the artists.
With this proposal, the photographer creates a special iconography of flamenco representation at different levels.
The exhibition, which is part of the program of the month of the photograph of Flamenco, reflects the international importance of Flamenco, which is growing from day to day,' explains the artist and makes it clear that 'Flamenco-people' can be any human being, but when you look at the photos, the viewer notices that there are no typical images of artists on stage.
Very normal people on the portraits are artists who are able on stage to convey passion, sadness, joy and thus to move the audience.
In order to retain the personality of these artists, you don't have to take photos on stage.
Their personality and character are in their hearts.
What interested me was to create a personal atmosphere that would allow me to hold the characters of the greatest flamenco masters with the camera'.
Bauer, inspired by the festival `Cante de las Minas', made a long trip in 1997 to photograph singers, guitarists or dancers with a digital camera.
Thanks to the image sorting function of the camera and the existing material, images were created that remind of classical photography.
The application of various stylistic means destroys the classical basis of the image, giving the image the modernity and the idea, as the farmer Flamenco understands: 'music with traditional roots that change and surprises every day'.
This is not just the dance, the singing or the instrumental play itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, which seduces the audience with his art.
The search for the essential, for a certain something that becomes visible in the form of hearing, being, was and was the fixed goal of this work, which will be presented in the next time in the gallery of El Fotomata.
Famous personalities in Flamenco among them Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Moreente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo and others are among the close selection of almost seventy artists who were photographed.
The project became an anthology of the Flamenco and will soon appear as a book, with all portraits from the exhibition.
Bauer's passion for the portraits led him to take up this idea two years ago and to realize it as 'portraits of the veterans of sports' ('sportart project').
Although the concepts of the project 'Flamenco-people' are different, the photographer gives me a lot of pleasure in photographing people, getting to know them and putting me in their living conditions, whether for a short moment or a longer time.
I think that in the field of photography the portrait is the most difficult genus.
You meet or meet people, personalities you sometimes don't know at all, or they leave you alone for a few minutes to take a photo.
Apart from these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to realize my ideas.'
The collection of the portraits of the Flamenco of today entitled 'Flamenco-people' is exhibited in the gallery of the El Fotomata, which is located in the street called la calle de la Mata and runs parallel to the street la Alameda de Hércules. You can visit the exhibition until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa admits that the Roma he's just writing is 'a great attitude'.
He does not yet know where the story of the novel takes place and what it is about, but Mario Vargas Llosa is constantly trying to advance the project on which he is working, a novel with the protagonist Roger Casemant, a nationalist from Ireland who lived in the Congo for twenty years and moved into the Amazon area.
Yesterday, during his presence at the festival Hay Festival Segovia, the preferred Nobel Laureate admitted that the project he was dealing with is 'a cool spirit' and 'everything points out that he didn't have to write the novel'.
'If I had thought, I would not have done it, but I will do it and hope to end the novel at some point', so he concluded his participation in the festival, where the ideas, thoughts and words were exchanged. Within the four days he saw hundreds of writers, historians, journalists and thousands of people who were in Segovia.
The author of `La ciudad y los perros' was one of the most outstanding personalities at the third festival and made forecasts.
Vargas Llosa, who won the premium of the festival Hay Festival and gave her voice to most of the people present, is compared to the old edition of `Ourmutual friend' and can be seen in the theater Juan Bravo.
He was introduced by Félix Romeo and found that he had an audience in mind who noticed that the Peruvian, who has a wonderful memory and a great sense of humor, was not given enough time to go through everything again: how his vocation to literature was created out of 'extraordinary adventure', out of 'joy at reading' and out of 'more experience' than before; how he writes and 'discipline preserves' to complement 'the lack of inspiration', his intense work with documentation, numerous corrections and revisions he makes; how Faulkner, Víctor Hugo and Alejandro Dumas influenced his vocation and what 'remembers' it is, which form the basis for his stories.
The Hispano-American novelist admitted that there is 'no way' to measure and from where to know whether books change life, 'but I refuse to believe that literature is pure entertainment, a fleeting experience', Vargas Llosa stressed, who claims that it causes 'effects' and 'brings people even more apart', so I asked the writers 'don't leave them easy' and 'take responsibility' for his vocation.
At the festival in Pozoblanco the weather did not play with: bullfights fell out in part.
After the announced bullfighters found that the ground of the square was in poor condition, the bullfighting festival with which the festival was to be concluded in Pozoblanco was moved to yesterday morning.
With the agreement of Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, the organizer decided to postpone the bullfight.
Thus the festival was suspended from the unconstant weather, which is why two out of three celebrations could not take place.
On Saturday it rained, so the second scheduled bullfighting festival could not be celebrated.
The group of the Matadors consisted of José Luis Moreno, Curro Días and Juan Bautista, who gradually entered the Bullfight Farena.
So there was only a celebration on Friday.
The winner there was Daniel Luque, who cut three ears and triumphed after leaving the passage with pleasure and aesthetics.
On the same evening Alejandro Talavante met two horns and an ear of the bull, which had succeeded him more by galloping than by his bullfighting.
Even worse was El Juli, who passed through the Arena de Los Llanos without difficulty, but also without fame.
After fighting so badly, most of the audience responded to his second fight with Buh calls.
In Álava, two people wanted to escape the control of their car, which was loaded with two thousand pounds of hashish.
Tomorrow: five minutes ago ten.
Traffic control in Ertzaintza, in the city area of Armiñon (Álava).
Two policemen called on the drivers of the car to stop, which led them to flee.
It looked as if they would not have to stop with the load of more than two thousand kilos of hashish.
The police persecuted her and arrested one of the drivers, the man who is 28 years old, known as A. A. J., as the Ministry of the Interior of the Basque State announced.
The arrested person was accused of drug trafficking and forgery of official documents.
The incident occurred when the officials of the traffic police of the region of Álava had already completed traffic control on the N-1 and passed through the city area of Armiñon.
They decided to stop a car to carry out the route control. The driver did not follow the instructions, suddenly increased the speed and tried to escape control.
The police began the persecution until the car stopped at the edge after a few kilometres. At the moment, the drivers got out of the car to flee a country road into a forest area.
The police of the city of Ertzaintza finally picked up one of the two. In the car, an Iveco Daily, the drug traffickers transported 2,178 kilos of hashish, which was confiscated by the police.
The front part of the car was loaded with hashish bundles, which were later directed to precise laboratory analysis and to weigh the bundle to other police departments.
In addition, the officials found that the identification mark was 'doubled' so that it did not match the identification mark indicated in the car papers, which is why an additional arrest was made for the falsification of official documents.
The police of the city of Ertzaintza continue the investigations to carry out the arrest of the second suspect who, as already mentioned, was able to escape, but also to determine the origin of the confiscated drugs.
The arrested 28-year-old A.A.J. was taken to a police station for questioning. He will be presented to the prison judge in the next few hours.
Actress Heather Locklear was arrested for driving under the influence of an unknown drug.
The actress Heather Locklear, known for the role of Amanda from the "Melrose Place" series, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) for driving under the influence of an unknown drug.
One Witness had observed how she tried to get out of her park in Montecito in a rather strange way, reported the newspaper People's.
The witness told in detail that Locklear pushed through a gas pedal after 16:30 and made a lot of noise by trying to move her car back or forward from the parking hole, and as she drove back, she grabbed her sunglasses a few times.
A little later, the witness, who had probably not recognized the actress at first, saw Locklear stopping on a nearby street and getting out of the car.
The witness was the person who notified the emergency service because she had `anxious life for Locklears'.
When the police came, they found the actress sitting in her car, standing across the street, blocking traffic.
'They seemed to be unoriented', so they brought the police to a special drug and alcohol center to take a test.
According to a police spokesperson, the actress proved to be cooperative, excessive alcohol enjoyment was excluded from the first moment. 'The first observations of the officials led us to believe that Locklear was under the influence of an unknown drug', the speaker said.
Locklear was arrested under the suspicion of driving under the influence of an indefinite substance that could not be determined and brought into a local detention centre at 7 p.m.
Two months ago Locklaer was released from the Arizona clinic after being treated for anxiety and depression.
Llamazares insists that the United Left's Andalusian Federation be responsible for the Silva case.
Gaspar Llamazares, the main coordinator of the VL and member of the United Left, has today assured that the Regional Association for Education will be the one that will make the decision in the case of the former City Council for Youth and Sport of the City Hall in Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after he was accused of doing business with family members.
`In such cases, I am a great federalist, and the Andalusian organization will be the one who has to take responsibility for it', Llamazares pointed out what approach the party must have towards that which has so far been sitting as a city council in the council of Seville.
Nevertheless, the president of the VL defended the need for 'transparency' in the possible investigations of the breaches of the rules that Silva might have started: 'The VL always insisted that such cases should be given maximum transparency'.
With regard to this subject, he stressed that education has a strict code of ethics for all public authorities.
`Sangre de mayo': Hero Book of Garci
Inspired by `Episodios Nacionales' by Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Carci in `Sangre de mayo' represents the revised version of the Spanish uprising against the French. This is an admirable film in filmography, with about 15 million euros invested in filming.
In this way, the cinema has tried to represent 'a lot of personalities and social analysis', which he has always admired in the works of the famous novelist, Carci today explained in the presentation of the film with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the beginning of a long list of performers.
`Sangre de mayo' with a film length of more than two and a half hours, this Friday will be presented in cinemas and later on on the transmitter Telemadrid will be shown as a four-hour miniseries.
José Luis Garci, a great fan of Galdó's literature, assures that thanks to this film his 'childhood dream' came true. He owes this to Esperanza Aguirre, who three years ago commissioned him by the autonomous community of Madrid to film a memorial film for the second century celebration in Madrid on November 2. Especially because the story is based on 'Episodios Nacionales', he accepted the order.
The total contribution of 15 million made by the autonomous community of Madrid for filming, Garci, as he added, offers the 'unique opportunity' with the help of decorations and corresponding clothing the image of 'disguised Spain, which chose the false leader for the battle because the people had been brought to a halt by the struggle for independence and under the rule of the Ferdinand of VII.'
However, the cinematist regrets that one could not expect funding like `Alatriste' or `Los fantasmas de Goya' (twice as high as at `Sangre de mayo'), so some scenes from the script with Horacio Valcárcel, with which Garci worked almost his entire career, could not be filmed.
For this reason, Garci, who was also director of film in 'Volver a empezar', contributed by his usual way of working: he stood on stage to the actors with whom one must first try before starting to shoot and for those who had not done casting, he appeared 'demeaning' and respectful, 'part of the career of the director of the film consists in providing help in theatre and cinema to know what is happening in the cinema industry in which one works.'
Many actors he encounters in `Sangre de mayo' have to repeat in front of his camera, as in the case of Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garci, Oscar candidate in four nominations (of which he won one), is of the opinion and assured that none of the three candidates representing Spain in front of the Academy of Hollywood this year are a young generation of Spanish filmography. Neither `Sangre de mayo', nor `Site mesas de billar francés', nor finally the selected movie `Los girasoles ciegos'.
Garci does not expect awards for this film.
`In the beginning you think you're working for the offspring, later you realize that it's only for the better, and now you're happy when you've produced another movie', explains Garci after more than 30 years of work.
Isabel Bayón calls back the memory of the dancer from Seville Tórtola Valencia
A flamenco dancer from Seville worships a dancer who also comes from Seville.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia: her father was Catalane (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and the mother Andalusian (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), she was born in the Triana district and when she was three years old, her family moved to London.
She was a dancer and an expert for oriental dances.
She had an exciting life, she was one of the first fighters for the emancipation of women, such as Isadora Ducan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist, a vegetarian, and stood for the abolition of the corset, which restricted free female movement.
Isabel Bayón was fascinated by the life of this woman, who left her traces of the dance and aesthetic revolution in Europe between the wars.
`I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she suggested to me this role which seemed impossible to me.'
'We don't try to tell about her life without keeping her Esprit,' said the flamenco dancer.
Your dance grounds helped me a lot in Flamenco.
'The dance of the butterfly' seemed to me, for example, like Guajira, or 'the dance of the snake' like Tango.
Her dancing was sensual and I have been told that my dancing is also in this aesthetic area,' she claims.
The production is based on two extraordinary collaborations: with Miguel Poveda, who will sing for Isabel again at one of her performances, as he did in `La puerto aberta'; and with Flamenco master Matilde Coral, who wanted to work exceptionally with one of her ex-students.
`Matilde plays Tórtola, a very mature personality.
I am happy because she agreed to participate in my work, and I feel very honored.'
The production also includes musical composition and guitarists Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, with the vocals of Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Morón; with the percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the viola of Rafa el Viola and the collaboration with the actor Juanfra Jjarez, he takes on the role of companion of the artists who were Divas in whom he is in love again and again.'
This work also tells in a certain way of the life of this woman, who was known in as far places as India, the United States or Russia and also throughout Europe, although she lived in London normally.
`I wanted to call her back in memory, because I think she is one of the women who have a tremendous influence on a particular era and whose works no longer have any value today and therefore she knows even less', says Bayón.
The performance takes place today at 20:30 in the Theater Lope de Vega.
The publication of the book `Diario de un poeta recién casado' also includes the Triennium
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of `Diario de un poeta recién casado' in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), in a place where Juan Ramón Jiménez married in 1916 Zenobia, offers a corresponding atmosphere to carry out planned activities on behalf of the Andalusian Council for Culture in order to celebrate the `Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramón' (2006-2008). The aim is to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize in Literature and the day of the death of the two.
Thus, `the Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramón' is completed with the new edition of this work, with the international congress taking place in New York, with the restoration of the house museum of Juan Ramón Jiménez-Zenobia and with the hiking exhibition `Juan Ramón Jiménez: `Aquel chopo de luz', which opened in May and after which it was in different places in Andalusia, now reached New York and is presented during the international congress.
The Andalusian Council for Culture has also received eight hundred copies of `Diario de un poeta recién casado', published by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Pacobo Pérez-Enciso. The aim is to make the person and the work of the Andalusian world poet more famous.
The U.S. can imagine bad without Paul Newman
`Sometimes God creates perfect personalities.
Paul Newman was one of them."
This phrase comes from the actress Sally Field, who worked with him in 'sensation reporter', and came from the then prevailing idea of the American cinema, which was abandoned, from all America to Newman with his enthusiastic vision and followed her.
Now look what it cost him to give the Oscar.
And when he retired in 2007.
And he knew he was very sick.
Nevertheless, it was a great blow for everyone.
`What one sometimes feels is much more than an expression, and now I have lost a great friend', said Robert Redford crying, `My life and my country were the greatest horrors of his life.'
No one was afraid to make himself ridiculous or to exaggerate.
As the 'father' of the cinema and the fatherland, he died in a sad moment, in which fear of terrorists and the collapse of the market prevails, in which the depressed self-esteem of the US Americans is in the hopeless search for reasons to hold back dignity.
If in this hard time without virtue only a few people can be admired, you don't necessarily have to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all, he embodies a platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official enemy of Richard Nixon and suffered as well as various losses as well: from the foundation that has dedicated itself to the fight against drugs and in honor of his son from the first marriage, who died of overdose, was founded up to his own brand of homemade and organic products.
All of this is a gift to the country where it took a great deal of effort for him to fight a deadly food culture.
A wide wave of amazement strikes haushoch over Hollywood without taking into account nationalities and nationality.
The last James Bond, Englishman Daniel Craig, confirmed that not only one person died, but the whole era.
The Englishman Sam Mendes, film director and Oscar winner, said that working with Newman was no longer or no less than the top of his career.
Russell Crowe, the evil boy who came from Australia, dared to call Newman his greatest inspiration.
`We have left the greatest of us all', confirmed George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who today trust to live as Paul Newman lived: having high demands on justice, leading a responsible private life, far from the cameras.
This is not always easy or even possible in today's media jungle.
But there's someone who's trying, and Paul Newman was an example of that.
He divorced once and was then married to Joanne Woodward for fifty years, who he was faithful, although there were certainly many possibilities not to be.
`Why should I eat a hamburger on the street when I have fillet at home?', he often joked himself.
In heaven he will be proud that on earth his daughters have the same opinion as his fans, which is not necessarily common in America.
'Of all the great roles he played, he was not as proud as of the faithful spouse, the loving father, the attentive grandfather and the philanthropist', they say.
For the Olympic Games, the streets in Madrid are flawed.
Yes, the dream of many of us is to organize some Olympic disciplines in Madrid, after the failure for 2012, it may be 2016.
But I wonder, are we prepared for this?'
Yes, we follow the example of the old streets, I say it's not true!
It was called the perfect road, and in my opinion, it was the worst road with everything in it and there.
Of course, it is a lot of nonsense if you took note of the evaluation and I could check it, that clearly would not have been possible.
But, let's go through everything from the beginning.
The nonsense starts with the ticket pick-up that allows you to go first.
It doesn't seem bad to me either, but if they let you do it, they should give you everything (including chip to avoid the congestion on the road).
So don't.
Here they only let you get the ticket (the first nonsense that consists of just going there) and (after an infinite queue) there is the surprise! The T-shirt was only in the size `S' (a second nonsense because I need the size XL)
Where do we live anyway?
Or is it that after the crisis it was decided to buy only small, much cheaper shirts made of less fabric?
All right, things like this are a trifle compared to the days on the road.
Apart from the fact that you have to go very early to get the chip, there is already a waiting line of at least 15 minutes and, moreover, you have to leave the backpack.
Waiting has taken more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible in the case of a street where 11,000 people are expected.
Finally, as was to be expected, the road started and we had not left our backpacks in front of it, even if once it had succeeded, but it would have been harder to get them back.
In addition, during these 40 minutes of waiting for rain, it seemed that there was an temptation to organize a popular uprising and attack the house.
I think tomorrow will certainly have some 500 people pneumonia and some like me will not even appear at the time of classification because of this chip that I have got, I can already think that the output was mismarked.
Of course, if you asked me for a perfect street, this road would never come to mind.
So I think we're still going to dream of a city that's well prepared for the Olympic Games.
Microsoft looking for a (virtual) receptionist
At the 'Emerging Technology Conference', organized by MIT, Microsoft presented the progress of the new image recognition system and human interaction, an artificial intelligence being without much intelligence, which is capable of accomplishing some primitive tasks, such as ordering a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, this is a route planner to move on the company's campus).The system takes note of what it hears during entertainment.
Thanks to a camera and a form and facial recognition system, this 'receptionist' can see how many people are in the room, who they are and even remember how they were dressed, how they can listen and understand the keywords of their conversation.
It can also include those present after the discussions in the groups.
In the presentation video, `the receptionist' notices a third person, but she understands that this person is not part of the group who is having a conversation with her, and that neither is a company employee.
She asks if the person wants to visit someone here and answers that she will listen soon.
Everything without the blue screenshot
Impressive
This is certainly the future.
Now the company has better things to focus on, for example on the next version of its Windows operating system.
This week one talked very superficially about Microsoft's change of strategy.
Windows 7 will be faster and not have so many embedded programs.
Steve Ballmer found that if the computers were equipped with the most necessary instead of filling them with commercial garbage, they would work five times faster. Man, Steven, that will only be for the few.
Everything is only a finding when you consider that Microsoft added one or other feature and 'Extras' in Windows versions.
The change of direction is worthwhile
Microsoft is right, the operating system gradually loses importance, just like the software.
When Google Chrome appeared online, that was part of the theory that it was the first step of Google to compete with Windows.
Skillful many point out that the browser is not an operating system.
The operating system, as an essential part, will always be necessary to enable hardware and software to work at the same time.
The operating system performs the function that can be compared to the function of his wife or his husband when it comes to communicating something to his mother-in-law.
That's right.
The system will never disappear, but one must think of his 'death', not as an absolute, but as a relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week is the confirmation of this idea.
People pay less attention to the operating system every time, more to the web browser.
The computer is only started to run the Firefox, Explorer or Chrome and every day we spend more time surfing than in the environment of the `windows'.
What is the purpose of half of the applications available in the computer?
Less Is More
And Windows 7 needs to be more compact, much more compact than Vista.
Lighter, not so exaggerated, less complicated.
The interest of Microsofts is more to integrate its online services, which can eventually become the alternative to Google.
In reality, they need that, without a doubt.
The photo of this place I took in Redmond, in one of the recreation rooms for Microsoft employees at the beginning of the month.
A sign is attached to the refreshing beverage machine: 'Your search. Our future'. It prints out a request to use your own online search tool.
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of employees at Microsoft, Google, used research on the Internet.
By the way, last week it was also confirmed that the new version of Windows Mobile 7 has been delayed.
It will not appear at the beginning, but at the end of 2009, rather in 2010.
Microsoft is looking for the possibility to bring Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 to the market at the same time.
Every day the phone turns into a computer.
The Android and the iPhon are already on the market, but the other delay will cost money.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso had it in Costa Azul, Leonardo di Caprio had this brand in `Blood Diamond' by Edward Zwick, just like Al Pacino in `Der Pate' by Francis Ford Coppola. At the same time it belongs to the clothing of a well-built pastor.
When we start counting the countless star performances, we can go back to the image of a very powerful man, with a pointed beard that had raised heavy weights in a hiking circus.
Basically, this is a typical male t-shirt made of cotton, sleeveless and waistless.
The English-speaking people call it 'tank'. However, Lle Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles surpasses all other brands.
First, because of its great name, although it is called 'Marcel' in the narrow circle. Legend tells that the name creation is connected to sport and stems from Boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of singer Edith Piaf.
`La Marcel' surpasses all because of its excellent cotton, because of its distinctive Unisex cut and is characterized by a small Belgian flag (almost recognizable) that these T-shirts have as detail on the neckline.
And notice, the Belgian company is not just focusing on the production of 'tanks'.
You also have College Sweatshirts, Boxer Retro, Cardigans and cashmere, cotton trousers, T-shirts with stripes, Babies, Mini Shorts
Modelled and comfortable underwear.
Although, it is very bad to use them as underwear.
You're very charming.
'I want to be a young mother; I don't worry about the candidate'
Her great appearance with her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Mónica Cruz is graceful, but full of joy in life.
At present, the siblings Gruz take their new activity in fashion very seriously.
For Mónica this means much more than for some pretty and rich girls who keep their reputation.
She was in Paris at the doctorate of Mango, then moved her residence and also made the presentation of the most important prizes in the fashion that the Spanish fashion house sponsors.
Compassionate and shy, winner on the short routes.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I have come to present the new collection for this autumn/winter season, which my sister Penélope and I have designed for Mango, and I have also visited the presentation of the second edition of `Mango Fashion Awards' and participated in the dinner in honour of Valentino.
A very intensive working time, which is exciting at the same time.
You work for the Spanish house, what is the basis of your new collection for the fourth season for Mango?
My sister, both I am fascinated by the cinema of the 50s and 60s; there we find many ideas.
I would like to go through a city and watch women as they are dressed, as they combine their clothes, I often do.
Dancer, actress and fashion designer, you're a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I think, but finally, everything meets in one and these areas have many commonities.
Since I was little, I was thrilled with the clothes; I always wanted to go to my grandmother to roll around in my aunt’s wardrobes and see her clothes.
That was great, almost better than going to a amusement park.
Later, as a dancer, I always tried to watch the clothes.
You know, we dancers like it so much to have our own style in class and at the rehearsals to look into the mirror and feel good about it.
As an actress, when you get the costume, you put yourself in the real acting role.
Finally, everything is connected, it is so, much respect for the costume designer and their professionalism.
You just turned 30, didn't you fall into a crisis?
Oh, my God.
I feel better than ever, when I'm 30, I feel good.
I think the woman is getting mature, has experience and can enjoy life with less mistakes.
I'm not afraid of my biological clock.
I've done the things I've wanted to do since I was a kid, and that has given me a lot of inner joy.
So, are you thinking of becoming a mother, or not?
For a long time, I have known that I am becoming a mother because that requires my body and I also want to be a young mother; I do not want to miss that.
As far as the candidate is concerned, I'm not worried.
I will impart great happiness to my child and raise it with much love.
As far as film art is concerned, you keep in mind the works in which you participated and were shot last year.
That is exactly what it is, and I would like them to be presented to the public.
I, as a woman who comes from the theater, am very impatient and restless and want to have everything at once, which, of course, cannot be immediate.
I very much wish that `La última hora' and `En busca de la tumba de Cristo' will be performed for the first time.
Let's see how they like you.
A couple of days ago, you were on the run with Naomi Campbell, right?
It's okay. Don't say that.
It's not like I went on the runway to model.
Naomi Campbell, whom I have known for some time, has just called me and invited me to London to attend a parade for the charity of her organization 'Women for a Better World' and the clothes we show. I know that two items of clothing from our collection were auctioned for Mango to collect the money for Naomi's NGO.
The people don't know Naomi's good heart.
There's a lot of things being told about her, and I, as the one she knows, would tell you that she's not right.
Nevertheless, I will support this good thing in which it is involved.
She asked me to take part in the parade for this big-hearted thing, but if she comes and asks me to make a handstand, I will do the same.
To support women in the Third World, whatever is necessary.
The drivers, who can be receded due to the alcohol level, will have to install the `Alcolock'.
The authority orders that the driver, who had three official penalties for the alcohol level, install this system in his car, which forbids him to start the car in a drunken state. If he is alcoholic, then the car does not start.
The initiative was announced last month in June and is already part of the General Public Prosecutor's Office's report. According to their information, it is a pilot project that will last for a year.
The purpose is to re-socialise the driver, which is why he is given a course for the re-education of traffic behaviour.
The Ministry of Transport and the Foundation of the Technical Institute for the Safety of Automobiles will also participate in this, as experienced by the Attorney General.
According to statistics, between 30-75% of drivers who were shown more than once because of driving under the influence of alcohol were taxed again.
The `alcolock' would prevent this because it is a system connected to the car, it measures the alcohol content in the exhaled air and prevents the start of the car when the driver has tested alcohol; or if an alcohol concentration is detected which is higher than permitted.
It costs more than 1 000 euros, the costs are borne by the person who imposes the penalty.
In this context, a study carried out in the US in 2007 showed that these devices already prevent cars equipped in the first year after their introduction up to 65% of the violations of the rules.
In Spain, it is estimated that 115 lives could be saved every year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to tackle this behaviour before it becomes a criminal offence.
And in order to facilitate their implementation, a legal reform can be implemented in the ordinary way, and yet a reform of the basic law is required which is necessary for the law enforcement process.
The device is still available on the Spanish markets, in no business, although it has already been installed in some commercial vehicles and public transport vehicles.
Tomorrow, the House of Representatives will vote on the initiative of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party, which proposes to install this system in school buses, which has already been done in France.
In Mexico and without 'peep-toes'
With British punctuality, at 5:40 p.m., at the time scheduled by the program, next to the presidential hangar of Benito Juárez de México DF airport, the plane of the Spanish Air Force landed with the prince and princess of Asturias.
The sun went down, but their rays were still forced to use the hand as a parasol to see the royal couple who got out of the plane.
Directly on the Gangway: the Spanish Ambassador and other authorities
A few hours before I asked a taxi driver on the road if he knew that the prince and the princess of Asturias were visiting the city to formalize the official journey.
- Ah, very well, so you can't take people at the airport at this time. You're from here or something.
No, she's the Spaniard, but she lived here for a few years.
-Oh, very good.
But the Mexican press knows exactly who the prince and the princess of Asturias are and knows the importance of the journey.
There are many who are waiting in the hangar of the airport and on the red carpet, also military protection of 27 Marine soldiers who give off the honorary ointment.
The prince appears smiling, dressed in navy blue, and she, the princess, with long hair woven by the wind, without ordinary 'peep-toes', perhaps was told that a thunderstorm is expected in DF.
Before they enter the hall, they smile and are prepared for the photographers in whom the official sequel awaits.
At the door of the hotel where they are accommodated, one of the four largest in the city, a reporter from Mexican television is waiting for her, who likes to joke.
The best premium of fashion
There was probably no more suitable place in the world than Paris to present a premium of fashion and there was probably no significantly outstanding fashion designer and Bonvivants than Valentino.
Mango presents the second edition of the fashion competition `el Bóton-Mango Fashion Awards' for the promotion and international promotion of young fashion talents.
This is awarded with a monetary price of EUR 300 000.
Ayer Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, saw her drawings yesterday in the display window of the Mango Branch on Boulevard Haussmann number 54 in Paris and almost cried because of the emotional excitement.
By the way, this is the company's second largest business in Europe and was recently opened. It offers a sales area of 1,335 m2.
The largest store is in London.
So many events have happened that you want to thank the fashion designer Valentino for his jury president at the competition. Everything ended with a luxury dinner in Opera National de Paris.
In the vicinity of many famous people, the board, organized by Mango, seemed spectacular.
Nati, with the heavy heart that was broken by the pain because his brother died recently, broke up. He put on the suit from the fashion house and wore some jewelry from ELAH that were breathtaking. He held on to his son Luis’ arm, which is almost two meters tall and accompanied Valentino at dinner, in his honor.
Andik, the owner and master of Mango's house, greeted the guests and was such a cavalier, so that he ended up with the baron of Red Shield without jackets, because Jackets they lent to the ladies.
Mónica Cruz, hastened to the shop and had a trousers and a shirt that she herself modeled, and to dinner she wore a long, black sexy dress. At a night walk through the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us a hall for ballet rehearsals, so she got excited, remembered the old times, grabbed a rod and made a kind of 'grand plie'.
Inés Sastre, did not join the walk through the premises of the palace, but before that she had shown us the photos of her son on her cell phone.
The next morning we were able to look forward to the presence of Oliver Martínez, a personality that always evokes a stormy enthusiasm, and to Jon Travolta, who, after his arrival (with his own bed linens and towels) at Hotel Internacional in Paris, asked in advance to have a room without smell.
The stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh la la, that's life.
1001 Counsel against Stress
There is not 1000, but one more way to forget about chaotic everyday life.
And if there are few, all of them are collected in a book that says how to relax. The book comes into the bookshops on September 30.
The alarm clock is a punishment when it rings at 7 a.m., but even worse the idea of returning to the hectic rhythm that demands the current life appears.
The office is called the tension and the computer that leads to the back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there are not one and not two methods to combat daily exhaustion and the problems of switching off the world of work.
However, the number is increasing, no more and no less than 1001.
In addition to yoga opinions, the classical massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott presents in the book the entire list of options adapted to the taste and time of each individual.
The work against stress is called `1001 possibilities to relax' and so the tranquility which the book conveys comes into the bookshops of Pearson Alhambra and DK.
Who believes that it is impossible to achieve peace in areas such as workplaces with the help of personal contacts, this manual refutes such faith.
In addition, the methods are offered how to stay in contact with nature or the 100% natural recipes that lead to relaxation.
If the adrenaline in your veins no longer rises to restore the body's balance and the stress has become a problem, then the moment has come to sit down on the sofa, turn off the brain and focus on reading.
Talk in sleep
Some children talk at night
I do not mean those who wake up and tell us something that happened the day before, but the children who speak during sleep.
If it happens to you for the first time, in the best case you will be frightened, but in reality it doesn't matter.
This is a positive sleep disorder called talking in sleep.
It is quite widespread, especially among children and young people.
Certainly, more than one of you was told that you spoke at night.
This phenomenon can occur occasionally (once in life, for example, as during the high fever), or regularly (every day, once a week, once a month), the next day the child can remember nothing.
There is no single reason to cause this phenomenon.
Often, relationships with other phenomena are sought in sleep, such as nightmares, panic fear at night, enuresis noctura (bedding nostrils at night), talking in sleep, but there is no reason to do so.
As we have already mentioned, it can be due to very high fibre, stress or over-requirements.
In any case, this is a little bit of a researched phenomenon.
The frequency with which it occurs is very variable.
It can be that one speaks quietly in single words, whispers or it can be quite the opposite (screaming, crying, long discussions).
In cases where the expression is very intense, it is recommended to monitor the child and consult with a specialist to check whether there is a problem that causes fear and thus results in it.
We have said that it is a positive disorder, so it is not treated, whether it is associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, with the sleep apnoea or with stress).
What you can do is take a series of simple preventive measures:
Try not to excite the child before sleeping.
So, pick a quiet game for the child and avoid stressful TV programs that are terrible and a bit too wild.
For the nervous children to whom relaxation is recommended, relaxation methods can be used to help them get some inner peace.
It helps the child to sleep quietly.
If the speech occurs once in a sleep, try to keep the peace.
Remember, it's harmless for the child and the next day it won't be able to remember anything that happened.
Useful advice
Don't wake it up.
This is useless, because the child is unconscious, so you will rip it out of your sleep.
Although the child speaks, it sleeps, so it rests.
Remember, if it turns out to be frightened after a few apparitions, it is recommended to consult or find out what reason the child is afraid of.
If they understand what it says (which is not so common), the child does not put pressure on them to conduct a hearing and to obtain more information.
So you will not be able to achieve anything with it, because when the child sleeps, it is unconscious and cannot think about it.
Besides, you will hear what it says, but you will not know what it is dreaming and why it says so, therefore they are careful with the interpretation of the information and the conclusions it draws from it.
Maybe it doesn't tell the child that you hear that at night and know his secrets.
Not even a joke.
That's a lot of fear.
So, don't worry, it's nothing bad, it's a moment that only takes a few minutes.
Illhäuseren ... finally
After a long stretch of thirst, Illhäuseren is finally on the field again on a success course.
Without great effort, the yellow-blacks played numerous goals and managed to implement one of them, thus winning the game.
The pace of this encounter, in which the attackers struggled to show their ability, was not very high.
After a first attack by the guest captain Kauffmann, whose distance passed close to the corner, Illhäusern should easily dominate the game, and it succeeded alternately only fonderflick with a remote shot, then brain with a high pass, and Romain with a shot with the foot tip to challenge Denmark's defense.
The opposing team blocked in the middle of the field and only let through the lively Riahi at the top of the storm.
The beginning of the second half should be decisive with first two Torch Chances fought by Riahi and Temporal, and immediately after that with the first Gate for the Illhäuser by Marais, who stood exactly right to assume a ball that had been defended in a first attempt by Diebold.
However, the Illhusian goalkeeper should not be able to enjoy his luck for long and be sent to the bank about twelve minutes later, making his teammates have to play down the numbers.
Denmark, however, did not take advantage of this and did not encounter any major problems with an illhaust eleven who withdrew only a little to 'enhance their defense', except in the very last seconds of the game in which the ball passed very close to the latte after a big mess.
Sarkozy meets angry fishermen
Before he flies to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make another detour to Brittany.
In view of the determined attitude of fishermen who blocked access to several Breton and Norman ports on Monday, the French President decided to meet with their representatives at the port of Guilvinec on Tuesday morning in Finistère.
The latter promised to receive him 'with a constructive spirit' and hope that he will come with 'concrete proposals'.
The President's visit is at the same time as a General Assembly of the Crisis Committee, founded by the Breton fishermen, to enforce measures in view of the extreme increase in the diesel price, which has reached a record value of an average of over 1.14 euros per litre.
According to the press spokesperson of the Elysée Palace David Martinon, the President will discuss with them possible solutions to help their businesses regain their competitiveness and to ensure the working conditions and pay of seafarers.
Sarkozy is expected by the fishermen with determination.
On Tuesday morning they led the protest marches of Morbihan and Calvado, which caused congestion of almost ten kilometres in length.
The sailing port of Quiberon was also blocked, but the connections to Belle-île did not break.
The Quiberon peninsula was demarcated with a barrier.
Already on Monday the sailors expressed their determination by burning tires and pallets from the early morning in front of the fuel depots of the ports of Brest and Lorient, while in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc demonstrations were held.
The movement extended to other ports of the Atlantic coast and the Channel, such as Sables d`Olonnes, in Vendée, where the fish cutters did not go out, or Le Havre, where about twenty boats blocked the manoeuvres of the merchant ships.
The fishermen of Turballe and Croisic in Loire-Atlantique dissolved the blockade of the important total-refinery in Donges in the evening.
The Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait for the Wednesday meeting at the Ministry before deciding on possible measures.
In fact, the crisis committee in Guilvinec must decide on the reactions to the movement and on its participation in the discussion planned in the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by those responsible for the national fisheries committee who have not supported their movement.
'The strike will continue' because 'the fishermen will not yield' and 'will not go to Paris', for example Liliane Cariou, President of the Lorient Fisheries Committee, announced.
The professional fishermen who do not pay taxes on diesel currently cost the liter about 50 cents, but they believe that the profitability limit of a boat can only be reached with diesel for less than 30 cents per litre.
Paul Newman the Wonderful
The unforgettable actor from `Butch Cassidy and the Kid' died at the age of 83 from the consequences of cancer in his house in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and also Sam Mendes were part of the film and actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer keeps its delivery forecasts for 2008
The Brazilian aircraft manufacturer expects 215 aircraft delivered this year, despite the imminent recession, to be a threat to the world economy.
Embraer, the world's fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer, met its delivery forecasts for 2008 with 215 aircraft delivered, confirmed his president Fredrico Fleury Curacao.
In the first half of the year, the aircraft manufacturer supplied 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer hopes a lot from the Chinese market, especially for its aircraft of the size of 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 machines to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would consider giving up more than 15% of its assets
According to the Financial Times Sunday issue, the Insurer American International Group, which was financially supported by the U.S. Monetary Authority, is considering giving up more than 15% of its assets in order to pay back the 85 billion dollars it has been charged.
AIG is ready to sell a large part of its business, beyond its life insurance at international level and its retirement benefits in the United States.
According to the FT, the Board of Directors of the AIG met on Sunday evening to check possible sales.
The AIG could not be confirmed.
Among the assets that AIG might separate from are its aircraft leasing branch International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% share of the reinsurers Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its real estate assets and investments in private equity, the FT further explains.
As regards these sales, no final decision has been taken, the FT continues.
AIG must make sales as soon as possible in order to repay the loans over 85 billion that it has granted to the Federal Reserve, also at the risk that the American authorities will receive 80% of their capital and the current shareholders will be lost to the same extent.
Analysis Historical Paris of the meeting Historical morning meeting
The New York Stock Exchange reported on Monday, after the representative board had rejected Paulson's plan to rescue the banks, a historical case of the prices: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, an unprecedented loss of nearly 800 points, and the Night Day 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) dropped by 777,68 points to 10,365,45 points.
As regards the points, the strongest case of his history (684.81 points) had previously been recorded on 17 September 2001, the day of the trade decline following the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
According to the final payoffs, the Nasdag index, mainly technology related, decreased by 199.61 points to 1,983.73, and the widely used Standard&Poors 500 index by 8.81% (106.85 points) to 1,106.55 points.
Following the unexpected rejection of the plan to rescue the banks by the Chamber of Deputies, which was to allow some stability in the markets, Wall Street collapsed, which had already been set off at the beginning of the quarter.
With 228 votes against and 205 against, the honourable Members refused the funds he had asked for to the finance secretary Henry Paulson.
Nearly two out of three Republicans rejected his plan.
`Here, a bad picture is being circulated that represents Congress as unable to accept a plan', said Lindsey Piegza from FTN Financial.
`This shows how much the market counted on this plan', she added, and fears that a project 'too late' will be adopted in several days.
`If the project is actually doomed to failure (...), it will soon be the task of the Fed (the American Central Bank, Note d. Red.) and other central banks to deal with the crisis, which would limit the credit conditions even more', warned Brian Bethune, Economic Manager at Global Insight.
And Miss Piegza stressed, highlighting the feeling of extreme urgency even more, that every day that passes away brings the ruin of a financial company in the United States 'with itself'.
After the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual on Friday, the American authorities planned to purchase the bank operations of Wachovia from its competitors Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis suddenly accelerated and led to emergency measures in favour of banks in the United Kingdom, in the Benelux countries, Iceland and Germany, indicating that the markets are facing not just an American but a global crisis, added the analyst of the FTN Financial.
The market for basic consumer goods has grown strongly.
Revenues from the Treasury within ten years have fallen from 3.632% to 3.827% on Friday evening, and revenues within 30 years last night from 4.161% to 4.357%.
Obama, winner by points in the first television duel
The first debate of the two candidates for the White House of Friday was followed by another one to find out who emerged as the winner, John McCain or Barack Obama.
As expected, the QGs announced their own victory in this television duel for the election of both the Republicans and the Democrats, to be persecuted by one third of the American families.
Political analyst David Gergen estimates that John McCain's performance, although quite considerable, was not brilliant enough to allow him to stop his decline in polls five weeks before the presidential elections.
The Gallup Institute, which published an opinion poll on Saturday, according to Obama with five points in front (49% to 44% for McCain), believes that the democracy is clearly making the better figure.
For the still undecided voters, that is, those to whom it now applies, Obama emerged with 39% as the winner of the polls, while according to a CBS survey, McCain sees 25% of them as the winner.
Obama should be able to confirm his lead on Thursday with the good performance expected by his competitor Joseph Biden during the first and only public debate with his rival Sarah Palin
It would be a mistake to underestimate them.
She has good instincts', but warned Bill Clinton this weekend.
Seventy-year-old McCain did not stop putting his indisputable experience in the field of foreign policy at the forefront, and clearly stressing his opponent's 'neighbourhood' on these issues, which were the focus of this first television episode.
'Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that...', he emphasized several times.
`I do not believe Senator Obama has the necessary experience and knowledge to become president', he also assured.
An attack point that has been preached in the Republican election campaign since yesterday.
Obama himself stressed that he represents the future.
He expressed himself briefly and precisely without being taken out of the version.
He put his ability in the foreground to make good decisions and to renew the image the world has of the United States.
`McCain has still not understood, Obama has already', this weekend opposed a democratic election campaign in which Republicans were accused of not having recorded the full extent of the crisis on the 'American road'.
`During the 90 minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot of things to say about me, but nothing about you', Obama denounced 20,000 people yesterday who had gathered in flowing rain on the occasion of an election in North Carolina.
He did not even mention the words 'medium-sized' or 'workers'. 'The financial crisis gives Obama, whom the Americans consider most appropriate, even to save the economy at the edge of the abyss, a clear advantage.
'The next week could be a decisive turning point', estimated yesterday by the influential democratic senator Charles Schumer.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton government, compared the 'good economic instincts' of Obama with those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the democratic candidate, the current crisis is 'the final judgment of an eight-year bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain'.
After once again stressing that he would probably even manage to reduce taxes for 95% of Americans despite the fluctuations on Wall Street, the Senator of Illinois pointed out that the creation of a potential energy independence of the country and the promotion of renewable energies, together with the introduction of a health insurance system, were his top priority.
McCain, on the other hand, wanted to build a plant from 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
The two candidates considerately deviate from the issues raised in the plan to save the financial market over 700 billion dollars (470 billion euros), which was adopted by Congress last night and is extremely unpopular with the people.
`Have you noticed that there was a choice in Minsk?'
Youths and oppositionists demonstrated Sunday evening on the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject the results of the parliamentary elections in advance.
A few hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday evening since the closing of the polling stations in the market square of Minsk to protest against the fraudulent character of the parliamentary elections.
Although no results had yet been announced, many young people had come to demonstrate against Alexander Lukachenko's power: 'The dictator should resign'.
Some admit that they didn't choose at all: 'What good is it if they do with my voice what they want,' says a youth.
They do not believe that the regime, which has shown itself in the best light to foreign observers to resume negotiations with the European Union, is ready to make a democratic turn.
The sanctions, including the non-participation of visas for 40 leading Belarusian personalities and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections were considered clean by the observers.
According to the opposition, they were not.
'We were excluded from the electoral commissions and our observers were not allowed to participate in the census', lamented Juri Potemkin, press spokesman of the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous association of twelve parties.
This is a cosmetic change, emphasizes Alexander Milinkiewitsch, former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the Pro-Europe movement, because it is important who counts the votes, and with us that is the executive.
If Members of the opposition move into Parliament, then because they have been appointed, and not elected.
But their entry into Parliament can mean broadcasting time on television, meetings in the regions and legislative proposals.
The opposition is therefore responsible for interfering in the political game, because the dialogue with the European Union must be opened.
Because if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, gets into a crisis and we do not reform, we are in danger of becoming a protectorate of Russia.
Well, we want to be independent.
The opposition fears that the organisation for security and cooperation in Europe, which has followed the electoral process, does not recognise the election as valid.
It emphasises that the electoral turnout figures appear too high and that the extension of the vote cast in advance (26% of the voters of Minsk) has paved the way for any kind of manipulation.
`Have you noticed that an election has taken place?' asks the leader of the Social Democrats Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners who were released in August of this year.
No one was in the polls.
And there will be a maximum of five members of the opposition in Parliament, those who are most likely to conform to the ideas of the government.
The silence of the night decreases again over the October square.
On television, President Lukachenko and the members of the Central Election Commission congratulate themselves on their success.
Discussion - From the blood that has become safe again
Hema-Quebec celebrated the 10th anniversary of her founding yesterday, and her president, Dr. Francine Décary, had every reason to rejoice, because Hema-Quebec has become one of the safest and most efficient blood banks in the world.
And above all, it has regained public confidence, which was severely shaken by the scandal of contaminated blood in the 1980s and 1990s.
As you know, during the 1980s, the national blood reserves managed by the blood donation service of the Canadian Red Cross were contaminated with HI virus and hepatitis C virus.
In view of this drama and public dissatisfaction, in February 1994, the Government of Canada launched a public investigation led by Judge Horace Krever aimed at bringing light to the circumstances which had led to such a tragedy and to developing guidelines to prevent a further disaster of this kind.
While Judge Krever was still hesitant to report, several provinces then set up a committee to develop a new system of blood canning in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee fulfilled this mission.
According to the reports of Gélineau and Krever, two blood banks were established in Canada: Hema-Quebec, who is responsible for Quebec, and the Canadian blood company to supply the other provinces and the two territories.
`1998, when Hema-Quebec started her work, barely 38% of people had confidence in the blood-preserved system in Quebec, remembers Dr. Décary.
The situation was discouraging.
Through the enormous efforts to improve the safety of blood canning and through the work in this area during the following years, we have regained public confidence', she says, before they proudly emphasize that by the beginning of 2008 almost 94% of the population of Quebec had confidence in Hema-Quebec.
Dr. Décary, however, keeps in mind that 'trust is something extremely fragile'.
Since its establishment on 28 September 1998, Hema-Quebec has acted on the principle of caution.
At that time, we experienced the occurrence of numerous cases of the human form of cattle madness in Europe, a new type of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, tells this woman, who has been in charge since its founding in 1998.
`And we had no idea whether this disease could be transmitted over the blood.
So we referred to one of the main guidelines of the reports by Krever and Gélineau, which states that exclusion measures are applied if one does not know this and if a disease progresses only slowly, as it is obviously the case with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is expressed by a degeneration of the brain, which inevitably leads to death.
Thus, in April 1999, no blood was taken from persons who had been in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980.
Well, a few years ago, there was no doubt that this disease was being transmitted over the blood.
So this event has shown us that the principle of caution that we used has quite a meaning.
In 1999 a much more accurate HIV detection technique appeared on the market: the Nucleic Acid Tests (NST) which allow the donor to detect the presence of the virus itself directly in the blood, and not that of the antibodies against the virus, as was the case with the tests used so far.
The NST made it possible to shorten the incubation period between the time the person was infected and when the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, the specialist explains.
This time could be reduced to less than a week.
Thus, the risk that certain donors could be infected without knowing it, and one could not see it, was greatly reduced.
These improvements made it possible to significantly reduce the risk of transmitting AIDS via a blood transfusion.
Today, one in 12 million people is at risk of getting HIV-infected blood.
In other words, 12 million canned blood would have to be distributed before someone was infected with HIV.
Since Hema-Quebec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood canned every year, it would take more than 24 years before a case of HIV being transfused via a blood canned.
I believe that today you can feel well when you get or write a blood transfusion to restore your health,' says the director of Hema-Quebec.
`Our challenge for the next ten years is to maintain the safety of our products.
You never know which pathogen can enter the system.
Only last year did the Chikungunya virus appear on the island of Réunion, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted by insects over the blood.
We need to monitor continuously', Dr. Décary continues before she emphasizes that Hema-Quebec must also provide sufficient supply in addition to a secure supply.
'The need is increasing because the population is ageing.
Since anticancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often need new red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also affects the blood supply network, which on average accounts for only 3% of Quebec's eligible residents.
In doing so, any healthy person who is 18 years of age or older and who meets the eligibility criteria can donate blood every 56 days, i.e. six times a year.
On average, 14% of those who make their blood available are not accepted because they have, for example, AIDS or malaria, and those who have travelled to a country where malaria is spread are excluded from blood donation for a year.
With this 3%, we are able to obtain an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
Lack of supplies are very rare.
But you have to renew the members of this donor network when they get older and donate no more blood.
It's hard to convince people to donate blood, but above all, to keep them and make them become regular donors.
Life today is so hectic that you rarely find the time to spend an hour on blood donation,' laments Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of 297 million dollars, Hema-Quebec provides not only blood preserves but also human tissues, including bone transplants, heart valves, eyeballs and skin, which are used almost exclusively in case of severe burns.
These tissues are examined, processed and frozen before being stored at Hema-Quebec, which also manages the only public umbilical cord bank in Quebec.
In the umbilical cord, previously considered biomedical waste, there is a rich blood cell that can help treat severe diseases, such as leukemia.
`A few weeks ago we celebrated the storage of our thousandth umbilical cord blood sample, and we plan to decrease more than a thousand annually.
`We should probably start by making it available for transplants at the beginning of next year', Dr. Décary continues, who describes this program of umbilical cord loss as very popular.
'Many mothers are convinced not to have access to it', because Hema-Quebec lacks the means to offer this complex and costly program in all the hospitals in Quebec.
Soccer - Impact in semi-finals
Montreal's impact yesterday, thanks to a 3 to 1 win (4 to 3 with all goals) against the sounders from Seattle at the second and deciding to play the quarter-final series in the Saputo Stadium, where the overall door ratio counted, qualified for the semi-finals of the U.S.L.'s first league.
The midfielder Antonio Ribeiro shot the decisive goal in the 90th minute of the game.
After a first half without a goal for both the one and for the other side, the midfielders David Testo and Rocco Plancentino landed the other hits for the formation of Montreal.
Roger Levesque was the only one who stood in the way of Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
Remember that during the first game of the pre- and replay series on Friday impact, Starfire Complex in Tukwila had a 2 to 1-off position in a suburb of Seattle.
In the semifinals impact will be measured with the whitecaps from Vancouver.
On Saturday evening, Thunder was able to compensate for a 3 to 1 deficit in Minnesota with a 4 to 3 win, but the Whitecaps still moved into the semi-final with a total gate ratio of 5 to 4.
Impact will probably have to face the whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the game series will be set today.
In short - Victory by Kovalev
The number 1-trio of the Canadian team is ready to start the season.
Last night, the unit formed by Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrej Kostitsyn drove forward the attack on the Florida Panther with a storm fire, leading to a 3 to 2 victory.
Kostitsyn, the star of the encounter, shot a gate, Plekanec delivered two templates, and Kovalev turned a pass in this victory game, the fourth of the tricolors into six preliminary games.
Kovalev won the victory by shooting the only gate of the whole shooting.
`I'm not ready yet, warned the Russian.
I need another game to feel comfortable.'
`He's got too much fix on it in the first half of the year,' said Guy Carbonnau.
But I think he liked the end of the game.
He received stormy applause.'
Charest sets on the north
The Prime Minister does not rule out the opening of elections before the end of the year.
As soon as the General Assembly of the Liberal Party was over, Jean Charest went to Jean-Talon in Quebec yesterday, where the new Minister of Health Yves Bolduc (Left) tries to be elected in today's partial election.
'Move the course of our last great border to the north': This is the long-term goal presented by Jean Charest yesterday with visual means at the General Assembly of the liberal party of Quebec in Levi, following the guidelines.
During his lecture, a kind of picture mill was projected behind him.
On three huge screens, spectacular images of hydroelectric plants, mines, Quebec in 'Google Maps', maps, etc. were turned.
Great resources as during the electoral term.
In contrast to the press, the Prime Minister refused to rule out the fact that he will hold the elections this fall, even if he was told that his appointment calendar was very full.
The 'Plan Nord' is the fourth element of a 'vision' which the Prime Minister allegedly has for Quebec, namely a 'new economic area' which provides for an agreement with France on workers, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario.
Although it has been frequently mentioned in the Prime Minister's speeches recently, the opening of the north - the northern area at 49th latitude - had never been the subject of a presentation.
The Prime Minister, however, limited himself to explaining why the North was 'a jewel with enormous potential', but did not mention a date, no investment sums or precise priorities for the coming projects.
At most some prospects for what could be done more: especially in the water energy sector, in the forest, but especially in the mining sector, favoured by the growth of emerging economies and the renewal of public infrastructure.
According to Mr Charest's list, the north has 'nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium and even diamonds'.
This `area twice as large as France 'is near us, is in Quebec.
It is not only in our vicinity, it is in us', he stressed, as to show clearly that he is seeking to realize a national founding dream.
Quebec has grown very much through its connection with the north, he emphasized: the road to gold in Abitibi, the technique of Quebec, the James Bay.
`It belongs to us, it is our future', he added, after he had taken a theatrical break to look at the huge map behind him.
The North, 70% of Quebec's territory, includes a part of Labrador, which Quebec has always demanded, said to the prime minister of the press.
`This is a traditional attitude that followed all governments.
There is a borderline on which there has been no agreement for a very long time, if the opportunity arises, I will take this position again on behalf of the government,' he said.
In addition, 'with climate change, we need to rethink our vision from the north', he explained and spoke about the Northwest Passage, which will be traversable all year round due to the ice melt.
Against this new geopolitical background, the Prime Minister believes that it is almost a duty to occupy this area.
And the inhabitants of the land, the natives, and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Quebec government would deal with them very carefully and that they would benefit from this project, especially the boys.
Two former ministers from various parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former Pecist Member of Ungava), have already started discussions with some thirty communities.
A Ministerial Committee led by Benoît Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (transport and land treasures) takes an important place, has taken up the work.
The Prime Minister does not exclude a large assembly, 'not necessarily a summit', but an opportunity for 'a common vision'.
The development of the North will also be in line with the principles of sustainable development.
The plan of the north will be discussed, regulated and environmentally friendly, he promised.
Jean Charest described this 'Vision' as a continuation of the liberal prime minister who was in front of him.
Like the liberals who were in front of us, we have thought about transforming the challenges into new growth and development opportunities.
By the way, this was one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which was opened on Friday with a big cocktail party for the celebration of the 50th anniversary of the takeover of party leadership by Jean Lesage.
One of the adopted decisions provides for renaming the power plant of Beauharnois in Adélard-Godbout dam.
`From Godbout, who created Hydro-Quebec, about Lesage, who has achieved the silent revolution and the nationalization of water electricity, to Bourassa, who made the James Book, our party always knew to determine the future', said Jean Charest.
With regard to the press, he referred to another, this time conservative project, namely the `Roads to the North' programme by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
With regard to the hydropower dam project Eastmain1a-Ruper, Mr Charest stressed that its commissioning was scheduled for 2012.
`This remains among us, but I intend to be there', he entrusted his party members with what caused those applause storms.
The Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008, and certainly also in 2009, has not yet ruled out the possibility of holding a election this fall, which is possible to him under the law.
He stressed, however, that his appointment calendar was full, especially because of a mission by the Council of the European Union in China and a summit between Quebec and New York.
The Weekend General Assembly provided the Liberal Party leader with a platform of nationalist plans, in particular of 'the constitutional objectives', which were accepted without further delay: the PLQ calls in particular for the recognition of Quebec's 'speciality' in the Constitution.
It also wants Quebec to appoint members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council and to have a veto regarding the decisions taken in Quebec.
On the side of the opposition, the guidelines of the North Plan were taken up with scepticism.
The head of the Québécois Party, Pauline Marois, has relaunched the policy of developing the North-Du-Quebec, which the Landry government introduced in 2001.
According to her, when she came to power in 2003, the liberal government refrained from applying it.
If she had done so, we would be much further today', Ms. Marois judged alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon (where the election takes place today) Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ has advocated supporting the adoption by the government of a plan north.
`But what we want is that this will not only be a big idea', said the party leader Sébastien Proulx in representation for Mario Dumont, who is coming back from the holiday today.
Letters - An Injured Country
Mr. Vic Toews, ex-'Justiz' minister (which irony) in the cabinet of Harper it was who allowed himself last summer to say about Louise Arbour that she was a 'disgrace' for Canada.
This woman, who has waged a never-ending struggle for justice and deserves all our admiration for covering up with shame, says as much about the people around the Prime Minister as about Stephen Parker himself.
We are dealing here with a government which, as the only country in all the affected countries, has not brought home its fellow countryman trapped in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
A government that does not even take into account that Omar Khadr was still a youth when the things happened that are being blamed on him.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, breaks its word and causes a child soldier to go away under inhuman conditions.
The only one who goes down to a court-martial to assess the defendant's guilt.
Let us remember that UNICEF, Amnesty International, and the Canadian lawyers' association, in particular, are pleading to bring Omar Khadr home to get a fair trial in Canada.
This very government also closes its eyes to the torture: it is little to her that after so many years of suffering, a young adult will certainly be mentally broken forever.
We are not aware of this yet, but we are experiencing here a strange circumcision of our rights, our freedom and our 'democracy', this word that Harper constantly carries like a flag in front of him, and that sounds so unspeakable from his mouth.
So the time has come when there is no more morality: one can arbitrarily abuse, torture and imprison a Canadian citizen, according to the thinking of a head of government who is still supported only by the minority (may he be a minority after 14 October...).
Many voters believe to find their salvation in a party that preaches virtue, law and order. But they do not see that this government has renounced what constituted the reputation and dignity of our country.
The shame, Mr. Toews, lies in this demise, and nowhere else.
Free Opinion - The Orwellic Speech of Barrick Gold
In its September 17 issue, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr Patrick J. Garver, Vice General Director of the Canadian Gold Mine Barrick Gold.
This confirms, and follows an orwell logic, that the world's largest gold mining company sought a slanderous lawsuit of over six million against three authors and a small middleless publishing house, with the aim of opening a 'public transparent debate'.
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, then they judge not the truth, especially not in the case of slanderous charges, but the law.
As expected, this fundamental difference was completely hidden by Mr Garver.
For Barrick Gold is the best way to conduct a public debate, driving everyone into the ruin that dares to represent one of their opposite opinions.
No matter how the trial goes, the authors and editors of the book Noir Canada will have to spend considerable sums to prepare their defense and fight with very unequal weapons against an army of lawyers who are paid out of the almost inexhaustible pockets of the gold mine.
Moreover, the tactics of these unequal struggles are often to destroy the defenders in order to force a unanimous settlement that makes the opposite side dead and also deters anyone who dares to re-examine the question.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, she would have had to present her view of things before public opinion.
Contrary to what is going on in many of the countries where Barrick Gold works, debates are usually held in Canada through the exchange of ideas and not through a bump.
So it would have been enough if the gold mine had disclosed their books and files and opened a real debate through the newspapers, media, publications and funding of independent audit teams that could have brought light to this issue.
But Barrick Gold seems to have no confidence in public opinion and erases the petitions and letters to support the authors of Noir Canada with a hand movement aside.
Could Mr Garver perhaps explain how he can at the same time ask for a 'public' debate and ignore the opinions of this public?
It seems that this word in the Vice-President's world only covers the generously paid lawyers, and not the community of all Canadians; a rather narrow view of the term.
In a democracy, slanderers themselves have the right to speak.
What Barrick Gold does not understand - or does not want to understand - is that the public that supports the authors and editors of Noir Canada is doing this mainly because it rejects the brutal attitude of the gold mine.
This public is willing to listen to and judge Barrick, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, and not in a framework that many perceive as a gag complaint (in the course of the 'public debate', Barrick Gold has just addressed a demand to the authors of Noir Canada, in which she demands them to stop using this term...).
Apart from Mr Garver's surreal speech, Barrick Gold's complaint is a direct attack on the freedom of academic research and the truth finding that is fundamental to any democratic society.
It completely denies the right to quote credible sources and to discuss facts and interpretations that form the basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible in a country like Canada to explore and discuss issues that do not please the rich companies of this world, who else can do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, she could lead it by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
She has a right to answer.
The university environment to which we belong has long known how to deal with debates and disagreements and how to resolve conflicts.
The disproportionate complaint of Barrick Gold clearly shows that, contrary to what she claims, she has no desire for a transparent debate.
This is a loss for the university world, as well as for the public debate, and it is time for governments to take measures to limit this kind of unjustified complaint.
Rescue for the Wall Street - Democrats and Republicans understand themselves
The Bush administration and the leading congressmen, Republicans and Democrats alike finally came to an agreement yesterday on the most comprehensive economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the plan, over $700 billion, to stop the financial crisis that has been shaking Wall Street for months, still needs to be adopted by the two congressional chambers.
The main elements are: a better control of the practical application of the plan, new mechanisms to secure the repayment of the public funds used, new arrangements to curb the number of houses seized due to arrears of payments, and the right to monitor the salaries paid to the executives of the supported companies.
American Finance Secretary Henry Paulson, President of the Nancy Pelosi Chamber of Deputies, and the representative of the Republicans present at the negotiations, Senator Judd Gregg, announced yesterday, a few minutes after midnight, the good news, after a two-day negotiating marathon.
'We have made great progress towards an agreement that will be market-effective', said the representative of the Bush administration, Henry Paulson.
`Everything happened to protect the real economy and the American people from the course crisis on Wall Street', said the Democrat.
`This is the fundamental point: if we do not do so, the trauma, chaos and unrest in the daily lives of the Americans will be enormous', said Republican Judd Gregg.
The negotiations had accelerated during the last two hours, for fear of the effect that a further failure would have had on the investors' mood.
The deadline agreed was market opening this morning.
The two US presidential candidates, who only took part in the negotiations late, proved to be more in favour of the agreement, but without failing to express their dissatisfaction at the fact that they had to be met in this extreme way.
The Democratic Senator Barrack Obama insisted on the addition of certain provisions to the agreement, in particular those aimed at enabling owners to maintain their homes, and those relating to the salaries of senior employees of the companies rescued by the State.
'If taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsible nature of certain persons, this is nothing to be congratulated on.
But these measures are necessary', he said on American television stations.
When he was asked on another station whether he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent John McCain replied: `I would like to know the details first, but I hope so.
`The principles I have read [show] that this is one thing we all will have to digest, and with which we will be able to advance.
The option to do nothing is simply not acceptable', he said.
The 700 billion dollar plan is aimed at making taxpayers' money
It comes 14 months after a crisis triggered by the placement of a real estate bubble, which first led to the collapse of risky mortgage loans (subprime) before expanding on further forms of widespread bonds (PCAA), and finally to the freezing of financial power and the ruin of banks and financial institutions.
A group of Republican MPs failed the first attempt at agreement last week.
Since the Democrats have accepted that certain 'poisonous' assets of societies should only be secured by the government in distress and should not be bought, the dead end is believed to escape.
In order to round off the perspective for all in Congress, one has also added an order that, if the government were to make losses with this program within five years, they could then collect new taxes in order to retain its capital employed.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first sum of 250 billion, to which another 100 billion can be added if the President considers it necessary.
The payment of another 350 billion must be approved by Congress in a new vote.
In return for his help, Washington receives shares in the supported companies that bring him dividends in the case of winnings and that can resell it when the storm is over.
The Federal Government will have the possibility of suspending the mortgage settlement procedures with regard to the dwellings linked to the real estate loans affected by this plan, as well as setting deadlines for the repayment and settlements paid to the management staff of the companies concerned.
The developers of the plan would like the Chamber of Deputies to vote on him today, and then the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all their efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will be given green light.
In fact, there were further votes against this project yesterday, both by the Republicans and by the Democrats.
'Surely Washington doesn't understand us', said Republican Scott Garett, a member of the Chamber's Financial Commission, to his constituents.
Yes, we have a big financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not those who are asking taxpayers to check out'.
Democratic MEP Brad Sherman, head of a group in Congress called 'the Caucasian of Skeptics', presents things differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
'Four hundred excellent business professors, including three Nobel Laureates, have written us to inform us: we are asking Congress not to be put under pressure, and to think carefully about which way to go', he said yesterday.
At the same time, we in Europe were once again given proof that this is a global crisis.
At an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalisation of the Fortis banking group for EUR 11.2 billion (US$ 16.3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it would refrain from buying its competitor, who has been in great difficulty since she lost EUR 2 billion (US$2.9 billion) in the crisis due to risky property loans in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of the twenty largest European banks and the ten largest insurers.
'This is not lost money, said Dutch finance minister Wouter Bos yesterday.
To compensate, we receive an electoral right and influence in the bank.
This is exactly what savers and households appreciate, now that uncertain times are announcing themselves.
During this time, on the other side of the Channel, the British government was about to state another bank in distress from the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over all current loans at the Bank Bradford and Bringley, of which more than 41 billion (75.5 billion US dollars) from real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it would buy up the branches and customer accounts of the British bank.
Bradford and Bringley, after Northern Rock, would be the second bank that the British government has had to state since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (19252008) - Death of a dedicated icon
His beauty with the azure eyes was for a long time his trump, no one would say his weakness.
Did the American actor get rid of the narcissistic mirror with the charming smile?
Yes and no.
His fineness, sensitivity, and an obvious talent have kept him away from a position of power that brings the truly terrible monsters to the world.
But what a long-standing runner!
Paul Newman, who died on Friday at the age of 83 from lung cancer on his ranch in Connecticut, remains one of the last icons of the American cinema of his golden years.
He was less monumental than Brando, whom he resembled and for whom he was for a long time a kind of rival on the screen, more carefully in his play, certainly also more fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and the explosion of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often produces wonderful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925 as the son of a German Jew and a Hungarian mother.
From its European roots should arise one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
Without excessive ego, extreme quality feature.
Because in him, a whole country that was in love with the Self-made-man was reflected in the fighter who was injured in the Pacific War, who studied acting in Yale in the early 1950s and then attended the Actor's Studio in New York before he had success at the theater, on television and soon also in cinema.
This same man, who fought for civil rights, was also the driver who became second in 1979 at the 24-hour race of Mans, and also a sex symbol, although he lived in a first-hand relationship with actress Joanne Woodward since 1958.
With it, the unknown facets of this mysterious, restraining, committed and hypersensitive star to the glamour of the show business disappear, whose puzzles will never be completely solved.
A decent man, in the purest sense of the word.
The death of Paul Newman moved the cinema lovers this weekend into twilight, while on the dark screen of memories all its great roles were played.
More than half a century of American film art in constant change passes with him.
Then again, the charming cowboy from "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" (1969) comes to mind, and the young man who returns his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) to Die Katze on the hot metal roof filmed by Tennessee Williams in 1958.
There is a much shorter memory (1990) that wakes up to his sensitive Mr. Bridge, who at his old age is disturbed by a wedding that did not fulfill all of her promises.
There were so many other Paul Newmans in the course of history.
This criminal, stormy, violent and unforgettable boxer Rocky Graziano from Someone Up There Likes Me (A Handful of Dirt) by Robert Wise, a role intended for James Dean, was resumed after his death and made the Newman famous in 1956.
This sympathetic ganove in the outstanding The Sting (Der Clou), which was awarded the Oskar for the best film in 1973.
As bitter and vengeful billiard player in the wonderful The Hustler by Robert Rossen (1961),
This face through the ages, that was him.
Still him.
In his resume, epochs unite.
The youth knows him mainly from the cult film Slap Shot by George Roy Hill (1977), as Reggie Dunlop, the little orthodox coach of an ice hockey team.
His fans found him again in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of the Brothers Coen.
With a final role in 2003 as a patron of the Irish Mafia in Road to Perdition of Sam Mendes, the circle closed.
Unlike several film legends who retired early enough from the film world, Newman was supposed to stay in the saddle for a long time, with Hollywood, his fortune, his glory and his concessions being betrayed.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier saw him, not without humor, as a living challenge to the 'underplaying' when he judged his far too expressive achievements.
The Metier was not always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman, to whom the roles only fly for a long time.
However, he played rarer Sunnyboys as an outsider: neurotics, alcoholics, fieslings or desperate ones, with whose perfect representation he slid off and reflected his leaning.
As a director, Newman revealed unknown aspects of his true subtle sensitivity.
His Rachel, Rachel of 1968 (after the novel by Canadian Margaret Laurence) with his wife Joanne Woodward in the lead, drew a subtle female portrait full of melancholy.
He, who lost his son Scott through an overdose, dedicated his 1984 film Harry and Son, a work full of delicateness and sadness.
In the flood of honours that arose yesterday about Newman, his close friend and former partner Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) declared: 'His present has improved my life and this country.'
Generosity and joy of life were essential characteristics of the deceased actor.
Apart from his legendary career, a major defender of civil rights, environmental protection and independent cinema, an opponent of Hollywood's abduction, is now going to go.
We have often seen him standing in bowls full of vinaigrette, in sauces, pastries or other foods, and this is thought to be quite tasteless, although we found it fun at first.
The profits from his sales nevertheless flowed into his foundation for children in need.
Instead of resting on his myth, Newman committed himself to the shooting.
He left his five daughters a letter with these sentences: `Always and until the end your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was an honor to be here.'
And for us it was an honor to pursue the life of such an intelligent and generous American actor.
An exemplary citizen, in the narrowest and widest sense.
What was produced in the invoice factory of Zuschlag & Co.?
On 8 October the negotiations in the criminal proceedings against Jáno's award and his accomplices begin.
In particular, the accused is accused of participation in organised crime, gross negligence and commercial fraud, and other criminal acts, including forgery of documents.
According to the Public Prosecutor's Office, the funds drawn from the invitations to tender were used for their own purposes, while the services provided were often charged with counterfeit invoices.
State funds and subsidies from self-government - a total of HUF 65 million - are intended to be partly transferred to the funds of the Fiatal Balloldal organization, partly to the private funds of individuals.
As the investigation authorities announced, fictitious invoices were presented when the tender funds were taken into account, and the associations should not have complied with their obligations either.
According to the charges, a large part of the invoices were falsified.
The billing blocks were bought on the market of Józsefváros, the round seal was made in Kiskunhalas.
The decision on which companies to issue the invoices was taken on the round trip north of Lake Platten, to which István Lados was sent by János.
In the course of this "exploration tour" Lados should find out about the guest houses and restaurants.
He asked for invoices on the consumption to be able to issue later invoices based on these proposals to the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, as well as to the self-administration of Budapest.
These bills should have been manipulated by the majority of István Lados and his accomplice, András ‰ri, the latter being responsible for the constitution of the relevant reports according to our information.
One of the goals of Lados' exploration tour was a beer room.
As can be seen from two invoices issued by supplement and Co in 2003, the gastronomy company is said to have hosted the 90-member group of the association Biztos Pont Egyesület.
But now the manager of the company says that such a large group would not have fit into the local at once.
Another invoice, issued in summer 2002 at the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, later known as Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért, also showed serious errors in form and content.
In a guest house in Badacsonytomaj, which has only three rooms and can accommodate no more than ten people at the same time, 130 guests are reported to have stayed.
The imagination of the counterfeiters was apparently not limited either when it came to the Pigal Kft., a gastronomy business in which the records of the customers Jobb Jövőért and Hoppá do not appear at all, according to the Public Prosecutor's Office.
As Managing Director Győző Farkas of hvg.hu told him, it was immediately clear to him that it was a forged document when documents were presented to him by the Public Prosecutor during a survey.
"Our company name and tax number were wrong on the stamp."
And further on: Apart from form defects, the fact that the farm should have accommodated one hundred people after they have a total of eleven rooms that offer as many people as possible space.
It was also mentioned on the food bill that the restaurant was no longer in operation for a long time.
The eclectic counterfeiters have also failed to verify that the Budapest travel agency they visited offers travel abroad only, and so they have indicated Hungary's travel on the cash bill, which also contradicted the company's accounting practice.
As has been known in the course of the investigations, they have also cited VAT on the invoices, although travel agency services relating to a country outside the EU are VAT-free.
The total amount of VAT was wrong on four invoices issued by the Hotel Révfülöp Kft to the Stiftung Jobb Jövőért, since instead of 25 only 15 percent VAT is invoiced, and only machine invoices are issued by the employees, but the counterfeit documents were handwritten.
Another mistake that had been made by the "committee of accountants" was that in one case they had indicated "goods transport" as performance provided, although this is not offered by the company specialized in investment consulting, the Public Prosecutor's Office announced.
Further form errors - incorrect billing format, false stamp - were due to the fact that the invoices issued to Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, as well as to XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont could be revealed as forgery.
Likewise in the case of Ravenna Bt. and the sports camp Kunfehértó, whose managing directors claimed never to have issued the invoices.
Another "wrong" is the forgery of the HIB Kft. from Nyíregyháza: This society was in disintegration at the time (2001), when the group of the Fiatal Városért Egyesület was supposed to have eaten there - the mass administrator therefore indicated that the invoices did not have to be issued themselves.
Consciously faked
The other group of accountants are persons who were well aware that they would have to make fictitious invoices.
At the request of the Fiatal Balladal - Ifjú Szocialisták, the Foundation Esély Budapestért Alapítvány has issued invoices for the Foundation Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért, at an amount of approximately HUF 4 million.
According to the charges, the CEO of Collab Kft. was persuaded by one of the defendants, Ludovic Györfi, to issue the fictitious invoices.
The Biogate Kft, currently also in liquidation, is said to have cooperated with supplement and co.: In 2003, the GmbH is said to have provided the Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány Foundation, as well as the Atlasz Egyesület and Vörösfenyő Egyesület with counterfeit invoices in the total value of HUF 5 million, which relate to services not provided.
However, there was also little payment since the invoices were cancelled immediately after their exhibition, which the parties concerned have forgotten to mention in their documents.
The third group of auditors shall include persons directly associated with the accused.
One of them is Iván Cubatov, the postman of the Ukrainian managing director of Delta Trió Kft., a Budapest based fuel and vehicle trading company that cannot be found there.
This company is said to have issued several invoices for the sale of IT components in the total value of HUF around 18 million between October and December 2005.
According to the investigating authority, the cash investment Kft. from Kiskunhalas, which has been in liquidation since 14 September 2005, is said to have acted as the buyer of these invoices.
The manager of this company was a Romanian company, which was also to be supplied by Iván Kubatov between 2002 and 2005.
According to our information, during the investigations, Cubatov has issued invoices on behalf of the GmbH. to the Atlasz and Hoppá associations, as well as to Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány and to have collected their own equivalent.
The companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt. are said to have been founded by Romanian masons on Iván Cubatov's express wish.
In fact, however, none of these companies were active, which, according to the defendant, was due to a lack of orders.
Nevertheless, he was able to benefit from the companies: At the request of his accomplice, the lawyer Zsolt Szente, who was responsible for preparing the company's founding documents, he issued invoices on behalf of the companies to the associations involved in the award, such as Atlasz and Y-Generáció.
In total, Cubatov has issued 15 invoices worth HUF 14.2 million on behalf of the companies Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade to the organizations.
The Public Prosecutor's Office assumes that Cubatov could have collected 10% of the invoice sum as well as VAT.
Cubatov is said to have even abused the company Szi-Beri Bt. for issuing fictitious invoices - in this case the invoices were added to the applications of Biztos Pont.
The company Y-Generáció and Szövetség a Modern Magyarországért submitted their applications to the non-profit organisation of the Socialist Party in January 2006, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány ("TMA").
Both received 500,000 forints each, but benefited from these amounts in a different way.
To cover this up, they have submitted five fictional invoices to the TMA of the Works Team Kft.
Incidentally, these invoices were secured in the search of the office of Árpád Kemecsei in the Ministry of Education.
The negotiations are now expected by some defendants to make a confession about the way in which the invoice was falsified, as they were already filed before the Public Prosecutor's Office.
A sensation could be if the main defendant Jáno's award for a comprehensive confession decided.
Indeed, his previous information was less detailed, and although he had already promised several times to report comprehensively on everything, his confession is still pending.
The question remains, therefore, whether this is in his interest, whether the socialists have concluded a pact with him on the reparation of the bulk of the damage caused by HUF 50 million, and whether the grant is in return ready to take over the responsibility.
However, it is quite possible that the supplement now plays the "supplicated" after his attempts to soften the detention and house arrest had fallen upon deaf ears.
While other criminals who have done far greater damage with economic crimes and have not paid them are on the loose, or at least under house arrest, this possibility is not allowed.
The psychology of oversupply - or why we are willing to pay more
When auctioning, the buyers tend to spend more and thus overvalue the bid.
Neurologists and economists at the University of New York have now been able to discover the neurological-economic foundations of this well-known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to a study published in the "Science" magazine, people do not want to get beat in a competition, such as an auction on eBay, and are therefore ready to pay even higher prices.
The researchers have tried to explore the neurological scheme of this "game" with experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers should play Lotto while the other participated in a playful action - in both cases the active brain regions of the subjects were investigated by functional magnetic resonance (fMRI).
In both games, the participants were able to win money, but an increased activity of striatum, a complex below the cerebral cortex, was measured at the losses of the auction, where oversupply of the opponent plays an important role.
In addition to many other functions, this brain region is responsible for the "self-remuneration" of the nervous system.
The researchers therefore considered that the price increase could be explained by the avoidance of an over-reaction of the striatum.
In order to support their thesis, the economists in the research group have also commissioned investigations to track the money.
In this case, three groups should participate against a partner under different conditions.
The control group was informed of the true value of the product, after which they made their operations.
Another group was also promised 15 dollar reward, in case they emerge as winners from the game.
The third group received 15 dollars before the auction, which were also lost in the event of a lost game.
The difference between the two groups was that the emphasis on the one was on winning, while the other was on losing.
However, as evidence of the hypotheses expressed by neurologists, the members of the "against losing" group were prepared for higher stakes than those in the control or "winning" group.
"These results can not be derived from previous economic theory.
In fact, the behaviour observed at auctions has so far been based only on the joy of winning, or on the avoidance of risk.
The contradiction between these two theories was resolved thanks to the imaging neurological procedures, so that we now have a third explanation prepared" - said Andrew Schotter, Professor of the Faculty of Economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When should the doctor visit?
Around half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary this chronic liver disease is listed among the leading causes of death.
The number of people infected is estimated to be one hundred thousand, but only seven thousand are treated, which is because patients often do not know that they are infected.
Hepatitis is the collective term for various viruses caused by infectious liver disease.
Symptoms are often similar - inflammation of the liver and jaundice are common, but the pathogens and diseases differ.
Depending on the pathogens, the hepatitis viruses spread in two different ways: in hepatitis A and E through the digestive tract (e.g. through contaminated food or water), in hepatitis B, C and D, the viruses can be transmitted through blood and other body fluids (e.g. sperm, sheath secret or saliva).
Travelers are recommended to vaccinate against the viruses A and B at any rate, there is no vaccine against the virus C.
The symptoms of hepatitis A are seen approximately two to three weeks after consumption of the contaminated food and are generally accompanied by discomfort, weakness, abdominal pain and vomiting.
Afterwards, yellow fever occurs on the skin and in the eyes, the chair becomes bright, the urine dark, and the recovery can last up to two-three weeks.
Worldwide, about 1 million people die every year from the far more serious diseases caused by hepatitis B, such as liver cancer and cirrhosis of the liver.
The main reason for this is that it is estimated that only every tenth infected person is in medical treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have serious consequences: untreated may lead to cirrhosis of the liver and liver cancer.
Most infected people don't even know about their disease, as the pathogen will negate the liver cells in an insidious way - in many cases the first symptoms appear after 20-30 years.
Therefore, timely prevention, such as regular monitoring, is essential.
There are three groups where this disease is more common: those who have undergone a blood transfusion before 1991, drug addicts, and tattoos.
Currently, the number of chronic hepatitis C patients worldwide is estimated to be 200 million.
Since the disease is already detectable in a routine laboratory examination, it is advisable to visit the general practitioner at the first signs of unknown origin.
In time, the disease is curable, the virus can be eradicated, which bans the risk of infection and prevents the development of cancer.
September 30 is the World Day of Hepatitis, 2004 organized for the first time by patient representatives worldwide.
The aim of the action is to strengthen awareness of this chronic inflammation of the liver caused by viruses, their emergence and the importance of early detection.
Do believers have less pain?
As recent research shows, religious faith acts like a kind of "pain" that has already facilitated the death of Catholic martyrs.
Researchers at Oxford University have conducted an interesting experiment: It has been investigated to what extent belief in God influences human pain, reported the British newspaper "Telegraph".
In the course of the rather bizarre investigation, 12 believers and atheists each received electric shocks while studying a painting of the Mother of God.
As the results showed, the faithful were able to eliminate most of the pain.
Through a brain scan technology, it could even be demonstrated that the Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain that is responsible for pain regulation.
The study was the first in a research project in which scientists also participate philosophers and theologians from various departments of the university.
During the experiment, a sparkling device was attached to the left hand to the subjects, which the electric shocks gave off.
The participants were asked to concentrate heavily on two paintings: on the one hand, a picture of the mother of God, painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century, and on the other, Leonardo da Vinci's "Dame with the Hermelin".
The researchers hoped that the vision of the Virgin Mary would create a kind of religious trance among the faithful, while they chose da Vinci's image, because it was hardly different from the other painting and felt as soothing.
The subjects each spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, and during this time received a total of 20 electric shocks in four stages, while they should either look at the religious or the other painting.
The Catholics reported that at the sight of the Mother of God, they felt "in security" as if they were "careful" and felt "peace and quiet".
As they looked at the religious painting, they reported over 12% less pain than if they had Leonardo's work in mind.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in the experiment, said that similar effects could also be produced with other, strongly-performing images also among the atheists, one would just have to find the corresponding photo.
"We need to find an image that triggers very positive sensations, such as a mother or a father," says the psychologist.
The Anglican bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research.
"Practice of faith should change our personality, and in many cases, too," says Wright.
According to these excellent results, only the question remains as to what effect a Madonna image of Leonardo or another comparable painter would have on the pain regulation of the faithful.
Would the high-quality Virgin Mary achieve even better results?
You're what you're telling me about yourself.
On the occasion of her tenth birthday, Google can claim with courage and justice: it is in people's pockets as well as over their heads in heaven: she knows where people have spent their holidays, to which specialists they go, and what they move.
And that's still not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, one of Google's managing directors.
In the direction of skeptics who are plagued by Orwell's horror visions, he has it directed: These would just overlook the essence of the Web 2.0.
In an interview with the Financial Times, Schmidt recently said that Google's main goal was to collect even more personal data about the users and thus to get closer to the company's original goal of "ordering all the information of this world".
Schmidt stated that after ten years of changing work, Google was still only at the beginning of the information collection.
Asked about the status quo in five years, Schmidt said: he wished Google would be able to answer questions like "What should I do tomorrow?" or "What job really suits me?", but software programs are not yet able to answer because they didn't know enough about the users.
Not all Internet users are aware that the search terms would be registered in the course of their Internet searches, as well as the IP addresses from which they were searched and the visited pages.
For example, the "Personalized Search" introduced two years ago allows the visitor to store his own search history and to use it later so that the results can be generated much more precisely later, and the same logic also bases the so-called "recommendations" that the system recommends tailored products and services due to the earlier preferences.
However, users wonder what happens in the event of a data abuse - "When you look at what I'm doing" - some are concerned about the Google data monopoly.
In most cases, however, it is more the potential power represented by the company that causes fear, and less the guilt or fear of punishment, the desire for freedom or the desire for power that many Internet users encounter.
However, it is a proven fact that the search terms are not only stored, but also passed on to third parties on occasion, and in these cases there is no protection for the personal rights of the Internet user.
A recent example of this was the action against paedophilia in Brazil, in the course of which Google provided the Brazilian government with information collected by the community site called "Orkut" and also enabled the identification of the pedophilia.
However, users concerned with personal rights were still able to breathe in May when Google, together with the civil rights organisation EFF, successfully brought against the FBI in court: hence, Google cannot be forced to disclose information to the FBI on secret request at any point in the future.
(However, the Federal Government has successfully achieved the issuance of 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms, referring to the Youth Protection Act adopted years ago, but the list of individual users or their web and search terms list has been retained retrospectively for two months.)
So Google's image remains controversial: Those who refuse to publish their personal data because they fear the loss of their privacy and privacy by using Google services are the ones who are teasing the company with the provocative outrage that is due to conservative companies.
However, the American "geek culture", which is present in many countries and unites enthusiastic computer fans, activists and users, sees the next generation of "cool entrepreneurs" in them, unlike Microsoft, which is thanks to Windows market leader, even if both are fighting for the same goal.
One possible reason for this is that, unlike Microsoft, Google does not require identification codes and provides its services for free, so that an open, constantly updated source code and software package seems far more attractive, youthful and cooler than the official practices of the software giant.
On the other hand, the Geeks see the problematic relationship between personal rights and the Internet with a sharp focus - a relationship that has been brought to the centre especially in recent years thanks to the term "Web 2.0".
In fact, the "Web 2.0" is about nothing else but collaboration, i.e., the users deliberately leave traces and use the available channels of communication, and even if the sizes are individually different, the main thing remains to be shown publicly.
An average youth can manage his profile at the same time on several community portals - from Facebook via Xanga, it can connect with other services, such as Twitter, or music services such as last.fm, and can eventually integrate all of this into a tracking system such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. In addition, they can run blogs that automatically represent the latest photo galleries that are located on Flickr or Picasa.
And a number of other exemplary cases prove: When looking at the party photos of last night, the girlfriend soon finds out with whom her infidel friend has been pleased, or the employee is released, because in his blog he only makes too honest his trouble about the company management air - one thing is certain: The term "private sphere" has now been completely reinterpreted.
Whoever leads an online life is what he gives of himself - so in this way one could formulate the basic idea behind the behavior of today's youth.
And whoever tries to keep something secret, or even avoid the Google Monopol, can do that - like with Scroogle, a tool that, while accessing Google's search engine, does not deliberately leave any traces behind.
Not a few people deliberately register not on community sites, so that they are not inventable, but also the online applications of Google, such as word processing and graphical tools and RSS feeds, can be handled with alternative versions that are not bound to huge server parks and therefore not generate the best possible profile from the user.
However, public opinion is waiting for Google to show her true face.
With its current value of USD 156 billion, the company is even ahead of IBM (USD 140 billion), Intel (USD 124 billion) or Coca-Cola (USD 110 billion), AdWords/AdSense's advertising space threatens the revenue of advertising agencies, and the increasingly rapidly introduced services not only cause Microsoft but also other software developers to break their minds.
However, critical viewers also find the disturbing counter-poles: For example, the management of the Group rejected a protest by the employees after the fees of the company's own kindergarten were doubled, and the management also said that the multiple catering of the employees was too expensive. However, all of this seems to be quite mild against the fact that in 2006 Google even went to the knees in front of the Chinese government and agreed to an agreement that all the regime-critical hits, or those that violate the good taste, would be filtered out.
The Group's internal regulation is that no new service will be applied for in advance, but only when it is already available. Nevertheless, the events of the coming months and years could be considerably reversed: While some think that Google's book- and magazine-scan or archiving project is now assuming that the company would soon have to deal with the Supreme Court, others are rather concerned about the "Health" system, which allows the creation of a complete health profile based on findings, doctors and problems.
And the fact that Google builds a genetic database already gives the next generation of Sci-Fi authors the fabric - for example "Scroogled", the famous novel by Cory Doctorow describes in the best Orwellian way a future in which a human being becomes terrifyingly close to data related to Google.
Two young people help the double murderer of Ózd in the removal of traces
In connection with the double murder of Ózd, the police have now interrogated two young people who are suspected of having helped with the removal of the traces, the spokesman of the police commissioner Borsod announced on Tuesday.
The young people were stable, they are currently being charged with the aid.
According to information from the MTI news agency, these are two girls who defend themselves freely.
Aid is threatened with a prison sentence of up to five years.
The suspect of the double murder of Ózd, a 23-year-old local man, was arrested on Sunday.
The man is under urgent suspicion of having deliberately murdered several people out of greed.
In the course of the investigation, it turned out that the 23-year-old had owed a larger amount of money to a 53-year-old.
However, the suspect did not want to pay his debts, so last Wednesday he lured his creditor to an area in Ózd, where he murdered him and his nine-year-old daughter.
According to the MTI, the man has planned the act of a long hand - this also proves the fact that he committed the murder with a gun hidden at the scene.
The police, together with experts, are now investigating the actual weapon and the circumstances of its use.
Warsaw Stock Exchange places a purchase offer for Prague Stock Exchange
Around 200 million euros, or 5 billion Czech krona, have offered the Warsaw Stock Exchange for the 100% purchase of the stock packages of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by Poland despite the fact that they were previously excluded by the Czechs as potential owners of their stock exchange.
The reason for this is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange belongs entirely to the state.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which wants to sell more than 60% of the papers in the coming months.
Following reports from the Czech daily "E15", the offer of Poland contains the highest purchase price ever offered for the Prague Stock Exchange.
As the newspaper reports, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Börse have so far made offers.
Petr Koblic, head of the Prague Stock Exchange last week said that the Warsaw Stock Exchange was probably the worst new owner of all the interested parties, and he also did not rule out that this could even lead to the closing of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague stock exchange at SEK 5-10 billion.
According to shareholders' agreements, 90% of the shares could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the Patria Finance Investment Bank with a 25 percent stake, followed by Ceská Sporitelna Bank with 14.7 and the Tiger Holding Four S.a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
The financial crisis from the point of view of European newspapers
In their comments on the international financial crisis, which is becoming increasingly acute, on Tuesday, a number of leading European journals spoke of "second 11 September".
The global financial disaster we owe to the American president, for example, said "La Repubblica" - the president had not even been able to put his own party behind him for the draft law, which would bring some relief to the frightening situation...
Instead of a "new Pearl Harbor", as billionaire investor Warren Buffett called it, it would be more appropriate to speak of a "second September 11th".
Parts of the press in Madrid also located the scapegoat in Washington.
According to the "El Mundo", the lack of political leadership is responsible for the fact that the world economy is now on the verge of collapse.
The American financial system threatens to collapse more and more, and the whole world will suffer from it.
Bush's plan was not perfect, but now, after the Congress vote, there is a danger that Washington will have no political means to manage the crisis.
The world economy hangs in the air, precisely at a time when one of the greatest transformations of the history of capitalism takes place.
One can no longer ignore the threat, for example, says the Geneva Day Advertiser.
While some states could still provide rescue packages to their failing financial institutions, banks with taxpayers' money could save them from bankruptcy.
However, if a domino effect is triggered and more banks are going to break, then no further financial injections will help, nor any other emergency measures.
In the long term, EU Member States would have to jump over their shadows and centralise control of money markets.
On Monday alone, more than EUR 100 billion were paid out to weaker financial institutions, the Vienna "The Standard" recalls. Moreover, according to the newspaper, the concerns are becoming more and more realistic that, according to the Americans, European taxpayers would now have to take a little deeper into their pockets in order to get out of the crisis.
So far, the EU has not seriously dealt with the crisis, which is now sweeping like a tsunami over the old continents.
While the "rights" would not immediately have to "swivel" with several hundred billion euros, it would be advisable to hold on to what extent it would be reasonable to touch the taxpayers' money in order to avert even greater damage.
Intelligent car imitates the flight of the bumblebee
What would be the best way to develop new accident prevention technologies if not to imitate natural obstacle sensors?
For example, those of the bees.
At CEATEC in Japan, an amazing project was presented in which the Nissan engineers of Hummeln were inspired by the creation of new accident prevention systems.
In cooperation with the Tokyo University, Nissan has built the BR23C biomimetic system controlled by autobots, a mini-car, equipped with the properties of bees, with the aim of supporting the development of a system that avoids any collisions.
In flight, each bee forms its own, oval "private area", which is very similar to our own "protective shield", said Kazuhhiro Doi, Product Manager for Technology PR and Research Development at the exhibition.
The compound eye of the bee, which can see in any direction and at an angle of more than 300 degrees, plays an important role.
In order to imitate the function of the composite eye, the researchers took up the idea of the laser-controlled distance meter.
This identifies obstacles to the BR23C in a field of vision of 180 degrees within 2 meters, calculates its distances and sends signals to the microprocessor on board, which immediately initiates the collision avoidance process.
The obstacle is recorded in fractions of seconds, and the author immediately changes the course, similar to the movement of the bees, by turning the tires around the corresponding angle.
Unlike previous systems, this maneuver takes place instinctively.
"If this were not the case, the Autobot could not react quickly enough to avoid the obstacles," said Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the Mobility Laboratory and the Autobot Project.
The system must react instinctively and immediately, as this technology corresponds to the innermost and most vulnerable part of the shield - a layer within which accidents are still considered unavoidable.
The entire process must reflect the behavior of bees when they divert other bees.
And that has to run in a fraction of a second.
However, unlike the bees, the deviation can not go up, down, or even diagonally - it can only be two-dimensional, only in the direction of the reversibility of the tyres.
While the bees here are endlessly open to avoid other bees, the researchers at the author robot could only use the rotational movement, or acceleration and braking.
The BR23C contains lithium-polymer batteries that are lighter and more energy-efficient and therefore have a longer life span than conventional lithium-ion batteries.
Andoh explained that it comes to the instinctive, intelligent response, and less to the processing of the data, and even less to the ability to store it.
This device only has to process some inputs per second and react accordingly to them.
It does not have to store it, or produce an intuitive, logical reaction using previous manoeuvres, so that it constantly only takes a handful of KB memory.
There is no need for gigabytes and megabytes of heavy memories.
This is the first step in the development of immediate collision avoidance technology, which Nissan estimates will be in production as standard within the next ten years.
Another application could find the technology in GPS satellite navigation by deliberately guiding the driver around obstacles and thus leading him to the goal.
A name for the sinful child
Now the written version of the 700-billion-dollar heavy rescue package law is available, which will be applied in several stages and aims at purchasing the bad loans of the banks.
In the first round half of the money is to be spent.
In a meeting that ended on Saturday after midnight local time East Coast, after several days of debate, Congressmen agreed on the 700-billion-dollar bailout package, Reuters reported.
"We have made significant progress," said Nancy Pelosi, democratic president of the American House of Representatives, and said that the agreement should only be put on paper.
The compromise reached on the rescue package supported both presidential candidates - Barack Obama and John McCain.
Minister of Finance Henry Paulson concluded: the programme will have an impact and it will be efficient, but one had to do even more. According to Pelosi, this was not about saving Wall Street, but about tearing around the rudder of the economy.
The written version of the package was published before the opening of the Asian markets, i.e., the Washington time Sunday evening 8 a.m. (Central European time Monday 2 a.m.), but did not trigger a high-level flight on the stock exchanges.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will first vote on the draft law on stabilising the economy of 2008, then the Senate will be next.
President George W. Bush spoke with Pelosi on Saturday evening, and the White House also welcomed the news of the agreement.
We are satisfied with the progress made at night and appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilise our markets and protect our economy, said Tony Fratto, spokesperson of the White House.
However, the programme differs from the original recommendation of the Bush administration that the $700 billion should be spent at once on the purchase of debt-stressed securities.
In a first tranche, a maximum of half of the 700 billion sum will be spent, 250 billion will be available immediately after the Congress will vote on the Causa on Monday. This sum will be used for the purchase of credit-laden, bad securities, and the President will decide on the remaining USD 100 billion.
The programme is being reviewed by a Commission of its own, which also belongs to the President of the Federal Reserve.
The other half of 700 billion depends on a further decision by Congress.
In accordance with the law, the Ministry of Finance can also apply a combined tactic: it can simultaneously purchase bad loans, mortgages, and mortgage-stricken securities, or other "toxic" loans.
As reported by the competent persons of the Ministry, the purchase can take place both in an auction and directly.
The Act allows the companies concerned to participate in an insurance programme in which the Ministry of Finance guarantees the funds of concern and the companies pay the expected damages corresponding to the fees.
Henry Paulsen said: The law defines the necessary funds so that up to $700 billion can be provided as emergency aid for the American financial system, whether it be for the large-scale purchase of bad funds, their insurance, or the avoidance of systemic risk triggered by the collapse of a larger financial institution.
We are taking the necessary steps so that we are ready to introduce the law as soon as it has been signed, says Paulson.
However, the heads of the banks in difficulty and now dependent on state aid can expect their operations, called "Golden Handshake" in the overseas snake, to be shortened by the government.
There will be a reduction in salaries only in certain cases, and these cuts will depend on how the Ministry of Finance helps.
The reduction essentially means that if the Ministry buys in the course of an auction, the "Golden Handshake" is taxed unless the retired bank manager is transferred to the pension.
In the case of a direct purchase of the lazy loans, the government will take aggressive action to ensure that the management salaries are not exaggerated.
The picture also includes that the existing Golden Handshake agreements will not be amended - the restrictions refer only to new agreements so that more people participate in the programme.
This is the first case in American history that cuts in manager salaries are regulated by law, said Dr. Barney Frank, Chairman of the Financial Committee, commenting on the measure.
The State gains rights to participate in the participating banks, so that the risk to taxpayers decreases, as they can also participate as soon as the economy and thus the rescued bank get better.
The draft law provides for the President to submit a proposal to Congress over the next five years on how taxpayers should recover their lost money from the financial sector.
However, there were skeptics on both sides who expressed their doubts about the plan.
This is not what the American citizens expect from us, the plan does not protect taxpayers' money at all, says the Californian Republican Darrell Issa.
His colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur, said that the measures were advanced by the same people who are also responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
Industrial prices continued to rise
Like the Central Statistical Office, domestic sales prices rose by 0.1 percent in August 2008 compared to the previous month, and compared to August 2007, by 12.9 percent.
Export prices were 1.1 per cent higher than in July 2008, and decreased by 3.9 per cent compared to previous year's prices.
As a result of price changes in the domestic and export sectors, production prices were 0.7% higher than in the previous month, and 3.2% higher than in 2007.
Domestic sales prices increased only slightly compared to the previous month, i.e. by 0.1 per cent.
Sales prices of the manufacturing industry also rose little - 0.1 percent - since July.
The largest price increase in August 2008 was for leather goods (2.8 percent) - mainly for bags and belts - where the increase was 4.6 percent, with shoes rising by 2.5 percent.
Higher prices for plastics and chemical raw materials significantly increased the prices of chemicals and productions (1.6 percent).
A price decrease was recorded in crude oil processing (1.4 percent), in electrical and technical equipment (0.9 percent), and in wood processing (0.1 percent).
Prices in paper production, publishing and printing remained unchanged.
In other branches of the manufacturing industry, a price increase between 0.2 and 0.9 percent was measured.
In the important domestic markets of industry, such as electricity, gas, steam and water supply, prices rose by 0.3 percent in August, mainly as a result of the increase in gas prices introduced on 1 July.
If one looks at the domestic markets of the manufacturing industry in the year-on-year comparison, prices in crude oil processing have risen most (32.4 percent).
In the metalworking sector, a 13.2-percent increase was observed, while the increase in the production of food, beverages, and tobacco was 11 percent.
A price decrease was observed in the textile industry (2.5 percent) and in electrical and technical equipment (0.3 percent).
The level of cost in the other manufacturing industries ranged between 0.6 and 9.1 per cent.
In total, prices in the manufacturing industry rose by 10.2 percent last year.
Prices of electricity, gas, steam and water rose by 18.7 percent compared to the previous year.
In August, the domestic sales market recorded the highest price increase in the investment goods sector (0.7 percent).
In the consumer goods production sectors, prices rose by 0.3 per cent, while they remained the same in the energy and processing sectors compared to the previous month.
The largest price increase in August 2008 was observed in the energy and re-use sector compared to the 2007 comparative period (16.8 percent).
In the consumer goods sectors, a price increase of 6.8 percent was observed, and in the investment goods, a price decrease of 1.4 percent was noted.
Industry's export prices, measured in Forint, rose by 1.1 per cent in August compared to the previous month, but there was a drop of 3.9 per cent in the year-on-year.
The domestic currency became 1.7 percent weaker compared to the euro, the dollar 7.1 percent weaker, and compared to the August 2007 rate, it increased by 7.5 percent compared to the euro, even by 15.9 percent stronger than the dollar.
No more visas to the USA from 2009 onwards?
Kinga Göncz sees good opportunities for the American-Hungarian visa agreement to enter into force by the 12th of January, as the Foreign Minister told the representatives of the Hungarian community in Chicago.
In her opinion, "all is now dependent on the timely introduction of the electronic immigration and control system in overseas."
However, she also stressed that there will be no entry permit in the new system, but the tourists would have to register in advance.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy is conducting negotiations in Washington from now on.
She meets Foreign Minister Condoleezza Rice, who will present her with the "Middle Cross of Merit with Star" of the Republic of Hungary, and also has talks with the foreign policy advisors of Democratic Barack Obama and Republican presidential candidate John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain support rescue package for banks
On Sunday, Barack Obama and John McCain, the two presidential candidates of the major American parties, pledged their support for the 700 billion dollar bailout package for banks. However, there are also politicians who demand the resignation of the finance minister.
After days of marathon consultations on Sunday morning, Congress and government representatives announced that they had come to an agreement on the banking bailout package.
The Wall Street crisis, as well as the thawing of the frozen credit market, have become the central issues of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain - both claim to be better suited than the respective opponent to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to recent polls, Obama was able to expand its lead thanks to the economic issues, while McCain's Hoch, who gave him the presentation of Vice-President Sarah Palin after the Republican Convention, melted away.
At an election campaign in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that Congress will quickly adopt the bill on the 700 billion dollar package.
He stressed that the plan also included those sections of consumer protection that he supported.
"We must now act responsibly (...) - your jobs, your savings, entire industries, and the stability of the entire economy are threatened" - he said before 35,000 spectators.
He did not fail to call McCain's economic vision "obsolet".
In an interview given to the broadcaster ABC, McCain said: "We will all have a hard time chewing (...) but nothing is certainly no alternative".
The Republican senator said that the plan also presupposes the establishment of a control commission for the finance minister, as well as the limitation of the handling of top managers - something that he insisted on.
The CBS told Obama that McCain had not played a definite role in the negotiations, whereas he, Obama, was in contact with the minister.
On Sunday, the spokesperson of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, announced that the House of Representatives will probably vote on the draft law on Monday.
Press review of the German-speaking region
The right bearing is intact, only the voters became more confident within the camp - so commented "Der Spiegel" the weak performance of the CSU in Bavaria.
In Austria, Haider and Co are ready to rule to prevent a red-black coalition.
The mirror (spiegel.de)
In the online edition of the left-wing German news magazine, Franz Walter analyses the reasons for the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article "Bayern's Revolution Destroys Their Fathers".
According to the renowned political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo took over his office.
The Christian-Socialists have renewed Bavaria for decades - now the modern citizens are turning away from them.
The breakup of the epoch is at the same time a problem of Christian democracy, as well as of Angela Merkel.
Surprisingly, the disaster of the CSU did not come to an end, but something came to an end on Sunday, which, however, already occurred quite exactly ten years ago: the unquestionable hegemony of a state party
For already ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU landed at 47.7 percent and thus fell for the first time since the 1950s under the fifty percent mark.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Bundestag elections, i.e. still in the much quoted Stoiber era.
The modernisation carried out consistently by the CSU in the federal state has ultimately destroyed its own mothers and fathers.
Sociologists had already predicted this 40 years ago, but at a considerable pace, they were not able to keep the secularization, the educational success, the inflow of East and North Germans into the prosperous regions of Bavaria on the loyalty of the CSU electors.
Modernisation always goes hand in hand with an increase in options, and that has political consequences.
The right camp is intact - only the voters within the camp have become more critical and self-willed.
It is striking that over the last few weeks, the classic citizens' groups have expressed the greatest distance from the CSU: the free professions, the commercial citizenship and voters with degrees such as university degrees.
Here the support of the CSU dropped to even less than 40 percent.
The press (diepresse.com)
The conservative Wiener Tageszeitung reports in her "Whom with whom? Party leaders withholding in coalition issues" entitled articles on the chaotic domestic political situation in Austria after the new elections.
The SPÖ wants to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The ÖVP forbids the involvement of the SPÖ in internal affairs.
The BZÖ is open to conversation in all directions, while the Greens do not yet want to define themselves in terms of a coalition.
The new elections are over, and now everything is about the coalition; in the debates on public-law television, the party leaders hardly let their cards look.
SPÖ Chief Werner Faymann confirmed his desire to negotiate with ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between both parties is very possible - in some federal states and in the social partnership this is already the case.
The question of whether he could imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current head of OVP as vice-chancellor, left Faymann open.
As he said, the voters would have chosen the Schüssel-Multerer course.
A repetition of this direction would not be in question.
However, Molterer has responded carefully to red offers.
The cooperation could not be fruitful, he said, if Faymann tried to interfere with the ÖVP's internal concerns.
Whether his party is in opposition, or in the coalition, is currently fully open, and these issues should be discussed within ÖVP.
BZÖ-Chief Jörg Haider was open in all directions.
"To prevent red and black, we are ready to take on government responsibility," says Haider.
Járóka: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today, in Paris, the European Summit on Equal Opportunities, which is being held this year by the EU Presidency country France, has begun.
In her address to the plenary, Lívia Járóka, a member of the European People's Party's Party's Fidesz, drew attention, in particular, to the segregation of education, which is one of the most serious violations of law that Roma children encounter, and this was also the biggest obstacle to their need for validity.
The high-level conference was opened by French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs Xavier Bertrand on behalf of the French Presidency of the Council, and Vladimir Spidla, EU Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
The participants included representatives of governments, the European social partners, and the most important European legal protection and civil society organisations in the field of equal opportunities.
As reported by the Press Office of the EP Members of the Fidesz, Járóka pointed out that, in addition to discrimination in job search, Roma were mainly displaced from the labour market because of their low level of education.
"The vast majority of Roma students have no secondary education, and due to poor primary education, only a small part of them can graduate from higher education".
Járóka also stressed that education is a fundamental human right which would have a key role to play in the enforcement of other human rights.
Investment in the early training of Roma children could strengthen the economy of EU Member States.
In the view of the honourable Members, it is important that these links become aware of as broad a circle as possible - that is, Roma and non-Roma.
The sooner a Roma student starts schooling, the more his chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market increase; and through income and sales tax they contribute to national expenditure.
"As a citizen of the Union, the Roma must be guaranteed the right to high-quality education - bad and segregated education must be discontinued" - says Lívia Járóka.
As the honourable Member said, a common, goal-oriented and action-oriented approach by the European Union is necessary to speed up the process of desegregation in the education sector.
"We must break through the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment and give Roma children the democratic opportunities to contribute to the future of Europe as a fully-fledged citizen," Járóka demanded.
Since last year's Berlin Congress, the summit has been organised annually with the aim of creating a unique forum for the implementation of the objectives of equal opportunities and freedom of discrimination at European, but also national, level, in the sense of the "European Year of Equal Opportunities".
CSU: Grace on Time
At the end of October the fate of the fallen duo Huber-Beckstein will be decided
Despite the election debacle, no heads have been rolling yet, at the top of the Bavarian CSU, the personnel debates have been postponed.
Party leader Erwin Huber and Prime Minister Beckstein remain in their offices, the question is just how long this grace lasts.
The fate of the tandem after the catastrophic 17-percent loss of voice will be decided at the extraordinary party meeting on the last week of October.
The well-trained duo, however, had already made it clear that it does not want to stick on their armchairs.
Thus they want to soften the angry group and the party base that demanded personal consequences one day after the "Baryan Tsunami" in view of the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - admittedly, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber at his career highlight - the Christian-Social Union still reached 60.7 percent. Now, however, one year after the coup against Stoiber, they were able to secure only 43.4 percent of the votes.
For 46 years, the CSU was the sole director of Bavaria, which generates 18 percent of German GDP.
Although conservatives remain the determining force in the southern federal country, which is also important for the Hungarian economy, they will have to rule in a coalition in the future.
As the first sign of party internal restructuring, the potential successor of Huber, Vice-President and Federal Minister of Agriculture Horst Seehofer will also be involved in the exploration team, which will conduct exploratory talks on a possible Munich coalition with the liberal FDP, or the legal "Free Voters".
An irony of fate is equal to the fact that with the list of "free voters" Gabriele Pauli enters the legislature whose anti-stober appearances used the Huber-Beckstein Duo first to serve the determined politician mercilessly.
The CSU leadership is now focusing all its forces on the stabilisation of Beckstein.
In this transition process, Stoiber, who so far drew the threads from the background, will play an active role. On 28 September, the former Prime Minister and CSU President called the "best day of his political career".
On Monday, Huber made some toxic remarks towards the CDU - in his opinion, the CSU would have earned much more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted defeat as a signal to the CDU and hence to Angela Merkel.
If the CSU, which contributed much to success at national level in 2005, is not put back on track with a joint force act, Merkel cannot become a chancellor again after the Bundestag elections in September 2009.
Merkel, who has made no difference in her disappointment about the failure, believes that the loss of the terrain of the CSU will not have a negative effect on the great coalition in Berlin.
However, what is relative is that the wounded CSU will not be easier to govern, and the crisis of the Social Democrats continues.
With 18.6 percent, the SPD has achieved its best result in Bavaria since 1946.
Lukaschenko opposition: 110-0
In the elections on Sunday, no member of the opposition in the Ukrainian Parliament managed to do so.
Russian observers believe that this is due to the prosperity and stability of the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, but the OECD suspects that there are legal violations in the counting of votes.
The OECD, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, has not accepted the elections.
De Legislator of the 10 million-resident state has been coming out without opposition for decades. Nevertheless, the opposing party under the name "United Democratic Forces" (ODS) seriously hoped before yesterday's elections that Lukashenko, who had already renewed his presidency mandate for the fourth time this time, in the unclean elections and a constitutional amendment in 2006, would "allow" some members of the opposition in Parliament.
That is why the ODS has even distanced itself from the previously planned boycotts.
Ukraine is becoming increasingly dependent on Russia, thanks to rising prices of natural gas imports. In order to ease price increases, loans were even made, and the country has also agreed to the sale of Beltransgas, the owner of the country’s leading gas pipeline, to the Russians. In the light of the opposition’s expectations, the hope was that Ukraine would improve its relationship with the EU after Lukashenko and other high-ranking politicians had banned entry into the EU because of the anti-democratic political system.
A temporary relaxation was provided by the OECD election evaluation report, in which emphasis was placed on positive movements rather than on shortcomings, such as the exclusion of one third of the opposition candidates from the elections.
However, on Monday, the OECD's Rapid Report criticised the campaign - which is why oppositionists should not appear in the press - and in particular the fact that the opposition was not allowed to be present in the counting of votes.
Despite all of this, the opposition is able to see an improvement in the political system: political prisoners were set free, for example, and Minsk is even prepared for smaller confrontations with Moscow, by continuing to deny the recognition of the independence of the apostate Georgian provinces of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, although Russia, with which Ukraine on paper forms a federal state, has considered the two territories independent for a month.
"We have made two steps forward and one backwards, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun," said Alexander Milinkevich to our magazine.
In the opinion of the opposition candidate of the 2006 presidential elections, a continuation is desirable, although "the powerful have been afraid to leave even one oppositionary in Parliament".
The opposition does not plan to take any protest measures in view of the results, but rather tries to clarify the need for economic reform to voters.
"We have many problems to deal with here - the oppositional newspapers have to be printed in Russia, the local authorities put us in the way of distribution stones, but yet I see that more and more people are supporting change, even the older ones" - said Milinkevich, alluding to the fact that not even the most supported layer of pensioners agrees with the Lukashenko regime, whose only merit is the production of social security.
"Thanks to the country's debt and the rise in the trade deficit, it is only a matter of time before the "social security" which is admonished by the silence of a cemetery begins to crumble," Milinkevich said.
Unlike opposition politicians, Russian observers have called the elections democratic.
Sergei Lebedev, Head of Mission of the Community of Independent States, said to the news agency Ria Novosti: "People believe the deeds, and not the words." The lack of opposition is therefore proof of the maturity of the Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on it will be breakfast before work"
For the first time in the history of the Palazzo Chigi there are rotatable doors for the entrances and exits of the officials.
As of today, the measure will come into force against those slagers who first stamp and then go drinking coffee during their working hours.
The new Anti-Faulpelz Act was presented today by Renato Brunetta, Minister of Public Administration and Mauro Masi, Secretary-General of the Council of Ministers.
">"Drivable doors are a means of increasing work efficiency through a higher attendance rate and more services," Minister Brunetta said.
"Now a new era of responsibility and transparency begins.
This is reformism," says Brunetta once again.
With the Palazzo Chigi, the establishment ends in all the buildings of the Bureau of the Council of Ministers.
Masi says: "the choice of the rotatable doors is also of great symbolic value".
There was no resistance on the part of the officials, the Secretary-General assured: "This process was supported by all, the cooperation came from all sides."
All in all there is now no breakfast during the working hours; end with coffee or croissant.
Brunettas advises on this with a smile: "A good cappuccino works miracles at 7 o'clock".
During a meeting of the General Committee of Public Administration (Scuola Superiore della Pubblica Amministrazione)
in Rome, the Minister announces that "within three months the absences of officials have been reduced to 50%, i.e. 60,000 people per year are more present at work".
He added that it was necessary to strengthen the efficiency of the Italian public administration
"their wage dynamics - according to the Minister - have been twice as large in the last 8-10 years as the private sector and far above the inflation rate".
Meanwhile, thousands of officials have gathered to counter the Brunetta decree in the context of the appeals supported by Codacons.
"While the Minister of Public Service is profiled with figures on lower absenteeism at work - according to the Consumer Centre - the people of the 'active lazy' are constantly growing.
In fact, thousands of correct and valuable public service officials have gathered to explain the illegal norms of the district to the war."
In particular, the Regional Administrative Court (TAR) is fighting for additional financial compensation for work-related illness, including the planned extension of the compulsory house arrest of the sick worker, during which control visits can be made and further aspects of the Minister's renewals are being challenged.
Napolitano: "Prevention of accidents at work is crucial"
Every day in Italy 2500 accidents at work, three people die and 27 remain disabled for life.
For 2007, the data from Inail (Istituto nazionale contro gli infortuni sul lavoro) confirm that the fatal accidents at work were about 1200.
These figures prove the seriousness of a phenomenon which causes almost twice as many deaths as murders.
Today, the Anmil (Associazione Nazionale Mutilati e Invalidi del Lavoro) in all provinces of Italy will be celebrating the 58th National Day for Victims of Accidents at Work to draw the attention of the social institutions and the media to this dramatic situation.
"The alarming data spread by Anmil and the tragic news of these days confirm how crucial the issue of prevention at work is.", the President of the Republic of Giorgio Napolitano confirms in his communication to the President of Amil (Associazione nazionale mutilati ed invalidi del lavoro) Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses his "great appreciation for the constant commitment to the prevention of jobs, the protection of the injured workers, the support of the families of the victims and the awareness of public opinion".
"An outraged "basta" has risen to this point; understandably in the case of tragedies which, in terms of their size, trigger some vortex in the media and public participation. However, everyday reality often confronts us with dramatic events that can even be repeated in their own dynamics."
Napolitano does not hide that "there is in any case also a resource problem: it must be invested decisively in education and information."
A special importance is attached to the numerous initiatives for a more direct awareness-raising within the school framework of young people who feed on the world of work.
It is our duty to focus attention on this phenomenon and not to divert attention from its social seriousness.
On the other hand, the President of the Chamber of Gianfranco Fini stressed "how the phenomenon of job-related deaths constitutes an urgent social emergency, which offends the conscience of all of us and forces all institutions to work on decisive rules that aim to put an end to the problem".
"The data on accidents at work seem to indicate a slight improvement, but this does not exclude that the number of deaths caused by work is far too high," stresses President of Anmil, Pietro Mercandelli.
"We don't want this "positive tendency" to mean less attention. That's exactly what causes the tragedy in the end."
"How do you think that you are doing too little to counter the phenomenon of accidents? You can fight against it through various actions.
In our opinion, stronger controls and inspections are necessary – according to Mercandelli; but also stronger measures to educate workers who are already starting school."
"An additional effort is necessary - he adds - in terms of communication and awareness-raising of public opinion.
But above all, a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers is in demand of a phenomenon which constitutes a social emergency".
Mercandelli also referred to "the progressive deterioration in the protection of victims of accidents at work" and denounced the "disposal of the social system against which we are fighting in recent years".
"The aim is therefore to return a guarantee to the employee on insurance so that the fate of the victim of an accident at work does not depend on voluntary or incidental donations that are decided upon by a legislator at the time".
Mp3 player under charge: danger of hearing damage
Listening to loud music over a longer period of time with portable music devices, such as Mp3 players, can lead to permanent hearing damage.
This is reported by the European Commission, which cites the opinion of the Csrseri (Scientific Committee on the current and recently identified health risks) of the EU in a report published in Brussels today.
"The report – as it says in a comment – makes it clear that 5-10% of those who hear loud music with portable music for at least five years per day for more than one hour per day risk the permanent loss of their hearing".
"I am concerned that such a large number of young people, who usually put portable music devices and mobile phones on a high volume, are irrevocably damaging their hearing without knowing it," says Meglena Kuneva.
"From the scientific findings – it is said by the EU – there is a clear risk that is pressing for rapid action.
What really matters is to raise consumer awareness and make this information a common good.
In the light of these scientific findings, we need to re-examine the existing control systems so that they are fully effective and keep pace with the new technology".
Brussels had commissioned the independent scientific committee in view of the widespread use of portable music devices among young people.
"Scientists - as the EU Communication concludes - confirm that there is a good deal of concern and that the European Commission, together with the other members of the European Union and those concerned, will now examine the necessary measures to better protect children and young people from the noise that comes from portable music and similar devices."
There is already a European standard at the moment which limits the level of noise from portable music devices to 100 dB. Concern about the damage that could result from an excessive noise load.
It is very possible to limit these damage to solutions such as the reduction of volume and the length of noise emission.
In their report, the European Scientific Committee points out that if users of portable music devices only hear five hours a week (only more than 89 decibels) of music, then the legal boundaries that apply to the maximum noise level at the workplace are already exceeded.
Those who cross this line risk the complete loss of hearing within five years.
This represents 5-10% of the users of such devices, whose number can be estimated at between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Roma, Alemanno gives the start to the "Commission for the Future of the Capital"
We're starting today, it's supposed to be over in March, in June, we're going to have a balance sheet.
This is the procedure laid down by the Capitol for the work of the "Commission for the Future of the Capital of Rome", which the Commission met in the new headquarters behind the Caracalla thermals this morning.
In six months, President Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will work out the guidelines for Rome.
As soon as the project is completed, the City Council and the Municipal Council will evaluate the analyses and projects in order to be able to present the strategic plan for Rome with the "official stamp" of the Capitol and the Mayor Gianni Alemanno in June.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and all political, social and cultural opinions are represented in it," says Alemanno. "It will present proposals for a development plan for Rome, whose political responsibility remains with the City Council and the Municipal Council.
There is no redistribution of responsibilities, only the will to have a place where a great project can be developed for Rome.
In March, its task will be completed and the Commission will be dissolved again, as such a project must have a time-limited end-point.
In June - as the Mayor announces - we will present the strategic plan in which we will use the work done by the Commission."
Anyone who questions the Commission's competence, because their opinion of liability is lacking, responds to Alemanno: "Everything depends on the work that the Commission will do and on the quality of its proposals.
If, as in France, the Attali Commission delivers quality results – and this will certainly be the case in Rome – then its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often, politics deals with the everyday problems and emergencies that occur from time to time.
We, on the other hand, want to have a longer period of time in mind so as to work seriously in a deeper perspective on the development of Rome and the future of the city."
The mayor of Rome attaches great importance to clarify the following: "This Commission is neither a useless institution nor a wreck: it is absolutely free of charge, it will not cost the Roman citizens a cent and it will bring to our mind. It will occupy the best minds of the capital".
According to Alemanno, "it is necessary to have a strategic plan that is neither hermetic nor static in order to enable our city to make a leap in quality - which it really needs - and thus to make a joint step towards the future".
A future, according to the Mayor of Rome, who "will not only be confined to the current municipal boundaries but will look much further", not only as regards the role of Rome as a metropolis and political capital of Italy, but also as a future capital of Europe and the Mediterranean."
Obama – the first anti-American president? Here’s a statement
A well-known American politician, who is much to be regarded as independent, wrote: "Barack Obama becomes the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, through his decisions, decimated the economy of the United States and maintained relations with the existing Islam (and still does this as a private person today).
The attacks on Obama are getting more and more violent, right now, where the elections are approaching.
A Miami lady wrote in an internet page: "This person is full of ambitions.
Obama is very naughty: he thinks he will receive the highest office of a nation that has seen two black governors and five black senators in total!".
In fact, however, these attacks do not have much to say; they are racist attacks and they do not answer the voters' question: will he be a good president? And then there are also the polls; everyone says that Obama will win with a great advantage.
Even in this case, there are people who talk to the heart and not to the head.
A newspaper from Mississippi, in the deepest south of the United States, has written in her editorial: only in the polling booth will we know who will give his voice to the real American patriot.
Here comes a mentality of the United States that was kept hidden until the last time.
"Tell me what you want, and we'll decide who we'll make our crumbs for, whether for Obama or for McCain."
There are people who swear: if Obama wins, we will emigrate from America.
Something you never heard before – only now that the success of the black candidate seems so certain.
In any case, despite all these considerations, the final weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
1500 people were asked: What mistake has Bush made during his term of office? 89% have replied: the war in Iraq.
America is changing.
The nation lost 50,000 soldiers in Vietnam and was sent home with a kick in the butt.
In Iraq 4,500 soldiers lost their lives and the Americans were not forced to pack.
Nevertheless, Iraq remains for the majority of Bush's weakness.
The one who will take his place is faced with a huge task.
USA. The financial collapse leaves its mark on journalists: in the newspapers you can already feel the cuts. And many accuse the Internet, the "murderer" of the printing press.
Five hundred American journalists were questioned by the PEW Research Center about their situation and their mental control of the future.
Today, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
Nevertheless, they did not really express concern about the general credibility of the information concerning the competent authorities.
You don't feel as alone as before.
The problem for American journalists is the money.
For these journalists, the 2008 crisis is a crisis of an economic model that has been destroyed.
In addition, the major problems are caused by the cuts that hit the newsroom, i.e. the space in which the editors work to compile the newspaper.
It is a problem that needs to be solved – according to the interviewed journalists – if you want to prevent traditional journalism, as the big audience understands it, from shrinking significantly.
A clear but complicated pessimism is fulfilling the American journalist today.
Six out of ten journalists and executive seniors of the printing press believe that journalism is on the wrong track at national level.
In the local area, it is even 65% for the executives.
Printed vs. Broadcast.
It is not difficult for journalists to imagine in which direction the web is going.
The most important publishing groups are paving the way to the Internet, which is considered by many to be the "killer" of the printing press.
The "economic pressure" felt by journalists has increased by up to 79%.
The 500 interviewed journalists have admitted to want to join the new technology, in the hope "they bring something good for journalism".
The biggest break in American journalism exists today between the editors-in-chief of the newsroom and the reporters who work for them.
56% of chief editors at national level are sure that their reporters share their values with them, while at local level it is only 23%.
Some think it has to do with the "security in work".
Managers who are afraid of losing their jobs within three years amount to 47% at national level.
The number of journalists is 30%.
The topic of "safe work" in the team (our "editors", Note d. Red.) is always a topical issue in the USA.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In a huge nation, like the United States, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio and TV channels and Internet operators, employers like them offer and so it will be a question of take it or leave it.
The editor-in-chief often gets very high wages, but the editor can sometimes get only 10000 euros per month, plus pension and insurance money.
As far as the holiday is concerned, the thing is complicated: a certain amount of days in the first year, so and so many after the third, in order to finally reach 15 holidays after a certain number of years.
But the American journalists, as they themselves admit, often become "sick" over the course of the year.
It is a question of climate.
UNIPOL: ROOM COURT: DANILO COPPOLA
The President of the Second Chamber of Penalty in Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the request of the real estate agent, who had asked to be transferred from Grottaferrata to Rome.
It is established against Coppola for bankruptcy in the context of the investigation into the counter-agreement in the case of the acquisition of Unipol-Bnl.
In the course of the trial against him during the last week, his release from the house arrest was converted into a residence obligation in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella had asked the real estate agent to move from the provincial city to an apartment in the capital.
According to the court, such relocations (against which the Public Prosecutor's Office had expressed itself) could give him the opportunity to influence his society and to reach him indicting evidence.
The Elite is in danger
The phenomenon had already been revealed a few days ago when the Chamber of Deputies voted against the 700 billion-dollar budget of the White House: a large part of the Americans were and are more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
This confirms yesterday's issue of the New York Times, which reports on how the crisis in the run-up to the Republican Party is becoming more and more divided into its old and moderate East Coast Souls, which always favored the state institutions and the business community and that neoconservative who are hostile to "the one in Washington" and the financial world and, above all, in the south and the centre of states voters.
This part of the party owes its rise, above all, to the voice of what I mentioned above.
This example just mentioned is, however, only a small part of the major changes that the current economic earthquake announces or even already represents: not only in the United States, but also in the whole of the West, and perhaps beyond that, will be affected by these.
Both in the Member States and in Europe, the crisis seems to accelerate the long-afraid events, which finally take shape and come to light under these new conditions.
The first of these phenomena is the discovery of the unprecedented Renaissance of the state in connection with a kind of renationalization of the economy.
In fact, the crisis is a decline in banking and financial institutions, which have close links with abroad and at the same time manage an enormous amount of private household assets living in a single state.
This means an immediate political problem for governments: how to deal with the families concerned, which is also a huge mass of voters.
The crisis therefore appears economically global, but politically it is almost purely national.
Political internationalism seems to have gone far beyond itself and lost its right to speak: the clear evidence of this has been given by the EU, which, due to its division into various national and international conflicts, cannot find a common way.
Therefore, everyone is now counting on the intervention of their own state; rescue plans, new rules, and, above all, the distribution of aid funds: since the crisis has become increasingly serious, only the US is in the economic situation to save itself without foreign aid.
In addition to the funds, they also have the legitimacy to use them: thus, two conditions that cannot be overvalued – under certain circumstances – on which otherwise probably no international organisation and no market will be able to resort in a similar way.
Moreover, the new emphasis placed on the state-national element is in perfect harmony with the ever greater importance that is most recently associated in the economy with a closely related sector: territoriality.
Paradoxically it is right now, when we were so convinced that we have long since entered a networked total empire, into a realm of ever-differentiated technologies, of intangibles, that we must suddenly see how our future will depend more and more on the essential material things: water, harvests and oil.
While they can all be transported from one place to the other of the world, they are still extremely connected to a narrowly defined piece of earth – a territory.
Therefore, the one who has such a territory is in favour of another who lives in a yieldless, waterless or oil-free area.
I now come to the second innovation, which, however, requires a short introduction.
Anyone who says territory, who says government, who says politics, says leadership.
In this sense, the financial crisis seems to produce two convergent phenomena.
On the one hand, there is the knowledge of the need for respected leaderships, so the need for someone who knows how to regulate things.
On the other hand, there is now a wave of disillusionment over the existing leaderships, especially those of the economy, which have emerged as insufficient and full of shadow zones.
Finally, there is a deeper and more disturbing aspect: a loss of confidence, an inadequacy, an image of inefficiency, a feeling of distance, all of which is directed towards an entire class of managers of the Western countries.
It seems that the conviction among many parts of the population is the way forward, that it is not only the actions of the social elite, but already their world of ideas, their Way of Life, their culture in the broadest sense of the word, whose content is the majority as ever alien and more common.
The demand for leadership thus nourishes underground a weak but powerful movement of the demise of the leading class and the traditional political establishment. This manifests itself in unexpected "revolts" of the voters and in the immediate reversal of the collective state of mind of the recent times: starting with the rise of the conservatives in Austria and Bavaria, through the collapse of the Labour Party in the UK, to the rebellion of American MEPs against Bush (and perhaps the victory of the right in Italy plays a role here).
One gets the impression that the old elite, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, magazines, intellectual creditors, some would say their format, more and more problems of understanding and therefore less representative value of what is happening in the lower social strata of the West these days, and even stronger from the financial crisis and driven to overdimensionality.
In view of all of this, it would simply be exaggerated to speak of a "rebellion of the masses".
But keeping your eyes wide open is certainly not.
The superglue that raises walls
To defeat the forces of gravity thanks to a glue and to be able to climb walls like Superman.
This is the subject of four American research centres, one of which seems to have almost reached the target.
With a glue applied on an area of only 2.5 sq cm, the researchers have managed to fix a 100 kg body on a vertical wall.
STUDIO – an American magazine has published the results of the researchers at the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the research team is a further development of the adhesives already used, which use a special carbon structure, called carbon nanotubes.
"The principle of glue can be imagined as a series of stacks of spaghetti arranged tubes," explains Zhong Lin Wang from the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The scientists have been inspired by the feet of Geckos, which are covered by microscopic herrings that give the animal a perfect hold.
Tests carried out with different materials such as glass Teflon and sandpaper have shown that the new glue is ten times stronger than the durability of the feet of the reptiles and at the same time "stuck off the wall", says Liming Dai, researcher at the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Dayton.
"This material could be used as a transitory adhesive," adds Liming Dai.
Maybe, but the researchers think of a less fascinating benefit, such as the connection of electrical devices, because the nanotubes are also conductors of heat and electricity.
Other applications could fall within the scope of space.
So for the moment, the superheroes have to wait.
THE OTHER TYPE OF RESEARCH – also the University of Berkeley, California, is dedicated to a new type of adhesive.
In an article by the American Chemical Society, the Californian scientists present a microfibre adhesive that cleans itself from the dust by movement on a surface, keeping perfect adhesion.
Medicines: never take fruit juice
Beware of grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, which are consumed due to their refreshing quality and their vitamin richness, especially in summer, can cause serious health damage if they are taken at the same time with certain vital medicines, as they can have an extreme effect on their absorption by the body.
David Bailey, professor of the University of Western Ontario in London, repeatedly points out the risk of packaging and fresh fruit juices in connection with medication. During the 236th meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he again called for an alarm: it is enough for a glass of apple, orange or grapefruit juice to reduce the absorption capacity of certain vital medicines so that they are practically eliminated and thus endanger the health of the patients.
Grapefruit juice was already suspected of being responsible for increasing the effects of some medicines such as antibiotics, antiasthmatics, cardiovasculars, anxiolytics and neurologicals, up to toxic levels.
MEDICINAL PRODUCTS – In a report two years ago, the same Agency had warned doctors and patients about the dangers of this mixture, stressing that what is being drunk in combination with medicines such as diazepan or methadone.
IT IS NOT ONLY GRAPEFRUIT – According to the experts, orange juice and apple juice contain substances that can inhibit the medicines.
The list of active substances inhibited by the fruit juices is long.
The appeal of Michele Carruba, director of the Università Statale di Milano: "These results are usually passed on immediately to the various international manufacturers, who are thus free to change the consumer information.
It is therefore advisable to read the package leaflet at all times and, if there is any confusion, not to ask a pharmacist or a doctor," stresses the expert of the Ansa Agency.
Business Nobel Prize goes to Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize is awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his analysis of trade patterns and the establishment of economic activities.
The 55-year-old Krugman is a Neokeynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is known for his regular articles for the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration's economic and foreign policy.
A few months after the attacks of September 11, 2001, during the Enron collapse, Krugman had claimed in an editorial of the New York Times that this second event was more decisive for the history of the United States than the assassination.
A prediction that received not little polemics in response and was given to the economist years later, but proved to be completely correct today.
"I am surprised and also shocked at how quickly the memory of the scandals has disappeared from public view in the context of the collapses of Enron or Worldcom," said Krugman at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is an "economist of great value", but also a banalist with a "very aggressive style, especially directed against the excessive liberalism of the Bush government."
Open Office, it appears the third version of the "Anti-Microsoft" package
The day of publication of OpenOffice.org 3.0 has come; the Open Source software gains an increasing number of users, both at home and in the office, both among freelancers and in the public administration, as a free replacement for Microsoft's Office.
After a year of intensive work by the voluntary developers, which is monitored by SUN Microsystems, the new Open Office is now presenting itself to the public with some new features: in addition to a revised and now more sparsely designed start menu, it has now finally reached a level of compatibility with Apple's Mac OS x operating system, as well as support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2 format, the latest standard ISO version.
Eight against was also on compatibility with Microsoft's Office 2007, whose new formats (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx) can be read by OpenOffice.
Also interesting are some new features, such as those that allow you to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, which facilitates e.g. sending via email. This includes the possibility to import PDF files into graphic editing modules while at the same time preserving the original appearance of the page.
Thus, "hybrid" PDF-files can now be generated, which extend the typical graphics of Adobe format to the elements of a table and a text-processing system.
The cooperation is one of the most improved elements of the applications: Tables can now be worked out by several users, avoiding conflicts in the event of changes; in the case of the word processing system, each editor is assigned a Frabe to guarantee a better correction procedure.
Some companies are about to publish various functions of OpenOffice on the Internet (on the cloud), while in the coming weeks the definitive result is to be made public.
The Italian version is available for download on the following link: http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html. Thus it follows the English version, which has been on the mirrors since Friday.
The program is also available for the Linux operating system except for Windows and Mac OS.
On request, the installation CD can be sent to your home or office.
However, if freedom of charge can be an incentive for the distribution of the program in private households, it is also in the business area where OpenOffice could succeed the big throw: finally, various public administration and schools have already moved to OpenOffice.
In fact, there is not even a lack of a training offer, which means optimal help for small and medium-sized enterprises, and thus even opening up business prospects.
OpenOffice consists of five main components: Writer, the Word equivalent text creation program; Calc, the table program that aims to displace Excel; Impress, to create presentations like with PowerPoint; Dbase to operate databases instead of the more familiar access; and lastly Draw, a graphics module.
The goal for 2008 is to achieve 5 million downloads – a goal that can be easily exceeded at already reached 3 million and 600 thousand.
Also Kohl tested positive and thus the fourth doping case
It opens up a new doping case with the last Tour de France: it is the Austrian athlete Bernhard Kohl of the team Gerolsteiner, who is the third-class winner and winner of the jersey of the best climber.
The message published the daily L'Equipe on its website.
The 26-year-old Kohl of the Gerolsteiner team is the fourth driver, who was tested positive for Cera, the third generation Epo. Previously, this was already true for the Italians Riccardo Ricco and Leonardo Piepoli as well as for the German Stefan Schumacher.
The analyses from the blood samples of cabbage are among those carried out by the Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry laboratories in recent weeks.
If the counter-tests confirm the positive results on Cera, the Austrian will lose its third place and will be excluded from the races for two years.
The head of the French anti-doping commission Pierre Bordry confirmed the positive epotest, and, according to the Associated Press, he also informed the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian climbed the podium behind Carlos Sastre and Cadel Evans and claimed the jersey of the best climber for himself.
THEME AMENDMENT: THE NEW YORK TIMES QUESTIONS: IS ITALIA RASSISTIC?
Italy, "the former country of immigrants has recently become one of the preferred countries for immigrants", which is only accepted with reluctance.
Does this come from Belpaese a nation of racists? This is what the New York Times asks in a long article dedicated entirely to the subject of racism in Italy and the case of the young Abdul William Guibre, a native of Burkina Faso, who was murdered in Milan a month ago after he stole a pack of cookies.
The case testifies to what the Times calls "paradox of the North": the northern regions are those in which "most integration and work opportunities" exist, and yet "the highest degree of anti-immigrationist sentiments and the greatest support of the Lega North is recorded".
As confirmation of the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the Times calls for further episodes of intolerance from Milan, Rome, Parma, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
And not only this.
The new legislation against immigration introduced by the Lega and to speed up the expulsion of illegal immigrants are also cited as a sign of climate change in Italy.
A movement which also underlines the Pope and the President: "Giorgio Napolitano asked the Pope at a meeting on the Quirinal to cooperate between the Church and the State to combat racism."
Students Victims of up to 900 Euro per room rental prices
The market for apartments for students does not know any crises.
According to the latest study of the Sunia, the tenant union, a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples and 600 in Rome.
"This phenomenon has already taken on very serious trains. A whole group of students lose their right to study as effectively as their families are unable to support them at this level" – according to the Sunia, Laura Mariani, "in these cities the great demand of the students leads to a deformation of the market that has also damaged the other residents.
In addition, most rental offers include a number of infringements: free contracts, missing registrations, without a rental price limit, unauthorized sub-rents.
For the Sunia there is the need for exceptional measures, which result in a revision of taxation at lower rental prices.
It turns out that in Milan a sleeping space is needed in the Brianza district of about 450 euros; a single room starts at 650 euros (in the Nere district) and ends with 800 euros in the Lambiate, Udine and Fiera district or even 900 euros in the Vittoria district.
In Florence, an average sleeping space costs 350/400 euros, a room 700.
In Bologna, where students are concentrated in the neighborhoods around the university, 250/280 euros are for a sleeping area of needs, 370 to 500 for a single room.
In Rome, the prices in the neighborhoods around the university are about 600 euros for a single room, 450 for a sleeping area in a double room.
Only a little deeper are the rents in the districts around the other universities of Rome: 550 euros in Ostienne and Cinecittà.
Only those who choose outside districts can save money: 300 Euros for a sleeping area and 450 Euros for a single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and similar quarters.
In Naples you will need 300-450 euros for a sleeping area, for a room the price is between 400 and 600 euros in the most expensive districts, the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari a sleeping area costs 250-350 euros, a single room at least 350.
In the smallest cities, prices are lower, but they have a higher weight in the urban economy.
In the cities where the phenomenon of renting to non-European students is more common, such as Perugia, there is even another anomaly: a rental that is 25-30% above the average is required by foreign students.
Goodbye to the old cinema Paradiso – the cities close their historic cinema halls
The historical cinemas close due to the favored multiplex cinemas.
"A city without cinemas is a blind city, like a face without eyes."
This picture by director Giuseppe Tornatore describes with effect what is happening at the moment in the large urban centres of Italy, and also in the provinces.
The process of exclusion of the cinemas, which began with the birth of the large multi-room complexes in the periphery, means in the long term death for the one-room cinema in the centre. A process that not only seems inevitable and irrevocable, but also carries the trains of a cultural crime.
The most affected are historical places full of memories, "It is like losing a friend with whom one has travelled a piece of street full of emotions," says the director of the film "Nuovo Cinema Paradiso", who brought him the Oskar and the great prize of Cannes 20 years ago. It is the story of a suburban cinema and its nostalgia, which consists of living in a well-forgotten cinema world.
The figures provided by the Anec, the central trade association, speak a clear language: in the last five years the vast amount of 316 traditional cinemas have had to close; these coins mostly paid the cinemas in the big cities: 10 in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
Among the most affected regions are the Emilia Romagna with 82 lost cinemas, followed by Tuscany with 44 and Lombardy with 41.
This testifies to the fact that the main culprits are the multiplex cinemas, because it is precisely these three regions in which the largest number of these modern cinemas has been registered: with 195 in the last 5 years Lombardy has led the lists, 81 are both in Tuscany and in Emilia Romagna.
"The business has developed in an irrational way," said Paolo Protti, president of Anec, "it is useful that new structures also arise, but first and foremost the maintenance of the already existing one, because closing a hall in the city, not all its regular customers are willing to visit instead of the old one a multiplex cinema in the periphery.
And here remains the missing budget for the fund of the trade association outside of consideration: the debt burden recorded by the state amounts to approximately EUR 10 million.
It is a disgrace from the ethical and moral point of view that the government does not respect the existing laws.
In order to preserve the sector, between 16 and 18 million euros would be needed in the year".
Interesting is the case of Bologna, the first Italian city, which, because of the fears about the old cinema halls, has decided to protect it through an agreement between the municipality and the Anec; it is the first agreement of this kind in Italy, which aims to protect and support traditional cinemas, both in the historical centre and in the periphery.
The measures envisaged include tax advantages for cinema operators as well as benefits for the public in terms of local transport: it will be possible to drive into the traffic-limited areas of the centre and also to park at cheaper parking rates.
"It is a pleasant initiative," said Giuseppe Tornatore, "I hope that other cities will join our example and also design new concepts.
But we certainly also need a better audio and video equipment to be able to align something against the superpower of the multiplex rooms, because finally the audience of today is more demanding.
The defence of traditional cinema has always been an important topic for me: the closure of Baghiera's "Supercinema", the place of my childhood and youth, was the crucial point that led me to start the "Nuovo cinema Paradiso", even though I had been playing with the idea for 10 years.
For 25 years I have been living in Rome; when I pass the Rialto or the Quirinale in the Via Nazionale, where I have experienced so many different emotions, I turn to the side to avoid seeing the dust-covered posters.
The links between politics and 'Ndrangheta lead to the arrest of the mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to adapt the decisions of the municipality to the interests of the mafia group Piromalli.
The accusations by the Anti-Mafia authorities of Calabria against Mayor Giorgio Dal Torrione and his deputy Rosario Schiavone of the municipality of Gioia Tauro, who were arrested this morning for involvement in Mafia business, are serious.
Gioacchino Piromalli, the older mediator between the clan and the public administration, and his nephew: the lawyer who bears the same name as the boss of the clan, had already been convicted of involvement in criminal associations of the mafia, at that time for a sum of 10 million euros.
"Despite any kind of moral and legal norm," the lawyers wrote, "the two local authorities had decided to pay the lawyer Piromalli money for consulting activities."
"This made it possible for the Mafia Group – the judges – to enter the town halls on an official basis and to take part in public administration policy."
The president of the Calabria Regional Committee, Agazio Loiero, does not deny that in his region "it is all but an exception to encounter links between local administrations and organised crime." "There are places where the concentration of the mafia is greater than in others in which such connections are practically unavoidable.
But there are also local politicians who resist the pressure of the 'Ndrangheta: heroes who get a white vest."
The arrests of this morning follow those of last July, with which, according to the police, the Clan Piromalli was beheaded.
Since the end of last April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved, but already in 1991 – and also at that time because of alleged links between organized crime and local administration – local politicians had been removed from their municipal offices.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, then mayor of the Udc, was elected head of the Middle Right Coalition after the May 2006 election.
He shouted scandal when the prefecture ordered the dissolution of the council.
He was interested in this in the Deputy Minister, Marco Minniti, who accused him of inventing everything for political and strategic reasons. However, in connection with this morning’s arrest warrant, the judges stated that the Piromalli clan had even dared to request a change to the A3 project.
From a hearing in connection with the investigations on the Dal Torrione case, the willingness to meet the wishes of an entrepreneur, who is known to be a representative of the large group around the Piromalli – making public administration actions identical to the interests of this clan."
When the energy comes out of the waves, the great ones suddenly run up
It is a non-degrading source of money that covers over 70% of the surface of the planet and only now does this seem to understand the great energy companies of the world.
Waves, currents and tides are the new renewable energy sources that are now looking for and also seeking to occupy, such as giants as Chevron.
The possibility of extracting energy from the movements of the sea has been considered and investigated for 70 years; these studies have not been considerably intensified since the first oil crisis.
When the price of oil broke down around 1980, the idea of marine energy was forgotten, but now the environmental organizations and the increased oil price are pushing for new impetus in this sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimates that 15% of global energy needs could be met by ocean waves.
This would be equal to twice the energy currently produced by nuclear power plants.
There are also currents and tides.
Giants in the attack.
The first company that now relies on marine energy is Enersis, which signed a contract for the construction of a power plant in northern Portugal in 2005.
When this news was published, it seemed to be a revolutionary step.
Two years later, more and more companies from the traditional energy industry are focusing on marine energy production.
"Chevron investigates these technologies" – according to the speaker of a company known to the U.S. giant in the Wall Street Journal – and considers the possibility of working with us."
It is a question of obtaining approval from the American Energy Commission, which is necessary to launch a project off Alaska's coast.
This is not an underestimated sign, especially when we consider that oil is still being promoted by the United States in Alaska, and President Bush just launched the plans for new drilling.
In addition to Chevron, the companies Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey are also investing in the new industry; if the details are not known, observers are talking about an increasing interest.
Even better technologies.
Experts are talking about a technology that is still emerging, not least because the last doubts have not yet been clarified by the environmentalists.
So far, projects such as those in Portugal and Scotland are of a rather small dimension and do not seem to cause any serious ecological problems.
However, in order to produce energy on a large scale, technologies with much greater environmental impact are needed.
There are various possibilities: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of interconnected buoys.
The thrust of the waves, which move the buoys up and down, is converted into hydraulic pressure within the float via pistons and cylinders.
This one drives a turbine, which in turn runs a generator.
The current is then sent via underwater pipelines to the coast.
Until now, there are four planned installations of this kind, which are only waiting for the state approval. Part of the energy generated could also be used for military facilities.
However, Verdant Power is already producing energy for a department store and a parking lot using underwater turbines in the East River of New York.
The water movements during the tides drive the turbines, which feed the generator through the resulting rotational movement.
According to Verdant, a long queue of potential clients is already waiting for the necessary authorizations to use these energy sources.
First the waves, then the tides.
According to the Institute for Electricity Research, a particular interest deserves the potential that is present in the tides.
Although it is also an irregular phenomenon, the tides are more predictable than wind currents, solar radiation and also the waves, and therefore a more reliable source of power.
Especially tidal energy is what led states like New York, Maine and Alaska as well as other coastal states to invest $7.5 million in 2008 – up to 35 million are planned for 2009.
