Welsh MEPs do not want to appear as ‘muppets’
Members of the Welsh National Assembly, now known as AM (Assembly Members), are not entirely satisfied with the proposal that their title may be changed to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The proposal comes as a result of the plans to change the name of the National Assembly of the Welsh Parliament.
Representatives from all over the political spectrum fear that this could lead to ridicule.
A representative from the Labour Workers' Party explained his group was concerned because ‘it rhymes on Twp and Pwp.’
For non-Wales readers: in Welsh, twp means "dustede", and pwp means "bush".
A representative of the Wales Party Plaid Cymru said that the group as a whole was ‘dissatisfied’ and that they have proposed alternatives.
A representative of the Welsh part of the conservative party said that his group was ‘open’ to the change of name, but noted that the pronunciation of MWP is very close to the word ‘muppet’, which, in addition to being the name of some known dolls, is also a British Snake word for ‘dust’.
In this context, the Welsh letter W is pronounced in a similar way as the letter U is pronounced in the English Yorkshire dialect, more like an 'uh' sound.
Assembly Commission, which is currently developing laws to introduce the change of name, said: ‘Of course, it is the members themselves who have the last right of destination with regard to the name with which they are to be mentioned.’
The Government of Wales Act 2017 authorised the Welsh National Assembly to change its own name.
In June the Commission published the results of a public consultation which showed general support for the re-opening of the National Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
As regards the title of the representatives, the Commission supported the WMPs (Welsh Parliament Members), but the MWP option received the most support during the public consultation.
While the representatives may propose other alternatives, getting all parties to reach an agreement could lead to a break in the head of President Elin Jones, who is scheduled to deliver a draft legislation for the change of name over the next few weeks.
The reform legislation will include other changes in the functioning of the national Parliament, including rules on disqualification of representatives and the design of the committee system.
Representatives have the final vote on what they should be called when they debate the law.
Macedonians go to the polling stations to decide whether to change the country's name
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia may vote on whether the name of their country should be changed to ‘North Macedonia’.
The referendum is held in an attempt to resolve a multi-year dispute with the neighbouring country of Greece, which also has a region called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour constitutes a claim on their territory and has repeatedly opposed its applications for membership of the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the referendum for the change of name, has said that he will ignore the vote.
The supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that the change of name is simply the price they have to pay to participate in the EU and NATO.
The bells in St. Martin's stills – the warriors in Harlem are struggling
"The old ones I talked to have told me that in the past there was a bar and a church on every corner," says Adams.
‘Now there are none of the parts.’
He said the bar's resignation was understandable.
‘People associate socially with each other in other ways’ nowadays, he says.
‘Bars are no longer the meeting places of the local environment, all of which visit regularly.’
As far as the churches are concerned, he fears that the money from selling assets will not last as long as the leaders think. “And sooner or later they are back at the beginning.”
The churches, he adds, can be replaced by apartment buildings full of the kind of people who won't help the neighborhood's remaining refuges.
"The vast majority of those who buy apartments in these buildings will be white," he says, "and will therefore only speed up the day when these churches have to close the doors for good, because it is unlikely that most of these people who move into these apartments will become members of these churches."
Both were built by white churches before Harlem became a black metropolis – Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin's a decade later.
The original White Methodism Society moved out in the 1930s.
A black community that had held close by took over the building.
St. Martin's got a black community under priest John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of traders on 125th Street -- one of Harlem's main deputies -- because they failed to hire or promote black workers.
A fire in 1939 caused great damage to the building, and when Father Johnson's parishioner made plans for the reconstruction, they bought a carillon.
Prest David Johnson, father Johnson's son and successor to St. Martin's, proudly declared that the carillon was "the church bells of the poor people".
The expert who played the carillon in July called it something else: ‘a cultural tax’ and ‘an irreplaceable historical instrument’.
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan also noticed that it was the first carillon in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who went on to the largest carillon at the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Merriweather, St. Martin's never replaced him.
What has taken place at St. Martin's in the last few months is a complicated interaction between architects and entrepreneurs, some of whom have been led by church laymen and others by the bishophood.
The Church Council – the leadership of the Church, consisting of laymen – wrote to the Bishops' Court in July about its concern that the bishops' judgment would ‘try to impose the costs’ on the Church Council, despite the fact that the Church Council had not been involved in the initiation of the architects or contractors sent by the Episcopal Court.
Some parishioners complained of a lack of transparency on the part of the bishop.
Sharks hurt thirteen-year-old lobster divers in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy when he dived for lobster in California on Saturday, the first day of the lobster season, according to the authorities.
The attack took place just before 7:00 near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told the KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had dived with friends in about half an hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy cry for help, and that he and a group of others swam across to drag the boy out of the water.
According to Hammel he at first thought that the boy cried out with enthusiasm over having caught a lobster, but he finally realized that the boy cried out 'I was bitten!
I was bitten!'"
His whole collarbone was torn up,” says Hammel, who discovered the damage when he reached the boy.
"I cried out that everyone had to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'" added Hammel.
The boy was transported by air ambulance to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is still in critical condition.
The type of shark that carried out the attack is unknown.
Captain Larry Giles said at a press conference that a shark was seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was found that it was not a dangerous shark.
Giles also said that the victim suffered serious damage in the upper torso.
The authorities closed shore access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security purposes.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most are not employed as dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to do its part in the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's challenger Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams with department store-like make-up and beauty shelves, staffed by specially trained staff.
The expanded shelves are being tested in 11 shops around the country as part of a strong intake in the UK’s 2.8 million beauty care market, which is experiencing steady growth while sales figures for clothing and home articles fall.
The investment in beauty care is a result of the supermarket’s attempt to find a new use of the space previously used for TVs, microwaves and home articles.
Sainsbury's has said that they should double the number of beauty products they offer to 3000 products, including brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, which the store chain has never sold before.
Existing product range from L'Oreal, Maybelline, and Burt's Bees will also be given better space in noted brand areas, in the same way as in shops like Boots.
The supermarket chain also relaunches its boutique make-up brand with mainly vegan products, as this demand is growing among younger customers.
In addition, the perfume dealer The Fragrance Shop is to test out sales tables in two Sainsbury's shops.
Online commerce and a new tendency to buy small quantities of food daily from local grocery stores mean that supermarkets need to do more to tempt customers to come.
Mike Coupe, Managing Director of Sainsbury's, has said that the sales are going to look more and more like a warehouse, as the supermarket takes up the fight against the cheap shops Aldi and Lidl with more services and goods outside of food.
Sainsbury's has placed Argos sales in hundreds of stores, and has also introduced a number of Habitat sales after buying both chains two years ago.
The last attempt by the supermarket to upgrade the beauty and pharmacy departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested cooperation with Boots in the early 2000s, but the cooperation was terminated after a dispute concerning the distribution of the income from the pharmacies in the supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its 281 store cookies to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy pharmacy chain, GBP 125 million three years ago.
According to them, Lloyds will participate in the plan, by adding a selection of luxury care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's Trade Director, said, "We have transformed the look and design of the beauty shelves to create more welcoming surroundings for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained staff who are so ready to give advice and help.
Our brand selection is designed to meet all needs, and the inviting surroundings and practical locations make us now a beauty contestant representing a new business experience.’
Peter Jones is “rapid” after Holly Willoughby withdraws from an agreement worth GBP 11 million
Dragons' Den Star Peter Jones is supposed to be furious after the TV host Holly Willoughby withdrew from an 11 million contract with his life-style brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their home and accessories tag, True.
Their company was previously compared with Gwyneth Paltrows' brand, Goop.
Willoughby (37) who is programme manager in This Morning, announced on Instagram that she is leaving the company.
Holly Willoughby has made Dragons' Den Star Peter Jones furious by withdrawing from their profitable life-style brand for the last second to focus on their own new gold-edge contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say that Jones was “rapid” at a fancy meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire.
The company has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrows’ brand, Goop, and it was expected that it would double Willoughby’s estimated GBP 11 million worth.
While Willoughby (37) announced on Instagram that she was going to leave True, Jones left the United Kingdom on her way to one of her holiday homes.
One source said, "Truly was undoubtedly Holly's first priority.
It was a long-term investment that would give her financial security over the next decades.
Everyone is completely shocked that she has chosen to retire.
No one could believe it when it happened last Tuesday – it was just before the launch.
Now there is a warehouse full of goods at Marlow headquarters that is now ready for sale."
Experts believe that this morning programme manager, which is among the most popular stars in the United Kingdom, can cost the company several million pounds due to large investment in products such as cushions and lights, fashion and cosmopolitan clothing, as well as a potential delay in launch.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends of Jones and his wife Tara Capp for the past ten years.
Willoughby created True with Capp in 2016, and Jones (52) became Chairman of the Board in March.
The two couples go on vacation together, and Jones has a 40% holding in Baldwin’s TV production company.
Willoughby shall become the brand ambassador for M&S and shall replace Ant McPartlin hosting the I'm A Celebrity ITV programme.
A source close to Jones said yesterday, "We won't comment on his business affairs."
Checkmates «and then we fell in love»
He knew about the criticism he would receive from the news media for having made a comment some would consider as ‘a little presidential’ and to be so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given away so much?
said Trump in his imitation of a news anchor.
‘I have not given anything away.’
He noticed that Kim was interested in a new meeting, after even declaring that their first meeting in Singapore in June was a big shit on the road to nuclear disarmament in North Korea.
But the negotiations on nuclear disarmament have stopped.
More than three months after the summit in Singapore in June, North Korea’s top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea has not seen a ‘correspondent response’ from the United States to its early disarmament measures.
He noted that instead the United States still has sanctions that aim to keep the pressure up.
Trump had a much more positive attitude when he spoke for a gathering of his electors.
"We're doing very well with North Korea," he said.
"We were going to war with North Korea.
Many millions of people would be killed.
Now we have a very good relationship."
He said that his work to improve the relationship with Kim has given positive results, such as putting an end to rockets, helping to get hostages released, and getting the lives of American officials sent home.
And he defended his unusual approach by talking about the relationship with Kim.
"It's easy to act with presidential dignity, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this step-by-step arena, we'd have about 200 people standing right here," said Trump pointing in the area right in front of us.
Tsunami and earthquakes in Indonesia are raging an island and killing hundreds of people
In the wake of the Lombok earthquake, foreign NPISHs were told that their help was not needed.
Despite the fact that more than 10 % of Lombok’s residents had lost their homes, a national disaster was not declared, which is a requirement for international assistance to be submitted.
‘Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it quite clear that they are not asking for international help, so it is quite challenging,’ Sumbung explained.
The children are now putting together a team to travel to Palu, but are not yet sure if foreign employees will be allowed to work in the country.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson of the National Emergency Management Team, said that Indonesian authorities are assessing the situation in Palu to see if international organisations should be allowed to contribute to the relief work.
Given the constant earthquakes in Indonesia, the country is terribly badly prepared to deal with nature’s anger.
Lights to protect against tsunami are built in Aceh, but they are not a common sight along other coastlines.
The apparent lack of a warning siren on Palu, although an alert had been sent out, has probably contributed to the death tolls.
Even under the best circumstances, it is a challenge to travel between the many islands of Indonesia.
Natural disasters make logistics even more challenging.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is headed for Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the scene of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo made an upgrade of Indonesia's ready-to-fall infrastructure a major feature of his election campaign, and has spent a lot of money on the road and the railway.
But lack of money has been a major problem for Joko's administration, which is to be re-elected next year.
President Joko is also under pressure from sustained sectarian tension in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have moved to a more conservative form of Islam.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands had to flee their homes when Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets with machetes, arrows, and bows and other primitive weapons.
See: Liverpools Daniel Sturridge with late compensation in the fight against Chelse
Daniel Sturridge rescued Liverpool from the Premier League defeat against Chelsea on Saturday by cutting for 89 minutes in the Stanford Bridge fight in London.
Sturridge received a passport from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 meters from the Chelsea target while his team lay 1-0 behind.
He moved the ball to the left foot before he sent it towards the longest corner.
The attempt went high above the box as the ball sank toward the top right corner of the net.
The ball finally crossed a jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
"I just tried to get to that position and get the ball, and players like Shaq always send the ball forward as best it can do, so I just tried to give myself as much time as possible," said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
‘I saw Kante come and hit the ball once and didn’t think too much about it and just kick it further.’
Chelsea led by 1-0 at the break, after the Belgian star Eden Hazard scored a goal in 25 minutes.
The Blues attacker sent a passport with his heel back to Mateo Kovacic, before he changed direction near the midway and sprinted into Liverpool's runway.
Kovacic made a quick handover in the middle course.
He then fired a great breakthrough care that led Hazard into the box.
Hazard ran faster than the defense and drove the ball into the net in the longest corner with a left foot kick past Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool plays against Naples in the group game of the Champions League at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at Stadium San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea plays against Videoton in the European League in football for men in London at 3 p.m. on Thursday.
Tsunami mortality rates in Indonesia reach 832
The death tolls from Indonesia's earthquakes and tsunami have increased to 832, notified the country's crisis management unit early on Sunday.
It was reported that many were trapped in the ruins of buildings that collapsed after the earthquake with a strike of 7.5 that struck the country on Friday and caused waves of up to six meters, explained the county spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, was full of materials from wrecked buildings.
The police arrest a man (32) for killing after a woman gets stabbed to death.
A killing esperation is initiated after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old was found with stab wounds at 7:55 in Grayson Mews, John Street, a 32-year-old man is under arrest, suspected of being killed.
The police have asked people in the area who have seen or heard something about making contact.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan says, "We are at the very beginning of the investigation, but I want to ask everyone who was in the area around John Street in Birkenhead and then or heard something suspicious about contacting us.
We also ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have caught something on their car camera, to contact them – they may have information that is crucial to our investigation.”
A police spokesperson has confirmed that the deceased woman was permanently resident in Birkenhead, and that she was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who think they know the woman have arrived to ask questions about the place where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing, and the police have said that they are working to inform the victim's relatives.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to get into his apartment, but has been told that no one is allowed to go in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he discovered what had happened.
The residents are now told that it will take several hours for them to get back in.
A police officer was interrogated by telling a man that the whole area is now being treated as a scene.
A crying woman appeared at the scene.
She repeats “it’s so horrible” over and over again.
At 2 p.m., two police cars were behind the lockdown, while a third car was just outside.
A number of police officers were outside the lockdown and overseeing the apartment complex.
Persons who have information are asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111, by referring to ‘log 247’ from 30 September.
Parliament's statue of Cromwell is the last memorial that has been drawn into the controversy about «rewriting history»
The removal of the statue would be poetic justice for the Taliban-like destruction of many of England's cultural and religious treasures carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the history of the Comwell Society has described Jeremy Crick's publishing house as "stupid" and "an attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, director of the Cromwell Society, says: "It was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of statues that Oliver Cromwell's figure outside the Westminster Palace was also going to become a goal.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil War was neither ordered nor performed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be punished for the sins of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's fantastic presentation of Cromwell is a proof of the 1800s opinions and is part of the history of a man many still think worthy of being hailed.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: «Cromwell is made by many, perhaps more late in the 1800s than today, seen as the parliament's defender against outside pressure – in his time, of course, it was about the monarchy.
Whether this is an exact representation is still the subject of historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 1600s has shaped the later development of our nation, and Cromwell is a single recognizable figure that represents one side of that conflict.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and remembering."
Killer Pig Kills Chinese Farmers
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on the South West China market, according to local news reports.
The man, mentioned only by the surname ‘Yuan’, was found dead and covered with blood from a broken artery near a binge on the Liupanshui market in Guizhou Province, South China reported Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing to put vaccines on pigs on a farm on 30 May 2005 in the city of Xining, Qinghai province of China.
He had apparently traveled with his cousin from the neighbouring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The morning after the cousin found him dead, and discovered that the gate of a nearby pig path was open.
He said that inside the pighouse there was a big mess with blood on his mouth.
According to the report, a forensic investigation confirmed that the pig of 250 kg had killed the man.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and malted," explained the cousin, referred to by the surname Wu, in a quote to Guiyang Evening News.
Recording from the surveillance camera showed that Yuan entered the market at 4:40 on Thursday to feed their pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed Yuan did not belong to him or his cousin.
While the police collected evidence from the scene, one of the market leaders explained that the pig was locked in order to prevent it from attacking anyone else.
Yuan's family and the management of the market seem to be negotiating compensation for death.
Even if it happens to the ssource, it's not the first time it's been registered that a pig has attacked people.
In 2016, a pig attacked a married couple on a farm in Massachusetts, causing serious injuries to the man.
Ten years earlier, a Welsh farmer was pushed against a tractor and attacked by a 300-kg pig until the farmer's wife was able to chase the animal away.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba to CBC News explained that pigs are not aggressive to the common, but that the taste of blood can have a triggering effect.
‘They're just playing.
They like to bite, and they're very curious... they're not trying to hurt anyone.
All you have to do is show due respect.’
The rest of Hurricane Rosa will lead to heavy rain in South West America
As reported, Hurricane Rosa is weakened as it moves over the cooler sea on the north coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring her flooding on her way through North Mexico and South West America in the next few days.
Rosa had a wind strength of 135 km/h and was a hurricane of category 1 at 05.00 ET on Sunday, and was located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is expected that Rosa will move northwards on Sunday.
At the same time, a tree begins to form over the Pacific Ocean and moves east towards the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it will begin pushing tropical humidity northwards towards the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will cause up to 25 cm of precipitation in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the interaction between tropical humidity and the thread approaching will lead to widespread heavy rain in the south-west over the next few days.
Locally, 3 to 10 cm of rain will lead to dangerous floods, liquid rushes and rapid and possible landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity will result in precipitation rates of up to 5–7 cm per hour in some areas, in particular in the south of Nevada and Arizona.
As much as 5–10 cm of rain is expected in parts of the South West, especially over large parts of Arizona.
There are possibilities for flooding with rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the scattered tropical rain.
It is very unwise to move around in the desert on foot as long as there is a danger of tropical precipitation.
Heavy rains can cause river valleys to become broad - flowing rushing rivers, and thunders will lead to local gusts of wind that may contain dust and sand.
The approaching tangle will cause local heavy rain showers for parts of the coast along South California.
Total rainfalls above 1,3 cm are possible and this can lead to liquid rushes and rapids, as well as smooth roadways.
This will be the area's first rainfall.
Some scattered tropical rain showers will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday evening and early Monday morning, before the rain spreads later on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the corner states on Tuesday and last all Wednesday.
October can cause some intense temperature fluctuations throughout the United States as the Arctic gets colder but the tropics stay very warm.
Sometimes this leads to drastic temperature changes over shorter distances.
We'll see a clear example of strong temperature differences across Central America on Sunday.
There will be almost 11 degrees temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
During the next few days, sustained summer heat will try to build up and expand again.
Large parts of the central and eastern US are likely to have a warm start in October, with degrees high in the twentieths from Southern Plains to parts of north-east America.
New York City can reach 26.5 degrees on Tuesday -- this will be about 5.5 degrees higher than the average.
Our long-term climate report indicates that East America is most likely to have higher temperatures than usual throughout the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh hearing
More than 20 million viewers, divided into six TV networks, saw Thursday's gripping testimony from Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who has accused him of a sexual assault that must have taken place in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political feud continued, and broadcasters interrupted their usual broadcasts to announce Friday's great surprise in the last second, when it was found that the senator of Arizona, Jeff Flake, had arranged it so that the FBI would conduct a week-long investigation of the charges.
Ford told the senate court that she is 100 percent sure that a drunk Kavanaugh felt her and tried to take her clothes off at a high school party.
In a passionate testimony, Kavanaugh insisted that he is 100 percent certain that this did not happen.
The mission on Friday was probably seen by more than the 20.4 million Nielsen reported.
The company calculated average ratings for CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Seeing numbers were not immediately available to other networks that showed the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Furthermore, Nielsen usually has problems measuring office viewers.
To give some perspective, this audience is equivalent to the final game of the American football championship or the Oscar distribution.
Fox News Channel, whose opinionaries have supported Kavanaugh's appointment with great enthusiasm, led among the networks, with an average audience of 5.69 million for the full-day hearing, according to Nielsen.
ABC was number two with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CCNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
The interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the main character of Friday's drama.
The moderate Republican's office made a statement that he was going to vote in Kavanaugh's favor. On Friday morning he was filmed by CNN and CBS cameras trying to take the elevator to a meeting of the court committee while demonstrators shouted and shouted at him.
He stood with a lowered look for several minutes while he was peeled out, while the event was sent directly to CNN.
"I'm standing right here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the country our truth?"
He was told that "you have power when so many women are powerless".
Flake pointed out that his office had made an opinion, and said as the elevator doors closed he would have more to say about the matter at the committee hearing.
The cable and broadcasting networks covered all the consultation directly several hours later, when the court board was to vote on whether Kavanaugh’s nomination should be continued to the entire Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he was only willing to do this if the FBI investigated the charges against the candidate within the next week, as the democratic minority has urged.
Flake was partly convinced by conversations with his friend, the democratic senator Chris Coons.
Flake made his decision after talking to Coons and then several other senators.
Flake's choice had a big impact, when it was clear that the Republicans did not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without this investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation to investigate the charges against Kavanaugh.
Theresa May accuses the critics of ‘political games’ around Brexit
In an interview with The Sunday Times, British Prime Minister Theresa May accused her opponents of leaving the EU of ‘political games’ with the future of the United Kingdom and undermining the interests of the nation.
United Kingdom Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, printed side by side with her own on the front page of the paper, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson continued his attack on her so-called ‘Chequers’ plan for Brexit by saying that a proposal that the United Kingdom and the EU should obtain each other’s tariffs was ‘quite ridiculous’.
Wayde Sims Shooting: Police are arresting Dyteon Simpson, who is suspected of causing the LSU player's death
The police have apprehended a man who is suspected of shooting and killing Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player for Louisiana State University.
Dyteon Simpson (20) is arrested and targeted for deliberate killing, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities have released a video recording of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and according to the police, Sims lost his glasses during the Basque roof.
The police found the glasses at the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, according to CBS partner WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, the police said he admits to having shot and killed Wayde.
His deposit is set at USD 350,000, according to The Advocate.
The forensic surgeon in East Baton Rouge Parish published a preliminary report on Friday, where the cause of death is indicated as a head and neck gunshot wound.
The police thank Louisiana Stat Police for its working group on the collection of refugees, the state police laboratory, the Southern University police and the local population for contributing to the investigation that led to an apprehension.
LSU’s sports director Joe Alleva thanked the area’s police force for his ‘hard work and the pursuit of justice’.
Sims was 20 years old.
The 2 m tall forward player grew up in Baton Rouge, and his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 returns per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU's basketball coach Will Wade said that the team is "crashed" and "in shock" after Wayde's death.
"This is what we fear at all times," said Wade.
Volcano sprays ash over Mexico by
The ash spraying out of the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southernmost neighbourhoods of Mexico’s capital.
Centro Nacional de Prevención de Desastres, Mexico's Public Emergency Prevention Unit, warned the people of Mexico on Saturday that they had to stay away from the volcano after the activity increased in the crater and 183 emissions of gas and ash were recorded in one day.
The establishment monitored several cases of bulging and shaking.
Pictures on social media showed a thin layer of ash that covered windscreens on the cars in neighborhoods like Xochimilco in Mexico City.
Geophysicists have discovered increased activity from the volcano, which is 72 km southeast of the capital after a 7.1 earthquake in central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as ‘Don Goyo’, has been active since 1994.
Police in conflict with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday, after Protestants for independence had a clash with the police, while several thousand participated in competing demonstrators to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia’s polarising vote on detachment.
A group of masked separatists were held back by the rebel police, and bombarded them with eggs and powder paints, which caused dark dust clouds in the streets which are usually full of tourists.
Handeleng broke out later in the day, when the police used batons to limit fighting.
For several hours, independent demonstrators shouted ‘Never forget, never forgive’, face to face with Unionist demonstrators shouting ‘Long live Spain’.
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries they received during the protests, according to the local press.
The tension is still high in the liberation-oriented region one year after the referendum on 1 October, which was considered illegal by Madrid but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The vote showed an overwhelming majority for liberation, but it was a bad appearance because the vote was boicotted by most who opposed the liberation.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1000 people were injured in violent confrontations last year, after the police tried to stop the vote conducted at electoral stations across the region.
Release teams set up camp in the streets night to Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration was nevertheless held, but was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes (68), an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said that he no longer had hopes of Catalonia's ability to become independent.
"Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying out for joy in getting a voice, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite having achieved a narrow but decisive victory in regional elections last December, parties supporting Catalan independence have had problems holding up pressure this year, as many of their professed leaders have gone into exile or are in custody while awaiting legal proceedings for their role in organising the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who used his phone to film the protest to support the police, said that the conflict is aroused by politicians on both sides.
"The situation is getting more and more tense," he explained.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who has been in prison pending a trial since late last year, announced that he will be in the European Parliament for election next year.
‘The best thing I can do to condemn the repression and the regression of democratic values we have seen from the Spanish government is to stand for election as a candidate in the European elections,’ he said.
Londonderry: Arrested after a car was driven into a house wall
Three men of 33, 34 and 39 years were arrested after a car was driven several times into the wall of a house in Londonderry.
The event took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 7.30 BST.
Detective Bob Blemmings said the incident had caused damage to the gate and the building itself.
A crossbow may also have been fired at the car at some point.
Menga's attack leads to Livingston's 1-0 win against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured the victory
Revered Livinston astounded Rangers, who delivered Stevens Gerrard's second loss after 18 matches as manager of the Ibrox Club.
A good hit from Dolly Menga turned out to be crucial, and Gary Holt's side is now similar to Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's side has still not won the Premier League off track this season and is going to play against the leaders of Hearts, who are eight points ahead of them, next Sunday.
Before this, the Rangers will play home fight against Rapid Wien in the European League on Thursday.
Livingston, on his side, has remained undefeated through six battles in the division. Chief Holt has not yet lost a fight after he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses opportunities for his sluggish guests
Holt's team should have led long before they scored, as their direct procedure caused countless problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through but bombed on the goal, and Alan Lithgow could only send the kick forward after slipping in to meet Craig Halkett's header past the goal.
The hostship let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could make trouble for their guests at the death ball.
And that's how the decisive goal came about.
Rangers gave off a freepark and Livingston found an opening – Declan Gallagher and Robinson collaborated to give Menga a clear course, and he scored a goal from the middle of the box.
By this stage the Rangers had had the ball pretty much all the time, but the home team defense had proved to be impenetrable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly had little to worry about.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos performed a near-scoring that had to be saved by Kelly.
Scott Pittman was blocked by the feet of Rangers keeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgrow sent a Livingston Death Ball in a wide-ranging briefing.
Crossbreeds kept entering the Livingston Box and were still being rescued, while two penalty demands — once after Halkett's protest against the exchange of Glenn Middleton, and once by hand — were ignored.
Livingston ‘phenomenal’ analysis
BBC Scotland Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal performance and a phenomenal result for Livingston.
They were all amazing, and continue to exceed all expectations on the way up.
The game style and the crew have hardly changed since they got to the top again, but Holt is going to have a lot of credit for the way he has strengthened his making after his arrival.
He had many heroes.
Captain Halkett was amazing and coordinated an enormously well-organized defense, while Menga held Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on toe raise throughout the battle.
The Rangers, on the other hand, did not have my inspiration to part with.
Although they've sometimes been very good under Gerrard, they couldn't live up to this standard.
The last part of the game was labs – they only got into the home team half once – and it was a bit of a wake-up for Rangers, which is right in the middle of the table.
Erdogan receives a mixed reception in Cologne
Everything was just smiles and blue sky on Saturday, September 29, when the leaders of Turkey and Germany ate lunch together in Berlin.
It's the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve the relationship between the NATO allies.
Disputes have arisen over issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s entry into the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police gave security as the reason why a population of 25 000 was not allowed to gather in front of the mosque, but many followers met up nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of Protestants against Erdogan – many of them Kurds – also heard from him, criticizing both Erdogan's policy and the German government's decision to let him into the country.
The conflicting demonstrations reflect the split that follows a man who is hailed as a hero by some German Turks and hated as an autocrat by others.
Deptford collision: Cyclist killed in a car collision
A cyclist is killed in a collision like a passenger car in London.
The collision took place at the crossroads between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, which is a busy route in Deptford southeast of the city, about 10.15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and the cyclist was treated by an ambulance staff, but the man died on site.
The collision only takes place one month after a cyclist died in a car crash where the driver escaped from the scene of Children's Street, about a mile from Saturday's collision.
Metropolitan Police said the police are working to identify the man and alert the relatives.
Roadblocks and roundabouts are in place, and drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: six cops injured in riots
Six prison officers are injured in an incident in a high-security prison for men, according to the prison authorities.
Disgusting at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 09.30 BST on Sunday, and still in progress.
Specialised ‘Tornado’ officers have been picked up to deal with the incident, involving eight prisoners and limited to one wing.
The officers were treated for minor facial injuries on site.
A prison spokesperson said: ‘Specialised prison staff have been sent in to deal with an ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees have been treated for damage.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons – those responsible will be transferred to the police, and may have to spend even more time behind locks and punches.’
HMP Long Lartin houses more than 500 inmates, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison director received hospital treatment after being attacked by an inmate.
And last October, the rebel police were called in to deal with a serious incident in which the employees were attacked with billiard bullets.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with floods (may be beneficial for droughts)
It's the fountain of Arizona taken by a tropical low pressure, but it's probably going to happen early next week, as Hurricane Rosa's remaining force moves through the desert regions of the south-west and carries flood hazards.
National Weather Service has already issued flood notices for Monday and Tuesday for Western Arizona and into southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will move in a straight line through Phoenix on Tuesday, and that the rainstorm will start late Monday night.
National Weather Service in Phoenix has noted on Twitter that only «ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of tropical storm or low pressure within 320 km of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane until it was 65 km from the border with Arizona.»
The latest National Hurricane Center models predict 5–10 cm of precipitation, with up to 15 cm in some places in Mongol Rim in Arizona.
Other areas within the south-west desert, including the middle of the mountain chain Rocky Mountains and Great Basin, are likely to be between 2.5 and 5 cm, while up to 10 cm of precipitation is possible in some areas.
For those who are out of flood danger, Rosa can be a blessing, since the area suffers from drought.
Although floods are a serious problem, some of these precipitations are likely to be beneficial, as South West America is currently in a drought state.
According to the United States Drought Monitor, a little over 40 percent of Arizona experiences at least extreme drought, which is the second highest category,” according to weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa hits land on the Mexican peninsula of Baja California.
Rosa still has hurricane power on Sunday morning, with a maximum wind power of 137 km, located 620 km from Punta Eugenia in Mexico and moving 19 km/h.
The storm hits colder waters in the Pacific, losing power.
Therefore, it is expected to meet Mexico with tropical storm power Monday evening or afternoon.
Precipitation over parts of Mexico can be strong and cause great floods.
‘Total rainfall of 7.5–15 cm is expected from Baja California to north-western Sonora, with a rainfall of up to 25 cm’, according to weather.com.
Rosa will then move northward across Mexico as a tropical storm until it hits the border of Arizona at dawn on Tuesday morning as a tropical footprint, which this moves on through Arizona and into southern Utah by late Tuesday evening.
‘The main danger expected of Rosa or its remains is very severe rainfall in Baja California, north-west Sonora and the south-west desert in the United States’, according to the National Hurricane Center.
This precipitation is expected to produce life-threatening floods and liquid rushes and rapid desert and mountain terrain.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Attempts to Kill
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man are under arrest, suspected of attempted murder, after a 16-year-old was found stabbed in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area by Midsomer Norton around 4:00 BST on Sunday.
He was driven to the hospital, and his condition should be stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested during the night in the Radstock area, according to the Avon and Somerset police.
The police have asked anyone who could have a mobile recording of the event to make contact.
Trump says that Kavanaugh has “suffered under the petty and mind” of the democratic party
‘A vote to support Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the reckless and shocking tactics of the democratic party’, said Trump in front of a popular meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh has “suffered under the petty and mind” of the democratic party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh witnessed in front of the Congress on Thursday, and denied strongly and emotionally the charges of Christine Blasey Ford that he committed a sexual assault on her several decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testifies to his accusation during the hearing.
The president said on Saturday that "the American people saw how brilliant, capable and courageous" Kavanaugh was that day.
‘A vote to support Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to support one of the most powerful lawyers of our time, with spotless public service conduct,’ he told a meeting of his supporters in West Virginia.
The President referred discrepancy to Kavanaugh's nomination when he talked about how important it is for the Republicans to vote in the middle elections.
«We are five weeks away from one of the most important choices of our lifetime.
I'm not really a participant, but I'm a participant," he said.
‘That’s why I’m travelling around fighting for the best candidates.’
Trump claimed that the democrats aim to ‘resist and prevent’.
The Senate's first interim vote on the nomination of Kavanaugh is expected to take place by Friday at the latest, according to the assistant of a leader of the Republican Party to the CNN.
Hundreds killed by Indonesian landslides and tsunami, numbers expected to rise
At least 384 were killed and many were dragged out to sea by huge waves that thundered against the beaches when a great earthquake and a tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Slavesi, according to the authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered at a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday, when up to six meters high waves thundered ashore around the sunset, destroyed everything in their path and dragged many into drowning death.
The tsunami came into the heels of a 7.5-force earthquake.
‘When the tsunami father arose yesterday, people still engaged in beach activities, did not immediately escape and ended up as victims,’ said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia’s crisis management unit (BNBP) at a press conference in Jakarta.
‘The tsunami was not alone — it carried cars, wooden trunks and houses, it hit everything on land,’ Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had moved across the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before hitting the coastline.
Someone climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived."
Some 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Air photography published by the crisis management session showed many damaged buildings and shops, twisted and broken bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
Aftershock continued to shake the coastal town on Saturday.
The range of earthquakes could be felt by 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Technology Assessment and Use Unit (BPPT) stated in a statement that the power from Friday's enormous earthquake was about 200 times more than the power of the nuclear bomb that was released over Hiroshima during World War II.
The location of the city at the end of a long, narrow bay may have made the tsunami larger, according to the estate.
Nugroho described the damage as “comprehensive” and said that thousands of dwellings, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels have collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found trapped in the ruins of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the death tolls and injuries could be the shore of a larger country 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the heart of the earthquake.
The communication “was completely crippled, completely without information” from Donggala, according to Nugroho.
There are more than 300,000 people there,” said the Red Cross in a press release, adding that their staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
‘This is already a tragedy, but it can get a lot worse.’
On Saturday the department was strongly criticized for not informing that a tsunami had hit Palu, but the authorities said that the waves had taken place before the warning was issued.
In an amateur recording shared on social media you hear a man on the top floor of a building shouting desperate warnings that the tsunami is approaching passersby on the street below.
Within a few minutes a wall of water comes thundering toward the beach, and tears with it buildings and cars.
Reuters has not been able to authenticate the recordings immediately.
The earthquake and the tsunami caused a major power failure that has prevented communication around Palu and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate the rescue work.
The military has begun to send transport aircraft with the help of Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, but the evacuated still desperately need food and other necessities.
The city's airport is only open for relief work and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
Death rates after the tsunami in Indonesia are rising over 800.
It's so cruel.
World Vision's staff from Donggala have made it to the Palu Centre, where they have sought shelter under the tarpaulin at the courtyard in front of their office, but they passed major destruction on the road, according to Dosaba Sinay.
"They told me they saw hundreds of broken houses," he said.
It's so cruel.
As relief organisations began the gloomy preparations for providing emergency aid, some complained that foreign aid workers with a lot of expertise were refused to travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian legislation, money, supplies and workers from abroad cannot be released into a crisis area until it has been declared a national disaster area.
It hasn't yet happened.
‘It is still a provincial disaster’, said Aulia Arriani, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
'When the government says 'Ready, this is a national disaster', we can open up the borders of international aid, but the situation has not got any status yet.'
As the sun descends over Palu for the second time after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of those who are still missing hope that their loved ones will be among the miracle stories that brighten up the gloomy news image of tragic natural disasters.
On Saturday a little boy was fished out of a sewer.
On Sunday a woman was liberated by rescue teams after spending two days trapped under ruins with her mother's body beside her.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the National Paragliding Team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asians, who were conducted earlier this month in Indonesia.
Several of those caught in the ruins of the Roa Roa Hotel, including Petra Mandagi, were also his students.
"As a senior in paragliding, I have my own emotional should bear," he said.
Gendon said that in the hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel was spread in the paragliding environment, he sent desperate WhatsApp messages to the practitioners who attended the beach festival at Palu.
But the messages only led to grey pickles, rather than a pair of blue pickles.
“I think that means that the messages were not delivered,” he said.
Thieves steal USD 26 750 under mini bank restocking in Newport on the Levee
Friday morning, twenty USD 26 750 from a Brink's worker who filled a mini-bank in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver had emptied a mini bank in the entertainment complex and got ready to deliver more money, wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy in the press release.
While he was busy, there was another man who “rand up behind the Brink’s staff” and stole a bag of money that was to be delivered.
Witnesses saw several suspected escapes from the scene, according to the press release, but the police have not specified how many were involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about their identity must contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes his name to Ye
The rapper Kanye West changes his name – to Ye.
When he announced the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote, "The creation previously known as Kanye West."
West (41) has had the nickname Ye for a long time, and used the name as the title of his eighth album, which was launched in June.
The change comes before his performance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album, Yandhi.
He replaces the singer Ariana Grande on the program, after she canceled on an "emotional basis," according to the serial creator.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has said that the word has a religious meaning for him.
"I think 'ye' is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," said West earlier this year, when he discussed the album title with the radio host Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
It went from being Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye -- as a reflection of the good, the bad, the confused, everything.
The album is more a representation of who we are."
He's one of many famous rappers who's changed his name.
Sean Combs has been known as both Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who has previously collaborated with West, has also varied between the use of hyphens and capital letters.
Mexico’s AMLO swears not to use the military against civilians
Mexico's acceding president, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has sworn that he will never use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody represals against students.
Lopez Obrador promised at Tlatelolco Plaza on Saturday that he ‘never will ever use the military to oppress the Mexican people’.
Military troops shot at a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing as many as 300 people, at a time when leftist student movements were raging across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly grants to students and opening up several free public universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of education lead young people into criminal gangs.
The US should double financial support for artificial intelligence
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount they spend on research in this field, according to Kai Fu Lee, the investor and performer of artificial intelligence, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
His comments come after several departments of the U.S. government have made announcements about artificial intelligence, despite the fact that the U.S. generally does not have a formal strategy for artificial intelligence.
China, for its part, put in place a plan last year and aims to be number 1 in innovation for artificial intelligence by 2030.
‘A double research budget for artificial intelligence will be a good starting point since all other countries are so far behind the United States, and we are looking for the next major breakthrough,’ said Lee.
Double financial support can double the chances of the next major achievement in artificial intelligence coming from the United States,” Lee told me in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book «AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order» was published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt this month, is the director of the Innovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the leading companies for artificial intelligence in China, Face++.
In the 1980s he worked at Carnegie Mellon University to develop a system of artificial intelligence that beat the best Othello player in the United States, and later was a manager at Microsoft Research or Director of Google's Chinese Department.
Lee acknowledged the US government's former technology competitions, such as Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one would be held, to help find the next generation of wise heads.
Researchers in the United States often have to work very hard to receive government funds, according to Lee.
"It is not China that steals the academic leaders, it is the companies," said Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have employed wise university heads to work with artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee says that changes in immigration policy can also help the United States to strengthen its efforts in artificial intelligence.
‘I believe that those who have a doctorate in artificial intelligence should receive an offer of a residence permit automatically’, he said.
The China Council of State issued its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan for the Development of Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
China's National Natural Science Foundation finances people at academic institutions, in a similar way as the National Science Foundation and other government organisations distribute money to researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, according to Lee.
Earlier this year, the United States Defense Department established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which is to involve partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the creation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced an investment of USD 2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
As far as NSF is concerned, they are currently investing more than USD 100 million in research on artificial intelligence.
At the same time, the U.S. legislation aimed at establishing a national security commission on artificial intelligence has been stopped for several months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on whether to change the country's name
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change the country’s name to ‘North Macedonia’ to resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece, which has blocked their attempts to become an EU-NATO member.
Greece, which also has a province called Macedonia, considers that the name of the northern neighbour constitutes a claim on Greek territory and has vetoed including them in NATO and the EU.
The two governments concluded an agreement in June based on the proposed new hub, but nationalist opponents argue that the change will undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that he will not vote in the referendum, and a boycotting campaign has cast doubt on whether the attendance will meet the minimum requirement of 50 percent, which is mandatory for the vote to be valid.
The question on the ballot box is ‘Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership for the approval of the agreement with Greece’.
Those who support the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is worth paying this price for Macedonia, one country that emerged after the fall of Yugoslavia, to be able to join organisations such as the EU and NATO.
‘I came here today to vote for the country’s future, for the youth of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the EU’s protective umbrella, because it means a safer life for all of us’, said Olivera Georgijevska (79) in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, it is likely to be crucial because a high enough number of Members have said that they will comply with the outcome of the vote.
The change of name requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The state election commission has said that they had not received any irregular reports by 13.00.
However, the attendance was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the previous parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters gave their vote.
‘I came to vote because of my children — we belong in Europe’, said Gjose Tanevski (62), who voted in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonia's Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko vote in Strumica, Macedonia 30 September 2018. The referendum in Macedonia is about changing the country's name to open the doors so that they can become members of NATO and the EU.
Before the House in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov (54) prepared a small stage and brought out chairs in front of tents set up by those who are to boycott the vote.
‘We are positive to NATO and the EU, but we will be reported with a raised head, not let in backwards’, says Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they do not accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to countries like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will lead badly needed investment to Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
‘I think most people will be in favour, because more than 80 of our citizens want us to join the EU and NATO’, says Zaev after voting.
He says that a 'yes' answer will be a 'confirmation of our future'.
According to a survey published last Monday by the Macedonia Institute for Political Research, between 30 and 43% of the voting rights will participate in the referendum — this is lower than the required attendance.
Another survey, conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV, showed that 57 percent of respondents have plans to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said they were going to vote yes.
For the referendum to be valid, the attendance must be 50 percent plus one vote.
If the referendum fails, it will constitute the first serious political obstacle faced by the pro-Western government since it took over last May.
See: Manchester Cities Sergio Aguero maneuvers past the entire Brighton defense to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling shattered the Brighton defense in Manchester City's 2–0 victory on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy when he scored a goal for 65 minutes.
The Argentine Attack Player received a match at the start of the sequence.
He raced around with three Brighton defenders before he got out on the open track.
Then Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He got around one defenseman before he ran from several on the edge of the Brighton box.
Then he sent a passport to the left that reached Sterling.
The English attacker used his first contact in the box to send the ball back to Aguero, who used right-hand shoes to beat Brighton's keeper Matthew Ryan with a shot into the right-hand side of the net.
‘Aguero is still struggling with some foot problems’, the city manager Pep Guardiola told the press.
“We talked about that he was going to play 55–60 minutes.
That's what happened.
It was lucky that he scored a goal right then."
But it was Sterling who gave Sky Blues the original advantage in the Premier League game.
This target came in 29 minutes.
Aguero received the ball deposited in Brighton's territory.
He sent a beautiful breakthrough care along the left flank to Leory Sane.
Sane had a few touches before he led Sterling towards the longest corner.
The Sky Blues attacker sent the ball into the net just before it was over the deadline.
City plays against Hoffenheim in the Champions League group game at 12:55 on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer will be the spoiler for Rockies
Nationals are no longer candidates for playoffs, and have no reason to bet heavily.
The ever-equal competitive Scherzer hopes, however, to stand on the track on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if it can affect the playoffs of the Colorado team, who leads the Los Angeles Dodgers with one fight in NL West.
Rockies got a wild card slot with a 5–2 win over Nationals Friday night, but is still looking to secure their first division title.
Even if we don't have anything to gain, we can at least play with the knowledge that the mood here in Denver, with the audience and the other team, will be what's most likely to be the highest level of combat I'm going to play at this year.
Why wouldn't I participate in it?'
The Nationals have still not advertised their starting pitcher for Sunday, but should apparently be inclined to take Scherzer pitche in such a situation.
Sherzser, who in that case is starting the pitcher for the 34th time, had a bullpen session on Thursday, and will throw with normal rest on Sunday.
The right-handed Washington player has won this season 18 matches and lost 7, with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts of 220 2/3 rounds.
Trump People's Assembly in West Virginia
The President referred discrepancy to the situation of the Supreme Court-nominated Brett Kavanaugh as he talked about the importance of the Republicans voting at the inter-elections.
‘All we've done is at stake in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our lifetime.
This is one of the big, big... I'm not a participant, but I'm a participant, that's why I'm going around fighting for the best candidates,” he said.
Trump continued, "You see this cruel, cruel group of radical democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they're determined to take power back at all costs.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to get power and control, that's what they want, power and control, we won't give it to them."
The Democrats, he said, aim to ‘resist and prevent’.
"And you see it over the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "sinny and bad and ugly and dishonest."
He referred to the Senate's judicial committee and mentioned the democratic senator, Diane Feinstein, by name, on which the audience bowed loudly.
"Do you remember her answer?
Have you leaked the document?
Um, um, what.
No, um no, I'm waiting for you -- it was very bad body language -- the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer open to all.
They don't tolerate people saying their opinion.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, it was hardly a surprise.
After all, I am the last in a large number of Labour Members who have been told that we are not welcome, just because we say what we mean.
My colleague Joan Ryan received similar treatment because she was very critical of anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was to be censored because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of having responsible economic policies, on national security, on Europe — ironically, similar issues as those of Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
At the nottingham East Labour conference on Friday, it was stated that ‘we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive’.
In most of my eight years as the local Labour representative, the GC meetings on Friday nights have been just this.
Unfortunately, this is no longer the mood of many of the meetings, and the promise of ‘softer, friendlier’ policies is far too much forgotten if it ever started.
It is becoming increasingly clear that different opinions are not permitted in the working party, and all opinions are judged based on whether they are acceptable to party management.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the leader, when colleagues I previously thought I shared many political positions with suddenly beginning to expect me to take an U-turn and stand for opinions I had never previously agreed with, they concerned the security of the nation or the internal market of the European Union.
When I speak in public – and there's nothing to say – I receive a bunch of bad messages on social media that require me to be dismissed, condemns central politics and tells me that I shouldn't be in Labour.
And I'm not the only one who's experienced this.
I know I'm luckier than any of my colleagues, because the comments I receive are usually political.
I know how professional and targeted these colleagues are when they meet a sea that sexually discriminatory and racist comments every day, but never allow themselves to cow.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is the normalization of gross excretion.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the working party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The truth is that we are no longer such a party that is open to all, and every mistrust proposal and every change in electoral rules is narrowing the party.
I have received a lot of advice over the last two years in which I am encouraged to keep my head low and not raise my voice so much, because it will "do everything better".
But that's not why I got involved in politics.
Ever since I joined Labour 32 years ago as a school student, provoked by the neglect of the Thatcher government, which had led to my classroom at the public school I attended being literally ready to fall, I have fought for better public services for those who need them most, both as local councillor and government minister.
I have never hidden my political views, nor in previous elections.
No one in Nottingham East could in any way have misunderstood my political views or disagreements with the current leadership.
To those who tabled the proposal on Friday, I would just like to say that since the country is raging our way towards a Brexit that will harm individuals, businesses and public services, I cannot understand and understand the desire to waste time and force on my loyalty to the Labour leader.
But the message I really want to convey is not to Nottingham Momentum – it's for those I represent, whether they're Labour members or not: I'm proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of dismissal or political uncompromising will prevent me from doing what I think best serves their interests.

Ayr 38 – 17 Melrose: Unbesieged Ayr rises to the top
Two late attempts have changed the final result a little bit, but there was no doubt that Ayr deserved to win this amazingly entertaining Tennent's Premiership match.
They're now at the top of the table, and they're the only unconquered of the ten.
Finally, there was as much of their superior defense as their ability to take advantage of the opportunities they were given that led to the home team losing the victory, and coach Peter Murchie had good reason to be pleased.
"We have been challenged in our fights so far and are still uninjured, so I must be satisfied with that," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said, "All honor to Ayr, they were better at exploiting the possibilities than we were."
Grant Anderson's 14 minute trial, with a target park from Frazier Clima gave the Ayr management, but a yellow card to the Scottish landscape captain Rory Hughes, loaned from the Warriors, let Melrose level the position, and Jason Baggot did an effort without a target park.
Climo strengthened Ayr's leadership with a penalty court before he, just before the break, scored and goal set a solo attempt to change the position to 17–5 in the event of a break.
But Melrose started second half strongly, and Patrick Anderson's attempts, with target park from Baggot, reduced the distance to five points.
This became a longer stay in connection with a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was carried out on the stretcher, and from the reboot, Ayr's management increased even more swearing an experiment from Stafford McDowell, with a target park from Clima.
Ayr's working captain, Blain Macpherson, then got yellow card and Melrose took advantage of it to have an extra man on the track to the full with an attempt from Bruce Colvine without a target park, at the end of a period of high pressure.
The home team came back strong, however, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card to tackle Climo when he didn't have the ball, MacPherson performed a touchdown at the intrusion behind the advancing Ayr mill.
Climo performed a goal park, so he did again almost all the way from the reboot, after Kyle Rowe obtained David Armstrong's boxing park and sent flanks Gregor Henry awnings for the home team's fifth attempt.
Still Game Star is ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
It seems that the Still Game star Ford Kieran is on his way into the catering industry – he was recently discovered to be named as the director of a gifted restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC program for which he writes and plays along with his long-term comedy partner, Greg Hemfill.
The pigeon has announced that the next ninth season will be the last of the series, and it seems that KRun is now planning life after Craiglang.
According to public records, he is the director of the Akrifmorn Limited.
The actor would not comment on the matter, but a source from The Scottish Sun hinted that Krun wanted to engage in Glasgow’s ‘living restaurant industry’.
«The sea is ours»: Bolivia, a country without a coastline, hopes justice will open the way to the Pacific Ocean
The sailors are patrolling a rigged Marine headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings raise a sea blue flag.
Marine bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are decorated with the motto ‘We are entitled to the sea.
It is our duty to recover it.»
The whole of Bolivia's inland state has still recovered the coastline they lost to Chile during a bloody resource conflict in the 1800s, and the country is longing for once again to sail in the Pacific.
These hopes may be greater than they have been in decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling from the International Court on 1 October after five years of discussion.
‘Bolivia has a driving force, a Community spirit and calmness of mind and, of course, awaits the outcome with a positive attitude’, said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the ruling of the International Court of Justice on a large scale in many different places in the country, hoping that the Hague court will give its opinion in favour of Bolivia’s claim that Chile — after several decades of sporadic negotiations — is obliged to negotiate to give Bolivia its own way to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic indigenous president — facing a controversial re-election campaign next year — has also invested a lot in Monday’s feeling.
«We are very close to a return to the Pacific,» he promised late in August.
But some analysts believe that the court will hardly take Bolivia's party, and that very little would change if it had.
The UN agency, which is the team of the Netherlands, has no authority to allow them to give up Chilean land, and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
According to Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law, that the judgment of the International Court comes only six months after the last arguments were heard.
And rather than promoting Bolivia's case, the last four years may have actually made things worse.
‘The problem of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration’, said Zárate.
She believes that Morales' antagonistic rhetoric has wiped out any remaining goodwill on the part of Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations on one point or another, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss the matter afterwards.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia’s representative at The Hague, rejected the theory that the decision of the Court of Justice came unusually quickly.
According to him, Monday will give Bolivia ‘an exceptional opportunity to open up a new generation of relations with Chile’ and the opportunity to ‘stop 139 years of disagreement, for the benefit of both parties’.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales — still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America — had used the maritime situation as a political cover.
‘Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific’, he added.
‘The feeling is an opportunity to see what we have to do to overcome the past.’
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not happen unless they can trust the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country will never disarm its nuclear weapons if they can't trust US authorities.
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to keep promises they made during a meeting between the leaders of the two conflicting countries in Singapore.
These comments come at the same time as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems to be ready to launch the locked nuclear diplomacy, more than three months after the meeting in Singapore with North Korea Kim Jong Un.
Ri says that it is a ‘want dream’ that continued sanctions and American resistance to is a statement that will ever end the Korean war will force North Korea to kneel.
The US authorities are sceptical about accepting the declaration without Pyongyang first implementing significant disarmament measures.
Both Kim and Donald Trump, the president of the United States, want to have a second meeting.
But there is widespread doubt whether Pyongyang really plans to let go of an arsenal country probably looks at as the only security guarantee they have.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare another meeting between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris reveal the latest in huge headgear, which is heading towards a clothing store near you
If you want some big addition to the hat collection or hide completely from the sun, you don't have to look any more.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne deflected a selection of strange, overdimensioned headgear as part of their SS19 collection on the catwalk, which impressed the motel lions at the motel in Paris.
Very impractical hats have been popular on Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their eye-catching creations down the catwalk.
Valentino's most eye-catching garment was an exaggerated beige hat decorated with a spring-like wide broom that drowned the heads of the models.
Other oversized accessories included jewelled watermelons, a magic hat or even a pineapple, but they are not designed to keep their heads warm.
Thom Browne also deflected a selection of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had refurbished their lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than the last scream.
One created memory of diving equipment, including snorkels and scuba goggles, while another looked like a melted ice cream in biscuits.
And if you're looking for even more big fashion accessories, then you're lucky.
Style experts predict that the huge hats can be heading towards a clothing store near you.
The oversized hats come straight into the heels of the ‘La Bomba’, the straw hat with a half-meter wide broom that has been looked at all, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the very impractical hat that dominated social media has now sent another great creation down the catwalk – a beach bag in straw that is almost as large as the swimwear model that wears it.
The orange Raffiave, which is edged with raffia fringes and completed with a white leather handle, was the most striking creation in the Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at the Moteluka in Paris.
The celebrity stylist Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: “I expect to see big hats and beach bags in the clothing stores next summer – when the designer has had such a big impact it will be difficult to ignore the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills are essential for world citizens
The freshlands of Scotland are still exhibiting academic excellence, and this has continued in 2018 with another year of excellent exam results. These are supported by individual and joint successes in sports, art, music and other social activities.
These schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools, have more than 30,000 students across Scotland, and are working hard to deliver the very best school experience to both students and parents.
Free schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen careers and their position as world citizens.
As an educational institution that can design and implement a tailor-made school curriculum, we see that modern language is still a popular and sought-after elective subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to a man in a language he understands, when his head is spoken.
If you speak to him in his own language, the words of his heart reach out."
This is a strong reminder that we cannot just stick to English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From this year's exam results, we see that languages are at the top of the table with the highest percentages of survival from fresh oils.
A total of 68 per cent of students studying foreign languages received the exam character A.
The data obtained from the 74 member schools of the High School Council showed that 72 percent of students received the Mandarin A exam character, while 72 percent of those who studied German, 69 percent of those who studied French, and 63 percent of those who studied Spanish also received A.
This illustrates that in Scotland fresh schools support foreign languages as a crucial skill for children and young people will undoubtedly be needed in the future.
Language selection is now valued at the same level as real science, technology, engineering and mathematics on the curriculum for fresh schools and elsewhere.
A survey carried out by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 showed that for the reasons employers stated in order to have problems with filling a job vacancy, 17 percent could be attributed to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly important to clarify young people for a future career.
As more and more job opportunities require language skills, these skills become crucial in a globalised world.
If you have learned a second language, these lifelong skills will bring real benefits in the future, no matter which career you choose.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically give a multilingual person a competitive advantage.
According to a YouGov survey answered by more than 4000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation, and French was the only language a two-digit number of participants (15 percent) could speak.
This is why investment in language training is now crucial for today’s children.
Knowing more languages, especially those related to emerging economies, will give children better opportunities to find good jobs.
In Scotland, if each school teaches in different languages.
Many schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while others will teach in the languages that are considered the most valuable for the United Kingdom on the way to 2020, e.g. mandarin and Japanese.
Whatever interests your child, there will always be a selection of languages to choose from in fresh schools, with teachers who are experts in this area.
Scottish fresh schools aim to create a learning environment that will prepare the children and equip them with the knowledge and skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future brings.
It cannot be denied in today's global business environment that languages are still crucial for the country's future, and this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should in fact be considered as ‘international communication capability’.
Free schools will continue to offer this opportunity, diversity and distinction to young people in Scotland.
Il fout bien le faire.

LeBron will have his Lakers debut on Sunday in San Diego.
The waiting time is almost for fans who want to watch LeBron James play for Los Angeles Lakers for the first time.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the opening game of the Sunday preseason against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
How many minutes he's going to play is still not decided.
‘It will be more than one and less than 48’, said Walton on Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trundell wrote on Twitter that James is likely to play for a limited number of minutes.
After an exercise earlier this week, James was asked what plans he had for Lakers' six-game preseason plan.
"I don't need preseason games at this stage of my career," he said.
Trump People's Meeting Time in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President starts a number of polling sessions tonight Wheeling, West Virginia.
That's the first of Trump's five planned public meetings over the next week, including stops in cities where he has a lot of support, like Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that the confirmation vote for his chosen Supreme Court candidate has been put on hold, Trump aims to obtain support for the forthcoming inter-elections, since the Republicans are in danger of losing control of Congress when the voters go to the polls in November.
When is Trump's West Virginia People's Meeting tonight, and how can it be seen online?
Trump's people's meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled to start at 19.00 ET this evening, Saturday 29 September 2018.
You can see the Trump People's Meeting in West Virginia online via direct streaming on YouTube.
Trump is likely to discuss this week's hearings with the Supreme Court nominated Brett Kavanaugh, who is accused of sexual assault.
The main objective of all these people's meetings is to support Republicans facing a challenging election in November.
President Trump has therefore said that during the next few weeks, these five people's meetings aim to "encourage volunteers and supporters as the Republicans try to protect and extend the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
“Congress control is so crucial to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible while we are moving towards a busy campaign season,” Reuters was told by a campaign spokesperson for Trump who did not want to be named.
Tonight's public meeting, which is scheduled to take place at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, may attract support players from the "Ohio and Pennsylvania, and are covered by the Pittsburgh press", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time during the last month Trump has visited West Virginia, a state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia's Republican Senate candidate, Patrick Morrisey, who is behind polls.
“It’s a good sign for Morrisey that the president has come to try to give him a boost to polls,” said Simon Haeder, a political science expert at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team The United States shows fighting spirit to keep faith as they enter Sunday's single game
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday afternoon's foursomes may have been exactly what this year's Ryder Cup needed.
Momentum's swinging pendulum is a completely invented sport concept, but still something that players really believe in, especially in competitions like this.
And where do they think the momentum is now?
"They led by six points and now there are four, so we carry it with us as a little momentum," said Jordan Spieth when he left the track for the day.
Of course, Europe will have the advantage — they're leading by four points and there's 12 left to play for.
But as Spieth says, Americans feel that they've had some wind in the sails again, and they have good reason to feel inspired, especially by Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both have three points by four.
Spieth has delivered excellent games from tea to green, and leads by example.
The deep revelries became higher as his round continued, and sank to a decisive puttingting to raise the match to a draw when he and Thomas lay two below after two.
His putting, which won them the game of 15, was met with a similar scream -- by the sort that shows that he still doesn't believe that the American team is out of chance.
"We really just have to put all the cloths on and focus on our own match," said Spieth.
That's all of these players now have.
18 holes to make an impression.
The only players who have scored more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, who are undoubtedly Ryder Cup's great success story.
Europe's unusual but lovely couples have four out of four and don't put a foot wrong.
«Moliwood» was the only couple who avoided a bogey Saturday afternoon, and also avoided the bogey's Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and the last nine holes Friday morning.
These results and how their energy seems to float both to and from the lively crowd make it clear that they are Sunday's biggest competitors, and there are no other players in the audience either will see secure a European victory as the sun descends over the Le Golf National than Freetwood or Molinari.
Everyone prefers both at the same time, in each of their holes.
However, it is too early to declare Europe the winner.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson roamed lightly with Sergio Garcia, the fourballs hero of the morning, when he was a partner with Alex Noren.
After one bowey and two doubles in the course of the first nine holes, the Spanish and Swedish lay so far behind that they did not have the nubbeshan to take the lead again.
But on Sunday there is no help to get.
Fourballs and foursomes are very interesting to look at closely because of the interaction between the pairs, the advice they give each other, the advice they don't give, and how a strategy can turn in a moment.
Europe has played better as a team so far, and is far ahead of the last day, but this foursomes session also showed that the United States team has a single spirit of struggle, especially in the United States, has missed.
Europe leads 10–6 at the start of the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will have a strong lead at the start of Ryder Cups last day, after H has completed Sunday's fourballs and foursomes matches with 10–6 leaders against the United States.
The brilliant duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led with two victories against a broken Tiger Woods, and raised his score for the Le Golf National so far to four points.
Thomas Bjørn's European side, who fights to keep the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the unhappy side of America in tomorrow's fourballs and won the 3-1 series.
The U.S. gave more resistance in foursomes and won two games, but they didn't get any of the lead again.
Jim Fury's page has to score eight points from Sunday's 12 single games to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European smoker to score four points in a row, and he and Molinari – who together have been nicknamed "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend – are the only couple who have scored four points from their first four matches in Ryder Cups history.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in fourball, they collaborated seamlessly to break down Woods and the American rook Bryson Decambeau with even more repressive 5/4.
Woods, who limped through two games on Saturday, gleamed to the in between, but now lost 19 of his 29 games in fourballs and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who rested for the fourballs of the morning, returned to partner Henrik Stevensen in foursomes and won a 2 and 1 win against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, ranked number one and three worldwide.
But Europe didn't get everything they wanted on this warm day with a light breeze southwest of Paris.
Justin Thomas and Jordan Spieth, who have won majors three times, set the standard for Americans with two points on Saturday.
They got a hard-hitting 2 and 1 win over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Paulter in fourballs, and came back later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 and 3 in foursomes after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of Ryder Cups has a team managed to recover after a four-point lead at the start of the single game, but as current holders only need feary's side to reach a tie to keep the trophy.
But after being second best for two days, it does not seem that they will be able to deliver a counter-attack on Saturday.
North Korea will 'no way' on unilateral disarmament without trust
The Secretary of State of North Korea told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions strengthened the mistrust of the United States, and that the country will by no means agree to unilaterally release its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Organisation’s annual General Assembly that North Korea has carried out ‘significant goodwill measures’ during the last year, for example by stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test area and promising not to spread nuclear weapons and technology.
“However, we have not seen a corresponding response from the United States,” he said.
‘Without confidence in the United States, we have no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we will not unilaterally disarm ourselves first.’
Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints against Washington's resistance to a gradual nuclear disarmament, in which North Korea is rewarded for gradual disarmament steps, but his statement was significant because it did not reject unilateral nuclear disarmament completely, as Pyongyang has done before.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump issued in Singapore on 12 June, at the very first meeting of a United States President and a North Korean leader, where Kim promised to work against the ‘nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula’, while Trump guaranteed North Korea’s security.
North Korea has called for a formal end to the Korean war that was going on from 1950 to 53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first release its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed calls to reduce severe international sanctions against North Korea.
‘USA insists on ‘nuclear disarmament first’, and increases pressure through sanctions to achieve its objective by force, and even opposes the ‘declaration of the end of the war’’, according to Ri.
"The belief that sanctions can force us to kneel is a wishful dream for people who don't know anything about us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions create further mistrust.’
Ri did not mention the plans for a second match between Kim and Trump that the American leader underlined in front of the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the Minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and the South Korean leader Moon Jae in the last five months, adding: ‘If the other party to this disarmament case were South Korea, rather than the United States, the nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula would not have been as locked as it is.’
Nevertheless, the tone of Ris speech was very different from last year's when he told the UN General Assembly that an attack on mainland America with North Korea's missiles was inevitable after Mr. Evil President Trump called Kim a "missile man" on a suicide mission.
After threatening to ‘completely destroy’ North Korea last year, Trump stood this year in front of the UN and praised Kim to be brave enough to take disarmament steps, but said that much work remains, and the sanctions must remain in force until North Korea is nuclearly degraded.
On Wednesday, Trump saw that he didn't have a time frame for this, and said, "It doesn't matter if it takes two years, three years or five months."
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
But U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that “the sanctions of the Security Council still have to be enforced forcefully and without exception, until we have achieved complete, final and confirmed nuclear disarmament.”
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to strangle the funding of the Pyongyang nuclear and missile programme.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly, and then said that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a new summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said that they had made progress, but only hours after accusing North Korea him of having made “gangly demands”.
North Korea committed itself in a meeting with Moon this month to shut down a missile area as well as a nuclear facility if the United States took ‘similar measures’.
He said Kim had said that these «corresponding measures» he wanted, were security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and measures to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students take the course to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year will help students to get more sleep by tackling the growing unculture of pooping through the night with coffee drinks as fuel.
An academic found out that students at the world's best university often had no idea how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, Professor of Sleep Medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He started the course after he gave a lecture on the effect sleep deprivation has on learning.
"After the talk, a girl came to me and said, "Why hasn't anyone said this before?"
She said that no one had ever told her how important sleep was, and it surprised me," he said to The Telegraph.
The course, which starts this year, explains to the students the importance of good sleep habits in order to be able to perform academically and sportingly, and in the general state.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and adm. dir. for university health services, said that the university decided to start the course after they saw that the students were suffering from severe sleep deprivation.
The course, which lasts one hour, has a series of interactive tasks.
In one part, there is a picture of a room in a dorm, where students can click on coffee cups, curtains, jogging shoes and books and hear about the effects of caffeine and light and how sports performance is affected by sleep deprivation, and how important it is with a sleep routine.
In another part, participants learn how prolonged sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
A map of the campus with interactive icons makes participants think about their own daily routine.
«We are aware that this will not change the behaviour of students immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know about this, just as you have the right to know about the risk of smoking," said Professor Czeisler.
There's still some pride in being able to pry all night, he said, adding that modern technology and the growing pressure on the students led to an increasing problem of sleep deprivation.
Enough and good sleep should be the students' ‘secret weapons’ against stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said – even as a remedy for weight gain, as lack of sleep puts the brain in a state of hunger, leading to constant hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old from California studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler prepare the course.
He said that the course inspired him to work for a course that was available for the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all the master's students to take a similar study programme before they are enrolled in the university.
Professor Czeisler recommended that the students set an alarm for when to lie down as well as for when to get up, and that they should be aware of the harmful effects of blue light from electronic screens and LED lights.
Livingston 1–0 Rangers: Menga's target beats Gerrard's men
Rangers probably suffered a loss when Dolly Menga's target hit Steven Gerrard's teams 1–0 at Livingston.
The Ibrox side wanted to win its first win since February 4-1 at St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team caused Gerrard's second loss on 18 matches as manager and since then left his eight points from Ladbroke's Premiership leaders Hearts.
Menga beat up to seven minutes before the break, and the Rangers never managed to cancel out.
Rangers now fall into sixth place, while Livingston climbs up to third and is behind the Hibernian on target.
There may be more trouble in yeast for the Rangers after Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury after an object was thrown from the away public.
Gerrard made eight shifts on the team, like the sweep past Ayr and into the Betfred Cup semi-finals.
Holt, on the other hand, went for the same Livi 11 who took a point from Hearts last week, and he would have been pleased with how his well-trained team beat the opponents.
Rangers might have had the most possession of the ball, but Livingston did more with it while they had it.
They should have scored only two minutes into the game when Menga's first pass sent Scott Pittman through on Allan McGregor's goal, but the middle player played the chance.
A long freepark of Keaghan Jacobs found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner, Alan Lithgow, could only shoot at the goal pole.
Rangers took control, but it looked as if their game leaned more on hope than belief in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos thought he was going to have a penitentiary after 15 minutes when he and Steven Lawless collided, but Judge Steven Thomson rejected this.
Rangers only scored two goals in the first place, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly didn't get any problems with Lassana Coulibaly's header and a tame kick from Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi's opening for 34 minutes may have been against the game's passage, no one can deny that they deserved it for the struggle.
Again, Rangers were unable to handle a deep game from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his head cold when he chose Menga out for a simple conclusion.
Gerrard replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent during the break, and the game change gave immediate results when the winger sent to Morelos, but Kelly ran off his line to block.
But Livingston managed to get the away players to play exactly the kind of fight they like, as Lithgow and Halkett caught up long ball after long ball.
Holt's side could have stretched the leadership last round, but McGregor stood up against Jacobs before the Lithgow head off the corner.
Rangers' exchange Glenn Middleton probably had a late claim to a penalty park as he ended up in conflict with Jacobs, but again Thomson looked away.
Almanac: Inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from the Sunday Morning calendar: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, was the day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm «Hans» Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, a discovery that led to the apparatus we know today as the geiger counter.
The Geiger counter has been an important part of science since then, and has also become part of popular culture through the 1950 'Bells of Coronado' film, with scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: What in the world is it?
Rogers: «It's a geiger counter. It finds radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you can hear the effect of the atoms that the radioactivity of the minerals gives off."
Evans: Let's say it makes sound now!
His Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the invention he gave name to, lives on.
New cancer vaccines can teach the immune system to “see” cancer cells
New cancer vaccines can teach the immune system to “see” cancer cells and kill them
Vaccines teach the immune system to recognise cancer cells as part of the treatment
The method involves taking immune cells from a patient and changing them in a laboratory
The cells can now ‘see’ a protein that is common in many cancers and then re-injected in the patient
A vaccine during testing has had promising results among patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who received the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognise cancer cells, experienced that the ovarian rate she suffered disappeared for over 18 months.
The method involves taking immune cells from a patient, changing them in the laboratory so that they can ‘see’ a protein called HER2, which is typically too many cancers, and then these cells are injected into the patient again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said, "The results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 ‘is driving the growth of different cancers’, including breast cancer, ovarian refractory disease, lung cancer and colorectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar procedure, where immune cells were taken from the patient and ‘trained’ to target cancer cells, has been effective in treating a type of leukaemia.

Kanye West was built in a studio on Saturday Night Live after a resounding performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would stand for election in 2020.
After performing his third song for the evening, Ghost Town, wearing a Make America Great Again hat, he stretched out against the Democrats and repeated that he supported Trump.
"It happens so often that I talk to a white person, and then he says, "How do you like Trump, he's racist?"
If I was afraid of racism, I would have moved from the United States a long time ago," he said.
SNL started the show with a sketch with Matt Damon, where the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's explanation to the Senate Judicial Committee about the charges of sexual assault that Christine Blasey Ford presented.
Although it wasn't broadcast, the recording of West was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock wanted to ridicule West by publishing the recording.
West also complained to the audience that he heard it in the back room about the choice of headgear.
"They bullied me.
They said, "Don't go out there with that hat on."
They bullied me!
And then they said that I don't understand what the reality is," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see that I understand what the reality is?" he said, saying that he was going to "take on me the Supermann race, because then no one can tell me what to do.
Try love.’
His comments were made at least twice, and the employees who worked at the SNL looked disappointed, Variety, where a staff member said, "The whole studio was dead quiet."
West was brought in as the last little substitute for the singer Ariana Grande, when her girlfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West confused many when he performed the song "I Love It" dressed like a Perrier water bottle.
West received support from the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who wrote on Twitter: «To one of our bravest: TAKEN TO STAY THE IMO MASSES.»
But talkshowvert Karen Hunter tweeted that West is just «who he is and it is absolutely amazing».
‘But I choose not to reward anyone by buying his music or clothing or supporting his ‘art’, which I believe cultivates and spews out ideology that is harmful to society.
He's free.
We are too," she added.
Before the show, the rapper on Twitter announced that he had changed his name.
He is not the first artist to change his name and now follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Rapperkollega Snoop Dogg has had the name Snoop Lion. Then, of course, it's dead music legend Prince, who changed the name to a symbol and then the artist who was once known as Prince.
Target for stabbing killing in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been targeted for attempted murder after a man was stabbed at a restaurant east of Belfast on Friday.
The incident happened in Ballyhackamore, according to the police.
The sighted are expected to be presented to the Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The protection will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones Star Kit Harington Protrudes Towards Poisonous Masculinity
Kit Harington is known from the role of the swordswing Jon Snow in HBO's violent fantasy series added to the Middle Ages, Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor has gone out and criticized the stereotype of machoelt and says such roles in movies often make young men think they have to be tough to be respected.
In conversation with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that something has gone wrong and wondered how to tackle the problem of "toxic masculinity" in these #MeToo times.
Kit, who recently married Game of Thrones colleague Rose Leslie, also 31 years old, admitted that he was very busy with the theme.
‘It worries me a lot about the time — where did the masculinity go wrong?’ he said.
‘How have we raised men in view of the problems we are seeing now?’
Kit believes that TV can have part of the blame for the increase in “toxic masculinity” because of the strong masculine roles.
He continued, "What is innate and what is learned?
What's on TV and on the street, what makes young boys feel like they have to grow just this side of being a man?
I think it's one of the really big questions in our time -- how can we change that?
Because it is clear that something has gone wrong for young men."
In the interview he also admits that he will not do any forerunner or successor of the Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, and says he is ‘ready with battlefields and horses’.
From November, Kit will play the lead in a new recording by Sam Shepard True West.
The actor recently revealed that the best thing that came out of the Game of Thrones was that he met his wife Rose.
"I met my wife during the recordings, so that's how it came out pretty well – my future family and my life from now on," he said.
Rose played Ygrite, in whom Kit's role figure Jon Snow is in love, in the Emmy award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on Leslie's family property in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14 % increase in new cases
China has reported an increase of 14 % in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people have been hit in the country, says the health representative.
Around 40000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases have been transmitted through sex, marking a change from the previous one.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in certain parts of China through blood transfusions.
But the number of people who get HIV in this way is now close to zero, said Chinese health professionals at a conference in Yunnan Province.
Year after year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people.
HIV infection through sex is an acute problem in China’s LGBT environment.
Homosexuality was decriminalised in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be high.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry women.
Much of the disease infection is due to insufficient protection by sex in these conditions.
Since 2003, China’s authorities have promised universal access to HIV medicine as part of a response to the problem.
Maxine Waters rejects the inclusion of leaked data on Republican senators, sneezing of “hazardous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
A member of the House of Representatives, Maxine Waters, rejected the charges on Saturday that members of her staff had posted the personal data of three Republican senators on the Wikipedia pages of lawmakers.
The Los Angeles democracy, insured by the claims, was made by ultraconservative commentators and web pages.
‘Lies, lies and more reprehensible lies’, said Waters in a statement on Twitter.
The published information included alleged home addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, as well as Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared on the web Thursday, posted by an unknown person at Capitol Hill during a panel hearing in the Senate about the assault charges against the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
Leakage came a little after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites, such as Gateway Pondit and RedState, reported that the IP address of the source behind the post was traced to the Waters' office and revealed information about a member of the Waters' staff, according to Hill.
‘This unfounded charge is totally incorrect and a real lie’, continued Waters.
‘The members of my staff – who have been compromised by their identities, personal data and security due to these dishonest and false accusations – had absolutely no responsibility for the leakage of this information.
This unfounded accusation is completely incorrect and a real lie’.
Waters' statement was quickly criticized online, among other things by the former press secretary of the White House, Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is aggressive," wrote Fleischer.
“This suggests that she does not have the right temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they haven't done, they shouldn't be aggressive.
They can't go in defense.
They must not question the motives of the prosecutor.
They have to act calmly and calmly.
Fleischer compared Waters' reaction to the democrat criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of being too aggressive during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who works to remove Waters in the middle elections, also aired his thoughts on Twitter.
“Great – if that’s true,” he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said that her office had warned "the relevant authorities and the police about these false accusations."
‘We will ensure that the perpetrators are revealed,’ she continued, ‘and that they are held responsible for all acts that are destructive and dangerous for each of my staff’.
Review by Johnny Svenska Strikes Again – Anaemic Rowan Atkinson in spying parody
It has become a tradition now to look for Brexit references in all new films with a British sniper and it seems to be relevant for this revival of the parody franchise Johnny English action comedy – which started in 2003 with Johnny English and was revived in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will sarcastic self-satisfaction about how obviously hopeless we are to become the nation's new exporter?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English with his bulging eyes and his rubber face has been given a renewed license to turn it for the second time – his name says more than anything else that he is a clear and comical figure intended for territories with non-English-speaking cinematic views.
He is, of course, the foolish secret agent who, in spite of his bizarre James Bond ambitions, is a mix of Clouseau, a demon Mr. Bean and a portion of the guy who contributes one single note to the musical feature of the firecar theme during the opening ceremony at the Olympics in London in 2012.
He is also originally based on the role that Atkinson played in the farthest forgotten television ads for Barclaycard; the travelling and international mystery man who leaves chaos everywhere.
There's one and the other great moments in the latest Johnny English trip.
I loved how Johnny English approached a helicopter in medieval armor and the rotor blades cut his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy comes to terms, but the humor feels quite anorexic and strangely superfluous, especially now that the "serious" brands that 007 and Mission Impossible willingly away have features of comedy.
The humor seems to be more focused on children than on adults, and to me Johnny English's fathers are not as inventive and pointed as the silent film loops in Mr. Bean.
The current premise is that the United Kingdom is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated the United Kingdom's super-secret web network of spies and revealed the identity of all British agents in the field, to the dismay of the guarding agent — a regrettable little role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last drop of a prime minister, a pompous and depressed figure who's already going through a complete crisis of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing a very good job with this kind of Teresa-May role, but the script doesn't give her much to work with.
Her intelligence advisors inform us that since every active spy has been revealed, she has to pick up some of the retired.
And that means the clumsy Johnny English, who now works as a teacher at a snobbed establishment, but gives unofficial education in secret intelligence.
English is caught back to Whitehall for a quick orientation and reunited with his old, tormented helper Bough, played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, splintered with a submarine commander, a hysterical top-class lady role where Vicki Pepperdine is a little wasted.
So the Batman and the Robin style of messing up everything else on behalf of the Queen is back, where they confront Olga Kurylenko amazing five fatal, Ophelia Bulletova.
At the same time, the Prime Minister is seduced by the charismatic technology billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's cyber problems: the ludicrous Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their journey with far-reaching sidesteps: disguised as waiters, they put the guys at a magnificent French restaurant, they create chaos while they hide on board Volta's luxury yacht; and English triggers the pure anarchy when he tries to use a VR headset to get to know Volta's house.
All the stops are really pulled out before the last sequence, but even so lovable and noisy it's so much like children's television with the whole thing.
Quite mediocre, all of it.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I couldn't help but think: can the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role where he really gets his talent used?
Labour denies that they plan to let the British work four days a week, but get paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party will evaluate a radical plan that will give the British four-day working week – but will be paid for five.
It is apparent that business leaders will spend savings on the revolution with artificial intelligence by giving workers an additional day off.
This will result in a three-day holiday for employees, while at the same time they will receive the same salary.
Sources say that the idea fits into the party's economic agenda and plans to move the country in favour of workers.
Trade unions support the transition to a four-day week so that workers can also benefit from the benefits of the new economy.
A Labour Party senior source told The Sunday Times: ‘A political review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
‘This will not happen overnight, but four-day week is an ambition that fits the party’s desire to let the pendulum swing to the benefit of the workers – in addition to the overall industrial strategy of the party’.
Labour will not be the first to support such an idea. Green Party promised four-day week during the campaign before the 2017 parliamentary elections.
However, the idea is not supported by the entire Labour Party.
A Labour spokesman said, ‘A four-day week is not the party’s policy, and is not something that is judged by the party’.
Financial spokesman for Labour, John McDonnell, spent the Labour Conference last week deepening his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from ‘faceless directors’ and ‘profits’ of public service providers.
The plans of the shadow chancellor also mean that current shareholders in water companies are at risk of not getting the entire shareholding back because a Labour government can deduct from perceived injustice.
He also confirmed plans to place employees in the boards of directors and set up employee funds to transfer 10 % of the equity of private sector companies to the employees, which may receive an annual dividend of GBP 500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell "60 Minutes" if the FBI review of Kavanaugh can change their mind
The FBI review of the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has suspended a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least one week and raises the question as to whether the Agency's findings may cause some Republican senators to change their minds.
In an interview sent on Sunday, correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham in "60 Minutes" if the FBI could reveal something that would change their minds.
Kennedy was more open to it than the colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
‘I said at the beginning of the hearing that I had spoken with Judge Kavanaugh.
I contacted him after the charges came out and said, "Did you do that?"
He was fixed, he was non-slip, unambiguous».
However, Graham's voice seems to have been stoned.
"I've decided on Brett Kavanaugh, and in that case it had to be a remarkable finding," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett denied it energetically," added Graham and referred to Christine Blasey Ford.
«And none of them she mentioned could confirm it.
That was 36 years ago.
I don't think anything new will change that."
What is the Global Citizens Festival, and has it helped fight poverty?
This Saturday, New York is hosting the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that has an impressive list of stars to perform and an equally impressive mission to eradicate the world's poverty.
The Global Citizen Festival, which is now in its seventh year, will cause thousands of people to stream to the great central park, not only to experience the sizes of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real goal of the event to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizens Festival, launched in 2012, is a further development of the Global Poverty Project, an international action group that hopes to combat poverty by getting more people to work actively against poverty.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), participants had to perform a number of tasks, or ‘actions’, such as voluntary work, send an e-mail to a world leader, answer a telephone or in other meaningful ways to raise awareness of their goal of eradicating poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been when there are only 12 years left to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a genuine way to get people to fight for change, or just another case of so-called ‘clicktivism’ - that people feel they are making a big contribution by signing a signature campaign online or sending a tweet?
Global Citizen says that since 2011, they have registered more than 19 million ‘actions’ from their trailers, with a variety of objectives.
They say that these actions have helped to get world leaders to declare commitments and policies equivalent to more than 37 billion dollars that will improve the situation for more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group could refer to 390 exposures and announcements as a result of their actions, of which at least 10 billion dollars have already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that the secure funding has had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the main exposures are The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and entrepreneurs based in the United Kingdom to ‘help children exploit their full potential’ and promised to give Rwanda $35 million to help eradicate malnutrition in the country after receiving over 4700 tweets from Global Citizens.
‘With the support of the British government, donors, national authorities and Global Citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history’, said Ambassador of Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, to the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions in the United Kingdom to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutritional measures.
In response to one of the usual questions on the website, ‘what makes you think that we can eradicate extreme poverty?’
Global citizens replied: ‘It will be a long and difficult road — sometimes we will fall and fail.
But like the important civil rights and the anti-aparty movements before us, we will succeed because we stand together stronger.
Janet Jackson, from Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are some of the artists who perform at this year's event in New York, which will be led by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States may use the marine as a 'blocked' to prevent Russian energy exports - the Minister for the Interior
Washington may ‘if necessary’ resort to the navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching the markets, including in the Middle East, revealed U.S. Secretary of State Ryan Zinke, according to Washington Examiner.
Zinc claimed that Russia’s involvement in Syria — especially when it operates following the invitation of the legitimate government — is a pretext to explore new energy markets.
‘I think the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to negotiate energy just as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern flank of Europe’, he said.
And according to the spokesperson, there are always ways and means to deal with this.
‘The United States has the possibility through the sea to ensure that the sea routes are open and, if necessary, block to ensure that the energy does not reach the market’, he said.
Zinc spoke to the participants at the event held by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organisation that profiles itself as ‘the voice of energy consumers’ in the United States.
He compared Washington's ways of interacting with Russia and Iran, and noticed that they're far from equal.
‘The economic alternative to Iran and Russia is more or less to exploit and replace fuel’, he said, referring to Russia as ‘one trick pony’ with an economy dependent on fossil fuel.
The opinions came after the Trump administration had been on a round trip to strengthen the export of its liquid natural gas to Europe, and they want to replace Russia, the cheapest option for European consumers.
Employees of the Trump administration, including the president himself, therefore tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the ‘inappropriate’ project The Northern European Gas Pipe 2 which, according to Trump, made Berlin the ‘capture’ of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North European gas pipeline is worth $11 billion, which is to double the existing gas pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
Kremlin argues that Washington's fiery resistance to the project is motivated only for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
‘I think we share the view that energy cannot be a tool to exert pressure and that consumers should be able to choose a supplier’, said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after a meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position has met with opposition from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitments in the project.
Germany’s leading industrial organisation, BDI, has asked the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
‘I have major problems with third countries interfering in our energy supply’, said Dieter Kempf, head of the BDI after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren wants to “think seriously” his presidential candidate for 2020, says Senator from Massachusetts
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would "seriously think" of whether she would stand as a presidential candidate after the middle elections.
During a election meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would stop.
"It's time for women to get to Washington and fix the shaky government, and that includes a woman on top," she said, according to The Hill.
‘After November 6th, I will think seriously about whether to stand as a presidential candidate’.
Warren attacked President Donald Trump during the election meeting and said that he “led the country in the wrong direction”.
"I'm worried all the way to the margin of what Donald Trump is doing with democracy," she said.
Warren has been open in his criticism of Trump and his supreme candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course we need an FBI check before voting."
However, a poll published on Thursday shows that a majority of Warren’s own voters do not believe that she should resign in 2020.
58% of the ‘probable’ voters in Massachusetts said that the senator should not stop, according to an opinion poll by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
32% supported her candidacy.
The opinion poll showed higher support for former Governor Deval Patrick, and 38% supported a possible candidacy and 48% opposed it.
Other high-profile democratic names discussed in the context of a possible candidateship in 2020 include Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont, Bernie Sanders.
The Biden said he would decide officially by January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin points out Track Palins PTSD during Trump's election meeting
Track Palin, 26, was a year in Iraq after working in Sept.
He was arrested and targeted for a domestic violence incident on Monday night.
"What my son is going through, what he's going through after coming home, I have in common with other families who experience the consequences of PTSD and some of the vulnerability our soldiers have with them," she told the audience at an election event for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest "the elephant in space" and said of the son and other war veterans: "They come home a little changed, they come home hardened, they come home and wonder if this is the respect for what their soldier comrades and pilots and all other members of the military have contributed to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and was targeted for domestic violence on a woman, cursing with a report on domestic violence and possession of a weapon while he was drunk, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the police in Wasilla.
18 Länder and D.C. support the testing of new asylum policies
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal review of a new policy in the United States that denies asylum to victims who flee from gang or home violence.
Representatives from the 18 Länder and D.C. provided a briefing from amicus curiae (a friend of the court) in Washington to support an asylum seeker who challenged the policy, reported NBC News.
The whole name of the defendant in the Grace v. Sessions case that the American Civil Liberties Union brought against the federal police in August has not been published.
She claimed that the partner ‘and his violent sons of a gang member’ abused her, but officials in the United States rejected her application for asylum on 20 July.
She was arrested in Texas.
The state attorneys who supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, who produce a large number of asylum seekers to the United States, as nations having major problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new asylum policy in the United States reversed a decision in 2014 by the Immigrant Appeal Court that gave undocumented immigrants who fled domestic violence to apply for asylum.
State Attorney Karl Racine, District of Columbia, said in a statement on Friday that the new policy ‘regards many decades of federal, federal and international law’.
‘Federal law requires all asylum requirements to be determined on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the requirement, and such prohibition is contrary to that principle’, said the briefing of amicus curiae.
The lawyers further argued in the brief that the policy that denied immigrants access harms the American economy and says that they are very likely to become entrepreneurs and ‘contribute to the necessary labour’.
Minister of Justice Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges no longer to give asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and violence in June.
‘Asylum is available to those who leave their country of origin for persecution or fear based on race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political view’, said the June 11 policy announcement.
Asylum was never meant to reduce all the problems – even all the serious problems – that people face every day all over the world.
Desperate rescue action in Palu - the death tolls are doubled in the search for survivors
For the survivors, the situation was getting worse and worse.
"It was very exciting," says the 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, consoling her feverish son at an evacuation center in the city of Palu.
«All the time you see ambulances picking up the dead.
Clean water is defective’.
You could see residents who came to destroyed homes and lightened through water-damaged assets in an attempt to save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and the hospitals, which were injured in the 7.5-force earthquake, were overcrowded.
Some of them injured, including Dwi Haris, who broke his back and shoulder, sitting outside Palus military hospital, where patients were treated outdoors due to ongoing severe aftershocks.
He got tears in his eyes when he retelled how it felt when the violent earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor he shared with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't have time to save ourselves in safety.
I was crushed by the wall that collapsed, I think,” Haris told the Associated Press, adding that the family was in town to attend a wedding.
I heard my wife cry for help, and then it became quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
The U.S. Ambassador accuses China of ‘trashing’ with ‘propaganda ads’
One week after a Chinese public newspaper ran a four-page ad in an American newspaper that painted the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the U.S. ambassador in China accused Beijing of using American press to spread propaganda.
The United States President Donald Trump referred on Wednesday to the Annex China Daily paid to move into the Des Moines Register — the most selling newspaper in Iowa — after accusing China of trying to interfere in the U.S. Congressional elections on November 6, an accusation China rejects.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to influence the election in the United States marked a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to put pressure on China, said U.S. officials according to Reuters.
It is true that foreign authorities normally use ads to promote trade, but Beijing and Washington are locked in an escalating trade war that has led to rounds of new customs duties on each other's imported goods.
China's criminal duty early in the trade war was to hit export companies in states like Iowa, which supported Trump's Republican Party, reporting Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and former long-time governor of Iowa, who is a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said that Beijing has hit American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in a reading in the Sunday's Des Moines Register: "China is now escalating the harassment by running propaganda ads in our own free press."
‘By spreading this propaganda, the Chinese authorities are taking advantage of the freedom of expression and the open press that we enjoy in America to post a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register,’ Branstad wrote.
“As a contrast – at the newspaper booth in Beijing you don’t find many dissenting opinions and don’t experience real reflections among ordinary Chinese people around China’s problematic economic course, given that the media are below the thumb of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added: ‘one of China’s largest newspapers rejected the offer to publish’ his article, even though he did not disclose which newspaper it was.
Republicans scare away female selectors before the Kavanaugh façade intersperse, warning analysts
Since many top politicians among the Republicans support and defend the Supreme Justice candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who has received multiple charges of sexual abuse directed at him, analysts warn that they will have a counter-reaction, especially from women, in the upcoming local elections.
The feelings surrounding this have been very strong, and most Republicans have already given signs that they want to proceed with the vote.
These things cannot be withdrawn," said Grant Reeher, a professor of state science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, to The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Reehr said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flakes (R-Arizona) proposed an FBI review in the last second would be enough to calm angry voters.
“Women will not forget yesterday’s events – they will not forget it tomorrow and not in November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn last Friday, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, demonstrators sang "November is coming!" while demonstrating in the halls of the Senate when the Republicans controlling the Judicial Committee chose to proceed with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, reported Mic.
‘Democrat enthusiasm and motivation are going to explode’, said Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst, to the news page.
"People say it's already been high, it's true.
But it could have been higher, especially among women insecure voters in the suburbs and younger voters between 18 and 29 years of age, who often don't vote even if they don't like the president."
Even before Ford’s public testimony that gave a detailed description of the charges of sexual assault against the highest court candidate, analysts believed that it would be a counter-reaction if the Republicans forced through the appointment.
‘This has become a happy root for the Republican Party’, said Michael Steele, former President of the RNC (Republican National Committee), early last week, according to NBC News.
‘It’s not only about the Committee’s vote or final approval or whether Kavanaugh is being deployed – it’s also about the way the Republicans have handled it and how they have dealt with it’, pointed out Guy Cecil, Director of the United States of America, a group that promotes the election of democratic candidates, to the news channel.
However, the Americans seem to be somewhat divided about who to believe in in the cold water of Ford and Kavanaugh's testimonies, with a small majority in favour of the latter.
A new questionnaire from YouGov shows that 41% of those asked were entirely or quite convinced of Ford’s testimony, while 35% said they were totally or quite convinced of Kavanaugh’s production.
In addition, 38% said they were quite or completely convinced that Kavanaugh lied under his diploma, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
After the Flake show, the FBI is investigating the allegations made by Ford in addition to at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford explained to the Senate's judicial committee on oath last week that Kavanaugh in drunken condition was committing crimes against her when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate exposed her genitals while they were at a party at Yale in the 1980s.
The World Wide Web author plans to launch a new Internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the author of the World Wide Web, launches a launch to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the Technology Legend, Inrupt, is a company that builds on Berners-Lee's open source platform Solid.
On Solid, users can choose where to store their data and who have access to the information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee spooked that the purpose is “world domination”.
“We have to do it now,” he said about the start-up.
‘It is a historic moment’.
The app uses Solid's technology to let people create their own "personal data repository online" or a POD.
It may include contact lists, work lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all are available on one browser at the same time.
What is unique about the online personal data repository is that it is up to the user who should have access to that type of information.
The company calls it ‘personal authorisation through data’.
According to the company's CEO, John Bruce, the idea behind Inrupt is that the company should provide resources, process and relevant competence to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some hired developers on contract to work with the project and a bunch of volunteer programmers.
From this week on, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralised apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about introducing something completely new or not, which will make their business models completely recalibrated overnight.

Bernard Vann: Celebration of Victoria Cross receiver from World War I
The only clergyman in the English Church who was awarded a Victoria Cross during World War I as a fighter was celebrated in his hometown after 100 years.
Lieutenant Colonel and Pres. Bernard Vann were awarded the Honorary Ceremony on 29 September 1918 at the Battle of Bellenglishe and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and was never told that he was awarded the highest British military rating.
A memorial stone was revealed by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that the stone was to be revealed exactly 100 years after the grandfather's award winning feat.
According to London Gazette, Colonel Vann led his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin on September 29th – “through very thick fog and under heavy protection from field cannons and machine guns”.
Later he plunged toward the firing line and led the line ‘with a big toe’ in the future before storming a cannon by himself and striking out three of the departments.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – just one month before the war was over.
Michael Vann, 72, said that the grandfather's actions were "something I knew I could never live up to, but something that humbles me."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid down a wreath after the parade, which was led by the Corps of Brentwood Imperial.
Michael Vann said he «felt very honored to play a role in the parade» and added: «the bravery of a real whole is being demonstrated by the support that comes from many people».
MMA trailers were up all night to watch the Bellator 206 martial arts program, instead they got Peppa pigs.
Imagine that you've been awake all night to see the densely packed Bellator 206, just to discover that you're not going to see the main game.
The participant from San Jose managed through 13 games, including six on the main card and was shown directly through the night in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6:00 p.m., while Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to meet each other, the viewers in the United Kingdom were sitting at the mouth when the picture suddenly showed Peppa pig.
Some were less impressed after keeping awake until early morning to see the fight.
A trailer described on Twitter the transition to the children’s programme as ‘a kind of sick joke’.
‘It is state regulation that it is not appropriate to send such programmes at 6:00 p.m., so they have to be transferred to the children’s programme’, said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president for marketing and communication, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa pig, yes!"
Bellator's Managing Director, Scott Coker, said they're going to work on the mission plan to include the viewers in Britain in the future.
"I think we can figure it out for the rematch," said Coker.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning on Sunday there, and we won't be able to solve this until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on the case.
Believe with-- when we put over, there were many messages going back and forth, and they weren't exactly of the friendly kind.
We tried to solve it and thought it was a technical failure.
But that wasn't it, it was a government thing.
I can promise you this won't happen next time.
We want to reduce from six to five games – which we usually send – and we tried to reach far for our trailers, but tipped over.
It is an unfortunate situation’.
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior to sexuality
The Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up with a feeling of inferiority towards everyone because of his sexuality – but it gave him the motivation he needed to succeed.
The 24-year-old says it wasn't until high school that he realized that he wasn't like others.
In the first program Desert Island Discs on Radio 4 presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he stood up for the gay rights to give others hope.
He also said that becoming a parent made him care less about winning the Olympics.
The usual programme manager of the traditional programme, Kirsty Young, shall be gone for a few months because of illness.
Daley appeared to be a little lost on the Lavender's first broadcast and said he felt "less worth" than everyone else he grew up with because "it wasn't socially acceptable to like both boys and girls."
He said, "To this day, these feelings of being inferior and different have been the real motivation and have the power and strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so that he didn't disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
He is twice a bronze winner in the Olympics and has become a highly-profile LGBT ambassador.
He said he stands out because he feels lucky that can live openly without negative consequences and wants to give others "hope".
The three times world champion said that he fell in love with a man -- filmmaker Dustin Lance Black from the United States, who he met in 2013 -- "surprised me."
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, last year, but he said the age difference had never been a problem.
"When you go through so much at such a young age" -- he attended his first Olympics when he was 14, and his father died of cancer three years later -- he said it was hard to find someone of the same age who had experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple became parents in June, to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his whole perspective had been changed.
"If you had asked me last year, everything was about me just having to win a gold medal," he said.
‘You know, there are bigger things than gold medals in the Olympics.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.
The son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after having been diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father didn't accept that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked was if they had obtained tickets to London in 2012 – since he wanted to sit on the first row.
"I couldn't tell him that he wouldn't live long enough to sit on the first row," he said.
"I held his hands when he stopped breathing, and it was not until he actually stopped breathing and was dead that I finally realized that he was not invincible," he said.
The year after, Daley competed in OL 2012 and won bronze.
“I just knew that this was what I had dreamed of my whole life – to dive in front of a home audience under the Olympics, the best feeling ever,” he said.
It also inspired his first song selection - Proud of Heather Small - which meant a lot to him in his drive-up before the Olympics and which still gives him goose bumps.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 Sundays at 11:15 BST.
Soft Mickelson taken out for the golf tournament Ryder Cup Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will beat a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he has to get in shape if it's not to be a sad milestone.
Mickelson, who plays in the biennial for the impressive 12th time, was put on the bench by team captain Jim Furk before Saturday's fourball and foursome matches.
Instead of being at the center of the events, as he had so often been to the United States, it five times the major-winner divides the day between being a cheerleader and working with his game on the rank in hopes of correcting what is shrieking.
The 48-year-old never had the best swing, even at the top of his career and is not in the perfect form of the tight Le Golf National course, where the long rough-area is constantly punishing wild blows.
And if the track itself is not scary enough, Mickelson, in the ninth game on Sunday, meets the British Open Champion Francesco Molinari himself, who has joined the novice Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their matches this week.
If the Americans, with four points below before the 12 single games, get a successful start, Mickelson's game can turn out to be absolutely crucial.
Fear expresses confidence in his husband, not that he could say anything else.
“He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a clapping on my back and put his arm around me and said he would be ready the next day,” said Fürk.
«He has great confidence.
He is a Hall of Famer and has added so much to these layers before, and this week.
I probably didn't see him playing two games.
I imagined more, but that's how it ended, and that's how we thought we had to do it.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else."
Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record for most played Ryder Cup matches on Sunday.
It can mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never quite reached his individual record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven drawdowns, but Fürk said his participation added some intangible values to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, funny and likes to do business with others. He's a great guy to have in the storeroom," he explained.
'I think the younger players were having fun trying out against him this week too, and it was fun to see.
He's giving a lot more than just the game.
European team captain Thomas Bjørn knows that his great leadership can soon disappear
Thomas Bjørn, the European team captain, knows from experience that a significant leadership at the entrance of the last day's single game in the Ryder Cup can quickly turn into an unpleasant round.
The Danish debuted in the 1997 battle at Valderrama, where one side led by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but the car took the victory with the lowest possible margin, 141⁄2-131⁄2.
‘You keep reminding yourself that we had a great leadership at Valderrama; we had a great leadership at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won, but only a little,” said Björn, photographed after seeing the Class of 2018 win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday lead 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So the story will show me and everyone else that this isn't over.
You'll give everything tomorrow.
Get out there and do all the right things.
This is not over until you've got the points on the board.
We have one goal, and that's trying to win this trophy, and that's where the focus lies.
I've always said that I focus on the 12 players who are on our side, but we're very aware of what's on the other side -- the best golfers in the world."
Bears are delighted with how his players have made it on the tough golf course and add, "I couldn't do better.
Tomorrow is a new challenge.
Tomorrow, there are the individual achievements in the center, and there's something completely different.
It's great to be out there with a partner when things go well, but when you're out there alone, your performance as a golfer is tested to the full.
That's the message you have to convey to the players, that they have to get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now you leave the partner, and he also has to go out and get the best of himself."
Unlike Bjørn, opponent Jim Fürk will try to get his players to do better individually than they did as partners.
Fear itself has been on both sides of the major revolutions the last day. He was on the winning team at Brookline before he ended up losing when Europe performed the ‘Miracle at Medinah’.
I remember every damned word of it," he said in answer to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the team captain in 1999, had fought with his players at the entrance of the last day.
«We have 12 important battles tomorrow, but you would like to have a good start, like the one we experienced at Brookline, as we saw at Medinah.
When the momentum starts to move in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle matches.
We'll arrange our setup then and send out the people the way we feel.
Thomas has been given the task of trying to lead the fight and challenge Rory McIlroy in the top game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter like the other Europeans in the top half of the game sequence.
"I bet on this group of men in that order because I think it stands all the way," said Bjørn about his selection of single players.
Germany's new warship delayed again
German Navy's latest frigate would have been completed in 2014 to replace old warships from the cold war days, but this will not happen until the earliest of next year due to failed systems and galloping costs, reported local media.
The completion of «Rheinland-Pfalz», the driver ship of the brand new frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit which quoted a military spokesperson.
The ship should have been handed over to the Navy in 2014, but the major problems after delivery pursued the ambitious project.
The four ships in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class of the Navy ordered completely back in 2007 will replace the old frigates in the Bremen class.
It has been agreed that they should be equipped with a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft missiles and some stealth technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods — it would be possible to use the latest frigates for up to two years away from home port.
However, steady delays mean that the advanced warships – they were told to strengthen Germany at sea – will already be out of date before they are put into service, reports Die Zeit.
The fateful F125 frigate made headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss yard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the marine has returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the causes of the return, but German media mentioned a number of important ‘software and hardware defects’ that made the warship useless in a combat mission.
Software defects were particularly important since ships in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class will be operated by a crew of around 120 sailors - only half of the crew of older frigates in the Bremen class.
It was also discovered that the ship has a huge preponderance, which reduces performance and limits the marine's ability to make upgrades in the future.
The 7000-tonne "Rheinland-Pfalz" is estimated to be twice as heavy as similar ships of the same class used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to defective hardware, the price tag of the entire project — including crew training — has also become a problem.
It is claimed to have reached a staggering EUR 3.1 billion – from the original EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems surrounding the new frigates are particularly important in the light of fresh warnings that Germany’s marine strength is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German Government’s Defence Committee, confirmed that the marine is actually ‘empty for usable ships’.
The official said the problem has escalated over time because old ships were out of order, but there was no new vessel.
He regrets that none of the frigates in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could be used by the Navy.
National Trust Thieves on the Secret Life of Flag mice
New research carried out by a landowner in the Scottish Highlands will reveal how bats use the landscape in the hunt for food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the behaviour of the unique flying mammals and help to design future conservation measures.
The study for researchers at the National Trust for Scotland will follow common bats and dwarf bats as well as browning and water-flagging mice at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special photocopiers will be deployed at important locations around the property to track seasonal bat activity.
NHS personnel and volunteers will also conduct mobile studies using handheld detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of the bat calls and the species that do.
A habitat map and a report will then be prepared to provide a detailed landscape of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, Nature Conservation Adviser for NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which habitat areas are most important to the bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will be included in the decision on the measures to be taken, such as the installation of pastures and the best management of the forest for bats and other associated species.
The bat population in Scotland and the United Kingdom has fallen considerably over the past century.
They are threatened by construction that affects breeding grounds and habitat degradation.
Windmills and lighting can also pose a risk, as can fly paper and certain chemically treated building materials as well as attack from house taxes.
In fact, bats aren't blind.
But because of their nocturnal hunting habits, they have more use for their ears than for their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use advanced echolocation to find insects and obstacles on the road when they fly.
NTS, which is responsible for the maintenance of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76 000 hectares of land around the country, takes bats very seriously.
They have ten competent experts who regularly carry out surveys, survey breeding grounds and sometimes rescue work.
The organisation has also established Scotland's first and only bat reserve at the Three Landings in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
Property manager David Thompson says the property is the ideal territory for them.
"Here at Threeve we have a perfect area for bats," he says.
«We have the old buildings, a lot of old trees and the ideal habitat.
But there's still a lot we don't know about bats, so the work we do here and on other properties will help us understand more about what they need to thrive."
He underlines the importance of mapping the bats before carrying out maintenance on a property since accidental destruction of a single breeding site may kill up to 400 females and young people, and may obliterate an entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill them, harass them or disturb them or destroy their breeding grounds.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish employee of the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the audience to help in the work.
She says, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many of the species we just don't know how the populations are doing."
Ronaldo rejects the rape charges while lawyers will sue the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has described the rape charges against him as ‘false news’ and says that people ‘want fame’ by using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue the German newsmagazine Der Spiegel, who published the claims.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventus has been accused of rapeing an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga at a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He's accused of paying her $375,000 afterwards for keeping close to the event, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
When he spoke on a live video on Instagram to his 142 million followers a few hours after the charges were reported, 33-year-old Ronaldo rejected the charges as ‘false news’.
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, fake news," says five times, winning the Gold Ball into the camera.
‘They want fame by using my name.
It's common.
They want fame by giving my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and I'm fine," adds the footballer with a smile.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for the allegations, which they have called ‘an unacceptable production of suspicions in the private sphere’, according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz says that the footballer will claim compensation for ‘reputal damage to an extent equivalent to the severity of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious privacy breaches in recent years’.
The alleged event shall have taken place in June 2009 at a suite in Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga should have gone back to the footballer's room, where he is said to have raped her anal, according to documents submitted to the Clark County District Court, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was "99% a good person" who was failed by the "one percent".
The documents show that Ronaldo has confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was voluntary.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that pictures of her injuries were taken in hospitals, but later they entered into settlements outside the court because she was “lived of revenge” and was also concerned about being “publicly hanged”.
The 34-year-old says she's now trying to set the settlement aside because she's still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of moving from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged assault, and moved this summer to Italian Juventus on a contract worth EUR 100 million.
Brexit: United Kingdom ‘will mourn forever’ about losing car manufacturers
Britain “will mourn forever” if they lose world leadership in car production after Brexit, said business secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was ‘anxious’ that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if the United Kingdom left the EU without agreement, they would stop production temporarily at the Burnaston plant, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the consequences of delayed border crossing at any Brexit without a contract could mean fewer jobs.
The Burnaston plant – producing Toyotas Auris and Avensis – produced almost 150,000 cars last year, of which 90 % were exported to the rest of the EU.
‘If the United Kingdom leaves the EU at the end of March, we will, in my view, feel that production at our factory is halting’, said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s Managing Director at Burnaston.
Other British producers have raised concerns about leaving the EU without agreement as to how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says they're going to shut down the mini factory at Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concern is whether what the car manufacturers say is the supply chain risks of any Brexit without a contract.
Toyota’s production line is operated on the basis of ‘order as required’ and parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the United Kingdom and the EU for cars made on demand.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there may be a stay at the border, which industry says can lead to delays and a lack of parts.
It will be impossible for Toyota to keep more than one day's inventories at the Derbyshire plant, said the company, and thus the production will stop.
Clark said that Theresa May’s Brexit plan for further relations with the EU is ‘presist designed to avoid such border controls’.
"We need an agreement, we want to get the best deal that makes us, as I say, not only enjoy success at the moment, but that we seize this opportunity," he said on the BBC Radio 4's Today program.
‘The message, not only from Toyota but also from other car manufacturers, is that we absolutely must be able to continue what has been a very successful set of supply chains’.
Toyota could not say how long production will be stopped but warned that in the long term, increased costs will reduce the plant’s competitiveness and eventually lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is a trade union leader at the factory, said that the members are becoming increasingly concerned: “My experience suggests that when these jobs disappear, they will never come back”.
One spokesperson from the government said: ‘We have put forward a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU’.
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein can be postponed again," says the White House.
Donald Trump's fateful meeting with Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein can be «exposed one more week» while the battle continues for Supreme Justice candidate Brett Kavanaugh, the White House reported on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian interference in the elections, links between Trump co-workers and Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by the President.
The question of Trump will dismiss the Deputy Minister of Justice or not, and thus threaten Mueller's independence, has been squandering during the speculations in Washington for many months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times wrote that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of engaging with Trump and trying to remove the president on the basis of the 25th Constitutional Supplement.
Rosenstein denied the information.
But last month he went to the White House, while it was reported that he was about to resign voluntarily.
Instead, it was announced that a meeting with Trump, at that time in the United Nations in New York City, would take place on Thursday.
Trump said he would "preferably let go" to kick Rosenstein, but then the meeting was exposed to avoid colliding with the Senate Justice Committee where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual assault, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both witnessed.
On Friday, Trump ordered an FBI check in one week on charges against Kavanaugh, which further suspended a full vote in the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, attended Fox News Sunday.
On a question about the Rosenstein meeting, she said, "A date for the meeting was not set; it could be this week, but I realized it could be a week's postponement because of everything that happens with the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I'm always busy keeping the press up to date."
Some journalists will dispute that claim: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since 10 September.
Software engineer Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of press conferences was not due to the reluctance of the TV reporters to "self-goodness", although she added, "I do not disagree that they are self-good".
Then she suggested that the contact between Trump and the press will become more frequent.
‘The Presidency is carrying out more questions than any former presidents,’ she said, adding without providing evidence, ‘We have looked at the figures’.
There will still be press conferences, said Sanders, but if the press gets the chance to ask the president of the United States directly, it will certainly be better than talking to me.
We're trying to make it happen a lot, and you've seen that we've done it a lot in the last few weeks, and it's going to replace a press conference when you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump often answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open events or press conferences when visiting important people.
Press conferences with him alone are rare.
In New York this week the president showed the possible cause, when he made a solo run and at times had a strange behavior in front of a lot of reporters.
Health Secretary writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland regarding Brexit concerns
The health secretary has written to the EU staff working in Scotland’s NHS (State Health Service) to express the country’s gratitude and a desire for them to stay after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, Scottish Member of Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before the United Kingdom was to leave the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to cover the costs of applying for a residence and work permit for EU citizens working in their public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: ‘Discussions between the United Kingdom and the EU on discharge have taken place during the summer and are expected to land on a solution for the fall.
But the British government has also stepped up preparations for a possible scenario without agreement.
I understand that this must be a very difficult time for you all.
I would therefore like to repeat now how highly I value the efforts of each employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from all over the EU, and beyond, provide valuable experiences and competences that strengthen and improve the work of healthcare for the benefit of the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely their home and we sincerely hope you will stay here».
Christion Abercrombie undergoes rapid operation after head injury
Defense player at Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, underwent an emergency operation after having had a head injury during Saturday's 31-27 losses to Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Mike Organ in Tennessee newspaper.
Tennessee States' main trainer, Rod Reed, told the journalists that the damage happened just before the first round was over.
"He came out on the sideline and just collapsed there," said Reed.
Trainers and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before they put him on a stretcher and took him behind for further investigation.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had been operated on at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that ‘no information is yet available on the type/scope of the damage’ and Tennessee State tries to find out when the damage occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year student, is in his first season with Tennessee State after transition from Illinois.
He had five battles on Saturday before he finished the fight, giving a total of 18 battles for his season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher document fee when buying a property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher document fee when buying property in the United Kingdom. According to new Tory plans, the extra money will be used to help the homeless
The change will neutralise the success of Corbyn's plan to attract young voters
The paper tax increase will be levied from those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
Experts in the Ministry of Finance expect it to increase up to GBP 120 million a year — to help the homeless
Theresa May today announces that foreign buyers will be charged a higher document fee when buying property in the United Kingdom – and the extra money will be used to help the homeless.
The measure will be seen as an attempt to neutralise the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s plan to attract young people with the promise to offer more affordable housing and hit high-income groups.
The application for a document fee will be made to persons and businesses who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
The surplus – which is in addition to the current document fee, including the higher rate introduced two years ago on housing number two and the purchase of housing for rent – may be as much as 3 %.
The Ministry of Finance expects the measure to contribute up to GBP 120 million per year.
It is estimated that 13 % of newly built properties in London are purchased by people who do not live in the United Kingdom.
Many prosperous areas of the country — especially in the capital — have become ‘ ghost cities’ because of the many foreign buyers who mostly live outside the country.
The new policy comes only weeks after Boris Johnson made proposals to reduce the document fee to help more young people own their own homes.
He accused large construction companies of keeping housing prices high by buying up land without using it, and demanded that Theresa May reject allowances on reasonable dwellings in order to solve the United Kingdom’s ‘disgraceful housing policy’.
Jeremy Corbyn has announced a striking array of proposed housing reforms, including rental controls and an end to unjustified layoffs.
He also wants to give municipal councils greater power to build new dwellings.
May said, "Last year I said that I would devote my time as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream -- that life should be better for every new generation.
And that means finding solutions to our degraded housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and create a life here.
However, it cannot be as easy for people who do not live in the United Kingdom, and also foreign-based companies, to buy homes that are too hard-working British citizens.
For very many people, the dream of owning a home has become far too distant, and the unworthy situation of homeless people remains».
Jack Ross: ‘My ultimate goal is to lead Scotland’
Sunderland's boss, Jack Ross, says his "final goal" is to become Scotland's manager sooner or later.
The 42-year-old shot is over the challenge of reviving the club in the northeast, which currently holds third place in League One, three points below the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St. Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a footballer.
I got a B-caps and that's it," said Ross to BBC Scotland's Sports Sound.
"But I was often with my father and saw Scotland at Hampden as a child, and there's always something that's withdrawing me.
However, that possibility would only come if I succeeded in the club-breeding.»
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic manager says he was not anxious to succeed such established names in the big club, and has previously declined approaches from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
«Success for me at the moment will be measured on whether I can get the club back to the Premier League».
Based on the structure and facilities of this club, they definitely belong to the Premier League,” he said.
It's not an easy task to get it there, but I'll probably just consider myself successful here if I get the club back there."
Ross has only been in charge for three years, after a period of assistant chief of Dumbarton and a 15-month short performance in Hearts' training staff.
Then he helped Alloa to get back from the downfall to the third division and helped St. Mirren from the edge of the downfall to win the championship title next season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did during the playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren, and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a proper road junction," he recalls when he took over the management of Alloa.
"I really thought management was right for me, more right than playing.
It sounds strange since I did it well, generated a reasonable income from it and experienced some fine highlights.
But football playing can be tough.
There's a lot of things you have to get through on a weekly basis.
I'm going through it in terms of stress and pressure in the job, but the management feels absolutely right to me.
I always wanted to lead, and now I do.

The heat wave of summer has boosted the income of heavily pressed pubs in the United Kingdom, but put more pressure on the restaurant chains.
Pubs and bars experienced an increase in turnover of 2.7 % in July — while revenue for restaurants fell 4.8 %, showing figures.
Peter Martin, a business consultant CGA, who summarized the figures, said: ‘Continued sunshine and England’s unexpected long-term participation in the World Cup meant that July followed a similar pattern as the previous month of June, when the pubs rose 2.8%, except that restaurants were hit even harder.
The 1,8 % drop in restaurant turnover in June was only worse in July.
Drink-based pubs and bars had the far best result, but an increase that was stronger like-for-like than the restaurants went down.
Pubs with food service also had difficulty with the sun, although it was not as dramatic as for the restaurant drivers.
It seemed like people just wanted out to drink.
For chain-based pubs and bars, sales increased by 6,6 % that month, with food serving falling by 3 %’.
Paul Newman, an analyst from the RSM hotel and restaurant industry, said: «These results follow the trend we have seen since the end of April.
Weather and major sporting and social events are still the main factors in outdoor sales.
It is no surprise that restaurant groups continue to have difficulties, and a 4.8% year-on-year drop will be particularly painful at the top of current cost pressures.
The long, warm summer could not have come at a worse time for food service companies, and the time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we have had in August will give a prolonged breathing room.»
The total sales growth for pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 % in July, reflecting the slowdown in roll-outs of new brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, a trade sales inspector for the pub, bar and restaurant sector in the United Kingdom, collects and analyses the results of 47 operational groups, with a total turnover of £9 billion, and is the established industry standard.
One in five children have secret accounts on social media that they hide from their parents
One in five children — some only 11 years old — has secret accounts on social media that they hide from parents and teachers, show survey
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed pages of ‘fake Insta’.
The news has increased concerns about sharing sexual content.
20 % of the students said they have a ‘principal’ account that they show their parents.
One in five children — some only 11 years old — creates accounts on social media that they keep hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed rapid growth in ‘fake Insta’ accounts — a reference to image sharing pages on Instagram.
The news has heightened the concern that sexual content is shared.
20 % of the students said they had an innocent ‘principal’ account that they refer to their parents, while they have other secret accounts.
A mother who came across the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who encouraged others to "rape me."
The research, carried out by Digital Awareness UK and the headmaster's conference (HMC) for private schools, revealed that 40 % of 11 to 18-year-old students had two profiles, half of which admitted to hold secret accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said, "It is frightening that so many young people are tempted to create websites where parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be the voice of the libertarians in the Scottish Athletics board
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Board of Scottish Athletics and has a non-performing role in the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated sportsman, and President Ian Beattie described the event as a good opportunity for those who direct the sport to gain insight into her extensive international experience over the past ten years.
‘Eilidh enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and worldwide recreational environment, and we are sure that in Scotland, recreational practitioners will benefit from getting her into the board,’ said Beattie.
Doyle said, "I'm excited to act as a voice for recreationalists, and I hope I have a lot to do to help guide sports in Scotland."
The American won 200 and 400 meters under the Olympics in Atlanta in 1996 and has a total of four Olympic gold.
She wrote on Twitter: "A month ago today, I got a blow.
I couldn't go.
The games said that only time will show if I want to be restored and to what extent.
It has been hard work, but I am quite good again and have learned to walk again, and today I do exercises of agility!
Thank you for all the encouraging messages!’
Breast pump advertisement that compares mothers with cows splits opinion on the web
A breast-pump company has split opinion online with an ad that compares nursing mothers to lactating cows.
To mark the launch of what is said to be ‘the world’s first silent breast pump carried close to the body’, Elvie, the technology-based consumer goods company, published a fresh and fluent, music video-inspired advertisement to show the freedom of the new pump provides active mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of loud and cuddle to a song with, among other things, the following text: «Yes, I'm milking myself, but you can't see any tail» and «In case you didn't understand it, this isn't jur, it's my puppies».
The choir continues: "Pump it out, pump it out, I feed my babies, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my balls."
However, the advertisement, published on the company's Facebook page, has created a storm on the web.
With 77 000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has gotten mixed reactions from the viewers, many say it paints the "cruelties" in the dairy bar.
‘Very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and feed to produce milk, but their babies are taken from them a few days after birth,” one wrote.
Elvie breast pump fits well in a breast-bh (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: ‘Appreciably traumatic for both mother and baby.
But – hey, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their babies?’
Another add: ‘In the case of a failed advertisement’.
Others defend the ad, and a woman admitted that she thought the song was "unbelievably funny."
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
I'd like to have one if I still breast-feed.
The pumping made me feel like a cow.
The advertisement is a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
This is a brilliant product," was one who wrote.
Another commented: ‘This is a funny ad directed at mothers like pumps (often at work or toilets) and feels like ‘cows’.
This is not an ad that salutes or condemns the dairy brandy.’
At the end of the video, the women reveal that they have all danced with the discreet pump in the bra.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women who pump themselves say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is completely silent, has no wires or hoses and gets fine space in a breast-fed bra, so that women get the freedom to move, hold the baby and even go out while they pump.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother, commented: ‘The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing parallels between active women and dairy cows, we wanted to light up breast pumping and all the challenges, while at the same time showing in an entertaining and recognizable way the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump provides.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a two-child mom showed up on the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski while she was using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children moved to a tent camp at the Texas border in all secrecy
The number of migrant children arrested has remained stable even though the monthly cross-border crossing has remained relatively stable, partly because the hard rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it more difficult to place children among supporters.
Traditionally, most supporters themselves have been undocumented immigrants, and have been afraid to destroy their own chances of staying in the country by coming forward and claiming a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential support players and other adults in the household had to provide fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official of the immigration and customs authorities, witnessed to Congress that the Agency had arrested dozens of people who applied to be a supporter of lone minors.
The Agency later confirmed that 70 % of the arrested persons did not have a previous criminal record.
‘Nearly 80 % of the persons who are either supporters or members of the household to supporters in the country are illegal, and a large proportion of them are criminal immigrants.
So we keep following these people," says Albence.
Officers try to deal with children more quickly and introduce new rules which require some of them to meet in court within one month of being arrested, rather than 60 days of the previous standard, according to the reception workers.
Many will be produced through videoconferencing instead of appearing in person to file their case for a residence permit for an immigration judge.
Those considered unjustified asylum seekers will be deported immediately.
The longer the child is in custody, the greater the risk of anxiety or depression, which may lead to violent outbreaks or attempts at escape, according to the reception workers and reports received in the past few months.
Lawyers said that these concerns have grown at a larger facility like Tornillo, where children who are struggling are more easily overlooked because of the size of the facility.
They added that moving children to the tent camp without having sufficient time to prepare emotionally or take part with friends can intensify traumas that many are already struggling with.
Syria begs US, French and Turkish «acquisition powers» to withdraw immediately
In a speech at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also appealed to Syrian refugees to come home, even though the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as Deputy Prime Minister, said that the foreign forces were illegally staying on Syrian soil, under the cover of combating terrorism and ‘will be treated afterwards’.
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally", he said to the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the ‘war on terror so to speak is over’ in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions are on the move.
He said that Damascus will continue to ‘bring this sacred struggle until we have cleansed all Syrian territories’ both for terrorist groups and for ‘all foreign presence’.
The United States has around 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly for the training and advice of Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs in opposition to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops on the ground in the war-torn country.
In the case of refugees, Moualem said that the conditions are so good that they can return, and he accused ‘some Western countries’ of ‘promoting irrational flight’ that keeps refugees away.
"We have contacted the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate these returns," he said.
They are politicizing what is really a purely humanitarian situation.’
The United States and the EU have warned that there will be no support for reconstruction of Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major defensive position of the rebels at Idlib has created an opportunity to press for political talks.
The Russian/Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-supported Syrian forces against the province where there are three million people.
However, Moualem underlined that the agreement had ‘clear deadlines’ and expressed the hope that military action would be directed against jihadists, including warriors from the Al-Qaeda-related Nusra Front, who ‘will be destroyed’.
The UN mission Staffan de Mistura hopes that he will soon be able to convene the first meetings of a new committee consisting of state and opposition members to draw up a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for new elections.
Moualem imposed the conditions for the Syrian authorities to participate in the Committee and said that the work of the panel should be limited to the ‘review of the articles of the current Constitution’ and warned against interference.
Why Trump wants to win another period
According to that logic, Trump would have won reelection in 2020, unless, as many liberal viewers probably hope, national law and scandals end the presidency before that time.
In what would undoubtedly be the ‘most dramatic conclusion of a presidency ever!’
At the moment, there's no sign of rightness.
Since 2014, viewer ratings for best transmission time have more than doubled to 1.05 million at CNN and almost tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in best transmission time, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBC "The Rachel Maddow Show" has peaked the cable viewer numbers with a total of 3.5 million viewers on evenings with big news stuff.
"This is a fire that attracts people because we don't understand anything," said Neal Baer, programme manager of the ABC drama Designated Survivor, about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a well-known comedian and author of «Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Snowing Into the Hollywood Boys Club», has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told me he was going to vote for Trump.
She asked.
He said, "Because he makes me laugh."
It's an entertainment value in the chaos.
Of course — unlike anything else on TV — the actions taking place in Washington can determine the future of abortion rights, whether immigrant families can be reunited and the health of the global economy.
The announcement is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, you go a long way to be an enlightened person when you sit for six hours to follow a panel of experts who discuss Bob Woodward's use of "dives in background fabric" for the book "Fear", Paul Manafort's leather jacket with ostrich feathers worth $15,000 ("a garment covered with hybris," said Washington Post) and the consequences of Stormy Daniel's colorful descriptions of Trumps, eh..., anatomy.
I don't want to look at Super Mario in the same way anymore.
‘One of the things he does that makes it look like a reality show is he gives you something every night’, said Brent Montgomery, Managing Director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of ‘Pawn Stars’, about Trump’s varying role crew and daily twisting on the plot (crimes with NFL, shame Kim Jong-un).
You can't miss one episode, or you'll be hanging out.
When I met Fleiss this week, there was 27°C and sun outside his house on the north coast of Kauai, Hawaii, but he caged in and looked at MSNBC while he took up CNN.
He couldn't tear himself loose, not when Brett Kavanaugh is going to meet the Senate Justice Committee and the future of the U.S. Supreme Court is at stake.
"I remember when we made all the crazy programs in the old days and people said this is the end of Western civilization," said Fleiss.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turned out they were right."

Money from the outside flows into the most even middle choices of the House of Representatives
It's no surprise that the 17th district of Pennsylvania experiences a flow of money after a conversion of a Congressional district that ended with two sitting representatives fighting for the same seat.
This newly attracted suburb district in Pittsburg stands with the democratic representative Conor Lamb – who won his seat in another district in an additional election last spring.
Lamb is facing another representative, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the 12th district of the old Pennsylvania, which is largely overlapping with the 17th district.
The map was redrawn after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled in January that the old districts were a constitutional manipulation of the constituencies of the Republicans' favor.
The election in the new 17th district has led to an explosive campaign funding race between the largest party funding groups, the DCCC (Democrat Campaign Congressional Committee) and the NRCC (National Republican Campaign Committee).
Lamb became a well - known name in Pennsylvania after a short victory in a closely followed-up election for Pennsylvania’s 18th district to Congress last March.
That seat had been held by a Republican for over ten years, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts have given the Democrats little leadership.
USA Considered sanctions against El Salvador for support to China, then drew the threat
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little resistance from Washington.
Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela in Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until the partners threw out the management team to the Trump Organization.
Officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs decided to recall the US diplomats from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of ‘the recent decisions to cease recognising Taiwan’, said Heather Nauert, the Ministry’s spokesperson, in an opinion earlier this month.
However, the penalties were only assessed against El Salvador, which received an estimated USD 140 million in US aid in 2017, including drug controls, development and financial support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country with its high unemployment and homicide rates.
While internal meetings were being held, North American and Central American officials postponed a top-level conference focusing on security and economic growth to follow up a similar gathering last year that was considered a step forward in trying to prevent migrants from coming to the United States.
But by mid-September, officials in the senior administration made it clear that they wanted the conference to continue, which stopped all plans for sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now about to speak to the conference, which is now scheduled in mid-October, to show the importance of the administration assigning the assembly, said the diplomat.
And the three U.S. agents returned calmly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new tough messages or sanctions from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal considerations under the assumption of anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an external analyst who is close to the administration and who also spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Learn From History
The next nail in the coffin may be Special Adviser Robert Mueller's report on Trump's possible obstacle to legal action, which is now very solid evidence in public documents.
Mueller is allegedly also in the process of extending the review to whether Trump's campaign cooperated with Russia in interfering in our elections.
If Congress were to change sides, Trump would be held accountable in that body, in the middle of the preparations to meet the voters again and perhaps eventually a jury of his peers.
There are many uncertain factors, and I do not believe that Trump’s fall is inevitable – nor for his counterparts in Europe.
We all have to make choices on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the length of the battle.
In 1938, German officers stood ready to make a coup d'état against Hitler, if only the West had stood up against him and supported the Czechoslovaks at Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of bloodbath that followed.
The course of history revolves around such turning points, and the unrelenting march of democracy accelerates or inhibits.
The Americans are facing several of these tipping points now.
What will we do if Trump kicks Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls Mueller's investigation's fate?
Rosenstein has been in trouble ever since this newspaper reported that last year he proposed secret hearings of the president and wondered if he was unfit to be president.
Rosenstein says The Times' production is incorrect.
‘How will we react if the recently launched FBI review of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair — or if it is recognised as a Supreme Court in spite of credible assault charges and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we vote during the inter-election for a Congress that will put Trump in charge?
If we do not pass those tests, democracy will face a long winter.
But I don't think we're going to fail, because of the experience I got in Praha.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my home of ambassadors.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later she sent me off to light the Sabbath light on the table with the chink cross.
With such an inheritance, how can I not look optimistic on our future?’

Rangers' Graham Dorran optimistic before the meeting with Rapid Vienna
Rangers will take Rapid Vienna on Thursday, in the certainty that winning over the Austrians after the impressive drawdown in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month will give them a strong position to qualify from Group G of the European League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first performance for the season in the drawdown game 2-2 against Villarreal, but he thinks Rangers can use the result as a springboard to get bigger things.
“That was a good point for us since Villarreal is a good team,” said the 31-year-old.
"We went into the game and thought we could do something and got one point.
Maybe we could have nodded in at the end, but the draw was probably a good result.
They were probably better at first, and we got out in the second round and were the best team.
Thursday will probably be a big night in Europe.
We hope on three points, but it'll be hard because they had a good result in the last game, but with the home audience in the back, I'm sure we can get a positive result.
The fourth year was absolutely tough, between everything that happened to my injuries and the replacements in the club itself, but there's a good feeling now.
The team's good and the guys are choking; the training is good.
Hopefully we can get on now, put the last season behind us and get it on”.
Women lose sleep because of the fear of pension saving
Although the participants in the study had a clear idea of how they wanted to be taken care of, few people talked to the family about it.
About half of the people in the Nationwide study said they talked to the spouse about the costs of long-term care.
Only 10% said they talked to the kids about it.
“People want to be taken care of by someone in the family, but they don’t do anything to take that conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide’s life insurance business.
That's how you get started.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can't prepare your family to care for you if you don't tell them what you want in good time in advance.
Discussions with the adviser and the family where and how care should be provided.
Bring your financial advisor: The advisor can also help you find out how to pay for the expenses.
The long-term care financing options may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with cash value to help cover these costs or self-insurance with your own assets — if you have enough money.
Work out your legal documents: Avoid legal problems immediately.
Get a health authority in place by appointing a person you trust to have an overview of your medical care, and make sure that healthcare professionals will comply with your wishes if you are prevented from communicating.
You should also consider giving some authority over your finances.
You choose a reliable person to make financial decisions on your behalf and make sure that your bills are paid if you cannot make them yourself.
Don't forget the small details: Imagine that your old parents have a medical emergency and are on their way to a hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Enter the details in a summary so you can prepare them.
‘It’s not just the economy that’s at stake – who are the doctors?’ said Martin.
‘What medicines do you need?
Who's going to take care of the dog?
Keep that overview in place’.
Man shot several times with an air gun in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air gun when he was on his way home after an outing.
The victim, a man in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
Police officers described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as an ‘unmotivated action’.
The victim didn't see the attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police have called for witnesses.
Indonesia earthquakes and tsunamis
At least 384 people have been killed in a severe earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to officials, and death rates are expected to rise.
Communication is out of operation and rescue workers have not been able to obtain information from Donggala County, an area north of Palu that is closer to the 7.5-force epicenter of the earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16 000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central province of Sulawesi, which lies at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379 800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and the tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a county that extends for more than 300 km along the coastline of the north-west part of the island of Sulawesi.
The government, an administrative region below the provincial level, had an estimated population of 299 200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the pillars of the central province of Sulawesis's economy, in particular the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the coast opposite to Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years, according to Indonesia’s emergency services.
In 1938 a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
A tsunami also hit west Donggala in 1996 and killed nine people.
Indonesia is located on the Seismic Ildring in the Pacific and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunami in recent years:
2004: A severe earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia’s Aceh province north of Sumatra on 26 December, triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries and killed 226 000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A number of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake with a force of 6.8 struck south on Java, Indonesia's most populated island and triggered a tsunami that struck inwards the south coast. Nearly 700 were killed.
2009: A 7.6-force earthquake occurred near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: An earthquake of magnitude 7.5 hit one of the Mentawai Islands, outside Sumatra, triggering a tsunami of up to 10 meters that devastated dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck Pidie Jaya in Aceh and caused destruction and panic while people were reminded of the hordes of the deadly earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
No tsunami was triggered this time, but over 100 were killed by collapsing buildings.
2018: Heavy earthquakes hit Indonesia’s tourist island of Lombok and kill more than 500 people, most on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and caused thousands of tourists to be temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's oldest son arrested after charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of former Alaska Governor and Vice President candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested for assault charges.
Palin, 29 years old from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for suspected domestic violence, colliding with a report on domestic violence, and opposing arrest, according to a report published Saturday by Alaska State Police.
According to the police report, he should have taken the phone from a female acquaintance when she tried to call the police to report the alleged infringement.
Palin is being held in Mat-Su custody prison and is being arrested for an unsecured debt note worth $500, KTUU reported.
He was brought before the court on Saturday, where he declared himself “not guilty, absolutely” when he was asked how he asked himself about the guilt question, reported the network.
Palin is confronted with three Class A offenses, which means he can be imprisoned for up to a year and fined $2500,000.
He's also been charged with a class B offense, which can be punished by one day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time it has been targeted against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, contacted the police to report the alleged assault.
The case is being conducted in Alaska's Veteran's Court.
In January 2016, he was targeted for domestic violence, dealing with the report on domestic violence and holding a weapon while he was intoxicated in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claimed that he beat her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after she linked the son’s violent behaviour to PTSD after serving in Iraq.
Indonesia tsunami earthquake: hundreds killed
At least 384 people are killed after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-force earthquake triggered a tsunami and has destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are down, and mortality rates are expected to rise in the next few days.
The earthquake hit the central Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos are circulated on social media that show the outbreak.
Several hundred people were gathered at a beach festival in the town of Palu when the tsunami thundered inward across the beach.
Federal prosecution agencies rarely seek the death penalty for suspected terrorist attacks in New York
Federal prosecution agencies in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people — a rare punishment that has not been carried out in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, allegedly used a rental car from Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bicycle path along West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, where he hacked down pedestrians and cyclists on his way in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecution must prove that Saipov killed the eight victims “wilfully” and caused serious body damage intentionally, according to the notice of intent to seek the death penalty in the Southern District of New York.
Both of these points qualify for possible death penalty, according to the file.
Several weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury dropped the 22-point appeal, including eight counts of killing in connection with extortion, in the face of Saipov, usually used by federal prosecutors in cases of organized crime, and a view of vehicle violence and wreckage.
The attack required “significant planning and continuation”, said the actor, who described the way Saipov carried it out as “honest, cruel and corrupt”.
‘Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, property creations and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleveland, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco’, states the notice of intention.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been ten years since the last time the Southern District of New York led a case that could give the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but was finally sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in a federal case in New York, in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after being sentenced to conspiracy for spying on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenberg couple were executed in the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Saipov, from Uzbekistan, did not display any remorse in the days and months after the attack, according to the legal documents.
He told the investigators that he was happy about what he had done, the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on the mobile phone, according to the screening.
He also asked to hang up the ISIS flag in the hospital room, said the police.
He did not declare himself guilty after the appeal on 22 points.
David Patton, one of the public defenders of Saipov, said they were "obviously disappointed" at the prosecution's decision.
‘We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a confession and life in prison without release will only prolong the trauma of these events for all concerned,’ said Patton.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked the prosecutions not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be given responsibility for the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the army of the people" today during a demonstration at the Tory Conference.
The former Ukip leader said that the politicians should be ‘feeling pressure’ from the Eurosceptics – when one of Theresa May’s own MPs suggested that he be given responsibility for the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told demonstrators in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would have been “destroyed” now if Farage were Brexit Secretary.
But the challenge for May to reconcile his deeply divided ranks has been underlined by the pro-Remain Tories who participated in a separate demonstration against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is fighting to keep his Brexit plan on track against attacks by Brexitians, Remainers and the EU.
Her supporters insisted that she continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the setback – and force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and ‘chaos’.
Bone told the "Engine" demonstrators in Solihull that he wanted to reject the Brexit plan.
He proposed that Farage should have been made a member and be given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been responsible, we would have been outside now," he said.
Wellingborough MP added: "I want to stand on behalf of Brexit, but we have to reject the Brexit Plan."
When he was going to explain his opposition to the EU, he said: ‘We did not fight in two world wars to become submissive.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.»
Bone dismissed claims that the public opinion had changed since the vote in 2016: ‘The claim that the British people have changed their mind and want to remain in the EU is completely wrong’.
Tory Brexitee Andrea Jenkyns also participated in the demonstration and told the reporters: «I simply say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
«The Brexit Plan is unpopular with the public; the opposition will not vote for it; it is unpopular in the party and with our activists, who are actually the ones who trample the streets and get us elected in the first place.
Discard the Brexit plan and start listening».
In a direct message to May, she added, ‘State Ministers will keep the job when they keep their promises’.
Farage stated that politicians would be ‘feeling pressure’ if they were thinking of betraying the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"This is now about the trust between us – the people – and those politicians," he said.
'They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to let them know they won't get away with it'.
In a message to an enthusiastic audience, he added: «I want you to let our politicians, who are on the verge of betraying Brexit, feel the pressure.
We are mobilizing the people's army in this country that gave us victory in Brexit and will never rest until we become an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.'
While marching Remainers through Birmingham before having a two-hour political gathering in the center of the city.
A small amount of activists fanned with Tories Against Brexit banners after the launch of the group this weekend.
Labour member Lord Adonis scorned the conservatives for the security problems they had with a party app at the start of the conference.
‘These are the people who tell us that they can have the IT systems in place and all the technology for Canada plus, plus, for a friction-free limit, for free trade without borders in Ireland’, he added.
‘It is a complete hazard.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
Warren seriously considers that he is a presidential candidate.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will "consider seriously to be a presidential candidate" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts democrat spoke about the future of a town hall meeting west of Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is re-electing the Republican representative Geoff Diehl, who was Vice-President of the Trump Massachusetts Campaign in 2016.
She's been at the heart of the speculations if she's going to stand up to Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters, who have used the town hall format since Trump became president.
One participant asked her if she was planning to stand as a presidential candidate.
Warren said it's time for "women to get to Washington to fix our defective government, and it includes a woman at the top."
Arrestation after Sims from LSU was killed by shooting
The Baton Rouge police, Los Angeles, reported on Saturday that a suspect was arrested for the shooting incident that killed LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge police announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, at a news conference at 11 a.m.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help identifying a man who was observed on the video.
Sims, 20 years old, was shot and killed near campus at Southern University early Friday.
‘Wayde Sims got a gunshot wound in his head and eventually died as a result of it’, police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wayde intervened to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted that he was on site and carried weapons.
Simpson was arrested without upstretch and held in custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Chamber.
Sims was a two-metre-high youth who grew up in Baton Rouge and played 32 games with 10 starting last season, his average was 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 returns per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton sets his sights on the world championship title after stallors give him the victory over Sebastian Vettel
It became clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes's stablelords would play a major role during the course.
From the pole, Bottas got a good start and swept almost Hamilton off the track while defending his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel drove into the depot first and let Hamilton continue driving in the back of the main field, which should have been decisive.
Mercedes made a pit stop a round later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton drove up after some pushing with the wheels that made the Ferrari driver reluctantly let the inside be free after a double passage to defend himself in the third turn.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the field and came in as number seven at the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
Then he led for a large part of the race while he was on the wheels to try to get to a quick finish and overman Kimi Raikkonen, who was number four.
He finally entered the depot on the 44th round, but was unable to increase the rate of the remaining eight rounds and Raikkonen took fourth place.
It is a difficult day because Valtteri did a fabulous job all weekend and was a real gentleman who was told to let me out.
The team has done a fabulous job to get a good two-span," said Hamilton.
It was a really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein during a political event on Saturday for her insistence that she did not leak the letter from Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Supreme Justice candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
When the president spoke during an event in West Virginia, he did not refer directly to Ford's testimony before the Senate's Committee on Justice.
"The only thing that could happen and the beautiful thing that's been going on in the last few days in the Senate, when you experience the mind, when you see people who are angry and bad and mean and talk nonsense," he said.
"When you look at deliveries and leaks, they say, "Oh, I haven't.
I have not done so.»
Do you remember?
Diane Feinstein, have you been playing?
Do you remember her answer... did you leak the document - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I have not spilled»»
Hey, wait a minute.
Did we ... no, we didn't play," he added, emulating the Senator's voice.
Feinstein was sent the letter with detailed information about the charges against Kavanaugh from Ford back in July, and it was leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein refused that the leak came from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's claims, I didn't play her story," Feinstein told the committee, reported The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it confidential, and I kept it confidential, as she asked."
But her denial was not graciously taken up by the president, who commented during the party event Saturday night: "I'll tell you one thing, it was a really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
In his continued defense of the Supreme Candidate, who has been accused of sexual assault by three women, the President suggested that the Democrats used the claims for their own purposes.
‘They have decided to take power back by all necessary means.
You see the madness, the evil, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to get power and control," Mediaite said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer got two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars made up for Friday's Elite League defeat against the Belfast Giants by winning the return match 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants got an early two-dimensional lead through shots by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie compensated for the home team before Dwyer restored the management of the Giants.
Francois Bouchard evened out for Dundee before two goals by Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory.
It was the third Elite League loss for the season for Adam Keefe's men, who had come back after they beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast Friday night.
It was the third meeting of the season between the layers, and the Giants had won the three previous battles.
Dwyer's opening came in the fourth minute at 3:35 with the help of Kendall McFaull, and David Rutherford put up the game when Beauvillier doubled the management four minutes later.
In what became a hectic opening period, Sullivan led the home team back into the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt put up to Cownie's parole at 15:16.
Dwyer ensured that the Giants had the management at break when he took his second goal for the evening at the end of the first round.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard rebalanced with a masterful goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran joined forces to help Nielsen give Dundee leadership for the first time during the game late in the second round, and he secured the victory with the team's fives halfway out in the final round.
Giants, who have now lost four of the last five matches, play at home against Milton Keynes in their next match on Friday.
Air traffic controllers are dying to ensure that hundreds of air passengers escape from earthquakes
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is being honoured as just after he died and ensured that an aircraft that had many hundred passengers could safely take off.
More than 800 people have died, and many are missing after a powerful earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
Heavy aftershocks continue to terrorise the area, and many are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Even after the colleagues had fled for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the very floating control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
He stayed to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, who was on the runway just then, could safely lighten.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he thought it would collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
Speaker for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, reported Australia's ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to move him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our hearts broke when we heard it," he added.
The authorities fear that mortality rates may rise to several thousand, and the country’s disaster response body reports that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
‘The numbers are expected to rise further since many corpses are still trapped under the ruins and many have not been able to reach’, said the organ spokesman, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Up to six meters high waves have razed Palu, who will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring in help and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: «All the time you see ambulances picking up the dead.
It's a lack of clean water.
Minimarkets are being ransacked everywhere’.
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: «Indonesian Red Cross is working febrile to help survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get a lot worse».
Indonesia’s President Joko Widodo arrived at Palu on Sunday and told the country’s military: “I ask you all to work day and night to carry out all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?’ CNN reported.
Indonesia was hit by earthquakes earlier this year in Lombok, where over 550 people were killed.
Fly crashed in Micronesia: Air Niugini now reports that a man is missing after flights crashed into the lagoon
The airline that owned the plane that crashed in a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, now says that one man is missing, and they reported earlier that all 47 passengers and the crew were safely evacuated from the descending plane.
Air Niugini said in a press release that on Saturday afternoon there was one male passenger they did not have an overview of.
The airline said they cooperated with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to the request for further details of the passenger, such as age and nationality.
Local boats helped save the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at the airport on the island of Chuuk.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been transported to the hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday, and the condition of all of them was stable.
What led to the crash and the exact sequence of events is still unclear.
The airline and U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon just outside the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane was bombing on the runway.
The American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane flew very low.
"It's a very good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and others were able to wade through amid-deep water to the emergency exit on the descending plane.
He said that the flight hosts were panicking and screaming, and that he had a minor head injury.
U.S. Navy said sailors who worked nearby to repair a bridge, also helped in the rescue work by using an inflatable boat to carry people ashore before the plane sank about 30 meters below the water surface.
Aviation Safety Network data suggests that 111 people have died in crashes with PNG-registered planes in the last twenty years, but none of them involved Air Niugini.
Analyst presents the timeline for the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecution authorities closed the procedure on Saturday in a new trial for a man accused of having burned a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
U.S. analyst in the Department of Justice, Paul Rowlett, witnessed for several hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He described to the jury how he used mobile prints to put together the movements of 29 years old accused Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night she died.
Rowlett said he obtained location data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers that night she died, which was contrary to what he had claimed earlier, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was in the same place as the phone to Chambers in the time he claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford went in the witness box on Saturday and claimed that he was not in the city that day.
When the actor asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he claimed he was in the trailer of Sanford that night, Sanford said he was "loose because my trailer was in Nashville".
Another inconsistency was that Tellis claimed he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Mobile prints suggest that they had only known each other for one week.
Rowlett said that a little after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted the call, contact details and messages to and from Chambers from his phone.
"He erased her from his life," said Hale.
The defence is scheduled to start its procedure on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the case to be left to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is community-accompanied hip hop?
A hip hop-trio wants to challenge the negative image to the genre by filling the music with positive messages.
The High Breed of Bristol claims that hip hop has moved from the origins of political messages to addressing social issues.
They want to go back to the roots and make community-accompanied hip hop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have experienced a new boom in the United Kingdom through artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
New York babysitter sues couples for termination of “racist” notice
A babysitter in New York sues a pair of discriminatory dismissals after receiving a misguided message from her mother, who complained that she was “another black person”.
The couple rejects the fact that they are racist and compares the case with ‘expression’.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother-in-law, expressed disappointment when she found out that the new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, was black when she met up to the first working day in 2016.
‘NOWN’, wrote Plasco-Flaxman to his husband in a message.
But instead of sending it to the man, she sent it to Maurice, twice.
After discovering the loss, it was an “inconvenient” Plasco-Flaxman who quit Maurice, claiming that their retired child caretaker, who was African-American, had done a bad job and that she had expected one from the Philippines, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for his one working day and was then sent home with a Uber.
Now Maurice sues the couple for compensation for the termination and demands compensation of a sum of $350 a day for the six-month, loski-based scheme she was promised, but without a contract.
“I wanted to show them that – hey, that’s just not how you do,” she said to the New York Post on Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple have turned back on the charges that they are racist and say the termination of Maurice was the only right thing, since they did not feel they could trust her after insulting her.
"My wife sent her something she didn't mean to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racist,” said the man Joel Pasco to the New York Post.
"But would you have left your children to someone you had been rude to, even if it was a misunderstanding?
Your newborn child?
Come on.
The comparison of the case with ‘expression’ said Plasco was due to his wife having only two months to term and was in a ‘very difficult situation’.
«Is there such a person you want to punish?
It's not very nice," added the stockbroker.
While the legal case is going on, the popular court has been quick to condemn the couple on social media and criticises them for their behavior and attitudes.
The publisher of Paddington feared that readers would not accept a talking bear, reveals a new letter
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born just after the book was accepted, said about the letter: "It is difficult to get in the second place when they read it for the first time before it was published.
It's very fun to know what we now know about Paddington's great success."
She says the father, who had worked as a cameraman in the BBC before he was inspired to write the children's book of a baby bear, would have been very pleased that his work had been turned down.
She describes Paddington as a «very important family member» and adds that her father in secret was very proud of the success he achieved.
"He was a rather quiet man, and he was no boastful person," she said.
"But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like when you have a child doing a trick: you're proud of it even though it's really not your fault.
I think he considered Paddington's success a little bit that way.
Although it was his product and his imagination, he always used to give the honor to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye over the phone.
On landing the daughter had been rushed to the hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where the doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to say that it looked bad, that he didn't think she would survive," said Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I got the phone from Nad, who said she was going to die in two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I'm so happy for you, my friend.
I'll come to you soon.
I'm coming to you.
The medical doctor had given her to make her heart beat, slowly lost its effect and left the system.
She died a while earlier and the organs of the body collapsed.
I just had to sit there and wait, in the certainty that it happened.
I couldn't howl and scream because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to get together».
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, who now mourned the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers – who did not know about the trials she was going through.
"No one knew," she says.
"I looked down all the time and tears flowed in a steady stream.
It's hard to explain, but it was there on the plane that I felt this overwhelming compassion for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Postcard with grieving women to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who have lost their loved ones in suicide work to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted postcards on a bridge in Wales with encouraging messages and phone numbers people can call for help.
Sharon's son Tyler was 13 when he was hit by depression and took his life when he was 18.
"I don't want any parents to experience what I have to experience every day," she says.
45-year-old Sharon, who lives in Lydney, says that his son was a promising cook with an infectious smile.
"Everybody knew him on the smile.
They said his smile could brighten up any room».
He left work before he died because he was "in a really dark place".
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old brother was one of those who found him after he took his life.
Sharon says, "I worry all the time about it becoming an infective effect."
Sharon made the cards "to tell people that there are people out there that they can go and talk to, even if it's just a friend.
Don't sit for yourself -- you have to talk to someone."
Kelly, who has been Sharon's friend for many years, lost Mark, the partner through 15, not long after his mother died.
"He didn't tell me he felt down or depressed or anything," she says.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed the changed mood.
On Christmas Day he was completely in the basement – when the kids opened the Christmas presents, they didn't get eye contact or anything."
She says his death was a great trauma to them, but they have to fight through it: "It tears up a big hole in the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we all have to endure and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in a thin thread while the FBI starts investigating
‘I thought that if we could get some of what he asked for – a time- and scale-limited investigation – we might come to some agreement,’ said Flake on Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee would ‘fall apart’ along bounded party boundaries.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
The reluctance was due to the timing.
The middle elections are only five weeks away, November 6 — if the Republicans are likely to make it bad, it will be significantly more difficult for them to get the man they want elected to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush has called senators and run lobbying to get them to support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Bush and met his wife Ashley there when she was a personal secretary for Bush.
What happens after the FBI has submitted its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where at the moment there are 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It's still unclear if Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, so Vice President Mike Pence can use his double vote and get him to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean hoppers under Kim
The number of North Korean divers to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, said a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, which refers to data from the South Korean Ministry of Collection, said there had been 1127 withdrawals last year — compared to 2706 in 2011.
Park stated that stricter border controls between North Korea and China as well as higher prices in human traffickers were key factors.
Pyongyang hasn't commented on it in public.
Most of the defectors from North Korea are gradually offered citizenship in South Korea.
Seoul says that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flights via China, which have the longest border with North Korea and are easier to cross than the strictly guarded demilitarized zone between the two Korean states.
China regards the defectors as illegal migrants and not refugees and returns them with power.
The relationship between North and South — which is still technically at war — has improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two Pyongyang countries met for talks on the locked negotiations on denucleisation.
This happened after the June historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they largely agreed to work for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister, Ri Yong-ho, blamed the United States for the lack of progress since then.
‘Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such conditions, there is no possibility that we will unilaterally disarm first’, said Ri in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he is unfit to sit in the Supreme Court
Minority leader of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called the Supreme Candidate Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he had a temperament that made him unfit to sit in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the statements in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I could only think that if a woman had behaved like this, she would be called hysterical,” said Pelosi about her reaction to Kavanaugh’s diploma to the Senate Committee on Justice on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied emotionally that he had committed sexual assault on Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
Kavanaugh was very emotional in his opening statement, sometimes he cried out and was crying sick when he talked about the family and the years in high school.
He was also strongly condemning the Democrats in the committee and called the allegations against him a ‘gross and coordinated character killing’ organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said she thought that Kavanaugh's testimony shows that he cannot sit in the Supreme Court since it shows that he is predestined against democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with such statements and the way he attacked the Clinton couple and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi hesitated when she was asked if she would try to sue Kavanaugh for national law if he were approved and if the Democrats received the majority of the House of Representatives.
"I want to say this -- if he doesn't tell Congress and the FBI the truth, he's not only unfit to sit in the Supreme Court, but also in the court he's sitting in now," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a democrat she was concerned about potential Kavanaugh decisions against the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) or Roe v. Wade (abort rights), since he is considered a conservative judge.
In the inquiry, Kavanaugh considered whether he would review certain Supreme Court decisions.
‘This is not the time to send a hysterical, biased person to the Supreme Court and expect us to applaud it’, said Pelosi.
And women have to deal with it.
It's a fair anger, months and years where the mind takes over, and she can't get it out without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's so weird, do you?"
She continues: "I got good help from a woman who was my superior somewhere, who said that she also cries when she gets angry, but had developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to, "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then she just kept going.
And that's what I thought was amazing."
Tears are allowed as an outlet for anger partly because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories from one of my first jobs was in a man-dominated office. I started crying with unexplained rage and was grabbed in the neck collar by an older woman – a cool boss whom I had always been a little afraid of – who took me to a stairwell.
"Let them never see you cry," she said.
‘They don’t know you’re furious.
They'll think you're bored and happy because they managed to take you."
Patricia Schroeder, at that time a democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart when he was a presidential candidate.
In 1987, when Hart was revealed to cheat on the spouse aboard a boat called Monkey Business and withdrew from the election, Schroeder was very frustrated and thought that there was nothing in the way to investigate the possibilities of silence as a presidential candidate himself.
"It wasn't a thoughtful decision," she said with a laugh 30 years later.
‘There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last ones they needed were one more.
Some called it ‘Snow White and the Seven Dwarves’.
Since it was closer to the end of the campaign, she lay behind with the funding and swore that she wouldn't stop if she didn't get $2 million.
It was a lost fight.
She discovered that some of the supporters who gave $1,000 to men gave her only $250.
"Do they think I'll get a discount, do they?" she wonders.
When she gave the speech to announce that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by feelings – gratitude to the people who had supported her, frustration over the system that made it so difficult to drive money and to now elect instead of delegates, and anger over sexism – that she fell into tears.
"You'd think I had a nervous breakdown," Schroeder recalls how the press referred to her.
"You'd think Kleenex was my main sponsor.
I remember thinking what they'd write on my grave stand?
'She's crying?'
How the US-China Trade War Can Benefit Beijing
The opening ointments in the trade war between the United States and China were deafening, and although the battle is far from over, a rift between countries can be beneficial to Beijing in the long term, say experts.
Donald Trump, president of the United States, fired the first warning earlier this year by imposing customs duties on important Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The main escalation took place this week with new customs duties on goods worth $200 billion, which means customs duties on half of all goods imported into the United States from China.
Beijing has, of course, been reciprocating every time, now at the latest with a strike of five to ten percent on American goods worth 60 billion dollars.
China has promised to match the US attack for attack, and the world's second largest economy will probably not lift the white flag with the first.
Making Washington descend means giving in to demands, but public submission to the United States will be too humiliating for the Chinese President, Xi Jinping.
Experts say, however, that if Beijing plays its cards properly, the pressures surrounding the trade war with the United States can give a positive long-term payoff for China by reducing the interdependence between the two economies.
‘The fact that a rapid political decision either in Washington or in Beijing could create conditions that start economic upheavals in one of the countries is actually much more dangerous than the spectators have realized before,’ said Abigail Grace, a fellow researcher who focuses on Asia at the Center for New American Security, a think tank.
Syria “ready” for the return of refugees, says Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria says they're ready for the voluntary return of refugees and appeals for help to repatriate the country, which is razed after more than 7 years of war.
When he spoke in the United Nations National Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the situation in the country is improving.
‘Today, the ground situation is more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in combating terrorism’, he says.
The state continues to rebuild the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
All conditions now provide for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and their livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million acids have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
In addition, there are six million people still living in the country who need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime will accept aid to rebuild the devastated country.
But he underlined that there would not be accepted conditional assistance or assistance from countries that supported the uprising.
Europe secures Ryder Cup wins in Paris
Team Europe has won the 2018 Ryder Cup after defeating Team USA with a final result of 16,5 against 10,5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six times in succession on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the throne when the Danish team captain Thomas Bjørn got the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
The U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who played during large parts of the tournament, avoided his tea-beats in the water at par-3, 16th holes, and had to see himself turned off by Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari was brilliant at all his rounds and became 1 out of 4 golfers who have ever gone 5-0-0 since the tournament got its current design in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was knocked out 5 and 4 of the lowest ranked player on the European team, Thorbjørn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's most ranked player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter from England, who may have played his last Ryder Cup final.
With all eight Ryder Cup tournaments behind them, Spanish Sergio Garcia became the most winning Europeans of the tournament over the ages with 25.5 career points.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t stop.
It's been a tough year.
I'm so grateful that Thomas picked me out and had faith in me.
I'm very, very happy to get back the cup.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I could be of help," said an emotional Garcia after the European winner.
He leaves the baton to his compatriot John Ram, who beat the American golf legend Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in single games on Sunday.
"I'm incredibly proud to beat Tiger Woods – I followed that man closely in his youth," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 career points in the Ryder Cup.
A strange statistic for one of the biggest golfers ever, who has won 14 major titles, just turned off Jack Nicklaus.
Team United States spent the whole weekend finding the fairways, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-precision golf throughout the tournament.
United States team captain Jim Furyk spoke up after a disappointing achievement for his troops, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
It was moments this morning when we put pressure on Europe.
We threw ourselves.
The hat off for Thomas.
He's a great team captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We want to regroup, I want to work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and I want to look ahead.
I love these 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their team captain.
You just have to take off your hat.
We were beaten."
