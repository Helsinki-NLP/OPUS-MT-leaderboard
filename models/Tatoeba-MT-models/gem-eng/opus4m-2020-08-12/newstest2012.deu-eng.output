No liberating amendment for Tymoshenko by Parliament
The Ukrainian Parliament today refused the request to abolish the paragraphs on the basis of which opposition leader Yulia Timoshenko had been convicted in the context of a revision of the Criminal Code.
The new regime, which could have paved the way for the release of the detained ex-prime minister, was rejected by the honourable Members at the second reading of the request to alleviate the penalties for economic crimes.
Timoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison in October for concluding a allegedly adverse contract with Russia on the purchase of natural gas.
The judgment is not yet binding, and in December the appeal of the convicted shall be tried before the court.
Timoshenko himself refers to the judgment as a political revenge of the regime and also in the West the trial raised the suspicion of prejudice of the court.
The request to remove paragraph 365, on the basis of which the Prime Minister was condemned to be in the Criminal Code, was supported by 147 MEPs.
226 votes would have been necessary for its adoption.
Libyan Victory
The history of Libyan liberation struggle or Libyan rebellion already knows its losers.
Muammar al-Gaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is over.
Now only the victors are to be defined.
As usual in this region, victory in the elections Islamists, the question is only which - the temperate or the radical.
The National Transitional Council became familiar with the law of the Sharīża, of which one now has a certain idea with God.
Libya would go to the country without crime, because for theft one briefly chops off the hand.
Women, too, should quickly forget thoughts of emancipation, possible apostates should be executed, and so on.
Instead of a single dictator, society will in future be united by the Qur'an from intermarriage tribes.
In short - in Libya there will be an order that would hardly be imaginable and, above all, hardly desirable.
Just - our lifestyle is not the only one and objectively seen probably also not the best and would hardly suit the mentioned Libyans.
In this way, it is rather strange that the Muslim fighters were helped by the unbelieving dogs at all.
To their apologies, it may be only the fact that the air attacks of NATO were not directed by any general from America, but by Allah himself, whose omnipotence was praised after every successful achievement.
The victors in Libya?
We only took part in a change of heart, served the interests of Islam, and our politicians got rid of themselves in the person of the dictator of a political ally, without any benefit from this.
After the fresh and bad experiences from Afghanistan and Iraq, we preferred a military occupation of Libya.
As a result, the locals are starting to worry - namely the expulsion of the cruisers.
But do the oil companies get the black gold at a mock price without occupation?
Perhaps hardly and so the West can at last boast with the right to its unselfishness in the area of the protection of human rights.
If they do not corrupt the Sharīęa representatives.
Beginning of a new crisis era
France and the rest of Europe in the focus of investors.
On Tuesday, a statistical storm broke through Europe.
Each country published its GDP data for the third quarter.
The Czech economy stagnated compared with the previous quarter, Germany and France.
Today, however, the bond market breaks all records.
Investors not only keep an eye on Greece, but also Spain, France, Austria and other countries.
The statistical offices of the European zone, Germany, the Czech Republic and some other European countries published their preliminary forecasts on economic development in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP was expected to grow by 0.5%, which was 0.4% from France.
At the same time, both countries corrected their data for the second quarter, where Germany recorded higher growth than originally expected (growth of 0.3% instead of predicted 0.1%), while France granted a slight decrease of 0.1% (original data were only about stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 percent in the third quarter of this year compared to the previous year.
Compared to the previous quarter, however, gross domestic product stagnated and, according to the Czech Statistical Office, the trend of growth slowed down in economic performance was confirmed.
The results are thus worse than the forecasts of the analysts.
The most important events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 percent in the third quarter of this year compared to the previous year, but it stagnated compared to the previous quarter.
According to preliminary and seasonally overcalculated data, the German economy grew by 0.5 percent in the third quarter.
Throughout the euro area and in the EU, the economy grew by 0.2 percent between July and September compared to the previous quarter, which is consistent with the expectations of analysts.
The Greek economy declined by 5.2 percent compared to the previous year.
The return on its 10-year government bonds increased by 28.45%.
The yields of Italian and Spanish government bonds rose to their critical limits.
Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium and other countries are also beginning to feel problems...
The return on Czech government bonds remains below 4%, even if the situation in the region deteriorates.
In Germany, voices are voiced, the ECB should become the creditor of the last instance.
The Czechs qualified for EURO
In Montenegro they won 1:0 and now celebrate their qualification for 200 million
The football selection has mastered the hardest task of the whole season!
Thanks to a well-appointed gatekeeper Čech and a magnificent gate of Petr Jiráček she won in Montenegro 1:0.
With a great deal of luck, Czech football was able to defend its luxurious advantage from the home game and will once again not be missing from the European Championship.
IHNED.cz followed the ascent game in a detailed report.
Little excitement in the first half and a huge portion of luck in the second.
The Czech selection also won quite happily 1:0 thanks to the weakness of the home team, a brilliant Čech's and the hero of the day Jiráček in Montenegro and has therefore redeemed their ticket for the football-EM.
Also because of the precise defense game of the Czech team, they only put more pressure on the Montenegrins in the second half of the year.
The pitchers of the game were Damjanovic and Vucinic, who shot two giant chances.
Thanks to an excellent Petr Čech, the Czech selection will therefore join the European Championships next year, it is also gratifying that the national football team will receive a prize of about 200 million.
From the first few minutes, rather combative football was played.
Both teams combined long and so was played mainly around the middle line.
In the second half, too, the pressure of the home team remained off, and the large reductions in the penalty area were successfully prevented by the Czech defense.
Iranian students are ready to die for the core program of their country.
They formed a living shield.
Some hundreds of university students formed a living shield around a core object in Iran.
With this gesture, they wanted to demonstrate their support for their country's core programme before a possible Israeli attack.
The students had prayed in front of the object on Tuesday afternoon and then proclaimed death to the USA and Israel.
On Tuesday, a few hundred students from the University of Isfahan formed a lively shield around the Isfahan nuclear technology center, where uranium is processed.
They wanted to know that they were willing to protect their country's core programme, if necessary with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) recently noted in its report that Iran had long since failed to give up its efforts for a nuclear weapon.
In Israel, too, there is talk of a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
Students had prayed at noon in front of the entrance to the complex and then proclaimed death to the USA and Israel.
According to the Israeli press, in the case of an attack that is intended to paralyze the Iranian nuclear programme, the Israeli press would also be targeting the nuclear enrichment plant in Nathan's attack target from the Isfahan centre.
The menu of a obese child: it does not breakfast and eats for dinner sausage
More than a third of children from 9 to 13 have overweight problems, with 9 percent of all students and 5 percent of all children being overweight.
Current surveys have shown - adipose children usually come from families with unhealthy lifestyles.
This shows once again how important for the healthy development of a human being is the environment in which he grows up and is the examples surrounding him.
On the tables of adipose children, sausages are up to half more often on the table than in families where normal-weight children live.
More than 19 percent of overweight children had fries for dinner on the eve of the Enlightenment campaign under the motto "Adipositas is not a coincidence".
In families with Dickerchen sports are not exactly one of the favourite jobs, but as far as the majority of today's students are concerned - only 15 percent answered that their parents find themselves at least once a week for active exercise.
Survey among 900 children
The survey took place last year towards the end of the school year, in which almost 900 children from primary schools were interviewed throughout the Czech Republic.
This was already the second year of the action "Adipositas is not a coincidence", which is supported by the General Health Insurance Fund and the company Unilever.
So far, more than 12 thousand students from 4th and 8th classes have participated in the project.
Unhealthy food and lack of exercise in the family are crucial factors that are responsible for the alarmingly increasing number of overweight or even obesity children.
"For example, only half of the children surveyed indicated five times a day to eat breakfast-second breakfast-vesper dinner-one of the main conditions for a healthy diet," says one of the survey results.
No breakfast and sausage for dinner
Experts point out that even relative small things, such as the regular breakfast time of the family, are important for the healthy development of a child.
In the Czech Republic, however, only 23 percent of the students' families have breakfast.
And - in most families everyone has breakfast alone.
The worst was the finding, which is not breakfast at all in every tenth family.
Breakfast is considered to be the cornerstone of a healthy daily diet.
The survey test showed, among other things, that many times unhealthy fries are consumed in the families of overweight children.
And almost everyone - regardless of weight - drinks sweet lemonade every day (70 percent)
Although more than 40 percent of the children surveyed are sportsmen, only less than half of their parents do so - only 15 percent.
Compose your own menu
Another part of the survey enabled selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools), from offered opportunities according to appetite and opinion, to prepare their own food plan.
"What Czech children prefer between 12 and 15 in terms of diet is far from the ideal of a healthy diet.
Among their favorite dishes were many flour dishes, meat dishes and, of course, sweet foods.
"Alarming is above all the great popularity of sweet lemonade", is emphasized in the final report on this survey.
At lunch, that is, the main course, doughnuts won just before poultry.
Hull fruit almost didn't like the children at all and also the popularity of fish and vegetable dishes as lunch was very small.
Returning to Health
At the same time, however, the survey also showed that the children are quite willing to change their eating habits when they get the right information.
"The survey participants' control group, which completed the questionnaire after completing the enlightening lecture "Adipositas is not a coincidence", was in many cases a clear shift in preferences towards the principles of healthy nutrition", is mentioned in the results of the project.
This was evident, for example, in the sweet limos, where many children began giving priority to ordinary water.
The children also crossed the questionnaire much more often poultry or fish as the main course of the day and were willing to eat less dumplings or sweet foods.
Pros claim - a stylist must also be a good psychologist
In the introductory article on how stylists learn, I had tasted a bit that this was a bit too much fabric for the beginning.
I had no idea what was coming.
Lectures by three professionals from the industry, clothing of problematic figures and a seminar on how the "on the square" works.
It's gonna get worse.
The closer the examination moves, the more information and practical tasks are ahead of us.
But even if the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, it is still fully documented.
This time, we debated with director Alena (no man is taking part in the course), how to attract a woman who does not have an ideal proportional figure.
And at least that's most of us.
One has too short a neck, the other too young a figure without proper curves and yet others are chubby.
It is up to the stylist to visually casque wide shoulders, extend the neck or conjure up the necessary curves.
We also received tips on how to dress a type of woman like Jennifer Lopez - i.e. with big busts, wide hips and narrow waist - pretty and figure-y, without it acting too provocative.
For example, if the difference between waist and hips is so big that the skirt or pants really don't fit, you should at least have a piece cut to the size.
You will certainly not regret this, for well-sitting clothing is simply priceless.
In such a tailor-made skirt, one feels much better than in one of the bars, which is always high and slippery, in the waist, etc.
Boyish figures can in turn allow themselves to wear clothing with wrinkles, constructions, applications, embroidery or rafting.
With this amount of information and figure types I am glad that I have a whole week to let everything go through my head thoroughly.
And yet I'm afraid it's almost impossible to make it in the light of the assigned homework.
Each of the students was awarded a prize for which they should design suitable outfits - daywear and evening robes.
In doing so, we should take into account the current appearance, the fashion style of the corresponding star and its character type.
I'm supposed to "dress" Miranda Kerr, who you might know from Victoria's Secret campaign.
I rejoice inside, for it is much better for me personally than to attract Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who has probably increased to the hundred kilos in recent times (well, that's a bit exaggerated), or also young Selena Gomez.
We are supposed to cut out the clothes from magazines or search the Internet, print them out and then edit them graphically.
In the "Moodboard", as the whole result is called, then our very personal style and our relationship to graphic design should be expressed.
It is very important to also think about the graphic side of the styling.
The stylist not only physically attracts the models, but also designs the so-called product page in the journals (according to specific specifications, for example trend handbags, coats, etc.).
The stylist and designer Mario Kameník told us about this.
But that's not until Sunday.
That means that a stylist must have a good overall overview.
The Saturday lecture, filled with information on the types of figures, was spiced up by three visitors from the industry:
by the stylist Jan Pokorný, by the fashion creator Jakub Polanka and by the fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is illusion and that a stylist should be able to take advantage of this.
And a sent stylist can work with a single piece of clothing in quite different ways.
The magic word is called variability.
For example, you can wear a Trenchcoat as usual over the jeans, i.e. like a T-shirt or coat, but you can also wear it on the naked body, wear heels for it and wear it as a dress.
It is enough to squeeze up the sleeves or collars and the whole look looks quite different.
"Play with it," he stressed.
But most came to me the following advice: "First you must know the rules perfectly."
"Only then can you hurt them," said Jakub.
Finally, I realize why we have to break all these doctrines, what to combine with and why, even if you often get to see quite different things in fashion journals.
Not to mention fashion shows.
Thanks to photographer Ben I now know that a stylist must have prepared much more clothing variants than he finally photographed.
So you have to be prepared for a fashion story with ten pages (speak ten outfits) to style at least fifteen.
And also that the clothing on the photo in combination with other accessories sometimes looks quite different than in reality.
So you have to count on all of this in the design of the outfit.
That image and style sometimes make up half of the success, also confirmed to us by Jan Pokorný.
You just have to look at Madonna, a not exactly brilliant singer, from which image and marketing have made a world star.
In the Czech Republic, the services of a stylist are rather reserved.
Also known personalities often think this is money thrown out (the main thing is that I bring something as I look at it is secondary).
And if any of us can be styled, then we should expect that he or she will probably force us to have a completely different (smaller) size than he or she really needs.
Then you just have to google to find out for sure that the boulevard press writes, the corresponding celebrity has returned to or decreased, etc.
Jan and Mario set our hearts on Sunday not to believe that a stylist only needs to focus on fashion and then to "build up" the outfit.
In his work he must communicate above all with the people he is silent and he must be a weaver psychologist.
Appreciate people without offering themselves and standing by their opinions.
"If any manager orders us to see their wardrobe and add nice pieces, then we can't clear out the whole closet and say - my God, that's terrible."
"You have to find at least a few praiseworthy things to which you recommend what you can wear for them," says Mario.
He also showed us in concrete terms what such a so-called "place bag" must contain.
So a bag that is tied to the waist and in which you carry all the necessary propriets.
In addition to such clear things as scissors, roll-offs for hair removal or safety needles, it also contains such utensils as a nylon thread (which helps the stylist to photograph products, such as handbags or hats), special clips with which the clothes are caught in the back if they are too large (stitches or other clamps are prohibited so that the fabric does not break) and, of course, sewers.
In order not only to listen but also to try something practical, we learned how to glue shoes properly.
Even when photographing in the studio, where the floor is right, you can damage the shoe sole, shut it out.
We glued and glued...
With the scissors, you can't even touch the shoes so you don't damage them.
So you really have to be smart.
Mario delighted me by praising my "creation" without restrictions.
The skill mentioned is not exactly my strength.
All of this was only the fraction of what we got to hear at the second weekend continuation course.
One thing has now become clear to me - to devote oneself to styling at a professional level is not a child's game.
V Need for Speed: "The Run" - the illegal race across America
Review
The originally carefree journey is made through a series of completely avoidable, dilettant errors to the routine journey to the early shift.
Although it was possible to fulfill the ambitions to a large extent, what good is it if obviously no one wanted to do a little more.
Even before he came to the barn tables, the new part with the subtitle "The Run" aroused high expectations.
After all, he promised to move the already old series of games "Need for Speed" back into a new dimension and in the playable demonstrations he did not seem to be just one of many action racing games.
We were also curious about how the passages that have been introduced fail, in which the main protagonist gets out of the car and continues on foot.
But how you're used to it at NFS is in the end a lot different from what you expected.
Sure - potentially it is quite decent arcade races, but overall the game is narrowed by some unnecessary errors that are present in this series for more or less a few years.
So it's actually not a mistake anymore, but rather a sign of the incomprehensible laziness of the game developers.
The adventure begins very well.
For the first time, it is introduced into history, whose main character Jack has certain personal problems; the only solution seems to be to participate in an illegal race across America.
In San Francisco, that is, on the west coast, you get on the steering wheel - with the task of being the first in New York.
The basic idea contains a whole series of interesting elements.
The entire route is divided into ten stages and into more than fifty individual races.
This means that each race is held on a different route and that the individual stages take place in different, sufficiently different and interesting environments.
You don't have the impression that game would always offer the same thing.
Some environments are still very nice to look at, although the technical level of the graphics does not go beyond that of the previous parts of the series.
So nothing world-moving.
But the ride through the desert, through the autumn landscape or high up through deep snowy landscape seemed visually very pleasant.
Occasionally, untypical elements bring a little variation into the individual races.
In the desert, for example, you are surprised by a desert storm that greatly limits your vision.
In the mountains again one must be kept in hell that one is not spilled by an avalanche.
By the way, the individual races are installed quite well in a row.
It's only a few, but it's enough.
For a while you try to overtake the prescribed number of opponents (in principle a classic race), then you have time to pick up (classic race against the stopwatch), then you expect another personal duel with a single opponent.
And the police, who want to mess up the whole thing, get involved.
A novelty is passages where Jack leaves the car.
This is more about certain interactive animations in which Jack flees from someone and where the player needs to help him by pressing the right button at the right moment.
So nothing complicated.
However, it is surprising that there are far fewer passages like that in the game than one would expect (concretely only three).
In the end, this is more of an advantage, because at least this element has no chance of getting bored - it belongs in the context of the above-mentioned elements that make the game more varied.
The driving model steps into the footsteps of the previous parts.
In other words, from today’s point of view, it does not rip out trees, but one could not claim that it would be bad.
If you're looking for realistic simulations, you have to look elsewhere.
But an action-loaded race will continue to be quite just the right driving model, even though one could find better in competition.
Until then, everything is in good order.
Real problems only show up after a certain time.
In contrast to the driving model, the collision model is not entirely O.K.
A game of this kind can hardly be expected to calculate complicated deformations and collisions, but if you have virtually no impact on any object, how the car behaves, then obviously not everything is fine.
Typical example: When you overtake or pass oncoming cars, you "strip" the other car easily in some places, but in other, almost identical situations you get into the sledding and twist wild pirouettes.
Or take the car straight to scrap.
Thanks to the restart system, it doesn't matter any more, but it's annoying all the time.
The restarts are solved this way: if you have total damage or land far away from the track, then you throw the game back to the last stop of the track.
Only - in each race you only have five restarts.
Once you've exhausted it, everything starts from the beginning.
So the restarts are more like a tool, in case something doesn't work, but you should rather not rely on it.
Sometimes, however, it doesn't even help to restart, because nothing helps but to learn the critical section from the head.
Very unpleasant is that the same things often happen at the same places.
For example, some curves have to be driven in a very specific way, otherwise you just don't fit through.
Otherwise, you will always meet "civil" cars in the same configuration at the appropriate location, no matter if you arrive as first or fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
This is particularly annoying in situations when you see that the opponent comes by in front of a playful car, but until you get there yourself, the cars are already in such a position that you have to bypass them or brake them.
And it doesn't matter when you get there, because everything is designed so that this situation always comes close to your nose.
The competitors have further advantages.
Throughout the game there are a few places where you are always overtaken in the same place by the same opponent and again here without regard to the time.
At the craziest, this is at the end of the game on the long bridge that you happen in the opposite direction.
The opponent obviously has to get one out of here on the devil.
And if he's already in front of you, he'll take a look at you, of course, so that at first you drive your own car a few times in lump.
Of course - you just want to make the game more exciting and exciting but this intention is so clear that it quickly misses you the joy of the game.
And that's a shame, because despite a simpler driving model, the game is quite entertaining and sometimes even so action-loaded that you almost don't know where one of the heads is.
And in principle, it doesn't matter what "guilt" is about - the concept with fifty unique routes, the arrangement of the races in a way that can't cause boredom, or something quite different...
An unusual idea is also the change of cars during the race.
You should not overlook the gas stations on the track, because right here you can change the car, although in most cases the car you have is enough.
The cars are divided into three categories.
The sports cars are well suited for the urban areas, the strong American limousines for the straight highways and exotic super sports cars for the technical rides, for example on the Serpentines in the mountains.
Hand in hand with the mode of the game history goes also the task mode (challenges) - i.e. the races in the individual locations that you know from history.
There are not only medals here, but also experience points for your own profile, which is common to the tasks (challenges) and history.
In order to reach the higher level of the driver, different objects have to be unlocked: from the car to the backgrounds for the profile.
This is at the same time connected to the Autolog online function, which inter alia compares its own scores with those of other players and also provides other collective functions.
One of the other incomprehensible carvers is a situation in the last race of history.
Here you come by car into a subway tunnel (meinwegen), where you rest on the tracks in the dark for a long time (meinwegen).
The tacho looks at numbers between 150 and 200 km/h (meinwegen), but there suddenly comes from behind a subway and uncompromisingly drives to scrap.
In our editorial work we will probably argue for a long time about whether this was a blackout of the game designers or whether the authors think we are so stupid.
The technical side is not overwhelming but at least the visual overall impression is in most cases quite appealing and sometimes even brilliant.
It is all the more annoying that at some exciting moments the frequency of image repetition slows down and this sometimes quite dramatic.
This concerns, however, in particular, the accidents with a larger number of participants, where a continuous FPS does not benefit anyhow.
The sound playback is as far as O.K. and the soundtrack is tasteful.
In an effort to address as wide a scale as possible rather to young audiences, a soundtrack a lä was created "by everyone something" - but who buys such a game because of the music?!
The general impression of Need for Speed: The Run? The feelings are rather mixed.
If the game were not narrowed by the above-mentioned completely unnecessary mistakes, we could have argued with the chest tone of conviction that The Run is the best piece of NFS in recent years.
But that's how the game seems.
In itself a great pleasure, but one should be prepared for one to face these errors with the power of airport lights.
Concert of the "students of the Velvet Revolution" with singing ensembles of Karlsuniversity
The Festival Festa Academica now offers for the third time the refreshment of the World Student Day with the anniversary of the Velvet Revolution and this as well as music experience.
During the festival, the twenty professional and university choirs will be presented.
The festival focuses on the two concerts that take place on 17 November.
"Karlsuniversity has a large share in the festival."
"Among the participants is also the choir of the Faculty of Education and the Faculty of Humanities Studies, and the Festival Committee also includes the Rector Václav Hampl," said Jakub Čaloun, head of the organization team.
The absolute highlight of the festival is the public concert of specialist school choirs, which will take place on 17 November from 2 p.m. on the square in front of the National Technical Library in Dejvice.
The program includes the composition of the important Czech jazz player Karel Růžička "Celebration Jazz Mass".
In the evening hours, the concert "Students of the Velvet Revolution" (Studenty samtu) takes place in the gala rooms of the Volkshaus in Vinohrady, where choirs of Karlsuniversity are also performed.
Festa Academica aims not only to celebrate the World Student Day and to commemorate the 22nd anniversary of the Velvet Revolution, but to present choral music at the highest level to the public and to promote creative cooperation among young people.
The main organizer is the association of Czech choirs in cooperation with the Johannes Kepler-Gymnasium.
Bohuslav Svoboda, the mayor of the capital Prague and Václav Hampl, took over the patronage of the entire event.
The festival takes place from 16 to 20 November in Prague and in Pardubice.
Apart from concerts, the schedule also includes numerous music meetings, student happenings, matinees and other events.
Detailed information is available on the website of the festival www.festaacademica.cz
EU Ambassador Vicenová:
The Czechs have the reputation of negativeists and Eurosceptics
"The Treaty of Lisbon has brought the balance among the individual institutions out of the lot."
I would not have expected such a hard war to burn."
"It will take five, six years until the waves are smoothed and all of them get used to their new role," began Milena Vicenová, the Czech Ambassador to the European Union, quite sharply speaking at the Faculty of Law.
How seriously she takes the motto "understanding and open about Europe" she showed in the first part of her lecture, in which she managed to describe the individual institutions of the EU and their mutual relations in such a way that she could have envied so many of the lecturers of the Faculty of Law of Charles University.
Ms Vicenová also praised the new permanent President of the Council of Europe Herman Van Rompuy:
"At first, criticism became loud that he was too inconspicuous - a gray official who had not grown such a role, but I have to say that it has struck everyone's breath how well he has accepted the matter.
"He is a human being who manages to listen patiently to twenty-seven member states, communicate with them, and who, above all, has clear ideas about how to proceed with the EU.
The new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy then explained to her as an answer to the question: Who is this really - the European Union? What number should I call?", that is, as an important step towards the agreement and better readability of EU policies towards states such as China or India.
No one wants to ban our oil cap quartz
Ms Vicenová also devoted herself to the agenda for the European Union to live and to live in the near future.
The Czech Presidency of two years ago described it as a success.
The Czechs would have mastered the financial crisis and the gas crisis and also organised the Eastern Partnership Summit.
The case of the government during the Presidency was described as a major negative one which had seriously damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU currently has all the hands to do.
In the words of the Ambassador, it was not only the Presidency, but also the subsequent crisis, which has not yet been overcome, which is quite hectic.
And there is still a need to approve the EU's seven-year budget, which makes the matter much more complicated precisely because of today's economic situation.
Whether it will be a slim and economical budget, which sectors will be given priority, which countries will be more and which will be less supported - all of this is now on the agenda.
The ambassador also recalls her own slogans with which she came to Brussels: "Intelligible about Europe".
"If I don't like something, then it's horrible abbreviations, foreign words and professional jargon that nobody understands.
How should I, as a citizen, know whether you really think about crumbs or round cucumbers in Brussels and different sized bananas or whether someone really wants to ban the quartz?
It would also have liked to use the EU's soil to get more Czechs in European institutions.
Europe of two or different speeds in view
In the opinion of the EU ambassador, the Czechs are called to be Eurosceptics who perceive more the negative than the positive sides of the matter.
The poor representation of Czechs in European institutions is all the more annoying.
Many factors are to blame for this, including the detention of our candidates, their inability to write motivational letters and, last but not least, the weak support of the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, she also highlighted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group, the so-called V4.
"Believe me, if a Pole or Hungarian comes to me and a Slovak is nearby, then the Frenchman next to me says, "Hey, what are you putting together the heads - is that your V4 again?" and makes a pretty acid mine.
According to Ms Vicenové, in the future, the EU is primarily expecting tough rules on the budgetary policies of the Member States.
As a much more real, as a "European Federation", it sees the concept of a Europe of two or even different speeds.
"We have here the countries of the eurozone and the countries outside the eurozone.
"We have the Schengen area and we already have the Institute of Reinforced Cooperation."
"For the first time it has been said that only the countries that want it to work together and those who do not want it should stand quietly away."
"There will be more and more such institutions, which ultimately leads to a strong "Europe of different speeds", she expects.
In this respect, it also acknowledged the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuyes in enforcing the principle that all issues having an impact on the EU as a whole should be discussed by all Member States and not only by the countries of the euro area.
Brand Story:
Innovator IBM enters the second century of its existence
If you wanted to look for a suitable word that the strategy of IBM is the most accurate, then this would probably be the word "longevity".
For the general public, IBM is the synonym for technological revolution, it is known as a modern company, although it has already been established for a century.
The basis for this longevity already laid her first boss - visionary Thomas J. Watson sen.
Already he represented the slogan, countless global problems could easily be solved if people were willing to think a little.
His slogan "Think!" thus became a trademark to play the life of the future giant (and at the same time the title of the internal journal, which IBM began to publish in 1935).
This was also the basis of Watsen's well-prepared corporate culture.
"For us from IBM, this long-term thinking means a continental movement towards the future.
IBM survived and was also successful for a whole century because it remained true to its principles and did not hesitate to change everything else around it.
This allowed us to transform the technologies, business and society in the course of our first century.
We hope that we will do even more in the next hundred years," said Samuel J. Palmisano, the current director of the company on the occasion of the anniversary.
Contemplative system
Watson has already been providing social care for his employees in the 1930s - in a similar way as the entrepreneur Baťa in Czechoslovakia: The IBM people had paid vacations as one of the first American employees, an insurance by the entrepreneur plus elegant uniforms as work clothes and a well-thought-out pay system for the best new and dealer.
IBM's long-term relationships with its customers are equally sophisticated.
The company was brilliant in talent promotion from the very beginning - as one of the first companies in the world, IBM lifted any discrimination - and was accordingly able to choose.
In line with this anti-discrimination strategy, the current plan that Palmisan at the top of IBM will be replaced by a woman next year - by Virginia Rometty.
She has been with IBM for thirty years, so far she has taken on the position of the chief executive for business, marketing and strategy.
IBM has been making so-called online brainstormings in recent years, out of which many future strategies and innovations grow.
No wonder - there are enough ideas, the company employs almost half a million people.
An institution with a good reputation
Their unwavering position in the business guarantees the company a strong image and this to the inside and outside.
"From the beginning, IBM had the concept of an institution rather than a mere technology company," said the Harvard Business School professor and the author of a book about IBM, Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps solve business problems using technologies," added George Colony of Consulting-Company Forrester Research.
As the company itself stresses, it is a difference to be present on the market only or to form it directly through this presence.
IBM - in the states of its logo because of its family called "Big Blue" has grown into one of the largest companies in the world in a century.
It is one of the most versatile technology companies at all - IBM develops hardware and software, infrastructures, hosting and consulting services in an incredible product range - from servers to nanotechnology.
Of all American technology companies, IBM has most patents and already five of its employees have been awarded the Nobel Prize.
His most famous inventions include ATMs, credit cards, financial swaps, barcode or the diskette.
With a market capitalisation of about $220 billion, IBM was the second largest technology company (also based on Apple) this year, with Microsoft being overtaken for the first time since 1996.
The look ahead
Not all products and innovations met the taste of today's customers - unfortunate were, for example, the attempt with its own OS/2 operating system, the online service Prodigy or also the computers IBM PC jr.
"Business is based on the forward movement, so you can't commit emotionally to the past," says Samuel J. Palmisano.
That's why IBM has no problem building its foundations on different platforms - and if they don't work, leave them again.
In contrast to the opponent Microsoft, which basically stands and falls with its operating system Windows.
Promising technologies
IBM's profits involve services, software and hardware to a maximum of one-fifth.
In 1990, hardware with more than fifty percent was the most represented.
Since 2000, IBM has sold low-profit assets worth 15 billion dollars, but at the same time it invested 58 billion dollars in the purchase of future-oriented technologies.
In these investments, IBM continues after 2008, when the modern financial crisis swept the world like a storm for the first time.
Here again, IBM remained faithful to the legacy of his first boss Thomas J. Watson, who increased his investment in the midst of the major global economic crisis.
So far, it seems that the company IBM survives the current crisis without any damage.
Since 2008, the value of IBM shares has increased by 120 percent rocket-like and the company's net profit is growing on a continental basis.
The company logo of IBM is: everything can be changed - just the values can't be changed.
This is also why it can be expected that this flexible giant will also cope with the next crisis.
IBM history: From cheese cutter to universal flights
Founded one hundred years ago in New York, the company IBM (International Business Machines) initially had a rather complicated name - Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
She took over the name IBM only in 1924 - originally it was a brand name for a branch in Canada and South America.
The foundation of the later company IBM laid the fusion of four companies whose history dates back to the 80s of the 19th century.
They had technologies such as the famous flashcards to register the start and end of work.
Charles Ranlett Flint was the architect of this new company, who was also the chairman of the Supervisory Board until 1930.
And it was Flint who hired Thomas J. Watson, the head of the competition company, to help him manage the company.
This leader then even put the founders of IBM in the shade - based on Watson's ideas to this day the invincible culture and identity of the company.
Watson managed the company until 1952.
IBM, as the name suggests, began with the production and distribution of all possible machines for the trade - from sausage and cheese cutters to cashier.
In the first four decades of running the company, Watson doubled its sales to nine million dollars and the company gradually expanded to all continents.
Watson was so indispensable to the company that he sat in the chief chair for forty years, only then he was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his leadership, IBM began to work on the development of artificial intelligence and also developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, technicians and computers from IBM helped manage NASA flights to Space - to Mercury and Saturn and in 1969 also the famous flight of man to the Moon.
Meanwhile, in 1964, IBM developed the first computer family with the same computer architecture - the series IBM System/360.
A classic PC, which specified the computer standard of that time, came on the market in 1981 under the name IBM 5150.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, but on the other hand, it bought the consultant part of the company PricewaterhouseCoopers and thereby entered into the business of consulting services and services with high added value.
The strategy that IBM has been paying off over the last three years is the concept of "Smarter Planet".
It embodies the intention to use technologies wisely in previously unplanned areas, for example to improve the situation in transport and urban administration.
In the commercial sector, IBM recently introduced the Smarter Commerce platform to help traders lead the entire commercial cycle.
IBM also has a strong history in the Czech Republic.
Already in 1932, IBM established a branch in Czechoslovakia - as the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, IBM ČR also operates a strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
The Central and Eastern European Centre is based in Prague, and there is also a world-level top research team that deals with voice recognition technology.
Darina Rychtářová over her unfaithful spouses:
Iveta - you can keep this donkey, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Rychtářová (53) says - now it's over!
After her husband Josef Rychtář (53) had become their lover from the protector of Iveta Bartošová (45), Darina remained hoping that Joseph would wake up from his pink dream and come home.
But now it is finally over with patience and for the rest of her life she has set clear rules.
"Josef can come home, but no more than my partner," D. Rychtářová explained.
When Darina Rychtářová had offered refuge to singer I. Bartošová in her own house, you probably wouldn't even have imagined the way things were going with her husband.
When Iveta moved back and forth on her urge after 30 days, Joseph immediately went with him.
Yes, he even publicly knew that he loved them.
In time, Darina resigned, even it seemed as if she wanted to make up with her unfaithful husband again - but now she finally gave him the running pass.
Rychytář doesn't care who his wife is sleeping with.
If Rychtář Iveta Bartošová should leave in the future, he will certainly not receive open arms at home.
"He is the biological father of my dreams and if he wants to decide his days in our common home, I will not chase him out."
"However, not as a beloved, lost old donkey, but as a person to whom I still have certain ties," said Mrs. Rychtářová; but she also said that she had already separated herself from him emotionally and remained alone on mutual decency.
The fact that Darina has locked him in the back door, Joseph has so far carried with dignity.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I'm staying with Iveta, that doesn't change anything."
"My wife wants a paper husband and I respect that."
"The company continues, I take care of the repairs, the garden, the property, I make the purchases."
"With Darina I'm having a normal conversation, we just don't share the bed," said J. Rychtář (the sheet) Blesk.
If Darina wants to find a new love, he doesn't want to stop her.
"We don't sleep with each other, so I don't care if she has a friend or who that is.
I realize it's my fault, I fell in love with Iveta, and that's why I take on any responsibility.
The worst female wrongdoers: what about you?
If you ask the men to call some typical female vices, they shake them out of their sleeves without exception.
Dear women, do you recognize yourself in the following lines, in which we let a few unsitted revue happen again, which causes the men to shed the blood in the veins?
Purchasing
Does her husband throw her to be a shopper?
Do you have to buy at least one hater every week?
Would you like to go shopping and may it be a bit more in the event of actions?
Then, in your case, it's really about a weakness.
Some women are at least aware of this and are trying to keep their shopping drive half under control.
But hand in hand, which woman already likes to stroll through a dress shop in search of a well-sitting coat and not try all (in all possible color combinations) in the cabin?
Even though shopping is a hobby for most women, for men it is often pure hell.
Think about how many times they've told their husband - you'd better stay out...
Permanent Dissatisfaction
"Am I not too thick?"
"I have to lose at least five kilos - should I start jogging or doing gymnastics?"
"Do I even like you?"
Does this seem familiar to them?
Yeah?
Then you will probably also be among the women who are really obsessed with what they look like.
This does not mean that you should let go, but many men react allergic to it when their wife constantly complains about their appearance.
The stronger gender is united - with increasing frequency of complaints, women are increasingly unbearable.
Order and cleanliness in the first place
It's a fight against windmills.
Clean windows, wipe tiles and dust, scrub the tub - and this at least twice a week.
If you're messing with your partner, because he's trampled on the clean tiles with dirty shoes again, you're peeling the kids, because the just-skinned sink is dirty again and because the glass door on the living room cabinet has fingerprints again, where does polishing make so much trouble?
If you are suffering from this kind of "deviant" then you should know that you must not exaggerate anything and that the order and cleanliness of family life are not the first.
This immeasurable purity fiddle can ultimately also damage the mutual relations and, above all, the tranquillity in the family.
Stitching
"Poor pants come into the laundry basket."
"Do you really want to put on the old socks tomorrow?"
"You don't just throw a wet towel on the floor."
If your partner is exposed to such a tirad, don't be surprised that this will bring him to the palm.
Of course that's not bad, they just want everything to have its order.
If the men knew this, the women might not have had to complain so much.
Clapsing and gossiping
Some women like to clatter and gossip, because behind their backs they are cuddled or even slandered or they are forged alliances.
Women are now focused on relationships, so they like to hate such issues, such as - who, where, with whom, how and why.
I guess each of us women has a little harmless chatter and gossip in store.
Hand to heart - it's probably all women's own.
But this is not to be confused with clattering calibres of calibre, to which nothing and no one is holy, which probably despise everyone in their surroundings and which pose a considerable danger to women's collectives in particular.
Jágr and Voráček helped Philadelphia win the victory with their assistants
The ice hockey tower Jaromír Jágr had a large share of the 5:3 victory of Philadelphia on the ice in Carolina with two assistants at the NHL Monday game and is thus again the most productive Czech player in the NHL.
In both cases, Claude Giroux, who added an assistant and was called the best player of the match, was a user of the nine-year-old ice hockey star.
Two assistants in the same game also recorded Jágr's co-player Jakub Voráček.
Jágr claimed after the game to journalists that he had giroux a great evening prophecy.
"Just before the game, I'll tell him that he's succeeding in a hat trick today."
I kind of felt that."
"Hin and again such a feeling overcomes," said Jágr, after whose action Giroux scored a goal at the first shot of the Flyers.
A little later, the second hit also had "a Czech track".
Voráček fought the puck behind the Hurricanes gate and presented it to the successful Maxim Talbot between the circles.
A second before the first third, home player Patrick Dwyer scored a short hand, but the second third then belonged to the flyer again.
Concrete Giroux.
In cooperation with Jágr, he scored his third hit, and then Wayne Simmonds directed his shot to the fourth goal.
"I love playing with him."
"I don't want to say that he's the best player in the league, but definitely he's one of the best three," said Jágr.
"I wouldn't have thought that at the end of my career, I was playing with such an ice hockey player as he did."
"I'm delighted."
"I'm cutting my game on me."
"All the years in the NHL my co-players set their game on me and now the spear turns around," smiled Jágr.
Carolina made the play a drama - through the hits of Tuoma Ruutua and once again Dwyer, who insisted on a penalty shot, it came to a gate.
Matt Read, however, prevented any further complication in which he was in excess of two against one successful.
"Excellent prongers still acted in our zone."
"He caught the puck, I took a ride and (Read) moved to distant posts."
"I tried to meet him and I'm glad it worked out," Voráček described the last hit of the game from his point of view.
This victory brought Philadelphia to the forefront of the Eastern Conference.
The Czech defender of Montreal Jaroslav Špaček injured himself in the game against Buffalo and retired in the second third due to an injury to the upper body.
In addition to their experienced Beck, the Candiens also fined their leadership an unforgotten in the penalty shot 2:3.
Tomáš Plekanec was unable to transform one of the shots.
More than the lost points, the coach of the home team probably hurt the high disease-related breakdown in the defensive - the game ended with only five defenders.
"That's bad."
"We only finished the encounter with a single experienced player, the rest were young players."
"But there's nothing that can be done, so we have to get through," said Jacques Martin.
"Every time we changed, one wave after another, and we didn't have anything to do with it."
"We should have made the game easier and brought the puck out of our third."
There were reserves here," said P.K. Subban, one of the defenders.
The Czech gatekeeper Ondřej Pavelec defended thirty shots from Tampa Bay and thus contributed significantly to the 5:2 victory over Winnipeg.
At the gates of the jets, which thus ended a series of five defeats, five different shooters had a share.
Trends in travel prices since 1989
Until 1989, there were only five approved state travel agencies in the then ČSSR: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autotourist.
At the time, the travel agencies sold mainly only travel to the socialist Eastern bloc countries, and in the West they were only allowed to choose.
And so Czech tourists traveled to the Baltic Sea (to the German Democratic Republic - the GDR), to the Soviet Union (Sochi on the Crimea Peninsula on the Black Sea), to Bulgaria and Romania on the Black Sea and to Hungary on the Balaton.
A slight exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when one was also allowed to travel to Yugoslavia, then Yugoslavia embarked on a pro-Western course and therefore the journeys to Yugoslavia were severely restricted.
A great paradox of those socialist times was that even citizens of the Eastern bloc (also Czechoslovakia) were not allowed to travel freely within the framework of the socialist countries.
For example, if a citizen of the ČSSR wanted to travel individually to Poland or even to the Soviet Union, he needed a so-called invitation letter, otherwise individual travel was not possible.
Even then, the travel agencies offered travel in the West, but then they had to take huge snakes or also spend the night in the sleeping bag in front of the travel agency, or at least have "good acquaintances" in the travel agency.
This was not the case for a long time.
The so-called foreign exchange pledge - the condition for an exit to the West - was given only "politically reliable" people - the others were not allowed to travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely exchangeable currency, so it would have been impossible to raise the necessary financial resources (western currency) for a trip to the West.
The vast majority of Czechs therefore spent their holidays in the country, no wonder that the Czechs bought themselves countless weekend houses and datschen - a habit that continues to this day.
The combined revolution of 1989 followed a travel revolution of the Czechs on foot.
While a holiday in the GDR or Bulgaria was the measure of all things until 1989, the Czechs spent 4.5 million of their foreign holidays in countries around the world last year.
A huge paradox, one of which is no longer aware of today, is the fact that one could not travel to the most popular holiday country of the Czechs - Croatia until 1989 at all, because it was part of the then Yugoslavia.
From the beginning of the 1990s onwards, the obligation to pay foreign exchange was lifted in the neighbouring countries of Western Europe, resulting in a huge wave of short visits, especially to Vienna in Austria and to Germany.
The Czechoslovakians could not get enough of their travels to the West for a long time, everyone wanted to have been there for at least a few days.
So the Czech holidaymakers slept when traveling to Paris in the tent in the park, because who had already had the money for accommodation in the hotel or in a pension.
A typical feature of travel abroad from the Czech Republic was at that time a packed trunk full of canned, beer and permanent sausage.
Another important milestone was the introduction of the freely exchangeable Czech crown - after decades our tourists could finally buy the Western currency freely.
Our level of living and thus our average salaries also increased, which in 1997 meant another important moment.
Thanks to the increased demand for travel, the travel agencies began to prepare charter flights regularly after 1997, which made flights incredibly affordable compared to the past, thanks to the possibility of negotiating volume discounts.
By the end of the 1990s, the Czechs, with the exception of the United States, had already had currency-free payments with all the highly developed countries of the world, making travel even easier.
Another interesting moment in the history of "post office" travel came in 2000, when thanks to the high demand the first direct charter flight to an exotic country was completed - to Thailand.
Since then, charter aircraft with Czech passengers have been flying directly from the Czech Republic every year to distant sunny countries; this year, twelve exotic destinations are flown directly from the Czech Republic.
To the 100 Tsd Czechs travel every year to exotic countries!
Another important moment in the era that marked our "post-revolutionary" development came in 2008.
On November 17th, 2008, the US lifted the visa requirement for Czech tourists, which made our country definitely among the highly developed countries of the world.
In 2008 the Czechs spent for the first time more than half of their holiday abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in their history they spent more than 15 TZK per head for a single holiday including the costs at the resort.
The general meeting is supposed to find a new chairman - again a platt threatens.
For almost five months, Czech football has no chairman and threatens that Ivan Hašek's successor at the top of the Czech Football Association (FAČR) will not even be known after the extraordinary general meeting in Nymburk on Thursday.
To date, there has been no agreement as to which electoral system should be elected.
And without this, no vote on the three potential successors is possible at all.
Three interested people want to manage the Czech football - Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
In June, Hašek resigned from his position, inviting his colleagues to join forces and to find a strong personality who could lead the football in the future.
Only - in the era of Hašek did the old querels break out again between the two federation chambers, which cannot agree on a common candidate.
This turned out to be very clear on 16 September when the new chairman was to be elected.
The delegates to the Annual General Meeting had come to the People's House in the Prague Smíchov district for no result, and this was not just about the election itself.
One could not even agree on who is actually entitled to vote at the plenary session - only the constitutional representatives or also the officials with a proxy.
At least a partial agreement was reached on this one point, which was also supported by the recommendation of the Institute for State and Law, which, in the view of a representative on a mandate basis, was not admissible.
However, disputes over the electoral system continue.
Nor did the Executive Committee bring any more clarity into the matter at its meetings, whether ordinary or extraordinary, in principle nothing else is on the agenda at all.
Even though the views on the election changed a few times - the neuralgical point remained the same.
The question is: how to proceed in the 3rd round to avoid a patch situation?
"The issue is whether to proceed in accordance with the statutes, or whether to find a completely different model," said Dušan Svoboda, one of the three vice-presidents of the FAČR, who represents professional football in management.
According to the statutory model, in the third round the candidate who receives the greater percentage of support in the chamber for which he is running wins.
Murders are allegedly willing to accept the compromise that the candidate who receives the higher number of votes from both chambers wins.
The Czech side, in turn, is subject to the condition that the winner receives at least one-third majority in this percentage vote counting.
"Then the two preliminary rounds have no sense at all, this mode would question the entire two-chamber concept," Svoboda understands the objections of the Moravian side, which it would be best not to bend the electoral system but to choose according to valid statutes.
Surprisingly, Tomáš Paclík also agrees, even though it appears that the electoral system is probably the best way to meet Pelta from all candidates.
"My wish is to be elected as far as possible after the Statute."
"In order not to create nonsense alternatives, as at the last Annual General Meeting," said the owner (the football club) Victoria Plzeň, who for the first time is running for the first time and distinguished himself mainly from Pelta in his statements.
Pelta, however, remains optimistic.
In his opinion, the new chairman will be known in Nymburk and he believes that the candidates will also cooperate constructively in the future.
"The potential qualification of the national football team for the European Football Championships today would certainly contribute to calming the moods."
"If football is only riding on the Euphoric wave, then there is also a greater willingness to cooperate," says the Jablonec official, who brings the greatest experience of all three adepts and this at both professional and regional level.
Rajchl's more reserved.
"I hope for an agreement, but the situation is unfortunately ambiguous."
"This is not a matter between the people of Bohemia and Moravia, but there are certain efforts to "define" the rules for their own purposes."
"That's why re-blocking at the Annual General Meeting is not excluded."
"I hope, however, that the common sense will ultimately win," Rajchl said.
Just - a lot of time for all sides to agree no more.
Some negotiations should allegedly take place directly in Montenegro, but who knows if the football generality will be complete until the qualifying game at all.
The charter plane, with which Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl were supposed to fly to Podgorica, could not even start in Prague in the morning due to a technical disturbance, and so one was anxiously looking for a replacement variant, as one still brings a part of the executive committee to the venue of the Barrage-Hinspiel.
Finally, the meeting at ministerial level, to which it is supposed to come on Wednesday, is certainly crucial.
Josef Dobeš, the Minister for Education, Youth and Body Education, would have liked to have moved the divided parties within the country's largest sports association to reach an agreement.
There is a lot at stake: state grants, the credibility of the Czech football and the upcoming general meeting of the ČSTV, which is to show the new direction to Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka.
Paclík is fighting for the position of the chairman because he does not see a suitable candidate
If Tomáš Paclík, the head of the Pilsner football team, could have made up a strong candidate before the extraordinary general meeting, who would have fulfilled all his ideas about the new chairman of the football association of the Czech Republic (FAČR), he would not have taken up the fight for this top position at all.
"If there were a good candidate, I would fight for him and renounce the choice."
"But in the current situation, it was not possible to find such an adept," said Paclík ČTK.
The main reason for Paclík to go to Duell with Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rajchl is to prevent the alleged favourite of the election, Pelta, from reaching the top of the FAČR.
Paclík also emphasises that in the event of his victory, he intends to exercise the office of Chairman only one year, i.e. until 2013, until the date of the Annual General Meeting.
In the position of the chairman, he would have liked to have seen an experienced top manager who was not too much involved in football.
"I spoke personally to some of the people in question."
"Nearly to believe that some of them told me they didn't want to identify with Czech football at the moment.
"Such views would have liked to have changed," he said.
Most of all, Paclík allegedly disrupts the connection of Pelta's with the chairman of the Pilsner District Football Association Roman Berbr, a man with a controversial reputation who is regarded as a powerful lobbyist behind the scenes, with the ability to influence delegation voting on general meetings.
For Paclík it is therefore unacceptable that Pelta should have the chairman's position.
"In his victory the present state would be preserved and in Czech football it did not progress at all."
"The support of Berbr, a clever businessman, would be twice as bad for football," said Paclík.
He also points out that some time ago Pelta's name fell in connection with phone calls for investigation in a corruption affair, but Pelta became more and more ardent.
"I don't know what prestige a victory of Pelta should bring to football."
"And how would we stand in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said řekl Paclík, who said his earlier statement, "he will sell the Pilsner football club if Pelta becomes chairman," but already sees something more relaxed.
However, if Paclík were to win the Thursday election, he could well imagine future cooperation with Pelta.
Similarly, another candidate - Rajchl, who had supported Paclík before the Annual General Meeting in October, also thinks that he ended with a failure.
"He (Pelta) would be the first one I would go to."
"He has great skills."
"I could imagine him well, for example, as head of the national team."
"But I don't think he's capable of running the league as a manager."
"I don't have my nose on matters that I don't understand," said Paclík, who in September had caused him to stand at the head of the Arbitration Commission with Lu?ěk Macela, who replaced Dagmar Damková.
Paclík himself claims that he feels the role of the chairman of the League has grown.
He is also the head of Pilsen, who, with his support in May, celebrated the first triumph in the league.
"I have the power to change something in the football environment and to contribute to a certain cultivation of it."
"In order to limit the influence of certain interest groups that tend to influence disciplinary and appeal commissions, which up to the worst of situations," said Paclík, who does not make a heath out of his antipathy, for example, towards the Sparta chief Daniel Křetínský.
As one of his priorities, he saw the strengthening of relations between the FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which he would lobby among the political leaders for more money from the lottery tax to flow into sport.
"This is one of the crucial things the new chairman should devote himself to."
"When it comes to the taxation of gambling, as the political parties declare, then I understand their argument, but they also have to say clearly where the money is going," he said.
His connection to the Pilsner Club also does not consider Paclík to be a handicap, although he emphasizes himself, the chairman of the FAČR must be "super-partisan".
Pelta in turn is connected to Jablonec, Rajchl with the Prague Dukla.
"That's not exactly ideal."
"It doesn't make much sense to transfer my shares in Pilsner Club to a third party in order to return after a year and a half," said Paclík.
Pelta promised new statutes of the FAČR, which will end a platt-situation in the future.
Two days before the general meeting of the Football Association, one of the candidates for the Presidency, Miroslav Pelta, promised to make a strong commitment in the event of his election to the FAČR's new statute, which in the future excludes disputes about the electoral system from the outset.
Prior to Thursday's debate in Nymburk, the Jablonec official is confident and believes that the election campaign will certainly defuse itself with the possible success of the Czech election.
Pelta had already promised before the unrealized election in September that he would concentrate on the national team and the acquisition of finance in the event of his election.
He decided only at the last moment to take part in the election before the last general meeting, and so the two-month break would help him defend his ideas about the leadership of the football and introduce him in a broader context.
"People at all levels devote themselves to football, they are impatient and therefore expect the chairman to be known on Thursday."
"He feels that it is high time that the association was led by someone, says the man, who is primarily associated with the Jabolonec club, who also worked for many years in Sparta and in the Executive Committee.
He also believes that he has sufficient experience to lead the Czech football team.
He is convinced that the Euphoria that prevailed at the time of Ivan Hašek is responsible for today's problems with the election.
"Unfortunately, statutes were approved at the Annual General Meeting in June, which were not as perfect as they had all assumed.
If they had not allowed different interpretations, we would already have had a chairman from September," said Pelta.
In particular, he used the revision of the most important document of the Citizen's Association as a bait for delegates.
"If I should be chairman, then I will take it personally and be willing to bear personal responsibility if it does not work."
"This is a matter of principle without which he cannot be," says Pelta.
Furthermore, he does not try to delineate himself against his opponents.
Earlier he had announced that he could imagine a collaboration with Jindřich Rajchl, whom he acknowledges because of his legal education and he knows well that his opponent would be his first deputy.
Tomáš Paclík also did not attack for a long time, which in turn did not leave a dry thread on Pelta.
In football he has been moving for over a year and can already point to certain successes."
"But his attacks were cutting and many people were shocked by his election campaign."
"That's also why many doubt his real character," Pelta addressed his opponent, who probably remains faithful to his proclamations, which he expressed as early as September.
In his opinion, his strongest weapon is the knowledge of football from the lowest game classes to the national team.
And this is supposed to be Czech football.
"I would also try to end all affairs - from the Causa Bohemians, to the aftermaths of the corruption scandal of last year."
"After that, I would fall for negotiations with the private and state sector to ensure sufficient funding for the entire football industry," said ČTK, forty-six years old, two months ago.
At that time he also promised that his move into the top of Czech football would not mean any personnel cleaning.
"I would first have to familiarize myself with the work content of all employees," he said in the direction of Strahov, where, due to the long anarchy, there is understandable nervousness.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios that accompany the upcoming Annual General Meeting, he believes that the delegates will not travel to Nymburk for free on Thursday.
"If really the only point of contention is how to choose in the third round, then we'll get over it."
"The football needs credibility and it only regains it if it finally has a new leader," Pelta remains optimistic two days before the possibly decisive day of his career.
Rajchl promises that the FAČR will start working hard under him
If the previous vice-chairman Jindřich Rajchl was to be elected to the general meeting on Thursday as the new chairman of the football association of the Czech Republic, this would allegedly lose the mood of many people in the association.
Rajchl promises to work hard in the event of his election.
He wants to introduce system changes and make the members of the Executive Committee responsible for individual football areas.
He also promised to resolve the Bohemian case, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money into football and otherwise continue the work that the previous chairman Ivan Hašek started.
"As chairman, I would like to devote myself to football as a whole."
Starting from international contacts with UEFA and FIFA, national selection, professional football, and youth performance football."
"I don't want to say that I want to do everything alone," Rajchl said in conversation for ČTK.
"I am a team player and would therefore like to distribute the competences of the Executive Committee in such a way that each member devotes himself to a certain area."
And I will distribute hard tasks so that the football gets ahead with miles in each segment."
Many would not be delighted because, instead of merely criticizing the work of others, they would now have to start working really hard themselves," he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement, consideration had been given to not running at all.
"I know I work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know that it makes sense and that people are behind me, who don't necessarily throw buttons between my legs and question every step I take," he said, explaining why he hesitated.
"But many people told me that I must not give up, because otherwise others would."
"It's trust you can't play," he said.
It is said that he also motivates him to continue the work he started under Hašek.
"In two years, we've been through a lot of work and I don't want to throw that away."
"Procedures have been started, which probably only come into effect in a few years' time, and I would hate to see them stop," he said, expressing his concern that in case the other candidate - Miroslav Pelta was elected, the situation could return to the times before Hašek.
"I believe in systematic action and that's something that Mirek Pelta doesn't bring."
"Behind him are especially people who would make football so that he would only be there for the elect."
I guess you can blame me for something, but not for being partial."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want football for everyone, because then everyone is doing well and not just the chosen ones," Rajchl said.
He also contradicts the claim that he was only a chairman of the Czechs.
"Even if some people say the opposite, I really intend to do the best possible thing for ants."
"For example, it is time to consider whether one should not divide the league into a Czech and a Moravian part, whose winners then each ascended to the first league."
"Then it couldn't happen that today only three Moravian clubs play in the league, which is a problem especially for the young players in Moravia," Rajchl says.
Because the head of the Pilsner Club Tomáš Paclík has joined the struggle for the position of chairman, Rajchl does not trust to assess his chances of being elected.
"I feel a strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has elected me as its deputy chairman and now recognises that clear successes are behind me," said Rajchl, who also sees as his success the saving of tens of millions of crowns for unprofitable contracts, the agreement of television contracts and the negotiations on the lottery law.
On the other hand, he partly blames himself for the fact that the League does not draw on a single strand.
While he says of Pelta that "he is disqualified from the outset to help Czech football to regain confidence," he considers the second rival - Paclík to be a strong candidate who really has something to offer to football.
"No one can doubt that he has done excellent work in Pilsen in just one year."
"If he were to be elected, then he would probably continue the things that Ivan Hašek has initiated and also the personnel occupation in the Commissions he would obviously not change in principle."
He would certainly not want to turn things down in his favor," Rajchl judges his rivals.
Europe's most beautiful pools
Jump to the blue
By Julia Stanek
Plansch Basin in Ufo-Optics, Pruning Pools in Budapest: If you travel through Europe, you can experience its blue miracle - and after a city tour or hike rest the tired legs in whirlpools.
A book shows where wellness in the water is most beautiful.
If Iris Meder went on a research trip in the past one and a half years, one should not be missing in her luggage: her swimsuit.
Reverslings lying on the water, she looked high in artistically designed domes, she swam marble powders waiting for her on the pelvis, and marveled at meticulously restored Art Nouveau swimming halls.
If she liked a bath, she recorded it in her notebook - including interesting details about the construction and history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools explored the architectural historian Meder in this way - and now presents her in her book "Badefreuden": Volksschwimmhallen in Munich, historic swimming palaces in the Black Forest, "Hardcore concrete buildings" in the Taunus.
Through 13 countries she led her "travel to the most extraordinary baths in Central Europe": In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and one city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old German is a true swim culture enthusiast.
With sports she doesn't have much on her hat, says Meder - only in the water is that different.
Regrettably, swimming fans have to find themselves with blue tiles and chlorine tanks, while jogger can breathe the enchanting scent of spruce forests or listen to happy bird-twitchers in the park.
"One day I wondered why swimming pools must always be so ugly," says the Meder living in Vienna.
"So I began to collect beautiful baths."
Water Surface Doubled Architecture
Platters in the jumping pool and essential sauna oils - the wellness factor in bathrooms is therefore so great because all senses are served, says Meder.
And when the builders have made trouble, swimming pools can be a real eye-catcher: "Instead of a floor you have a water surface in bathrooms."
"On the one hand it is transparent, but on the other hand it reflects the beauty of the entire building."
Everything doubles visually: high vaults, colorful tiles, jumping boards.
The small picture volume "Badefreuden" conveys on 190 pages worth knowing about the history of architecture and culture of historical wellness oasis - but above all makes a desire to jump into the blue.
Remarkable specimens discovered the pool collector Meder in her research in Hungary.
In addition to magnificent spas such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi bath in Budapest, she found a nitrate-containing water in an original karst cave (a cave bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) and a thermal bath, whose basins are filled with alkaline water and are located in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény).
Spectacular views, on the other hand, offer many heated outdoor baths in Switzerland and Austria: while the whole city is in the eye of the Zurich roof bath, you can look at the snow-covered Arlberg in the outdoor pool in St. Anton - and: In the steam bath there is a window from which you can observe the driving on the ski slope.
Perhaps the most extraordinary pool design awaits swim guests in Längenfeld: The Aquadome Ötztal looks like a UFO landed in the Alps.
From three bowls open to the top it steams in winter, while in the background the mountains of the Ötztal rise in the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Not in every swimming pool did the pool collector Meder get the smell of chlorine into his nose.
Many thermal baths smell like sulphur, in the Árpád bath in the Hungarian Békescsaba it smells so strong after heating oil, which you hardly believe to have landed in a health bath.
The smell comes from the alkaline-hydrogen carbonate-containing healing water, which is almost black and whose swallow one sticks to the skin as soon as you slide into the basin - a wellness experience of a special kind.
In one place, however, Iris Meder was also disappointed in her search for beautiful bathing spots: when she wanted to visit the outdoor and sunbathing pool in the Czech bath Luhatschowitz, she found a locked terrain.
The bathroom, designed in 1902 by architect Dušan Jurkovic, was now closed.
When Meder looked through the weathered windows of the red-white-yellow Art Nouveau building, she saw weeds growing between the tiles.
On the other hand, one has acted against the decay in a magical swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
Three phases of construction already have this bathroom behind them; one can discover not only neo-Romanic elements, which stem from the times of its construction in 1844, but also a Moorish hall in the Alhambra style, which was added around 1900.
Since the careful modernisation in 1995, the Palais Thermal is the favorite pool of the pool-scene Iris Meder - and not only because it originally comes from the Black Forest.
"It is already an achievement to merge so different construction styles into such a great unit," says Meder.
At such a palace, the dive in the thermal pool is apparently just a sideshow.
Agricultural speculation
Deutsche Bank lets raw material business shine through
By Christian Teevs
Does Deutsche Bank give up its agricultural raw materials business?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE information, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to examine the consequences of speculation on the world's poor.
In January, the CEO intends to draw conclusions.
Hamburg -
For the federal citizens, the thing is clear: 84 percent of Germans find it unacceptable, according to a study, that banks speculate with agricultural raw materials such as wheat or maize.
Two thirds of the respondents even demand that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions get out of this business because it exacerbates the problems of the poorest in the world.
This is the result of a Forsa survey commissioned by the consumer organisation Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
In this, author Harald Schumann shows that the bets on the global commodity markets push prices up - and the banks therefore bear a share of the global hunger problem.
The consumer protection campaign is aimed specifically at German bank manager Josef Ackermann, even if large banks like Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act similarly.
Originally, raw material bets were intended to secure dealers against price fluctuations.
However, most experts now agree that the socks have decoupled from supply and demand - and at the expense of the poorest profit.
Unlike US competitors, Ackermann responded to the criticism: he promised to investigate the allegations and said that no business was "worthy to risk the Deutsche Bank's good reputation".
According to information from SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is currently examining the allegations from the Foodwatch report.
By the end of the year, the audit will be completed, then the results will be presented to the Board of Management of Deutsche Bank - including recommendation on how to deal with it.
At the end of January, the bank’s top will then report the consequences.
In the end, there could be a reduction in the raw material business, or even the complete departure.
Ackermann crafts on his image
Foodwatch Chief Thilo Bode welcomed the news, but at the same time confirmed his criticism of the financial sector: "Betting on rising prices of food shows particularly drastically how reckless banks today are damaging the general good."
Ackermann is now particularly obliged as the top bank lobbyist.
"The Deutsche Bank must remove all assets from its portfolio where money is used for betting on food prices," said Bode.
"Whether Mr. Ackermann is about people suffering from hunger or the reputation of the Deutsche Bank."
The insight of Ackermann comes at first glance surprising, but it is clear that the CEO wants to give a perfect picture just a few months before he leaves office.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the Chief Executive would not change to the Supervisory Board otherwise than planned.
By turning away from controversial agricultural speculation, he could improve his image.
And in order to make any losses, he hardly has to shave - his successor would eventually have to do so.
Each other would terminate raw material facilities
Foodwatch is trying to keep the pressure on the manager high.
So far, more than 30,000 Internet users have participated in the organization's campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published the survey for which the Institute Forsa surveyed 1001 people on 7 and 8 November.
Thus, just eleven percent believe that it is legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer facilities to bet on food prices.
Many banking customers would also have personal consequences if they learned that their bank was involved in such transactions: According to the survey, each second would terminate all investments in which money flows into raw material speculation.
43 percent would advise acquaintances from such a bank, 49 percent said to think about canceling their account and switching to another institution.
21st House in Vienna
The Relocated Pavilion
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
An architectural history with heights, depths and happy ending: The Austrian World Exhibition Pavilion of Brussels received prizes in 1958, became a museum in Vienna, stood empty and disguised.
Now he will be reopened as an exhibition house.
When modern post-war architecture is combined with clear shapes, glass halls, courageous swings and new building materials that are typical of the belief in technical progress, then the Austrian pavilion of architect Karl Schwanzer for the Brüssler World Exhibition 1958 is a striking and famous example.
Schwanzers Pavilion then received the Grand Prix d'Architecture for its lightweight and floating steel glass construction.
The building is still considered a milestone in contemporary architecture.
He made the architect so well known that he also built pavilion at the next world exhibition in Austria.
With his legendary BMW four-cylinder house plus bowl-like side-building in Munich, he finally became internationally famous in 1973.
His pavilion, planned as a temporary exhibition building, had been set up after the World Exhibition in the Swiss Garden at the Wiener Südbahnhof, converted and opened in 1962 a museum of the 20th century - the "20er Haus" was called it.
However, the building was not suitable for spatial and technical purposes as a museum - no walls for hanging the art, no good climate.
Nevertheless, it was used until contemporary art in Vienna got a new house.
Since 2001, the building has been empty and came down more and more.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has rebuilt the pavilion, now called "21er Haus" and will be used as a museum for contemporary art in the future.
Tuesday evening, the Belvedere Museum, to which the house belongs, opens the first exhibition there - a happiness in every respect.
Agnes Husslein-Arco, who became the new director of the Austrian Gallery Belvedere in 2007, has taken the lead.
Husslein-Arco, a doctorate in art history with a remarkable career, among other things in youth as an ice skater, later at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and as founding director of the Museum of Modern Salzburg, emphatically implemented the conversion among politicians and monumentists, obtained public funds and private sponsorship funds and established the use.
In addition to contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba should be exhibited by the foundation of the same name, there should be a café and a book shop, and an office house had to be built.
Strict supervision, small budget
For the execution, Krischanitz was the ideal occupation.
Not only because he had sensibly remodeled and expanded Joseph Olbrich's Secession in Vienna and won the competition, but because he studied at Schwanzer's Technical University in Vienna and the pavilion was for him a "untouch important place" where he had watched the exhibitions "almost every weekend".
He knew the original design, and he knew the problems of the building, which already lost generosity and lightness when it moved to Vienna and its re-use.
There were far bigger problems in the current conversion: the building was "an energy sluice," says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of the glass façade were replaced, glass fibre reinforced insulating glass was used and the glass roof was replaced by a special safety glass.
Refrigerated bridge steel beams have been reinforced or replaced, and asbestos-filled ceilings have been refurbished.
Two lower floors brought space for the new use, a lowered light pit between house and street provides the lighting, a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new building, but still the light tail pavilion.
The original exterior doors have remained, the house has been painted in the old reddish-brown rust protection color.
And the cinema room is even quite the same as it used to be.
And all of this under strict supervision of the monumental authority and with a small budget.
"Often a material had to be found that is good and cheap and also liked the Memorial Office," says Krischanitz and points to a rough floor in the basement.
Despite all the constraints, problems and alterations, the building has remained flexible and easy.
It was difficult with the pavilion, "who came from Brussels therefore," Krischanitz recently said, a typical "drop-in-the-City story".
Such an architecture is "always in the wrong place" and still wants to "awaken a real consciousness".
In this case, however, the 21st house is not in the wrong place, because there has been an urban accident: around the Swiss garden, the completely new planned "main station district", with office and residences, is created.
And another lucky case may still occur: The 21st house could get reinforcement from another Krishanitz building, because the collector Francesca of Habsburg has bought the Berliner Temporary Kunsthalle, and as you can hear, it is already negotiating with the city for a neighbourly location in the Swiss garden.
Railway plans winter crisis package in million heights
The railway has developed a crisis plan to prevent train failures in winter.
The number of employees should be doubled.
It costs millions.
In the fight against winter-related train failures and delays, Deutsche Bahn reports that over 70 million euros will be extra this year.
The "Picture" paper reported in advance, calling for an internal crisis plan, that by 2015 investments of around EUR 300 million were planned.
This would improve the availability of vehicles and rail networks even in extreme weather conditions.
Among other things, it is planned to double the internal and external staff for the snow removal on railways and platforms to 16,000 people.
The aim is to free platform platforms from snow and ice within four to five hours until the start of operation and 90 percent of the operational distances required.
Two months ago, rail chief Rüdiger Grube had warned of train failures and delays after a top meeting with government and industry this winter.
Last winter the railway had significant problems in passenger transport, as it lacks reserves, among other things, under difficult weather conditions.
For example, many new regional trains have been waiting for approval by the Federal Railway Agency for years.
There is also a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
The railway also makes it possible for years to have ICE-train axles tested significantly more frequently in the workshop after an ICE had an axle break at the Cologne Central Station.
Deutsche Bank pays millions of fines in the USA
After the tumult to head Josef Ackermann comes a new mess from the USA: Deutsche Bank has to pay a million fine there.
As if the problems at home were not enough for the Deutsche Bank, the industry giants are now bringing back their past in the USA: The Frankfurt Institute pays 145 million dollars in a comparison (€106 million) to settle disputes over the collapse of five major cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
It's about selling mortgage papers.
The financial market regulator NCUA accuses a whole series of large banks of having seduced the cooperative banks with false promises to purchase the financial products; they would have played down the risks.
Such papers lost much value during the financial crisis and demolished banks into the depths.
"We are pleased that we were able to solve the issue without the parties having to go to court," said a German bank spokesman in New York.
The bank did not admit any debt by comparison.
This also applies to the Citigroup, which committed itself to the payment of $20.5 million.
The NCUA chairman Debbie Matz welcomed the meeting of the two money houses.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for the U.S. co-operative banks and intervenes in Pleiten to protect customer deposits.
The NCUA is trying to replace the resulting billion-dollar damage.
The comparisons now concluded are the first of their kind.
The regulator had also prepped other major banks and in the summer JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs sued.
The mortgage papers in question are so-called Mortgage-backed securities.
This is based on house loans.
When the U.S. real estate bubble burst in 2007, it became a disaster to a large number of financial corporations.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the U.S. investment bank changed Lehman Brothers.
Although the events have been behind for a few years, the banks are currently blowing a sharp wind in the US.
Investors and supervisory authorities have tried countless complaints to obtain redress or to detect errors.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has triggered the biggest lawsuit wave.
It accuses 18 international major banks of over-distributing the two US real estate financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in mortgage transactions in the volume of about $200 billion.
Deutsche Bank also has to file a complaint against the FHFA, which involves several transactions worth a total of 14.2 billion dollars from 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authority requires Frankfurters to be "substantial losses", but without mentioning a precise sum.
The Deutsche Bank had rejected the claims as unrelenting and declared that it wanted to resist them.
Warren Buffett rises with 10 billion at IBM
Finanzguru Buffett invests heavily in the IT company IBM.
Since March, he has bought shares worth more than ten billion dollars.
So far, the major American investor Warren Buffett had always declared not to invest in IT and computer companies, as the long-term development of the companies can only be predicted poorly.
However, he has now read IBM's annual reports and changed his opinion on investment in the industry.
He had to understand much earlier that IBM mainly offers services and provides computer systems for IT departments of other companies.
An investment by Warren Buffett is considered a knight in the financial world.
Therefore, IBM is now allowed to call itself "Sir IBM".
Because Buffett now revealed on the US economics channel CNBC that he had bought IBM shares worth 10.7 billion dollars since March.
His investment holding Berkshire Hathaway has thus risen to one of IBM's largest shareholders with a share of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said that not even IBM had known anything about the commitment so far.
He praised the management that even in the economic crisis had brought good profits.
"You've done a great job," said Buffett on strategy.
IBM has been relying for some time on the lucrative IT services such as the operation of data centers.
The more than 100-year-old computer pioneer also offers software and advice as well as powerful company computers.
Buffett had so far rather avoided technology companies.
He says he only invests in companies whose business he also understands.
Instead, Buffett approached a freight train, for example, with a lubricant manufacturer or machine manufacturers.
His holding Berkshire Hathaway also owns around 80 subsidiaries of a number of large companies, such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, the former Munich back.
The 81-year-old had taken over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and expanded it with wise investments to one of the most valuable companies in the world.
Nevertheless, his lifestyle is modest.
He is therefore a cult figure for countless investors around the world.
His almost insidious sense of earning money has given him the nickname "Orakel von Omaha".
After the Buffett investment was announced, the IBM stock increased by one percent in advance.
"Big Blue", as IBM is also called, is worth more than $220 billion on the stock exchange and is thus one of the most valuable technology companies in the world together with Apple and Microsoft.
With Microsoft, Buffett said, he doesn't want to get in.
Founder Bill Gates was a close friend.
The threat is tangible
After the discovery of the "Zwickauer Zelle", Turkish media doubted the German rule of law.
A newspaper even speaks of a "bloody ideology", which is now revived.
The murders of eight Turkish tribes and a Greek small businessman in the years 2000 to 2006 had a right-wing extremist background.
This news is being answered with fear and concern in Turkey and within the German Turkish population in Germany.
For many German Turks, a long believed-in ghost returns: Since the fire attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no comparable violence against Turks with a right-wing extremist background.
The fact that there is xenophobia in Germany was never in question.
However, the revealed right-wing extremist network reveals dimensions whose dimension is not yet foreseeable.
"Is Bloody Ideology Revived?" headlined the Internet issue of the Turkish newspaper Haberturk.
On the other hand, the newspaper "Sabah" stresses that one of the perpetrators should have been a V-man of constitutional protection, and is concerned that German authorities too could be involved in the right-wing radical swamp.
The Turkish community of Germany responded in due course: it reminded the victims of racist violence in front of the Brandenburg Gate with a commemorative watch on the weekend.
Only two weeks earlier, the Turkish community in Berlin, together with German and Turkish politicians, had in mind a celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish acquisition agreement.
In cheerful colours, this was staged together - as a story of success.
Like an earflake, there is the reporting of some Turkish media: "Germany's gift to the fiftieth" is the title of an article in the Turkish internet platform "Haber X", which refers to the backgrounds of the murder series.
Even the German edition of the "Hürriyet" cannot be taken to draw this mental connection.
"It starts to stink," is the title of the column of Ahmet Külahci.
He stressed that people had been murdered, paid taxes and made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany with their work.
In German-Turkish Internet forums, the police and their subsequent arrest success are being discussed in a critical way.
The authors wonder why it would not have been much better for the German authorities to search for suspects in right-wing extremist circles.
Some of them at least show themselves to be prepared for drastic means: "If we continue to snuff out here, the migrants are left with nothing but self-defense and arms."
"It'll be the best self-defense."
"The goodness of the enlightenment and adequacy of the punishment of the entire network depends very heavily on the inner peace in Germany," writes "Selen".
What it means when inner peace in Germany is in danger made clear the attacks of Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s.
The photo of the fire ruins of Solingen is deeply anchored in German and Turkish memory.
For no other event showed the Turks living here more clearly that there is a tangible threat, and the Germans that suspicion and distance can lead to right violence.
The attacks, however, exacerbated our feeling on the Turkish side.
Do not repeat the mistakes of the past
In the Turkish press, the failure of German politics after the attacks was particularly criticized at that time: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the fire attack by Solingen he sent a sympathizer telegram to the Turkish presidents, but was represented at the mourning celebration in Cologne by his foreign minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel mentioned in his speech how many taxes the local Turks did.
Just like that, the value of a human being is calculated by the amount of his taxes.
The current reporting of the Turkish media once again shows how deep the mistrust of many German Turks into the local rule of law has been since.
In addition to the efforts of an extensive clarification and reassessment of the right-wing extreme terrorism in Germany, it is necessary this time to speak openly.
The Skandalbank of the Zürisee
The most adventurous bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
In the financial crisis, the UBS went almost bankrupt and has since slipped from one crisis to the next.
Now it's for a German to judge.
I'm sure Axel Weber didn't think so.
After his spectacular departure from the top of the Bundesbank in July, it was announced that in 2013 he would take on an almost as spectacular new job: Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Swiss Gross Bank UBS - an unexpected and lucrative career step.
Axel Weber was delighted in public, praised Switzerland for its beauty and the UBS for its new solidity and made friendly comments about the future colleagues.
"The UBS made the turnaround."
"I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel".
But as early as September, it became clear that everything would be completely different.
A dealer of the UBS in London had bypassed all of the bank's security systems and covered around EUR 1.7 billion.
UBS Chief Executive Oswald Grübel, a banker not only famous in Switzerland, had to leave.
Since then, the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the UBS has also been regarded as being elected - and everyone asks: When will Axel Weber finally arrive?
It has already been known that Weber can advise the bank from February 2012.
And he takes over the Chairmanship of the Board of Directors already in May - not only in 2013, as the Bank announced on Tuesday.
For Axel Weber, it's gonna be hard.
He is not a banker, he is a professor of economics and a banker and would certainly have needed a period of work.
He then takes responsibility for the strategy of a bank that has just proved once again that it has long earned the title of "the largest scandal bank in Europe".
Because on the one hand the UBS is huge - until recently it was the largest asset manager in the world - and on the other hand it has been slipping from one scandal to the next for years.
Nothing, it seems, will be spared the once proud Swiss bank.
It started in the financial crisis.
Until 2007, the UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of the silent and solid but also well-buffed Swiss asset manager combined it with ambitious goals: she also wanted to be a very big number in investment banking.
In 2007, the UBS managed, on the one hand, with $1.6 trillion more money for customers than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, it had progressed as an investment bank in the league of the largest banks in the world.
That made an impression.
The former banker and later longtime bank professor in Zurich Hans Geiger says: "At the time, I always put the UBS as a pattern of a good bank to my students."
"From today's point of view, you ask yourself, "How could I be so wrong?"
He was very wrong.
In 2007 it became apparent for the first time that something was going wrong in the UBS.
In the middle of the year, Chief Executive Officer Peter Wuffli resigned surprisingly, who until then was considered a highly intellectual and equally brilliant banker.
A few months later, it was known why he had left.
The bank's investment segment had been covered with subprime papers and had to write down billions.
To do this, the UBS announced a capital increase of CHF 13 billion.
In fact, it found investors, but which, until recently, would have humiliated the nose of some: an intransparent Asian state fund from Singapore and an Arab state fund, which was so silent that they did not even know its name.
But that was just the first blow.
In April 2008, things got worse.
The bank had to announce new billion losses, Chairman Marcel Ospel, who resigned in 2006 from the second-best-paid board of directors in Switzerland.
In October 2008, the disaster followed: UBS faced the collapse due to its misinvestment in the financial crisis and had to be rescued by the state.
The National Bank bought the UBS for tens of billions of problematic securities, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for a forced migration bond over which it could become co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was shaken - because it noticed how dramatic it is for a small country when it houses such large banks.
Finally, the balance sheet total of the 2007 UBS was more than five times as large as the economic performance of Switzerland (see graph).
"Once again, we could not save the UBS," says bank researcher Geiger.
The second was the first disaster.
A few months later, the UBS surrendered in the tax dispute with America and agreed to release the data of wealthy customers who might have taxed with the help of the bank.
In addition, she agreed to a payment of $780 million - as a refund of unjustified profits from these transactions, including a penalty payment.
Thus, the UBS knew more or less openly to have helped with tax evasion.
At the same time, she lost something that had always been her capital in competition for rich customers: the nimbus of silence.
After the scandal, the Swiss banking secret was no longer the same.
It followed the resignation of the Chief Executive and Chairman of the Board.
And the exodus of customer money.
For example, within a few months, the Bank had lost its credibility in both key business areas: investment banking through the falsifications and asset management through aid for tax evasion.
And just when it got a little quieter again, just when you thought that the UBS would get back to it, then this ugly dealer story follows: A single dealer choked 1.7 billion euros before the bank notices that something is going wrong.
And it becomes obvious: with risk management in investment banking it obviously still does not work.
"With the case of Adoboli, it has to be noted that risk control has changed too little," says Martin Janssen, economist and financial professor at the Bank Institute of the University of Zurich.
The financial director of a large German bank is also certain: "The problem of UBS is that it does not control risk control."
It had been precisely the idea of caution with which the Swiss bankers had long ago begun to become guardians of the great wealth of the world: no too great risks, for security for money - even beyond the Alpine Republic might the world collapse.
The safes of the Swiss banks had become a symbol of unshakable reliability such as Lindt and Sprüngli for particularly noble chocolate.
The headquarters of the UBS in Zurich still fit the cliché of the pious Swiss private bank - it's just a little bigger.
The situation is already classic.
The bank is headquartered on Zuricher Bahnhofstraße, which leads from the main railway station directly to Lake Zurich, which is surrounded by the snow-covered peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are magnificent, the store rentals are among the highest in Europe.
Jewellery like Tiffany's can be found here between Swiss traditional shops such as the Confiserie Sprüngli.
For centuries, Swiss banks have resided here: from the National Bank to the Palace of Credit Suisse to elite private banks such as Julius Bär.
The reception hall of the UBS is accessed by a heavy turning door.
Inside the walls are marble-clad, before which there are thick leather armchairs, next to the bank logo a large sign for the "safe".
The UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
This idea of the Swiss bank has displaced both large Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, but at some point - or betrayed how the head of a small Swiss private bank finds.
He prefers not to read his name in the newspaper, after all, like all Swiss bankers, he also does business with the two major banks.
The UBS had become far too large, he finds - especially in investment banking, where the fishing scissors had also spread.
The Swiss had nothing to say there.
"And if so, they have long adapted to the customs of the Anglo-Saxons."
In fact, it was the Anglo-Saxon investment banking that changed the UBS, gave it first high profits and then the debacle: No European financial institution has lost as much money in the subprime jungle as the Swiss major bank.
The disaster became visible on October 15, 2008.
"On that Wednesday, the government coalition of the small seven million nation decided the largest rescue action in the history of its nation," writes author Lukas Hässig in his book "The UBS Crash".
Up to 68 billion francs or around 45 billion euros were granted by the politicians to save the large bank that was standing before the bankruptcy.
How could that be?
If you talk to Swiss bankers, they see the problem especially in the size of UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three large Swiss banks joined forces to form a huge group.
A bank was created, which was already too large for small Switzerland at the merger - and grew ever further.
In doing so, the two different forerunner banks of the UBS were complementary: a rich but sleepy bank with the focus on asset management in Zurich and a poorer but already more internationalized.
Suddenly, internationalized investment banks came to a great deal of money with which to spin a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with this rise of the UBS: Peter Wuffli, CEO of the UBS from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, Chairman of the Board of Directors.
"I always thought that Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team," says banker Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the high-intellectual, modest person who understands a lot of models and statistics, and Ospel, the abdominal man who has worked up from the bank's teaching to the top."
But in the end, Ospel relied on Wuffli.
And Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake in the end: "He thought his models were the reality," says Geiger.
"This is a tragic case."
Tragic, maybe.
It is clear: Overconfident came before the case.
Employees of the UBS clearly remember the executive meetings on which CEO Wuffli repeatedly issued the same slogan: Goldman Sachs from the throne.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank on earth.
She led the League Tables, the rankings that documented the success of the banks of that time.
That's where the UBS wanted to go, all the way up.
A few steps have already succeeded.
In the currency business and in the stock trade she played at the top.
However, business consultants who were commissioned highlighted a weakness: In the international interest business, in the banking language "Fixed Income", there was a huge distance from the largest banks.
The UBS has gaps in American mortgage products.
To close this gap, UBS embarked on an adventure that almost cost its existence.
Hungry for growth, both the bank itself and a hedge fund founded before it invested in American subprime facilities.
She developed into a huge machine that packaged and passed on securities on American mortgage loans - but also kept risks.
Even when other banks long sought the exit.
"Even in the summer of 2007, when the American real estate market was in flames, UBS bought it there," says banking expert Geiger.
So big the euphoria, so deep the case.
One manager after another had to go when the attempts to clean up were more difficult than thought.
Posts at the UBS have become sleigh seats and are still fragile.
Whoever runs the big bank now has an almost impossible job.
He has to find a strategy for a bank that has managed all the related business models.
Bankerforscher Geiger already has an idea: end of investment banking, focus on asset management, return to the Swiss roots.
So far, the bank does not want to go (yet).
But investment banking is supposed to shrink sharply, so much is already clear.
Next Thursday, the new bank manager Sergio Ermotti will present his future strategy to the world.
The 51-year-old Italo brother-in-law was only meant as a transitional solution when the bank was surprisingly separated from the predecessor Grübel.
In the meantime, he has asserted himself: he is to run the UBS's business on a permanent basis, the Zurich Bank announced on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to move the investment bank back to the mid-nineties.
3500 spots he strokes.
But that won't be enough.
The UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does she want to make money with?
These are the questions Axel Weber is already asking himself.
So far, he's only saying that he's going to look for an apartment in Zurich with his wife.
Next year.
Fear of recession in Europe burdened US stock exchange
The impending recession in Europe has taken the courage of the US investors at the start of the week.
The change of government in Athens and Rome remained unbeatable.
Continent industrial production suffocated hopes of stabilising the debt crisis in the seed.
The general relief of the change of government in Rome and Athens could not prevail.
The euro fell against the dollar.
The Italian and Greek glass were still half full, not half empty in the past week - but now the problems were again in the foreground, said Mark Luschini of Janney Montgomery Scott.
In particular, financial assets were on the sales papers.
The Dow Jones index of the default values recorded 0.6 percent at 12,078 points at the end of the trade.
In the course of trade, the market barometer ranged between 12.027 and 12.170 points.

The index of the Nasdaq technology exchange lost 0.8 percent and went out of trade with 2657 points.
In Frankfurt, the Dax met with a minus of 1.2 percent with 5985 counters.
Industry in the 17 euro countries has significantly reduced their production and is at the end of the upturn.
In September, companies produced two per cent less than in the previous month, as the Eurostat Statistical Office reported.
This was skeptical for US investors: "We are not an island, we are dependent," said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
Europe will not be able to escape a recession so quickly, and there will be further signs of weakness among the banks.
The investment legend Warren Buffett only confirmed this caution: It is not yet clear whether Europe is strong enough to do everything for an end to the crisis, he said in a CNBC interview.
That is why it is too early, from his point of view, to invest in European government bonds or banks.
Instead, Buffett threw a decade-old principle over the pile and entered the US technology industry.
His investment in IBM more than ten billion dollars supported the share price of the traditional company and initially made it record almost one percent higher against the trend in trade.
The paper closed almost unchanged at $187.35.
Buffett has paid an average of 170 dollars per piece according to his own data and now holds 5.5 percent.
The share price of Berkshire Hathaway lost 1.3 percent.
The Bank of America's shares were significantly stronger than the market, with 2.6 percent.

719 values increased, 2281 gave in, and 79 remained unchanged.
At Nasdaq, sales of 1.38 billion shares were 630 in plus, 1913 in minus, and 82 in unchanged.
Intelligent crows spread in cities
In many places, seedlings are considered "problem birds": However, experts claim that the highly intelligent animals can no longer be driven out of the cities.
One likes them, the other wants to get rid of them very quickly: crows have been part of the cityscape for centuries, but in many municipalities, residents' complaints about the dirt and noise of the animals accumulate.
A remedy against the "problem birds" is not in sight.
Seed crows were no longer to get out of the cities, said experts at the first crow symposium in East Frisian emptiness.
There, professionals from all over the Federal Republic of Germany were able to find possible ways out.
You are looking for alternatives in the cities
Nature conservationists also brought the problems in cities back to the land flight of specially protected seedlings: chemical use in agriculture increasingly destroys traditional habitats.
The hunting, increasing cultivation and the fall of typical brood trees made life difficult for the birds.
crows are under nature conservation.
Large colonies with more than 600 breeding pairs can be found in the Westphalian Soest, in the northwest, among others in Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen as well as in Leer.
In 2005, a controversial project for the mass killing of crows in the district had created negative headlines.
Critics had described the capture of the animals in bird traps and the killing with clubs as particularly brutal.
"The normal expulsion, the gruesomeness, does nothing," the city and landscape planner Werner Klöver found from emptiness.
Spraying nests with water or falling trees often have undesirable consequences, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr in Baden-Württemberg.
"The animals depart, large colonies split up and spread to other places."
Disgusting can only be thought of as an exception to hospitals, old-age homes or schools.
"We have to live with them, we can't get rid of them."
Without the surrounding area, the problem in the cities cannot be solved, said Mayor Wolfgang Kellner from emptiness.
It is thought that there is a combination of the ramifications of the animals from sensitive living areas and locks in order to relocate them to other places.
"Infotables instead of chainsaws" the psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens rejected for a completely different way of dealing with the animals: "We can finally put up with a pickle in the face with the best self-consciousness."
In Schleswig-Holstein, Jürgens had co-founded the Ascheberger Krähen-Lehrpfad, where a sign informs about the life of highly intelligent seedlings.
The project has already been adopted by tourists.
Jürgens also had his own opinion on criticism of the noise of birds: "There is a lot of communication that has a lot to say."
The intelligence and skill of the animals are legendary: Seed crows use not only tools to get to a bite, but even make their own tools as an aid.
Behavioral researchers from Cambridge University recently tested four seedlings how far the intelligence of the birds reached.
In an experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to bring down a scaffolding with stones in order to reach a moth larva.
Without much training, they determined what size and shape a stone must have to collapse the platform.
In a second attempt, the plentiful crows had to solve a more tricky problem.
In a vertical cylinder, the researchers had placed a small bucket with a moth larva.
With the beak, the birds could not reach their prey.
However, the researchers had placed wire pieces on them.
From this all four animals formed a hook, with the help of which they then nailed the bucket at the grip of the tube.
Three of the four seedlings even succeeded.
Cristiano Ronaldo shoots Portugal to EM 2012
The hopes of the Bosnians and Turks for a coup remained.
The favourites are Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and Ireland at EM 2012.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have solved the last tickets to the 2012 European Championship in Poland and Ukraine in the play-offs.
Leading by the double successful Superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8th, 53rd), Portugal beat Bosnia-Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1) and made the fifth EM-participation in a row after 0:0 out of the play.
In the play-off-back game at the outside of Montenegro, the Czechs had a 1:0 (0.0) after the play-back (2:0) had been a clear thing.
No more burns even Croatia at 0:0 against Turkey, Ireland brought a loose 1:1 (1:0) against Estonia.
Nani (24th), Helder Postiga (72nd, 82nd) and Miguel Veloso (80th) achieved further results for Portugal.
The former Wolfsburg Bundesliga pro Zvjezdan Misimovic with a transformed trade meter (41.) and captain Emir Spahic (65.) had shortened twice for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic saw the yellow-red card (54.).
Bosnia had already failed in the play-offs for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa to Portugal.
At Estadio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal achieved a tailor-made start.
Ronaldo chased a free blast from about 30 meters for early guidance into the stitches.
A good quarter of an hour later, Nani showed his wide-shooting qualities and met at 2:0 from 25 meters.
The Bosnians, who did not take place in the first half of an hour, had their first clear chance by goal hunter Edin Dzeko.
The ex-Wolfsburger from the English table leader Manchester City put a headball on the lower edge of the latte, but the ball did not exceed the goalline (33.).
Jiracek meets for Czech Republic
Afterwards, Arbitration Judge Wolfgang Stark from Ergolding was at the centre.
After an attack against Helder Postiga in the Bosnian penal area, Stark decided on Schwalbe and showed the Portuguese the yellow card (36.).
On the other hand, Stark gave a controversial trade meter after an action by Fabio Coentrao, which Misimovic certainly transformed.
But after the break, the 2004 Vice-European Champion made everything clear with four hits.
For the Czech Republic, Petr Jiracek also ended the last doubts in the 81st minute.
This means that the European champion from 1976 will go to EM for the fifth time in a row.
However, the team of coach Michal Bilek with the Bundesliga Legionaries Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1st FC Nürnberg) were also lucky and had to survive a terrible second already in the initial phase.
With a reflex at the last moment, Schlossmann Petr Cech prevented a possible owner by Tomas Sivok (9.).
Montenegro had its greatest possibilities when the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic shot in the 40th minute from the turning of the penalty limit just barely past the gate of Cech.
After the break the crossblade had to save for the Czechs’ already defeated world-class gatekeeper, again the stormer of FC Seoul had withdrawn (50.).
The gate just before the end finally made everything clear.
Turkey now missed Zagreb's football miracle.
Four days after the 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks in Zagreb did not go beyond a 0:0.
While National Trainer Guus Hidedink must thus almost certainly clear his seat at the Bank of the World Championship Third in 2002, the Croatians can be pleased with their fourth participation in an EM final round.
Before 31,000 spectators in the Maksimir Stadium, the Turks almost caught a dream start.
Selcuk Inan met in the seventh minute with a distance shot only the post, attacker Kazim Kazim could not sink the impacter in the gate.
After the horror second, however, Croatia took over more and more control.
Even after the break, the Croats didn't let anything burn.
In addition to Mario Mandzukic of the VfL Wolfsburg, who made the 62th minute for Dortmunder Ivan Perisic Platz, the Bundesliga Legionaries Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) were still in use.
Trapattoni drives to the EM
In Dublin, the Irish celebrated their first EM participation in Germany since 1988.
Stephen Ward brought the team of coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who had already made a preliminary decision with the 4:0 success in the game, in the 32nd minute.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57th) equal to the guests.
Ireland pushed ahead from the beginning, but had to wait until 23 minutes before Robbie Keane of Los Angeles Galaxy had the first good chance.
Only at the last moment did the Estonian rear team prevent the possible leadership hit.
But in the 32nd minute it was time.
After an accident in defense of closing man Pavel Londak, Ward was in position and pushed the ball to 1:0 over the line.

SAP wants to double the number of employees in China
Europe's largest software manufacturer SAP will invest billions in China in the coming years and will almost double the number of its employees in the country.
By 2015, around two billion dollars (about 1.5 billion euros) will flow, the Dax Group announced on Tuesday.
"We will create additional research and development facilities and recruit employees accordingly," Co-Chef Bill McDermott announced at a customer fair in Beijing.
The workforce is expected to grow from around 2500 to 4500 employees at the moment.

Mass slaughter at a personal level
Peter Englund's new book "Beauty and horror. A story of the First World War, tells in nineteen fates" with a long list of main characters who go to your heart.
Here is a tip on how to proceed: Cut this page carefully and make it your bookmark.
You will get to know these people very well in Englund's romantic narrative. And these main characters will function as your GPS, as a lighthouse in these few moments where you, like Englund's men and women, are lost in the fog of war and deprived of your illusions.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, who determines the Nobel Prize for Literature.
He has written an unusual book that he does not describe inappropriately as "a work of anti-history".
It contains few big names, important contracts or famous battles. There are few ambassadors, furious reporters or discussions about tactics and equipment.
It is less a book about what happened, he explains, but rather "a book about how it was". It is about "feelings, impressions, experiences and moods".
"Beauty and horror" means almost the war experiences of 20 more or less inconspicuous men and women on both sides of the war together, from schoolgirls and botanists to mountaineers, doctors, ambulance drivers and office workers.
Some of these people become heroes.
Some become prisoners of war, lose limbs, go crazy or die.
Each of these lives flashes up like the votive candles in one church, some are added, while others are extinguished.
Englund's book differs from the usual history books.
It also corrects the idea that the First World War was only the devastating war on the West Front.
"Beauty and horror" wanders with expert views over other war scenes: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book fall into bees baskets, a celebrated Christmas among the pyramids in Egypt, tsets flies are an insoluble problem.
This is a moving book almost from the beginning.
The war floods the lives of these people like a natural disaster, like a Hurricane Katrina who smells like Cordit.
Imagine you are a woman who is at home with her children and hears cannon fire in the distance. Stay or take refuge?
Who's coming at all?
Hardly anyone understands what is happening or why this war is being waged at all.
"Faulty facts," Englund notes, "are furnished with suspicions, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors."
"Beauty and horror" follows individuals like Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German shipmate.
Their stories were mainly taken from memories, letters and other material already published.
Their life reports can be terrifying or frightening, but they are extremely alive in Englund's collection of small moments lost in detail.
Many of them act of lack and help themselves.
In the history of a German schoolgirl, he says, "Replacement, everywhere replacement."
"Replacement coffee, wrong aluminum, wrong eraser gum, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
He tells more about the replacement dinner in Germany.
He describes "meat made of pressed rice and baked in mutton (and last served with a false bone made of wood), tobacco made from dried roots and dried potato peel, shoes that were stripped with wood."
There were, as he noted, "837 registered substitute foods that were allowed in the production of sausages, 511 registered coffee substitutes."
Some stories are about honor and bravery.
An American recognizes his own urge to wildness and says about the war: "One feels that, despite all that was intended for men rather than sitting in the armchair, with the evening leaf or the bestseller and a cigarette and a whisky in his hand, and to do so means such a facade civilization and as if there were no barbarism behind his own reinforced and coated shirt breast."
On the other hand, a British soldier recognizes that he is likely to die and that no one will take note of it or take care of it.
"If you take a distance from the thought of sacrificing yourself, you want to think that this is happening in front of an audience," he writes.
Instead, it is as terrible as "a condemned man hanged in secret."
Other observations are about the old Europe falling apart and about new kinds of terror.
"The conflict became increasingly an economic struggle," writes Englund, "a war between the factories."
He captures the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the bestiary of the still young century": "the word turned and ideologically convinced mass murderers in a uniform that slaughters while he sits behind a desk."
People behave in an unpredictable way and there is as free conduct as heroism.
Englund talks to the soldiers who actively tried to infect a prostitute with a sexually transmitted disease in order to escape the front line service.
"The grotesque expression of this can be discovered in the trade with the Gonokkak Eiter, because soldiers bought and lubricated on their genitals, hoping to get to the hospital so," he writes.
"Those who were really desperate threw him in the eye, leading to their blindness for the rest of their lives."
In this translation from the Swedish by Peter Graves, Englund's poetry becomes supple and yet unobtrusive and perfectly adapts to his human task.
In dozens of small scenes, he captures the way the war "uncontrollable forces were unleashed in a unique way: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred".
People are beginning to wonder why their leaders are making them fight.
The best books about the First World War were mostly rather forged like Paul Fussell's "Great War and Modern Memory" or novels like Erich Maria Remarque's "Nothing New to the West" than extensive history books.
Englund's band joins an unconventional hall of fame.
His book has the most devastating end I've ever read in a book of things.
I'm not giving it up anymore.
But it's like he took this page with his book with the main characters in front of his nose and lit us with a match.
After an early misstep, a minutely planned assault
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them wearing helmets.
They had decided for the night from Monday to Tuesday, because at this time hardly any people are in Zucotti Park.
The operation was kept secret and only a few senior officials were informed. Everyone else initially believed to participate in an exercise.
Police President Raymond W. Kelly was in the midst of them and his presence underlined the fact that the operation was full of challenges.
The incidents of the past weeks, such as the use of pepper spray against protesters, which violates the rules of the department and gave the homeowners a huge increase in public sympathy, were no longer allowed to repeat themselves.
And so the police action was carried out to remove the protesters from Zuccotti Park after two weeks of planning and training.
Officials had prepared these by observing how occupations were handled in other cities.
A disaster exercise had taken place with a view of Zuccotti on Randall's Island.
Officials reinforced the so-called chaos training - anti-terrorism measures, including the rapid deployment of a large number of police officers - to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training unit took place on Monday night on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The order to move into the park came "in the last minute," said someone familiar with the commands, which said a declaration as "exercise".
"The few police officers involved in my knowledge didn't know it was about Zuccotti Park," said someone who wants to remain anonymous.
"The only ones who knew it was about Zuccotti Park were the senior officials of the resort."
One reason for secrecy was a lesson that the city had learned.
On October 14th, officials wanted to clear the park, but then turn back when hundreds of protesters came together after they had learned of these plans.
Officials of various police units were involved in the Tuesday operation, including emergency services from all over the city - hundreds of mobile officials who are usually used in high - crime neighborhoods.
Mr. Kelly said that in the course of the day many people go into and out of the park, almost like commuters, so 1:00 a.m. is a good time to go in.
"It was appropriate to do this when the smallest number of people are in the park," he said.
Rescue cars with Jupiter lamps and loudspeakers were ready before the departure at Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive near Manhattan Bridge.
The lamps and the prerecorded messages that thundered from the loudspeakers seemed to intimidate many Protestants.
When the public officials got into the park in their light blue wind jackets, many protestors simply gathered their things together and left the place.
The police said that by 1:45 a.m. no tents would be touched to give the Protestants time to pack their belongings and goods together.
Other teams of officials were seen how they gathered in the area to intervene, arrests in the park should be necessary.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Paul J. Browne, spokesperson of the police president, said this had happened to their own safety.
But many journalists claim that they wanted to stop them from watching the police action in the park, and they said that the officials' dealings were very rough.
Mr. Browne said that television cars on Church Street on the west side of the park could have taken pictures.
When the police moved westward through the great mess of personal things of the Protestants, including suitcases, artificial grasses and bags with clothes, their employees followed the cleaning of the city, who stopped what had been left behind.
Some protesters who refused to go were dragged outside. Images of this were published on the Internet a short time later.
A main center of protesters was located near the kitchen area of the camp in the center of the park position.
Some built barriers and the police continued their methodical arrests.
About 10 people at the camp's epicenter joined forces with their arms.
And two people chained themselves to trees, said Mr. Kelly.
Civil protection officials were called to cut them off.
As Mr. Kelly said, no arrests were carried out in the park until about 3:30.
According to the police, the evacuation was completed after 75 minutes.
Mr. Browne said that 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of the arrests came, as he said, because of "unfair behaviour and resistance to arrest".
The most prominent official on site was Joseph J. Esposito, head of the department, the highest uniformed official in the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, Head of Department of Criminal Officers, was also there.
Despite his presence, Mr. Kelly "did not lead the operation", as Mr. Browne said.
In case they should access, a second group of officials on the eastern side of Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Street, waited.
Barricades were built on Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and on Pine Street, a block further south.
It could be observed how from these locations the police continued to extend the area around the Zuccotti Park.
In one place was observed as several officials, many of them with protective signs, drove people outside.
About 28 people were in the northern perimeter.
Some of the most violent actions of the night took place in the south of the park.
Around 5 o'clock south of Pine Street, a protester jumped onto the roof of a police vehicle and other demonstrators left the air out of the tire of a police bus.
In one place the crowd threw a piece of plywood.
In the end, an official and a protester came to the hospital.
Trade union of supervisors will file an action against the city for dismissals
The union, representing hundreds of school supervisors who lost their jobs last month, is planning to sue the city on Wednesday because the dismissals were not necessary and discriminatory due to their undue influence on the schools teaching poor students.
The complaint is probably the last opportunity that the union, District Council 37, is still open in its efforts to reverse redundancies.
Six hundred and seventy-second school assistants, care coordinators and other employees who were among the worst paid employees in the city and who lost their jobs on 7 October, described the union leader as a political revenge for refusing access to a health fund maintained by the working groups to close the budget gap last year.
This allegation was categorically rejected by the authorities.
At a hearing of the City Council, Dennis M. Walcott, director of schools, said last month that the redundancies were part of the budget that was adopted in June.
A member of the city council shot back and told him that nothing in the budget specified that employees of the school assistance would be released.
City Council officials 37 said they had and warned the Ministry of Education about a complaint. On Wednesday there will be a press conference announcing the submission of the complaint to the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
The complaint will be made by Mr. Walcott and the city's Ministry of Education as defendants and eight dismissed workers as plaintiffs who are all colored or Latin American women, like most of the helpers who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokesperson of the city's Ministry of Justice, said that the city was not in the process of bringing the case before the court, and so their individual claims could not be commented on.
According to a draft complaint filed by the New York Times, the union has focused on the number of redundancies at schools in the city's poor neighbourhoods to support a lawsuit for unequal treatment. It claims that poor schools have lost more help because they were chronically underfunded.
She explains that while there were no redundancies on Staten Island and only a few redundancies in the Upper East Side or TriBeCa schools, 17 school assistants lost in the 23rd district in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 helpers were released in the 8th and 9th districts in the South Bronx.
With the finding of the loss of five out of eight school assistants who were employed in the public school 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the complaint says: "This is not a neighborhood of well-documented parents who can organize donations to collect budget cuts."
P.S.: The 36th district budget was reduced by 3.26 percent this year. In addition, money was lost when the city changed its method of calculating the extra funding for each poor school enrolment.
The union also complains that the leaders of the High Schools were led astray by the language in a memo that approved the dismissal of the care coordinators.
The memo used the English word "excess" to describe the action, even if "excess" (translating) in the US usually describes the change of a teacher from the payroll of a school to a pool of available workers paid by the central office.
"Sixty-six care coordinators have been dismissed, not transferred," says the draft action.
Mission ended, Congress ready to agree on Libya
In the end, it looks as if Republicans and Democrats in Washington are already agreeing on the uprisings in Libya.
All that was necessary for this was the success of the revolt, the arrest and murder of the long-standing dictator Muammar Gaddafi and the termination of American interference.
On Thursday, the Committee for International Relations of the Senate decides on a resolution to be submitted to the chairman John Kerry (Massachussetts) together with Senator John McCain (Arizona) and Joseph I Lieberman (Connecticut), praising Libya for the successful rebellion and the American troops for their "mut".
"This resolution honors the courageous people of Libya who have begun rebuilding their country," said Kerry.
"It is a confirmation of the support of its democratic efforts by two parties."
The language may sound innocent, but so far nothing has been easy in the Libyan debate.
This summer the legislators of both parties and the White House disputed the choice of a number of resolutions to approve or disapprove of the role of the US military in the Libyan mission of NATO.
In June, Kerry and McCain tabled a resolution approving the restricted use of US military forces in Libya.
The law was rejected in the Senate by a wide-ranging group of both parties and there was no vote.
But on the same day this law passed into the Senate. In addition, the board passed a decision to reduce the funds for American operations in Libya.
As a result, the U.S. Mission entered a kind of legislative purgatory - with a congress that was so busy criticising Obama's approach as part of the mission, but not angry enough to finally pull the ground under his feet.
Then the indecisiveness of Congress was overtaken by the events.
Tripolis fell among the Libyan rebels in August, and Gaddafi was killed on October 20.
The NATO mission officially ended on October 31st.
Now the Senate may be ready to act.
The resolution of the Committee on International Relations "congratulates the people of Libya on their enormous courage and exceptional perseverance in their self-delivery" and "praises the men and women of the U.S. military and their coalition partners who support military operations to protect the people of Libya for their extraordinary courage and professionalism."
The resolution also reaffirms "the national interests of the United States in a successful and irrevocable transition from Libya to democracy".
Will the new measures be fully supported by the Foreign Relations Board, or will they split the legislators, as the June law did?
The last version encounters the opposition of Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indianapolis), the top Republican of the Committee.
Lugar's spokesman said on Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new law.
According to Capitol, it is up to the Senate to vote this week on a constitutional change that calls for a balanced budget, a top priority in almost every parliamentary legislative period of the Republicans and some Democrats.
The measures under the leadership of Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia) will be the first constitutional change to the budget or to another area that is currently being voted on in the Senate or Congress.
Other legislators have so far tried unsuccessfully to bring their amendments to the vote, although they have often tried enough.
Goodlatten's amendment is only one of 68 constitutional changes that have been presented to this Congress and cover a whole range of topics.
Some are double - the same law was presented both to Congress and to the Senate - others differ only slightly from each other.
There are at least 15 versions of the compensation budget change in the Senate alone and another dozen that would "control federal expenditure".
Some of the laws are also identical, but they give their clients - especially beginners among Republicans who want to polish their CVs - the opportunity to boast that they have "written" such a measure.
The Budgetary Control Act, adopted in August, requires both Senate and Congress to vote on a change in budgetary compensation.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such a change.
In addition to the budget, some members want to limit the number of provisions that members of the Congress can submit, while Republican José E. Serrano (New York) wants to abolish the limitation to two terms of office of the President.
The Republican Jesse L. Jackson (Illinois) has proposed a number of amendments which guarantee, among other things, the right to good education and health care.
A change that forbids marriage to same-sex couples is, as well as a change that forbids the burning of flags, a recurring template.
Some legislators also want to allow the repeal of federal laws if two-thirds of the states reject them.
As zealously as the members propose changes, they move at an unprecedented rate as in recent years.
At the 111th Congress, legislators presented 77 such amendments at the 110th Congress 66.
The pace fades compared to that of the early 1990s, in which members regularly proposed more than 150 changes every two years, according to the figures provided by the Senate Library.
But they were not much more successful than today.
The last amendment to be added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992 but was indeed already proposed to Congress in 1789.
"Founded, but not defeated", says Giffords in the first TV interview after the attack
Ten months after an armed man shot at her from a close distance during an election event in Tucson, Republican Gabrielle Gifffords (Arizona) appeared on national television Monday evening. She sang alone on the Broadway piece "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and said that the desire to recover was greater than the desire to return to Congress.
When she joined Diane Sawyer in the ABC news "20/20", she stood by words and needed help in walking.
The broadcast showed the severe slow recovery from the damage that the bullet, which split its skull, pierced the left side of its brain and pierced its head from front to back.
Three months ago, she returned to Congress to triumphantly give her voice to the debt brake.
In her first TV interview after the January attack, in which six people were killed and 13 injured, Gifford smiled, laughed and sang - and described her recovery as "difficult".
When Sawyer asked her how she felt, Gifford (41) replied: "Very well."
The interview with Gifford and her husband, the astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a one-hour "20/20" special, recorded shortly before the publication of the new book of the couple: "Gabby: A story about courage and hope."
The special is following Gifford's recovery since the January 8 attack.
In videos that Kelly recorded in the first few weeks, she was seen in the hospital bed, with a bare shaved head and a long scarf over her forehead.
She can only lift one or two fingers if her husband encourages her to do so.
months later, Giffords sits in a wheelchair, while therapists show her how to perform simple movements.
A nod with his head.
It's a tick with the lip.
And then, her first words, "What."
After a few days Giffords whispers another word: "Toast". She wants her breakfast changed.
Videos played in the ABC show show show show that music played an important role in Gifford's recovery: you can see how congressmen sing "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" together with the therapists of Cyndi Laupers and Tom Petty's "Free Fallin'".
In an interview with Sawyer, Giffords, who spends two hours of therapy every day, said that she cannot remember the day of the attack.
Her husband said that on March 12, Giffords had read an article on a daily newspaper about the assassination when she interrupted him and for the first time asked about the six people who had been killed during the murder.
The suspect shooter Jared Lee Loughner is in a prison in Missouri and is compulsively treated medically while waiting for his trial.
"Many people have died," Giffords Sawyer said.
"Hard, hard, hard."
In the course of his wife's recovery, Kelly Sawyer said, "I was hit."
"So, I'd say, "Gabby, you weren't defeated," Kelly said.
You just got hit.
And you will survive and you will recover and you will come back stronger than ever before.
Forces feel more compassion than respect
The event was a Wall Street Gala that collected millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, frustration and loss.
A hundred soldiers, sailors, pilots and marines gathered around him.
The amount in black tuxedos stood up and applauded.
"The soldiers were seen as heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized the fundraising campaign in spring.
A high-ranking military officer on the Gala, who was observed, among other things, by the chief of staff and then chairman, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops differently.
"They were introduced like orphans," the officer wrote in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers meant it well.
I know that.
But it wasn't respect, really not.
The harsh contradictions illustrate the difficult relationship between the military and the most distant, sometimes admiring American public.
The troops are heaped with praise for their victims.
But the praise has its price, say servants.
The public is increasingly acting as if they were suffering the people in uniform.
"We were by no means victims," said Brigade General Sean B. MacFarland, who ordered troops in Iraq and will soon go to Afghanistan.
"But apparently the only way to support is to push us into the role of unhappy souls."
The issue is extremely sensitive to military leaders who want to appear ungrateful or in dispute with the public they serve.
They also realized that the anger that the returning troops fought in the last years of the Vietnam war was far worse.
As a result, talks about compassion in the quiet and private between war veterans take place.
After his two sons returned from fighting with the Marines, the Colonel a.D. Mark Cancian warned them that people outside the military world could see their service from two different perspectives.
Some would view them with a sense of awe as they defeated rebels and traveled to exotic places.
Others would wonder if an "enraged, violent veteran under the surface" was hiding, said Cancian, who had fought in Iraq and had taken over an elevated state post in Washington after his return.
During his search for work, he said, he felt that some of the respondents asked subtly whether he was able to withstand the pressure of a demanding post in Washington immediately after his return from the fight.
"If you are talking about your ministry, you must keep the negative impressions against it," said Cancian to his sons.
The lack of ease of the military is partly rooted in the American lack of interest in the war.
Services on the battlefield are rarely taken out as praise by a country that has little experience with the military and sees little benefit in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"We as a nation no longer appreciate military heroism as was absolutely normal in World War II," said Lieutenant General David Barno a.D., U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the praise of politicians and the public is largely focused on the suffering of a servant.
Forces gain recognition for the number of attacks they have endured, the number of friends they have lost or for the severity of their injuries.
Military faces the growing pressure to go through with rape
This week, an important hearing decides whether 28 women and men are being charged with non-intervention in rape before the military court.
Should this not be the case, hundreds of plaintiffs are ready for the next hearing.
Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and in the 11th week she was pregnant when she was raped by a fellow soldier at night.
It was in October 2008 and she just returned to her barracks in Miramar north of San Diego from dinner with a friend when she met a male colleague who carried a 12 pack of beer.
He asked her if he should accompany her to a drink in her room.
"My alarm bells started," said Lyman.
But the Texan woman wiped out her concerns.
I thought, "Oh, he's 19.
He's from Texas," she said.
"I wish I had listened to my gut."
A few minutes after they went to Lyman's room, the man stepped behind her, pushed her down and raped her, claiming she.
This week, on November 18, Lyman and 27 other current and former military staff are anxiously waiting for a trial with a historical hearing in Arlington, Virginia, in which it is decided whether a lawsuit it has brought against former defence minister Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, is being brought before the court.
The complaint claims that Gates and Rumsfeld did not take action against the widespread rape within the military and under violation of the constitutional rights of the soldiers.
In February of Susan Burke, a lawyer from Washington, D.C., filed the case at the beginning of 17 plaintiffs who, however, in the following months, increased to 28: 25 women and three men, all claiming to be raped or sexually abused by fellow soldiers, and that the military failed to identify, condemn or make available appropriate case law according to the alleged attacks.
Burke says she's following the top military leadership, as the problem starts there.
"The military is hierarchical," she says.
"Who are the individuals who are in the position to eradicate the culture retribution of the? The leadership."
Burke also says that since February she has contacted almost 400 other survivors, many of whom could be part of future complaints.
Their strategy: Instead of all the plaintiffs putting their eggs into a basket, they will, if necessary, file many more complaints to maintain the pressure.
The defense team for the Ministry of Defence, led by Federal Attorney Neil MacBride, has filed an application to dismiss the action.
The files of the Court of First Instance, which are available in Newsweek, detail the defence strategy, primarily that the military cannot be charged with violations by current or former soldiers to whom it has come in the armed forces.
On the basis of a law of the Supreme Court of 1950, the so-called Feres Doctrine, the government is not liable for injuries caused to soldiers in active service.
"The alleged damage occurred during the service of the plaintiffs", says the document.
The Ministry of Defence refuses any comment on this story.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
If women are still not allowed to serve in battle, the distinction lies only in the name: modern wars rarely have clear fronts.
Both in Iraq and in Afghanistan, soldiers' teams are playing increasingly important roles, particularly in contact with local women in the war zones.
The result: between these two wars 150 soldiers died, two thirds of them in combat.
It's time for the military to be modernised, says Burke.
And she is not alone in her struggle: three more complaints besides her are pending.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans' Legal Services Clinic prepares a lawsuit against the four most important military academies for allegedly promoting a hostile atmosphere against women.
Independently, the non-profit Vietnam Veterans of America files a lawsuit against the military, focusing on the diagnosis of "personality disorder" that victims of rape received to release them from service - a common approach according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati of the Service Women's Action Network, a human rights group.
In December, her group filed an action against the Veterans Administration (i.e., the administration of the war veterans) in which she accused her discriminatory practices of dealing with benefits for persons who indicated that they had been sexually abused in the service.
Nine laws were presented independently of each other by a mixture of senators and representatives of both parties to the Congress, which offers a number of points of reference.
In 2010, according to the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office, 3,158 sexual abuses were reported by the Ministry of Defense.
But most abuses are not reported at all, and according to the Pentagon's own estimate, this figure takes into account about 13.5% of the estimated 19,000 cases that come each year.
The report, published in March, also examines the law enforcement rates: in 2010, 20 percent of the cases reported in the military were brought to court, only half as many as in civil law.
The plaintiffs in Burke's case describe their attacks as just the first of a series of dreams.
In Lyman's case, she reported the suspected rape of the military police less than an hour after the attack.
That night, she says, she was asked 11 times to tell the details of her rape of a number of policemen, doctors and commanders.
She had a rape kit and the blood of her attacker, who came from a cut on his arm, was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was heard by a judge. During this hearing she was asked about the sex she had with her friend before the assault.
Six persons said as witnesses in the name of the suspected perpetrator, who was finally acquitted.
"I still remember the day the verdict was read," says Lyman.
"I thought the pains would come. I ran screaming out of the courtroom."
"They took me to the psychiatric department and I remember when I came out again, I said to my commander, "That wasn't his procedure. That was my procedure."
Lyman was asked to see a military psychiatrist who eventually diagnosed a personality disorder and declared her incapacitated.
In January 2010, she was dishonourably released so that she did not receive any support.
Whether the complaint filed by Lyman and the other plaintiffs progresses is pure speculation, says John Turley, Professor of Law at George Washington University Law School.
Nevertheless, he says, "In my opinion, they should move forward."
What stands between them and a verdict is this doctrine, which has been criticised since it was first questioned.
I'm a critic of the Feres doctrine.
The military lags behind for a decade, because they do not have the same incentive and the same deterrence that brings liability.
He adds, "The chances are against them... but it's important for them to try."
These things will change only if good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing does not follow its path, Burke, the plaintiff's attorney, will begin with her hundreds of other plaintiffs for future cases.
"We will continue to fight the military in this respect until reforms occur," she says.
Or until we die, whatever happens first.
Walls Have Eyes: How Researchers Watch On Facebook
Before becoming the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was just one of many boys who sent their anti-immigration opinion online.
On Monday, Breivik, who confessed to having committed an amok run in Norway in July, at which 77 people were killed, had his first public hearing in court.
Although Breivik may have acted alone, he is by far not alone in cyberspace: he has spent a lot of time in front of his computer until his attack and chatted with some of the millions of nationalists who support far-right groups on social networks.
After the tragedy of this summer, researchers wanted to find out more about these people.
But how do you find them?
This is easy - you just have to log on to Facebook.
"We have noted that it was not difficult to get to them," says Jamie Bartlett, the main author of a recent report by the British Idea Factory DEMOS on digital populism in Europe.
Facebook's hidden personal data is so encyclopaedic, Bartlett says that researchers simply need to use the site's advertising tool to precisely determine their desired demographic data with scientific accuracy - as marketers have been doing for years.
Bartlett's team found half a million fans of right-wing extreme groups across Europe and then approached them with add-ons, but instead of linking themselves with a new band or a new diet product, the Adds invited users to a survey asking for their educational status, their attitude towards violence and the assessment of their own future.
Thanks to Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to question more than 10,000 supporters of 14 extreme right parties in 11 European countries - without even having to leave their office.
"It's a pretty new research method," says Bartlett.
Some of the results hardly surprise. Online promoters of right-wing extreme groups are mostly young, male and angry about immigration.
But in a kind of surprising twist, "those who combine their online activity with an offline activism are more rational, democratic and less violent than those who sit behind their computer screens."
DEMO's work is just an example of how Facebook becomes a new hot tool in the hands of scientists.
Ideas factories, medical researchers and political scientists use the site to study everything, from health issues to social trends such as "likes", text messages and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding three content per day on average, Facebook's "Data Supernova" generates a research boom that has increased the number of scientific works with the name of this page in the title of the last five years by nearly 800%.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is the fact that you can study people through this page that you normally can't reach with your clipboard on the street.
"If you tried to question people of the British National Party earlier, it was very difficult to identify them."
"They had to inform the party first and it would never have granted them access," says Bartlett.
"On Facebook, it all goes away -- you go straight to them."
Others say that the site offers an opportunity to identify and solve social health problems.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno from the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues found that students who discussed their full noise on Facebook are significantly more prone to problem drinking than students who are silent on this topic.
Moreno suggests that equal-level students, such as residential consultants, monitor the site and help a student when they post too many status updates.
"You can't solve a problem if you haven't recognized it," said Dimitri Christakis, Moreno's co-author and head of Child Health, Behavior and Development at Children's Research Institute in Seattle, Washington Post.
"We have found a way to identify vulnerable children who would not otherwise have been found."
Facebook also constantly collects the data of its own population.
The page's data team has compiled statistics on the relationship status and Valentine's Day, electoral participation in the 2010 mid-term elections and a National Happiness Index (mainly using data that only Facebook has access to - Masters of digital freedom have long known that the site should make their large data base for other research purposes accessible.)
But the users of Facebook know that the site is watching them whether they want it or not. To be able to play with a friend who is thousands of miles away, you allow the site to provide your own personal data.
But what if the users of Facebook become part of a survey they don't even know about?
While researchers have strictly defined guidelines on how to collect their data offline, everything is allowed online.
"I don't think that many users even thought about the fact that a researcher could study their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, about a 2006 study in which he studied the public pages of students on Facebook.
"As far as she was concerned, it was just about her and her friends."
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even offline there is no guarantee that a researcher is absolutely honest.
On Facebook it is impossible to know how many of the information in a user profile and in posts are true.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do outside Facebook are two completely different things," says Selwyn.
Therefore, despite his years as a technology researcher, Selwyn thinks that a clipboard and a pen are still the best research tools anyone can use.
"There is no substitute for going out into the real world and talking to real people," he says.

"Cold and Inhuman": Anders Behring Breivik appears for the first time in a public court
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who confessed to two amok races in which 77 people were killed in Norway this summer, described himself in his first appearance before a public court in Oslo as a "resistance" fighter.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and a temple knight in Norway," he said in front of a courtroom with more than 500 people.
"I object to the court because you have received your mandate from organizations that support hatedology and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I recognize the laws, but I don't confess."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue because he "did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform on which he can express his views."
For the same reason, he denied Breivik, who had a pre-written speech, the permission to turn to the members of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered that the police keep Breivik in custody for 12 weeks, that he has no access to the media for four weeks. He said that the authorities will monitor all visits and the entire correspondence over eight weeks.
Approximately 30 survivors and victims' relatives took part in the hearing.
Some came hoping to see Breivik in the eye, others wanted to confirm that he remained behind locks and bars.
Everyone took part with the goal that everything goes on a roadblock.
"I thought he seemed cold and inhuman," a survivor of Utoya told the Norwegian broadcaster NRK.
"It was unpleasant, but for me it goes a little further after I've seen and heard the suspect."
Breivik wore a dark suit and a blue tie and worked calmly and professionally throughout the hearing. He looked journalists and survivors in the eye as he entered and left the building.
Despite Breivik's bizarre indication that he was part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge came to the conclusion that he was not mentally ill and said that there was no evidence that he had had accomplices.
Some may like that the attacks of July 22 were apparently the work of a single extremist and not that of a group of radicals.
But does this automatically ease the grief and confusion that an entire nation still feels?
"I wish he looked like a monster, but he doesn't," said a victim's relative.
"It would be so much easier if he did it."
7 lessons of the interview with the deceased Steve Jobs, which was shown in a theater this week
After the death of Steve Jobs on October 5th, some compared him to Henry Ford, highlighting the technical genius as a great modern inventor.
What Apple fans might find most revealing in the recently rediscovered job interview, which was dusted this week before special film screenings in the important markets, is how much this creative head understood business processes and workflows.
He was certainly a designer, a dreamer and self-appointed hippie, but he was also an ardent organizer who worked hard on charts - a man who believed that many managing directors suffer from "a disease of thinking", "that a really great idea makes up 90 percent of the work... [but] there is a huge amount of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product."
In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the TV series "Triumph of Professional Idiots" about the break-up of the personal computer. And he spent more than an hour with jobs in which they had one of the rare, detailed conversations.
At that time, 10 years had passed since jobs had been forced from Apple. And he was already working hard on his new computer company NeXT, and was looking forward to the wide acceptance of the Internet.
While a small part of Cringley's interview was used in professional idiots, he says that the copy templates of the interview were missing in the delivery.
It was only after Job's death that a complete copy of the VHS was discovered in the director's garage.
This slightly revised film material forms the basis for the 68-minute film "Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview", which comes to the Landmark Theatre this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone who is known to abhor detailed interviews, jobs here seem surprisingly eager to explain his technological philosophies and business strategies.
And incredibly thoughtful.
Over the course of the interview, there will be four longer breaks between question and answer - 10 to 15 seconds of reflection, in which jobs clearly weigh their thoughts and strive for accuracy.
There are also moments when Job's perfectionism comes to light when he apparently responds impatiently to Cringely's questions and urges him to respond more quickly to topics or side-acts of greater importance.
Before the era of Pixar, iPod or iPhone recorded, the lost interview appears somehow incredibly far-sighted when jobs evaluate what other companies make his opinion right or wrong and his own vision of the future of the computer.
It is one thing to read posthumous values of career jobs. But seeing jobs here as the greedy dreamer who is on the leap to grandeur is something quite different, original and inspiring.
He has a vision of how things could be and should be.
Shortly after he had done all this here, he pulled off and made it.
A quick look at seven remarkable sequences of the Lost Interview:
How he learned to run a business:
"During the whole years of business, I always ask, "Why are you doing things?" And the answer you always get is, "Oh, that's just how it's done."
No one knows why he does what he does. No one in the business really thinks in depth about things.
That's what I found.
Jobs continues its efforts to rationalize Apple's accounting.
Astonished at how costs were recorded - usually one started with "standard costs", which were calculated on mere assumption and which were then adjusted with "distinction" - he developed an automated factory that ensured that the business costs could be determined to the smallest extent.
How the Pope was observed:
Jobs tells of the "Blue Box" he built with Steve Wozniak, a device that could be used to sneak into the telephone company and conduct long-distance calls for free.
Much has been written about the device, but job enthusiasm when he describes the Blue Box as an act of self-determination is contagious.
He describes how Wozniak and he would test the box using a pay phone, make a call, and then connect from one AT&T network to another, while grinding as many satellites as possible.
"We sent things half a dozen times around the globe, and when you were on the phone, it came out a minute later on the phone next door," says Job squeaking.
"We were young and we learned that we can build ourselves something that can control trillions of dollars of infrastructure around the world."
We both, we didn't know much, but we could build this little thing that can control a gigantic thing, that was an incredible lesson and I don't think there would be Apple without it.
Jobs continues to tell of a glorious strike that Wozniak and he almost pulled off when they called in the Vatican via Blue Box in the middle of the night and wanted to talk to the Pope, while they were as good as they could imitate Henry Kissinger.
Since several members of the Catholic hierarchy were called in the middle of the night to speak with the American diplomat, the two had to laugh off before the Pope himself got on the phone.
How he fell in love with the technique (and unpreparedly called Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12, when he was looking for spare parts to build a frequency counter, he searched for Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called him.
Shortly after her 20-minute phone call, jobs for the summer got a part-time job at Hewlett-Packard.
"It had a remarkable impact on me. It was the only company I had seen at the age and it shaped my views about what a company was and how well it treated its employees."
Later, jobs became one of the HP employees who visited the company's research labs in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desktop computer ever made".
He was as big as a suitcase, had a small screen with a brown tube and I fell in love with him.
I would climb up at HP as a teenager and hang on this machine and write programs for them.
How to improve innovation:
Jobs talk several times in the interview about how to spontaneously invent new products.
Early in his career, when he was installing some platinum, he was asked by a customer to assemble the entire computer.
He worked with a payment period of only 30 days and had to think both the assembly and the delivery of the finished equipment.
Later at Apple he recalls the problems he had in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember compelling arguments... you yelled at me that it would take five years [to build a mouse that would cost $300] and I got up, went out and found a manufacturer."
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could have built for $15.
Over large companies that leave behind:
Long before he revived Apple, Jobs foresaw the ways in which so many industrial giants went down with their visions and lost control of their shares.
"Did we say you work at IBM or Xerox, so do you do a better copier or printer, so what?"
They own the stock monopoly, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, so [is it such people] who ultimately lead the companies and the product with which people are pushed out of decision-making.
The product genius that has led to this monopoly position is being eradicated by people who have no concept of good products vs. bad products - craftsmanship.
This happened at Xerox...
Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry.
You could have been ten times bigger, could have been Microsoft in the 1990s...
You've captured the defeat of victory.
About innovation as an art form:
"There is a lot of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product... when you develop this great idea, it changes and grows."
You learn a lot about his subtleties.
You have to make votes, certain things you can't, but electrons, glass, robots, factories.
You have to remember 5,000 things, these concepts, and bring them all together...
In the end, it goes on to taste, it goes without saying that you try to get involved with the best stuff that humans have created and then try to bring these things together to what you do.
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal.
We are always shameless in stealing great ideas.
Part of what made Macintosh great was that the people who work there were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians who by chance are the best computer scientists in the world.
Had it not been the computer industry, they would create fantastic things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas are dining with opponents of health laws, as court accepts case
On the day when the Supreme Court meets behind closed doors to discuss the politically shared question of whether one will listen to a challenge to the health laws of President Obama, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, took part in a dinner sponsored by the law firm that the case will be represented in court.
The incident took place last Thursday when all nine judges met at a meeting to discuss the petitions for examination.
One of the cases to be dealt with was an action brought by 26 states against the far-reaching reform of the health care system, which was passed last year by Congress, a law that became the slogan of conservative activists everywhere in the United States.
The judges agreed to the hearing. In fact, a 5 1/2-hour basic discussion is expected in March, the result of which is likely to stimulate the 2012 presidential campaign, which will be in full swing at the time the court decision is announced.
The lawyer who will stand in court and claim that the law is to be overturned will probably be Paul Clement, once Attorney General under the government of George W. Bush.
Clement's law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies that supported the annual dinner of the federalist society, an old-fashioned group dedicated to defending conservative principles.
Another company that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the business associations, the National Federation of Independent Business, which challenged the law.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., who is financially involved in the outcome of the process.
The dinner took place a few hours after the court had discussed the case in a Washington hotel.
Service had, among others, Mitch McConnell, the head of the Republican group in the Senate and a declared opponent of the health reform
The dinner guests? Scalia and Thomas.
This is nothing new: The two judges have been attending events of the federalist society for years.
And that doesn't violate moral rules.
In fact, judges are exempt from the Code of Conduct, which regulates the actions of the lower federal judges.
If they were, they would probably be governed by principle 4c of the Code, which states: "A judge may participate in the benefit events of law nearer and other organizations, whereby the judge may not be a speaker, guest of honor, or according to the program not be a guest of such events."
Nevertheless, the extreme proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two of the firms involved in the case as well as to a company with a massive financial interest in it was sufficient to alert moral and government activists.
"This amazing violation of morality and the contrast to the Code punishes the actions of some judges lie, the court abides by the same rules that apply to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of the Common Cause, a civil rights movement in the United States.
"The judges won and dined during a Benefizi event with lawyers with pending proceedings in court."
Their appearance and their support of a donation action for this event undermine any claim to impartiality and are not acceptable.
Scalia and Thomas show little consideration for critics who say they would mix court matters too easily with groups who are led by the agenda, such as federalist society.
And Thomas' wife Ginni is a well-known conservative activist.
On the other hand, the conservatives claim that it is Judge Elena Kagan who has a moral problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was a state attorney under the Obama government when the first legal appeals were brought before the court in the first instance.
Her critics urged Kagan to withdraw from the hearing of the case because she was too involved in defending the law to be unbiased.
Kagan does not make any institutions to do this.
Boeing pulls record order of 18 trillion dollars ashore
Airline Emirates orders 50 dual aircraft of type Boeing 777 with an option on 20 more aircraft.
In addition, Boeing sells six Boeing Dreamliner to Oman Air, a business worth more than $1 trillion.
It is really a rare news that a company gets an order over 50 pieces of its products.
But it is a big deal if the company is the aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. and the list price for these 50 aircraft totals is at a record amount of 18 trillion dollars.
Equally unusual is the client of Boeing: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In a forecast published on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that airlines from the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft worth 450 trillion dollars in the next 20 years.
Boeing announced its biggest assignment for commercial aircraft at all times on the weekend, measured by the value of the order: 50 two-time Boeing 777 Jets.
The hammer order came from the airport Emirates from Dubai.
The airline also has an option to purchase 20 more aircraft, which will increase the total list price to 26 trillion dollars, announced in 2011 at the Dubai Aviation Show.
On Monday, according to Boeing Oman Air ordered six Boeing 787-8, the so-called Dreamliner, which greatly improves fuel consumption and passenger comfort.
The list price for six of these aircraft is more than $1 trillion.
"This is absolutely positive for Boeing," said Neal Dihora, Stock Exchange Officer of Morningstar.
"The quality of these special customers is very high."
Many airlines in the Middle East are owned by oil producing countries.
So they don't just have the money to pay for the aircraft, but rather an increase in oil prices, which usually harms airlines, because this is one of their biggest cost points, is not so harmful because the country earns a higher oil price.
This is important because they tend to cancel or postpone aircraft orders less than other airlines do when oil prices rise, Dihora said.
"You have a natural security," he said.
The order of Emirates confirms Boeing's leadership position on the market for large-scale aircraft and helps keep the Airbus competitors SAS in check, which attacks the A350 leadership position.
Boeing's victory on the air show comes four months after Airbus announced that one would move the introduction of the largest A350 that competes directly with the 777-300ER.
The introduction was postponed in order to gain more confidence after customers had demanded a higher payload and reach.
The Boeing shares increased by 1.5% to $67.94.
Sister of the Mexican President loses apparently election in Michoacan
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that drug traffickers have supported opposing Fausto Vallejo from the PRI in the run around the governor's posts.
The sister of President Felipe Calderon apparently lost her application for the office of Governor of Muchoacan during the violent state elections. She claimed on Monday that drug traffickers had influenced the race in favor of one of her opponents.
According to the preliminary results, Fausto Vallejo won the race for governors in the Western state by the Institutional Party of the Revolution, the PRI.
"The intervention of organized crime throughout the electoral process and especially on yesterday's day is alarming, not only for Michoacan, but for the whole country," said Luisa Maria Calderon in a radio interview one day after the election on Sunday.
"They threatened our candidates, our employees in the polls ... they occupied election cabins, built blockades ... and ordered people to vote [for the PRI]."
The PRI ruled for seven decades in Mexico until it lost its presidency in 2000.
But they are striving for a return and victory in Michoacan is an important step in these efforts.
The PRI hopes for a victory in the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have barely hit Claderon, who had been in the polls before the election day.
Calderon, a candidate of her brother's conservative Partido Acción Nacional PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as a winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the candidate of the leftist Democratic Revolutionary Party PRD, the current governor, came to third place, a severe defeat for the split and unhappy left leadership for the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to recognise the provisional results.
Vallejo, former mayor of the capital of Morelia, denies links to drug traffickers and urges the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacan has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and amphetamines.
It is the home country of President Calderon and he has chosen Michoacan to launch a military-led offensive against drug traffickers in December 2006.
The violence is still going on.
A PAN mayor was killed one week before the election during an election event for Luisa Maria Calderon and numerous candidates have gone out of fear of the local elections.
For the PRI, a victory strengthens the party, no matter how repugnant the elections in Michoacan appear.
The man who will probably represent the PRI in the race for the presidential office is Enrique Pena Nieto, who congratulated Vallejo from Washington and said: "I think this victory makes us look brave next year."
ADB urges Asia to help save the eurozone
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) calls on India and China to support the rescue of the eurozone in its severe debt crisis in order to prevent a long-term downward trend that will slow down the growth of Asia’s economy.
Rajat Nag, managing director of the ADB based in Manila, said that the two fastest growing economic nations in the world must do "everything in your power" to speed up the recovery of the monetary bloc either through the International Monetary Fund or through direct mutual agreements.
He warned against the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China), which are "sufferless" looking at the difficulties in Europe, and said that the financial support of European leadership and European resources through Asia helps prevent a long-term collapse of the global economy.
"We're all in the same boat."
"Everyone who can help Europe out of this crisis is thus helpful," he said to the Financial Times in an interview on the margins of the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asien may be protected to some extent, but it is not immune."
"If China and India can help, then by all means."
Europe's monetary union has become a serious debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days Italy's interest costs have increased dangerously and the prime ministers of both Italy and Greece have resigned.
The emerging severe debt crisis in Europe raises fears that the global economy could fall into recession and led to calls that leading emerging economies should join forces to support the euro area.
Mr. Nag predicted that any support from Asia would be channelled by the IMF, but said that mutual agreements - such as the purchase of EU rescue fund bonds, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) - offer greater negotiating power to European partners in Asia.
Anand Sharma, Indian Trade Minister, said that "India will do everything in its power" to help the Eurozone, as its own economy is now suffering from falling exports and the drying up of foreign capital flows.
"No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and turbulent," he said.
"We face major challenges and we need to maintain a high level of growth."
"It's not an option, it's an assignment, because otherwise we'll find work for our millions of young men and women."
Others argue that developing economies such as India have no incentive to help rich Europeans if they themselves face major economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, professor at US Brown University, said that it would be politically very difficult to sell the 1.2 trillion people in India help for Europe, of which more than 800 million of 2 dollars or even less a day live.
"At some point they will find out that the Greeks retire at 50 and spend vacations on the beach. Then you have a problem," he said.
Lee Howell, Managing Director of the World Economic Forum, asked similarly why India's reserves should be used to keep the numerous and well-paid public service employees in Greece, with jobs in poorly managed, loss-making facilities such as the railways.
Mr. Nag said that the crises in the eurozone will have "significant domino effects" across Asia.
The ADB's forecast with an economic growth of 7.5 percent in Asia for the years 2011/is now threatening "the risk of gradation" due to the imminent threat from Europe.
He said that vulnerable emerging markets would have to create "crisis plans" to protect themselves from a downward trend and a significant capital outflow of their words.
Urgent warnings from the Pentagon against possible incisions in the defense sector
Minister of Defence Leon Panetta warmed the Congress on Monday when he warned that automatic budget cuts would unwittingly weaken national security, triggering a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon's halls to the war scenes in Afghanistan and the civilian flow bands.
The Pentagon is already considering cuts of $450 trillion over the next decade, but is now afraid that further cuts of $600 trillion or more will be necessary if Congress cannot complete the expenses.
"The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the Ministry," wrote Panetta in a letter to Republican Senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said that a failure of Congress in reaching a budget agreement, which will lead to so-called confiscation, would lead to 23% general cuts and a halt to numerous new projects.
"Such a high reduction, carried out in such a careless way, would make most of our ship and construction projects impracticable - you cannot buy three quarters of a ship or a building - and seriously harm other modernization efforts," Panetta wrote to the senators.
"We would also be forced to involuntaryly separate ourselves from a large part of our civilian staff and, as the reduction would be implemented so quickly, we would have to leave civilians with a certainty of limited probability in order to achieve the goal."
"These changes would destroy the faith of those who maintain our military and seriously damage our alertness."
The cuts were finally met by the combat troops," Panetta said.
"While the war-time quotas in the anti-terrorist campaign are not directly affected by the seizure, the serious intervention in the basic budget would adversely affect the war efforts," Panetta warned.
"Personal settings have been shortened, which would lead to delays in the settings and the recruitment supervision that support the war."
"The salaries of staff would be reduced, leading to late payments to wartime traders and legal and political support would be disrupted."
The two senators answered Panetta 10 days ago and asked for further details regarding the potential impact of automatic cuts on the Ministry of Defence.
"The consequences of confiscation of the Department of Defense would lead to a rapid decline of the United States as the world's leading military power."
"We are vehement against this draconian act," said the senators in a joint statement on Monday afternoon when they published Panetta's letter.
"This is a result we can't live with, and there's certainly nothing to push us."
"The confiscation is a threat to the national security interests of the United States of America and their entry should not be allowed."
Whether Panetta's letter and the new warnings from the senators will increase the pressure on a compromise in the budget or increase demands to exempt the Pentagon from cuts remains to be seen.
Panetta has increasingly blatantly pronounced the possible cuts, although he was able to gain many years of experience with the budget in Congress and in the White House before he came to the top of the Pentagon, and knows that he is faced with difficult decisions.
At a press conference last week, the Minister of Defence painted a gloomy picture, which could come up - a military with shell, but without core.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a brigade without ammunition."
"It's an air force squadron without enough trained pilots."
"It is a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without sufficiently trained soldiers who are able to carry out the mission," Panetta said in his opening address in the Pentagon.
"It is a power of war that lacks morale and alertness and is unable to accept it with potential opponents."
"She's actually making you angry."
In an appendix to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta gave new details on how reductions "created significant operational risks: delays in times of crisis, conflicts and disasters, severe limitations of our global operational and capacity, leading to unacceptable risk in future war operations."
And Panetta said that some of the biggest defence projects of the strike could fall victim, including those that have already been tested and are already in the early planning phase.
This list also includes the fighter F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a planned new bomber, the next generation of ballistic submarines, the new Littoral Combat Ship and the new ground fighter vehicle needed by the Army and Marine to replace the Humvee.
If one stopped the further development and testing of the F35, this would save up to 80 trillion dollars in the next 10 years, but the supporters say that it is an important next step to upgrade so that possible dangers can be eliminated by China and other opponents.
How to Inculcate a Lie
A look at the current headlines shows how suspicious and widespread deception and lies are in everyday life.
The Republican presidential candidate, Herman Cain, is engaged in becoming master of the accusations of sexual harassment by several women. Both sides deny each other.
Penn State's leadership is accused of perjury, as reports of sexual abuse by a retired football coach have been withheld.
Last week an open microphone was heard when French President Nikolas Sarkozy told American President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
Lies destroy careers and shake countries.
New York Congressman and Internet exhibitionist Anthony Weidner made a fool of himself when he circulated denials that were quickly refuted by inviolable evidence.
The former presidential candidate John Edwards is accused of the violation of campaign funding associated with the concealment of an extramarital affair.
And then, of course, no one who has experienced it forgets the media circus that President Bill Clinton triggered when he lied during his second term in the Oval Office regarding his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
Stories about cheating in school and college exams are widespread.
There were incidents in which teachers gave their students the test answers so that they could do well even in their performance reviews.
Mentors who should teach the opposite send a message that lies and maligns are okay.
How much deception do we experience?
As studies show, we lie between 10 and 200 times a day.
Many of these lies, however, are considered an emergency lie.
Another study shows that strangers lie to each other three times during the first 10 minutes of a meeting.
To recognize lies or to "discover" lies is one that is important for every human being, both for personal and professional reasons.
Far from a social game such as Sharaden, in which the goal is to call "Hab you!", detaching a deception is a serious field of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades at respected universities that carried out far-reaching research projects, especially in the fields of psychology and physiology.
One result of the research is that most old myths have been deflected from the lie.
Lies look you in the eye.
They don't always stutter, stammer, rot and gag.
However, it must not be concluded that these liars are difficult to uncover and detach.
A trained liar deterrent can penetrate the truth by learning something about the structure of the claim, the fine facial expressions, about questioning and timing.
I have spent several years investigating the scientific results of the comprehensive and ever-growing field of deforestation, and it is clear that defacing a deception is a modern ability that is easy to learn and helps us to find justice in our complex world, especially if the setting up or questioning of persons or negotiations or administration is one of our own professional responsibilities.
Good liars are very good at appraising other people, raising their interest and controlling their own emotions, and they feel intuitively how they are perceived by others.
Thanks to research, we know that the extroverted people lie more often than the introverted people, that men appear more "self-oriented" lies than women, whose lies "orientate themselves to others" - usually they want to protect the feelings of others - that married people lie to their partners less often than unmarried people (but the lies they tell are usually "fat lies").
We also know that when a person has been deformed as a perpetrator, others feel less guilty to have lied to that person.
How do you know if someone's lying?
First, by observing the normal behavior of this person.
This is called "baselining", the starting position.
It provides a reference point for later evaluation of changes.
Watch the attitude, laughter, voice quality of your subject.
You should know better when someone normally keeps tripping with his foot, so that they do not unjustly accuse him when he triples with his foot during a meeting.
Then watch out for accumulations of noticeable verbal and nonverbal behaviors.
Consider these accumulations as alarm bells that are screaming, not as evidence of a defrosting.
People who deceive may stare when they try to remember their story. Perhaps their feet point towards the door or they lean towards the exit, change their position significantly, or show a "rest after the adjustment conversation", this deep, relaxing exhalation and the change in attitude when all the hard questions are over.
Askers often falsely signal that an adjustment interview is over just to keep an eye out after this relaxation after the adjustment interview.
In addition, be aware of the language of your subject.
Scott Peterson's exterminator is famous when he used the past when he claimed that his dead wife was still alive and triggered a national search for her.
Deceptive people can also use a distancing language: "I had no sexual relationship with this woman... Miss Lewinsky" or if you repeat a tricky question in total.
The most common verbal signs are subtle.
Some people use "qualifying language" when they answer a tricky question: "Well... to tell you the truth ... as far as I am known ... according to best knowledge and conscience."
This makes the answer more perceptive than factual, often causing the alarm bells to scream.
There is no means of magic to defuse lies, but you can learn skills through which a defrosting is possible.
Thanks to these skills, anyone can become less likely to be the victim of fraud, both in the private and in the working life.
Controversial plan of an oil pipeline will be revised after threat by delayed US approval
A few days after the Obama government threatened to delay the approval of a planned oil pipeline from Canada in the Gulf of Mexico, thereby making trade unions angry and at the same time calming down environmentalists, the pipeline-building company is trying to redesign the project so that it can return to normality.
TransCanada said on Monday evening that the planned pipeline will be diverted from the ecologically sensitive area of the sandhills in Nebraska.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the Nebraska Parliament building.
Alex Pourbax of TransCanada said that the company remains confident that the pipeline will eventually be approved, although with a different course.
This was followed by a announcement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs last week, after which a decision on a federal approval for the project would be postponed until the new possible course was reviewed, which avoided the area of Sandhills in Nebraska and the Ogallala-Aquifer, a large underwater supply.
"This is a real step forward," said Republican Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska, to Fox News.
The new environmental review commissioned by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs may delay a decision until 2013, following the elections next year, even if officials deny that politicians were involved in the decision.
Obama stated in a written statement last week that the decision was a task of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and promised his support.
The 1700-mile pipeline was connected to Canada with the Gulf of Mexico.
She would pump 700,000 barrels of oil a day from the province of Alberta to the refineries in Texas.
For this purpose, the pipeline would have to cross six states.
Environmentalists hate them, but labour markets love them, because they appreciate that the pipeline creates 20,000 jobs.
But the lawmakers of Nebraska, who are against the plan, weigh the laws to force a turn from the region of Sandhills and the Ogallala-Aquifer, a main source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current study on the impact on the environment of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs found that the project had little impact on the environment, but the source of the energy industry says that the main auditor of the Ministry has requested a separate probe of the review procedure focusing on two issues.
One is whether a lobbyist who was hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was a consultant to Hillary Clinton in 2008, is in a conflict of interest.
The other is whether a company commissioned to conduct the original study was an inappropriate choice, since it is connected with TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle accused because she allegedly forced a toddler out of fear to vomit
A New Yorker family claims that the Disco-Diva Patti LaBelle in the lobby of her Manhattan building had suffered a poison attack that would have put her little daughter in such fear that she surrendered to fear.
The tirad of the Lady Marmalade singer made the 18 month old Genevieve Monk so afraid that she suffered from "personality changes, sleep disorder" and "increased fear of strangers," said her family before the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
It was on November 10 last year, when stage worker Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanna, a nursery nurse, and Genevieve wanted to leave for a family trip.
While Kevin Monk got the car, Roseanna Monk took the luggage and Genevieve on his arm to the lobby in her building on Riverside Boulevard.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped near the door and stopped her daughter for a moment.
"Someone appeared behind me and said, "Do you know what your daughter is doing?" I said, "Yes," and went to take her back on her arm," she said.
LaBelle admonished the pregnant woman angry.
"She said in an aggressive tone, "You shouldn't stop your daughter near the door," said Roseanna Monk.
"I told her, "I don't care what you say or think."
She became angry and started to scoff - she used the F-word and the A-word and became very loud...
She had a bottle of water in her hand and began to pour water out of the bottle on me.
She said Genevieve had become hysterical.
"I said to this woman, "See what you did to my daughter," said the mother of the child.
LaBelle fell upon the mother, who was still carrying Genevieve on her arm, and had to be held back from her companionship and pulled to a waiting car, said Roseanna Monk.
The baby screamed so much that it had to surrender, she said.
Later, the LaBelle family apologized in writing, but received no reply.
LaBelle's lawyer and representatives did not respond to calls asking for an opinion.
The complaint is for an indeterminate compensation, but the family lawyer, Sam Davis, said that he would not charge a fee and the family would plan the money she would get from child cancer.
"We want Patti LaBelle to take responsibility for her behavior," said Davis.
"This kind of behavior is absolutely unacceptable, especially if it is shown to a nursery nurse who wears an 18-month-old baby on her arm."
Climatic hardships slowed the economy
In the first year that Mario López Valdez is in government, unemployment and undeclared work rose in Sinaloa, while foreign investment declined and the economy stagnated.
2011 will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloas. It is the first year in which Mario López Valdez, who calls himself the initiator of change and holds great hopes of economic growth, is in the government. However, due to climatic imbalances, growth cannot be the talk of growth, but on the contrary, the main economic indicators deteriorated.
The low temperatures in February not only caused losses in the agricultural sector at millions, but also limited the growth of the national economy and caused a general fall in economic activity of 3.6 percent in the first quarter. This is mainly due to the historical decline in agricultural development of 31.16 percent, which slowed down the impact on other sectors of the economy.
According to a report published by the Consejo Mexicano para el Desarrollo Rural Sustentable (the Mexican Council for Sustainable Agricultural Development) on the effects of the frost, 582,000 hectares of agricultural land were damaged, 78.03 per cent of which were completely destroyed and the remaining 21.07 per cent were partially destroyed.
The decline in economic activity by November has steadily increased unemployment in the Mexican state. The Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía observed a rapid increase in unemployment in the first quarter of the year, for from January to March 55 053 residents of Sinaloas had no employment, corresponding to 4.53 per cent of the labour force. In the second quarter, the unemployment rate rose to 5.28 per cent and from July to September to 6.19 per cent, resulting in 74 000 unemployed in Sinaloa, which is 18,969 more than in the first quarter.
Lower liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa this year is due to several factors. Economic scientist Gerardo López Cervantes, Dean of the Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences of the University of Autónoma (UAS), comments that public institutions' policies indirectly explain the growing unemployment.
"What we are currently observing is an increase in unemployment, which has several factors to do with, among other things, the loss of liquidity in the market as a result of the cutbacks by the legislation adopted to combat money laundering in Congress, because for those who are prohibited from raising dollars, it is not easy to let them work for themselves, invest them or use them for anything else," he said.
Migration stopped
López Cervantes pointed out that growing unemployment is also a demographic factor.
"The number of people who leave the country in search of work abroad, especially in the United States, has fallen, due to the problems of entry and, on the one hand, because it is difficult to find work there. These people stay here and are looking for work to increase unemployment," he says.
Undeclared work
The analysis of the labour market in Sinaloa is even more serious if the high proportion of undeclared work is taken into account.
Unemployment and undeclared work are the lowest wages in all of Mexico, according to the statistics of the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (Mexican Social Security Institute) and the Secretaría del Trabajo y Previsión Social (Government Office for Labour and Social Welfare in Mexico).
The average monthly income of employees in Sinaloa was up to September 5352 pesos, which is much less than the general government average of 7375 pesos.
Reduction of the ADI
In addition to the decline in economic activity and the rise in unemployment, the biggest decline in foreign direct investment (ADI) in the last ten years was recorded in 2011. According to Secretaría de Economía (State Economic Authority), the ADI from January to June amounted to 630 597 dollars, representing a decline of 87.74 percent compared to the 5,143 312 dollars in the same period of the previous year.
The Secretaría de Desarrollo Económico del Gobierno (Government Authority for Economic Development) has a total investment of 17 280 000 pesos in 2011, mainly from companies in the tertiary sector.
The debt
In the face of the economic crisis, in July, the state government requested a loan of 3 000 000 000 pesos to be invested in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities.
Reactions
For the representatives of entrepreneurship, Mario López Valdé's first year of government made it clear that he was incapacitated.
Miguel Loredo López, Chairman of the Cámara Nacional de la Industria de la Transformación (State Chamber of Manufacturing in Mexico), said that no efforts were made in 2011 to harmonise the views of the various sectors, including the state government.
"The economic activity in Sinaloa was really poor this year. It has to be worked hard to regain the lost terrain this year and in 2012 we have to make double efforts. The efforts of all and especially the progress of the already well-coordinated government team have not been sufficiently coordinated," he said.
Slow economic development
Loredo López said that events such as the frost at the beginning of the year made the country's economic development difficult and slowed down.
"The low economic flow is the result of several events, including the frost. One of the most important impacts is a slow-down economy that is not moving enough to generate an economic dynamic that could produce an acceptable flow of processes, products and services. Therefore, we will complete the year far below our expectations," he said.
Redefine vocation
Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, Chairman of the Confederación Patronal de la República Mexicana (Mexico Business Association) in Sinaloa, said that the state should be given more dynamic productive activities.
"In general, we have observed that work has been done. We believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term programme to redefine the economic vocation and line of the country, because it is important to activate all material and human resources Sinaloas," he said.
There's a lot to do
The Chairman of Coparmex stressed the importance of developing a future perspective that will lead to better government efforts.
"In general, I would say that the government has achieved good results in various areas. Economic development has progressed, but it is important to develop a long-term programme," he said.
He stressed that the current state power had made progress with the government.
"There are areas in which it can be said that the government has acted more comprehensively. What I can say is that work has been done and that the government is aware that there is still a lot of work ahead of it," he said.
Arrest for 8 kg marijuana
A resident of Navolato was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days in prison for possession of eight kilos of marijuana.
The Republic's prosecution announced that the drug trafficker was Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, who was punished for a crime against public health - here the possession of marijuana for commercial purposes.
According to AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested on June 7, 2010, by Mexican military forces in the surveillance of Cipriano Valdez street against guard post No. 80 in the village of El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug dealer drove in a white van where he kept a black bag in a box in the car and on the passenger seat a small backpack where the military found eight kilos and 23 grams of marijuana.
For this reason, the confiscated goods were handed over to the judge of the district and the punished one is still in the execution centre.
Debts for construction work
The social buildings for migrants provided for in the Hábitat, Rescate de Espacios Públicos and 3x1 programmes are at risk of not being completed due to lack of resources or only with great delay, said Miguel Ángel López Miranda.
The head of the Urban Social Development Authority stated that, although the construction programmes have already advanced, they are now in danger, as the government has not paid the funds it owes, which exceed 11 million peso for the three programmes.
He said that the total investment in these three programmes was almost 50 million peso, of which 25 percent fell to the state. So far, only the Federación and the municipality had contributed funds to the construction work, which is why a delay in the completion of the construction was expected.
"12 million they have to contribute, and although the year is coming to an end, they have not given us a penny, and this, although they have had to pay us a part in July," he said. "In order not to be late, we have already started the construction work, and they are already far advanced, but we need the money."
He pointed out that under the government of Jesús Aguilar Padilla the state had not fulfilled its obligations, so the congregation had to take up a loan of 7 million at the beginning of its reign. This corresponds to the amount that the central government should have incurred.
"This had happened to us in the last legislative period, because the state did not have sufficient economic resources. The programmes went on and this year we had to obtain the funds that the state had not spent to participate in these programmes," he said.
Even if the public authorities were obliged to disburse these funds, he commented that the Minister for Administration and Finance had been asked to speed up the administrative work and to pay the outstanding share as soon as possible.
"They must contribute almost 12 million, and although the year is already over, they have not given us a penny."
The Court approved the transition to digital television in Mexico for 2015
The transition of analogue to digital signals has been one of the most important changes worldwide in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) rejected the constitutional complaints filed by the Senate and the House of Deputies against the Presidential Decree and the need for the switch from analogue to digital signals from 2021 to 2015, due to the absence of eight votes required to challenge the law.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Supreme Court, Juan Silva Meza, felt that President Felipe Calderón had not exceeded his responsibilities when he issued the Decree-Law detailing the switch to terrestrial digital television.
This decision rejected the constitutional dispute initiated by the Senate, since it did not receive the required qualified majority of eight votes, so that the court could decide on constitutionality or non-constitutionality. Thus, the law remains in force.
In the complaint project prepared by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, it was proposed to declare the Decree-Law unconstitutional as the Comisión Federal de Telecomunicaciones (Cofetel) (Federal Commission for Telecommunications in Mexico) is responsible for the regulations relating to radio and television, which is why the Decree-Law would be contrary to the hierarchical principles and to the provisions of the law.
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero voted in favour of the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies filed constitutional complaints against the Decree-Law. Following the adoption of the complaints, Minister Sánchez Cordero no longer applied the Decree-Law and ceased all activities to establish the digital transmission.
The Council of Ministers also rejected the complaint lodged by the Chamber of Deputies without entering into the debate on the project for which Minister Sánchez Cordero was also responsible.
In his contribution, the Prime Minister stated that he did not agree with the project's arguments, in the sense that the government should not regulate the measures to be taken by the public administration under general rules.
"I also do not believe that if this were done, the independence of the regulatory body would be affected." She also recalled that the central government is responsible for the planning of strategic policies, such as the telecommunications sector, for constitutional reasons, because it is responsible for state affairs.
The replacement of analogue signals by digital is one of the most important changes that have taken place in recent years around the world, and it results in better use of the radioelectric spectrum, an increased quality of the signal and more channels.
The postponement of the switch, she said, is a postponement of the exploitation of digitalisation, which is a decision in the public interest, which has not only technical implications, "because it covers economic, social, political and security aspects."
These matters, she stressed, "made it necessary to act on the whole system, in accordance with the principle of economic governance by the state, they included a group of features that put the Constitution in the hands of the central government."
She recalled that many countries around the world had already implemented the digital change, namely the government, although they had highly specialised facilities.
It could not be concluded that the government intervened in the Congress's powers with the publication of the contested law district, because the laws passed by the legislature would be respected," she assured.
The possibility of counting the ballots in Michoacán individually is considered
According to the information provided by PREP, the difference between the first and second place in the governor's election is almost 27 percent, with 879 votes of a total of 6074 not yet counted.
The possibility of individual counting of the ballot is a reality this year in the elections in Michoacán, because according to the data provided by the Programmea de Resultados Electorales Preliminares (PREP) the difference between the first and second place in the governorial elections is almost 27 percent, with 879 votes of a total of 6074 not yet counted.
To this end, the President of the Consejo General del Instituto Electoral de Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that just last November, the electoral office adopted a number of arrangements to harmonise local rules with the reforms of the federal states in electoral matters.
It should be remembered that Michoacán had neither adapted his political constitution nor his electoral law nor his law on electoral justice to the reforms adopted by Congress, so that they had not entered into force during this round of elections. Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel avoided their publication in the public prosecutor within the time limits provided for by the argument or objection.
On 9 November, the Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) decided on the constitutional appeal filed by the local legislature and assessed the vote of the State Commissioner on constitutional reforms as "invalid and illegal", since he did not have the right to "determine or veto it".
María de los Ángeles Llanderal stated in an interview on the possibility of individual counting of votes that, thanks to the adoption of the guidelines by Consejo General del IEM, there would now be the possibility that the local electoral authority could partially or completely count the ballot.
Thus, in the following conditions, the votes contained in one or more electoral packages may be partially counted.The results in the minutes do not agree; the minutes on the counting and calculation of votes are not available in due course or they are not in the hands of the chairman of the electoral committee or there are obvious errors or changes in the minutes.
In addition, if there is a difference between the presumed winner and the one in second place, which is equal to or less than one percent, the total number of full-filled ballots may be counted, provided that at the beginning of the meeting there is an explicit request from the party or coalition chairman, who is the second of the candidates mentioned.
The vote can also be counted in its entirety if, after completion of the proper calculation, it is established that the difference between the presumed winner and the candidate is second or lower than one percent, provided that there is an explicit request from a representative of the party whose candidate has become second. In this case, the election packages that have been partially counted would be excluded.
It is worth mentioning that the elections in Morelia are in the same situation where, according to PREP, the difference between the first and second place is almost 0.16 percent, although the votes of 129 out of 923 votes have not yet been counted.
His Last Will
His ashes will be scattered across the Zapalinamé Mountains, confirming the family.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés roared this Sunday evening at Saltillo, his place of birth. On Monday, the Dead Show and a Mass of the Dead took place.
According to family members, the last intention of the lieutenant-in-chief was to scatter his ashes across the Zapalinamé Mountains.
After an honor, the family of Bacio Cortés returned to the capital of Coahuila in an airplane of the Mexican Air Force with the others killed in the accident. The colonel of the nearest person participated in the ceremony in Campo Marte.
At noon, the chief lieutenant's ashes landed on the hall of mourning, located on the Nazario Ortiz Garza Boulevard, and where the family and friends came to.
At 5.30 p.m., his remains were examined at the Saltillo Institute of Technology. This performance was prompted by his former fellow students from the technical abitur and his American football team, which Felipe Bacio attended during his preparation for the abitur.
"He wanted to return to Saltillo and that his ashes would be scattered over the Zapalinamé Mountains. He had always said that to his family and friends," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, sister of the pilot.
From her point of view, the lieutenant-in-chief had fulfilled all his dreams and she believes that he had stood in the fullness of his life. "He was a successful man, exceptional as a father and as a son, a loving brother and he always stood up for his family."
Felipe Bacio Cortés left the town of Saltillo very young to enter the school of the Air Force of Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some could not believe it, because they thought it would even make him dizzy on a truck. Nevertheless, he always sought to realize his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembers him as a good person. "He had hardly arrived in Saltillo, and already the whole family wanted to welcome him, as at the occasion when he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo."
The young man remembers that even at the age of seven he had gone to Zapopán to graduate his family. Therefore, he knows that his uncle died when he did what he liked best: fly a plane.
A Last Farewell
The captain of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Bacio Cortés, was honoured with the honor of the governor Jorge Torres López. Her honor was bestowed on him by the people and government, the Mexican army of the sixth military area, the Mexican Air Force, the school principal and students of the Saltillo Institute of Technology, where he studied in 1985 and was outstanding in both studies and sports.
Bacio Cortés died a few days ago when the helicopter he flew crashed, in which the Secretary of State José Francisco Blake Mora and six other people from the same authority also sat down.
At 6:05 p.m., the incarcerated remains of Bacio Cortés, citizens of Saltillo, arrived to be handed over to members of the Mexican Air Force in front of the barracks, led by Major Jaime Martinez. His family members, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina, his mother, siblings and other family members, students and teachers, were already waiting for him.
The abandoned corpse was found on a plot at Cadreyta NL
A few hours before the find, military personnel introduced the media to eleven people who had been arrested in the same locality in connection with the organized crime.
Three men were found killed by gunshots in different parts of the body and a shot of mercy in an abandoned finca in Cadreyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The event had taken place at the kilometre point 1.5 of the road from Cadreyta to Santiago at the height of the municipality of El Castillo.
Several transients saw that the door of the country house surrounded by a beige-brown wall was raised on a very wide scale.
As they looked into the house, they found the bodies of three persons, which they immediately told the competent authorities.
One wore a yellow t-shirt and dark pants, without shoes; next to him lay another one, dressed in a white top.
Nearly a meter away was the body of another person with red T-shirt and blue trousers.
All three were on their stomachs.
According to the information received on the spot, the three persons must have been murdered in another place as no cartridge casings have been found.
On the wall of the country house there are inscriptions that write one organized gang of criminals to another, and several entrances were found in the wall and door.
11 Persons Arrested in Cadreyta
The Secretaría de la Defensa Nacional (State Secretary of Defense) presented 11 persons, including a minor who were part of a criminal activity mainly in the town of Cadreyta, and who are associated with kidnappings, murders, halconeo (human hunt) and secret funerals.
According to the information published, eight persons were arrested at the Los Alveros settlement on November 11 and a prisoner was released.
Three properties and a cell phone were secured. The arrested confirmed to be members of the criminal group "Los Zetas".
On November 12, at 6:00 a.m., the military found a car without registration plates with two occupants in the town of Rancho Viejo in Cadreyta.
During the inspection of the car, the military found a long weapon, a charger and 18 cartridges.
Later, on November 13, at 2 p.m., one of her accomplices was arrested in the municipality of La Frauda, who tried to flee at the sight of the military.
They are charged with secret confederations in General Terán, China and Cadreyta.
On Wednesday the formation of the new Italian government
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to introduce the new government that will face the crisis that Italy has brought to the brink of economic collapse.
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to introduce the new government that will face the crisis that Italy has brought to the brink of economic collapse.
A statement from the Presidential Palace announced that the Monti, appointed on Sunday, would meet with the President, Giorgio Napolitano, on Wednesday to confirm the formation of the government.
It is expected that he will present a majority of technocratic cabinet, although it is not yet clear when the new Prime Minister will take office.
Monti said he would present to the President the results of the talks with the political parties on the formation of government.
"I want to reaffirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to cope with these difficult times," said the former EU Commissioner to the journalists.
Monti did not explicitly confirm the formation of government, but his comments show that the obstacles have been overcome.
"The frame is now well set," he added.
Monti has managed to form a government in less than three days, which is much less time than normal. Meanwhile, Italy is fighting a political and financial crisis that has driven the cost of debt to an intolerable level.
The new government, led by former EU Commissioner Monti, must adopt a tough austerity package called for by the euro-politicians in order to regain confidence in Italy.
The pressure to rush, which is on Monti, was still exacerbated by the fluctuating market situation in which Italian government bonds were charged at 7% interest for 10 years, in line with the situation in which Greece and Ireland were forced to apply for the European bailout.
Emma Marcegaglia, President of the Italian Confederation of Industry Confindustria, told the press after a meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government to the fullest extent possible."
We believe that this government is the last chance to get Italy out of this emergency.
Monti's chances of success were greatly increased by the support of the party PDL by Silvio Berlusconi, which had to resign from the crisis on Saturday.
"We believe that the efforts of Professor Monti are intended to produce good results," said Angelino Alfano, secretary of the Middle Right Party.
The support of the PDL, the largest party in Italy, is essential, for so far many of its members have spoken out against a majority of technocrats, which are just making up Monti.
Parliament's support
The new Monti government needs strong parliamentary support to implement the probably unpopular austerity measures.
Resistance to its efforts or the delaying of reforms could once again lead to a devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks is also exerting pressure, pointing out that Monti's failure is a disaster.
Monti started on Monday with his debates with political parties, trade unions and business associations, as well as with youth and women's organisations.
Tuesday evening, the session will be closed.
Monti was appointed this Sunday by Napolitano, who in response to the crisis initiated an extremely rapid change of government.
After a brief breath towards the end of last week, when it was known that Berlusconi would resign, as a result of the uncertainty about the success of the new Prime Minister, the cost of Italian government bonds has returned to critical limits.
A rescue of Italy with a public debt of 1.8 trillion euros would be too much for the current EU bailout.
Monti said that his government would have to take up to the next elections, which are expected to take place in 2013, despite the predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement the reforms, instead of preferring the elections.
Monti said that he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the big parties insist that this should only consist of technicians, an indication of their concerns in view of the process imposed by the pressure on the financial markets.
Political sources point out that mutual distrust and disagreement between the parties complicate the involvement of persons from political life.
Spaniards have more game opportunities than the Ticos
Of the 22 players retrieved from Spain, ten have over 50 international games on the hump.
From Costa Rica's side only one of the 22 called 50 games is behind it.
A huge difference for Costa Rica when the 22 players from both countries are compared to each other for the friendship game, which takes place today at 3:05 p.m. in the San José National Stadium.
While World and European champions, number one on FIFA's monthly ranking, can look back on a considerable number of class A selection games, the three-colored team has only Michael Umana as the only defender with over 50 international games.
He reached this number last Friday with the match against Panama (0-2) in Rommel Fernández.
The Spanish players playing in the League de las Estrellas (Starliga) and influential clubs of the Premier League of England have every year the opportunity to participate in numerous home games (liga and cup championships) as well as high-ranking European Cups such as the Champions League.
In addition, the experience with the Spanish Furie in complicated elimination games at the Eurocup and the World Cup.
The Tico footballers, on the other hand, have few international encounters in the context of the Concaf, which is on the FIFA ranking list at the bottom.
We will see how the Spanish team draws its last record: the Torwart Iker Casillas, who reached a parity with the former Gatekeeper Andoni Zubizarreta on the last Saturday against England (Lodging 0-1 in London) with 126 foreign games.
Casillas will play against the three-colored team today and Spain a new record of 127 foreign games.
Xavi Hernández, player of the Barcelona football club, owns 106.
Casillas and Xavi even received recognition last week from the UEFA, together with others of the Iberian team who had reached the magical number 100: the quoted Zubizarreta with 126 and the middle storm of Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
The number of hundreds also approaches Carles Puyol with 97 games.
He is followed by Xabi Alonso with 91, Fernando Torres with 90, David Villa and Sergio Ramos both with 81, Andrés Iniesta with 62, Cesc Fábregas with 61 and David Silva with 53.
From the side of the Ticos and close to Michael Umana are the left side towerer Júnior Díaz with 48 games and the stormer Bryan Ruiz with 45.
From there came only five to over 30 games: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The ones with the least games.
Less than 30 games in the Spanish team Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
From the side of the national team come on less than 30 games Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest is not even approaching the 20's border.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, recorded in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar only one and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson did not have their debut yet.
Spain's historic gatekeeper is David Villa with 50 hits, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz has shot with nine most goals, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
The quintet included Costa Rica in its tour to celebrate its 20th anniversary
"Playing in Costa Rica is a dream that comes true"
In the exclusive conversation with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament from Pearl Jam says that the band is prepared to give one of their best concerts at the National Stadium next Sunday.
More than 20 years they were expected, but the band was assured that a dream will come true for them when they play in Costa Rica.
This was assured by the group's bassist and co-founder Jeff Ament, who gave Viva an exclusive interview from Brazil last week.
The band is on the South American part of its tour for the celebration of its twenty-year existence and on Sunday, the 20th, they make their only stop in Central America.
On that day, they will be performing at the National Stadium with the band The X from Los Angeles and Las Robertas from Costa Rica starting at 7.30 p.m.
You will read an excerpt from the conversation whose full copy can be found in the online edition of La Nación.
For your Costa Rican fans, a dream comes true when Pearl Jam plays in Costa Rica: Are you aware of what that means to your fans?
Playing in Costa Rica is a dream that also comes true for us.
This is just the second time that we are playing in South and Central America, and so far it has been great.
I've only been to Costa Rica once. It's such a beautiful country that we'll definitely stay there for a few more days.
It is exciting for us to bring our music there.
I'm asking you this because the fans of the band are totally devoted. They experience the days before the concert most intensely.
What do you say to your most enthusiastic fans?
Thank you for being with us all these years.
We took almost 21 years until we came to Costa Rica. Thank you for waiting so long and we are sorry to have taken so long until we came here.
Some people even think that your concert will be the biggest show of the year.
Isn't that a bit of pressure from your visit?
Some of the greatest shows we've had in the last 21 years have taken place in the last two weeks.
We played some giant shows in Sao Paulo and we hope that they made us fit for this concert in Costa Rica.
Really, we want to play there.
We love this country, we like to surf and we love the jungle. Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you get to know Costa Rica and its waves for surfing?
Many of our friends are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo, where the waves are simply unimaginable.
My friends have always gone surfing to Costa Rica and Nicaragua. Together with Mexico, the excellent areas are for surfing. In this way, about people who love surfing, we have learned about it.
With a view of the tour, you offered huge shows with many songs.
What are your plans for the event in Costa Rica?
Since we have never played there, we also have no limits.
We will try to give the best possible show with many different songs. We want to play a few songs from each album and offer our fans a good and versatile repertoire.
You never repeat your repertoire.
Why?
I think that's partly because we have nine records and we can play over 120 songs. Everyone likes another song, so the decision we're going to play is not easy.
If we record two or three songs that we have no longer played, we can better maintain our concentration and they surprise us because they remind us of the reasons why we liked these songs. Otherwise, they could be forgotten.
This makes the show more interesting for us and I think, therefore also for the audience.
With this tour you celebrate your 20-year history.
Looking back, do you find it hard to believe in your success?
Yeah, totally.
First of all, I don't think anyone of us imagined playing in a great rock band for more than 20 years. That seems like a dream.
We also continue to focus on this blessing and find it great to be able to make music together even now.
We like and are excited to produce music.
We are lucky to be able to go to the places of the world that we have always wanted to visit.
Things couldn't stand better.
What did it mean for you to have actively participated in the grunge’s birth?
It has always been an honor to belong to this group of big bands.
We are good friends with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising and abundantly unusual when a movement emerges from a group of friends.
Time and again a band emerges from a city, but it is already unusual when five or ten groups come from the same city at the same time.
We are proud of it and feel honored to be part of the Seattle Group.
Sometimes we still play together.
Last year we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and in Canada with Mudhoney and we saw Soundgarden on their tour. We are happy to still be friends with them all and it honours us to be part of this upcoming Seattle sound.
It is also very unusual that a band like yours has stayed together with the same musicians for so long.
Yes, four of us have been playing together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) ran into us 13 years ago. That alone is much more time than many bands survive.
First of all, I believe that we all appreciate being happy to be alive and also take care of each other.
We are all close friends, which is why musical paths have opened up that give each individual the freedom to experiment.
One trusts the other and his music. We couldn't be better off.
Your relationship with glory has not always been easy. On the other hand, thanks to your success, you could always do what you wanted.
How do you find a balance?
The way we grew made it easier for us to find a balance.
We make sure not to be on tour too often, because it is too easy to lose this game with huge crowds who love your music.
As long as you remember that people have come to you because of the music, that reminds you that you have to pay attention to the music and what it has created, without being too eager to be a famous rock star. That never interested us anyway.
What memories do you have of your other project, Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote very good songs and at first it was great.
For three years we were a band that had never released a record until the death of Andy (Andrew Woods).
We were disappointed to have spent so long. We are still good with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who made friends with us. When I hear a song or see pictures, I think about what an incredible person Andy was and how he made me laugh. It was always a pleasure to go to work, laugh together and talk about music and football and many other topics.
He was an extraordinary person and we miss him.
The domestic band Las Robertas is responsible for opening the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know her work, especially Eddie Vedder, and the band has therefore chosen for the opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos from several groups and this band liked us best. That’s why we are curious to see what Las Robertas can offer live. That’s definitely exciting.
Why do you always change the text of Yellow Ledbetter when you play live?
This is a question for Eddie Vedder, I have no idea.
He sings him, and I think he sings the first thing he can think of.
Who influenced you as a bassist?
Of so many+
One of the first to remember me is Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many that I could talk about the bassists I like all afternoon.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep the grunge alive, even though it is no longer a fashion appearance?
I think we all don't feel very connected with the word grunge.
When I think about it, I think of the bands that I mentioned earlier, such as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the others that came up at the same time. Even though they are important today, I think it’s great, because it’s worth listening to this music and bands like Mudhoney are making better music now than ever.
At first her music was darker, now she is more positive.
Why?
This is interesting, because I think there are a few songs on the new album that might seem a little light. But there are also other songs like The End or Just Breathe, which are classified as very dark songs, although they also have something positive in them.
The tears came to me when I heard how Ed played them. They are very dark songs.
I think when you get older and something traumatic has happened in your life - for example, when you lose a family member or a friend - that affects your artistic creation and your music and these two songs clearly embody that for me.
But I also believe that you can be a happy person and still make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori returned to the hospital for medical examinations
The former president Alberto Fujimori was admitted to a public hospital on Tuesday to investigate the muscle loss of his legs, informed his general practitioner.
The 72-year-old Fujimori, who is 25 years in prison for violation of human rights during his reign (1990-2000), has several diseases, including tongue cancer, which is operated four times and under control.
Alejandro Aguinaga, Congress member and his personal doctor, told TV that Fujimori would be examined for three days at the Peruvian hospital Instituto Nacional de Envermedades Neoplásicas to determine the reason for his pain and muscle loss in the lower body members.
Aguinaga commented that he felt that Fujimori could be granted for humanitarian reasons. Nevertheless, he did not wish to do so because he considered him innocent.
He was operated four times on cancer of the tongue and he has lost 18 kilos of weight. In addition to other diseases such as severe erosion of gastritis, a cyst in the pancreas, kidney stones, high blood pressure and bleeding problems in the legs, the doctor counted.
Fujimori has been in the Dirección Nacional de Operaciones Especiales de la policía Detention Centre since September 2007.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the murder of 25 people by the death squadron of the Peruvian army, which was operating secretly during his reign.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political relations
An official delegation, led by the Uruguayan President José Mujica and consisting of several ministers and entrepreneurs, will start their visit to Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between the two countries and discuss regional political issues.
Mujica will meet with his Mexican counterpart Felipe Calderón next Wednesday. According to the Uruguayan President, this will be the culmination of his scheduled appointment with politicians, businessmen and a meeting with the group of Uruguayans living in Mexico.
The meeting of both presidents in the city of Guadalajara "is suitable for the exchange of information on all policy areas between the two countries", announced the presidential office of the South American country on its website.
According to local media, Mujica is looking for Calderón's support for the incident with France when French head of government Nicolas Sarkozy put the South American country on a list of tax havens at the G20 summit in the French city of Cannes.
In his discourse, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries which are still acting as tax havens, which was rejected by Uruguay and prompted a question to his ambassador in the European country.
Mexico has been chairing the G20, a group of the most powerful emerging and industrial countries in the world since November. Since January this year, there has been an agreement on the exchange of tax information to avoid duplication with the South American country.
In recent years, the Government of Uruguay has tried to speed up the concreteisation of agreements for the exchange of tax information in order to be removed from the "grey list" of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
At business level, a free trade agreement between Mexico and Uruguay has been in place since 2004, which has contributed to a growing exchange of goods between the two countries.
The cordless installer enters the third dimension with "Super Mario 3D Land"
For 25 years, Super Mario has been tirelessly fighting for the rescue of Princess Peach from the clutches of the evil Bowser, but never in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he fights for the love of the girl in stereo technology.
The game, which comes to the store counters of the world this month, has been tailored from the beginning to the characteristics of the portable console Nintendo 3DS, which can be played three-dimensionally without a special spectacle.
"Mario is the figure who has to say how stereoscopy works without glasses," said Omar Álvarez, the director of the press specialized in Nintendo in Spain at the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Álvarez explained that "Super Mario 3D Land" was "the first video game by Nintendo developed for this console from the beginning" , because so far, successful articles such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations already existing titles.
The speaker of Nintendo underlined that although it was three-dimensional, "Super Mario 3D Land" was an "affordable" video game that allowed a fast, liquid game.
Álvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contained two games in one: The first part is "easy" to capture the less scolded users.
After that, the experts can turn a "second round" over the different levels of the game, which are becoming more and more difficult.
In addition, users can choose in real time between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action. However, to overcome the obstacles, without becoming victims of the "optical effects", they must always play three-dimensional.
This trip Super Marios to the three-dimensional world also means the return of the figure to a portable console, which has not been the case since 2005.
With this video game, Nintendo winks at the fans of the saga and repeats the recipe for success of the last editions: The cordless installer has to overcome speckled platforms in order to free Princess Peach.
However, the player encounters news about the movements, the environment, the disguises and the enemies - and a "playable" Luigi.
Colom guarantees the delivery of Portillos to the United States
The president of Guatemala, Álvaro Colom, announced this Tuesday that he would grant the extradition of the former governor Alfonso Portillo so that he would be responsible in the United States for the conspiracy to raise $70 million.
Thus, the trial of the US application ends with the delivery of Portillo so that it can be brought to justice there.
In a press conference, Colom, confirmed his decision based on the independence of the judiciary and government, taking into account that a decision-making court had already ordered extradition.
He stressed that during his government he had not interfered in court decisions and had accepted all extradition requests from which he was informed.
In addition to Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín is delivered for murder and serious injury, Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
Coloms is a government act that takes place when all judicial and constitutional courts have been exhausted to condemn the former President of the State (2000-2004).
According to the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court of Guatemala, Portillo must be delivered if his legal situation in Guatemala is clarified and his human rights are guaranteed.
Portillo was acquitted of 120 million Quetzales in the Ministry of Defence during his reign. This negotiation preceded extradition, but the minister objected and revived the case again.
Trinijove has helped 6,000 young people threatened with social exclusion
The organisation was set up to prevent the marginalisation of young people without vocational training.
The first 25 years of the social assistance organization Trinijove have produced important results: in this quarter of the century, 6,000 young people threatened with social exclusion were supported to find a way out of their difficult situation.
In addition, more than a hundred jobs have been created for this social group.
On the occasion of the anniversary, an event in the former factory buildings of Fabra i Coats, attended by more than 300 people, was taken into account yesterday.
Trinijove was launched in 1986 in the Trinitat Vella district with the aim of helping young people with low levels of education, without work, with drug problems threatened by the risk of marginality.
Yesterday's celebration in Sant Andreu was attended by numerous responsible persons from institutions and institutions who worked with the association during these 25 years.
The participation of political representatives of different directions at election times demonstrated the impartiality of the work done by Trinijove.
Apart from the President of the Generalitat (Parliament of the Autonomous Region of Catalonia), Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, he attended the celebrations of former socialist education ministers Ernest Maragall and the former mayor and current left-wing city councillor Ricard Goma.
The large hall of Fabra i Coats also visited the current Catalan Minister for Social Affairs and Family Affairs, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the director-general of the social work of Sparkasse La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas stressed that Trinijove was created in very difficult times and that today’s times are no less complicated. But he added that the work done so far is “a good foundation”.
For the President of the Generalitat, Trinijove is a model that knows how to fight difficult circumstances and gives people hope in difficulty.
"The economic crisis is nothing new to the association and the work it does," he explained.
Occupying house where giant parties were organized was cleared
The homeowners had occupied 11 of the 13 apartments in the building on Balmes No. 51 (Barcelona).
The twelve housekeepers left the building yesterday afternoon without having done any resistance.
Everything points out that the nightmares of the neighbors of the house No. 51 on Balmes Street have ended.
Twelve people voluntarily left the building they had illegally occupied yesterday afternoon and organized huge festivals that had driven the neighborhood to despair. The evacuation took place on a judicial order without any police intervention.
After the evacuation, the door lock was replaced to avoid a similar situation.
"From now on, access will be controlled," confirmed the home administrator.
The housekeepers, who had occupied 11 of the 13 apartments of the building - the rest were inhabited - took along the entire electrical system and part of the water supply. Moreover, they had painted the walls and left all kinds of garbage, especially cans of alcoholic beverages.
On the three lower floors, huge parties were celebrated that lasted up to two days and drove the tenants to despair.
Next to the building is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which also suffered damage from it.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat, told Europa Press that her business had decreased by 80% since the start of the home occupation.
The owner of the discotheque pointed out that the housekeepers made their unfair competition, because they sold the drinks to three euros, while they cost 10 euros in the discotheque.
In addition, the owner of the leisure facility had been shown by the neighbors for rest disturbance, while according to their statement the noise was not caused by the visitors of the disco, but by the homeowners and in particular by the guests of the festivals that were organized there, and which, according to the angry neighbors, have become more and more and longer in recent weeks.
The head of the discotheque explained that the harassment had been so great that she agreed with the owner of the building that she would not have to pay rent for the last nine months.
The Guardia Urbana (urban police) also confirmed that she had received more complaints from neighbors in recent weeks.
The president of the PP (Partido Popular - People's Party) in Barcelona City Council, Alberto Fernández Díaz, last week asked to clear the building immediately and get the problems of civil cohabitation and the downfall of the district.
He explained that before the summer only one floor of the building had been occupied, but that in the last few months the housekeepers had moved on all the floors of the building and almost all the apartments. In some there had even been theft.
In this sense, he added that "it is necessary to put an end to impunity and to take action against the asocial actions in the building."
Yesterday, another building was cleared by the Catalan police in the Nou Barris district.
At 3:30 p.m., the police approached Montral No. 35 after receiving a call from a neighbor who had observed four people wanting to enter the building.
The four were immediately arrested.
Park or mountain?
The architects agree to the invitation to tender except for the disputes over the fees.
The urban tender for the 16 gates reopens the debate on the importance of Collerola in Barcelona.
In the mid-1980s, at the height of the disappearance of Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), this administration published its pamphlet on the promotion of Collserola.
The brochure described the mountain as a huge park in Barcelona City.
He was even compared in numbers to the Central Park of New York.
With the fall of the CMB in 1987, the park became in the eyes of many again the upper limit of Barcelona, because the capital of Catalonia is one of the few that spread not in the north-south direction, but up (mountains) and down (sea).
Collserola's classification as a natural park plays with this idea.
As an example, the Central Park was no longer used, but Yellowstone with wild boars in the role of the Yogi Bear.
So far, when the city in September issued a huge tender, consisting of 16 competitions, for further access gates to Collserola.
Undoubtedly, a gate refers to the concept of a park.
Either that's the case or someone's going to put gates on the land.
The question is self-evident: Collserola, Park or Berg?
The call is not only from an organizational point of view, but also with a view to reflecting on the city, the topic of conversation in the mouth of all the architects from Barcelona.
It is already almost a recurring issue on which two members of this old caste, which meets in the elevator, can draw.
And this very fact offers the fabric for one of the rare similarities between what three architects from Barcelona think about it and some university professors who have applied for the project.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: The invitation to tender is appropriate.
For Roldán "it is necessary" to speak about the "front of the mountain" after the attack on the coast, unless the discourse of Ildefons Cerda, which has been held about the green apples, has been held.
"One should assume the principle that Barcelona's largest park is the beach.
Among other things, it's well-accessible.
Collserola is more complex", the architect says, for which the title "Tore von Collserola" contains a "Lexical Trap": one must not imagine it as access to a park, but as a boundary of areas where action must be taken."
Modol, such as Roldán and Bayona with urban experience, sees the proposal as a "intellectual challenge" that involves "some dangers".
Risks arising from the "uncertainty that the design of a public space today entails" from the experiences of the 1980s, which had their "swan song" in the area of the forum.
The first fear is its own limitation to what can be built.
"Restricting something always means setting the next step," that is to say, exceeding it.
"You have to think about new urban planning instruments, because the current ones [referring to the General Metropolitano Plan (PGM) ] can lead to a real disaster."
Modol, who sticks closer to the question, believes that the side of Collserola, which goes towards Vallesana, "can be understood as a park which does not go towards Barcelona", for purely topographical reasons.
Modol recalls that there is already a study by the Patronat de Collserola that should not "pounce on deaf ears", although he is grateful to the city administration that it has given his board the opportunity to participate in this project "from the first moment on".
He also notes that the proximity of the mountain to the city of the accompanying letter allows the architects to participate in the debate, although he expresses his "doubt" as to whether this technical profile should guide the established multidisciplinary team ("exactly the right" he says) "We architects should only be a tool."
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question in the title of this article is complex, as there is no global view of Collerola in the tendering terms: "There have been 16 cross-sectional competitions," he says, "on the mountain-sea axis. But there is no longitudinal perspective that looks at the area in its entirety."
At least in his case, this led him to take part in the 16 competitions.
Otherwise, the program and the definition of a project for a gate would collide with that of the architect of the gate.
In his opinion, the city should absolutely guarantee that the strips directly above the Ronda de Dalt are equipped throughout its length, resulting in a smooth transition between the city and green areas.
Casino awards Jonás Larrazábal who comes free
After 72 days of silence, Casino Red's agent freed the brother of the mayor of Monterrey from the trial that is being conducted against him for alleged extortion.
After 72 days of imprisonment, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal is released after the agent of Casino Red has handed him over to the Second Criminal Court of the District, which is running the trial against the brother of the Mayor of Monterrey for blackmail.
After the attack on the Casino Royale, Sergio Gil García, the owner of Casino Red, published a series of photos and videos on which Manuel Jonás is on display, which supposedly forces him to pay a sum of money so that the city administration approves the secret operation of the bethouse.
After the charges, the prosecution opened a criminal trial against the Panist mayor's brother, who was arrested for 30 days on September 2.
After four hours with the official of the Ministerio Público 3 en Delitos Patrimoniales, he was taken to Casa de Arraigo 1 in the Barrio Antiguo of the capital.
He remained there 49 days after a second arrest warrant after the Ministerio Público had rejected the crimes for bribery and organized crime.
On October 19th, he was transferred to Cadreyta Detention Centre because he had probably bribed the owners of Casino Red with one and a half million pesos. On the other hand, he stayed only a few hours in the middle security area, as threats of murder were against him.
The authorities allowed him to take part in the trial as a prisoner of the San Nicolás de los Garza Municipal Prison.
On 25 October, he was sent to the Secretary of the Second Criminal Court of the District, Jorge Yánez, who found that after almost two months of investigation, there was sufficient evidence to blame Jonás for paying 1.5 million pesos to the representatives of the bethouse to open it in return.
On this Monday, the representative of Casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, asked Judge José Luis Pecina to give the mayor's brother the sentence, which is why he will be released in the next few hours.
During the court hearing, Ramiro Arias, the official of the Ministerio Público, García Gómez, asked whether he had repaired the damage and which the owner of the court had declared his forgiveness.
According to Case 197/2011, Jonás Larrazábal is freely dismissed. There are also no objections to the proceedings below and no damages are claimed.
Larrazabal Bretón was immediately set free after hearing the authorised representative of the betting house at 3:50 p.m.
The court secretary, Jorge Yánez, went to San Nicolás de los Garza's urban prison to inform Jonás that he had been acquitted and that his case would be filed.
He also informed him of the judicial order for immediate release.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome announced details of the aircraft accident in which the Secretary of Government Francisco Blake and seven other people were killed.
The Secretaría de Comunicaciones y Transportes - SCT (Secretariat for Communication and Transport in Mexico) informed that the results of the investigation of the accident in which the Secretary of Government Francisco Blake Mora and seven other people died indicate that the helicopter was impacted directly against the ground with its entire undamaged structure, without the pilot being able to initiate an emergency landing.
At a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communications and Transport, mentioned that the pilot had confirmed before the launch that the weather conditions were suitable for the flight.
"The fact that the propeller wing had contact with trees at 25 metres in height, with the helicopter losing its hull, seems to indicate that the helicopter had had several ground contact."
He also explained that the helicopter was built for 19 passengers, which is why he fulfilled all the conditions for the transport of the personnel.
In addition, he said that no helicopter parts were found in the investigations in the area where the machine had come down.
"In the search no aircraft parts were found in other places, the supplement concerned the entire structure.
The helicopter was built for 19 occupants, which is why it fulfilled all the requirements for passenger transport.
The area has a slope of 7 to 30 degrees.
At present, it is a priority to obtain the results of the investigation as soon as possible, but they could take several months, perhaps even a year.
On the other hand, Gilberto López Meyer, Director General of Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliares (the Secretariat for Aircraft and Relief Services in Mexico), assured that the helicopter of the Estado Mayor Presidencial flew at the top of the plane at a speed of flight and the plane fell on a soft slope.
"This information reinforces the assumption that it was a normal flight operation at the time of the impact."
At a press conference, the head of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, listed six relevant points to be taken into account in the investigation:
Field of view:
In accordance with flight standards, it was a flight in accordance with the rules of the visual flight. This means that the crew must have had sufficient visibility during the flight and on the ground.
Weather conditions:
The AICM recorded appropriate weather conditions during the take-off. During the continuation of the flight towards the border area between Mexico City and the Mexico State, some deep clouds rose.
Selected routes:
It is possible that because of the clouds the team had chosen a lower area with a better view towards the Cuernavaca valley.
Impact site:
The impact coordinates and the last radar recording of the helicopter are consistent. Before the impact, there may not have been any loss of control over the aircraft or a deviation from the flight route.
Dispersion of the remains of the aeroplane in a limited area:
The information available up to this point indicates that the helicopter was impacted from a straight and lateral direction.
The pattern of scattered aircraft remains suggests that the helicopter was impacted on the ground with its undamaged structure.
No evidence of fire or explosion:
The remains of the aircraft offer at the site of the accident neither fire nor explosion.
The latest findings indicate several soil contact.
In the on-site investigations, parts of aircraft were found at an altitude of 9200 feet above sea level. The terrain is abominable and has a slope of seven to thirty degrees.
The photos show the sequence in which the helicopter is likely to have broken.
Some information indicates that the helicopter may have had several ground contact.
After a minute search in an area that went beyond the locked area of the location of the accident, no scattered aircraft parts could be found, which reinforced the assumption that the undamaged aircraft structure was rattled to the ground.
MSS announces a research protocol to detect obesity genes
The social security institution of Mexico is conducting a research project to find the genes for obesity in children and adolescents, supported by specialists from the IPN.
The Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social - IMSS (Mexico's Social Insurance Institute) announced that it will lead a research project on the discovery of obesity genes in children and adolescents under the title "Genetics of obesity in childhood and youth" with which the genetic markers are to be found in association with obesity.
Miguel Cruz López, Head of the Unidad de Investigación Médica en Bioquímica (Department of Medical Research, Department of Biochemistry) at the Hospital de Especialidades del Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI, explained that an interdisciplinary team, consisting of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers, was established.
This team is supported by specialists and students of the postgraduate course at the Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública (INSP) and the Centro de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados (Cinvestav) del Instituto Politécnico Nacional (IPN).
The population is invited to participate in the study. Interested people can come to the sports grounds of the IMSS in the valley of Mexico, where tests with children and young people are carried out every Saturday from 8.00 am.
He stressed that the investigation began at the Cuahtémoc sports field (to the west of the state of México) and was continued since 8 October at the sports field of Nezahualcóyolt (to the east of the state of México).
Once the target of 500 to 600 investigators has been reached, the study will be continued at the sports field of Independencia (in the south of the capital district) and will be completed at the site of Morelos (in the north of the capital district).
He stated that the aim of the study was to identify the factors and role of genetics in the development of obesity and the identification of risk factors for Mexican children and adolescents for the prevention of chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of the worldwide day of diabetes, he stated that three thousand children and young people aged six to 14 years should be filled in with the consent and supervision of their parents with food-related questionnaires.
They will also be asked questions about their physical activity and their family history to control risk factors that could lead to diabetes or kidney failure.
He further explained that on Saturdays the investigators measured (weight, size, waist size), their blood pressure and blood levels such as glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin and genetic factors (test for the identification of genes related to obesity in childhood) were determined.
Cruz López stressed that this study would be carried out in response to health care professionals' concerns about the alarming weight gain of young people.
"Health surveys from 1999 and 2006 showed that in just under six years, the proportion of obese boys increased by 77 percent and that of obese girls increased by 47 percent. Overweight also increased dramatically," said the specialist of the IMSS.
He stated that the search for genetic markers was justified because the genetic history of the population of Mexico was different from that of other peoples.
He stated that one (e) Mexican (in) is on average 65 percent Indian-American, 30 percent European, and 5 percent African, reflecting the genes associated with diabetes and obesity.
In general, he explained that the genetics of obesity were incapacitating itself in the inability to burn the excess of energy (calories) taken to us, so that it would be stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that direct benefits for the investigators would be found in a comprehensive study of the children who would determine whether they had a degree of obesity or obesity.
It would even investigate the occurrence of dark skin folds in the neck and the inner arm (Akanthosis), which indicate the likelihood of metabolic disorders and pre-existing diabetes.
All information would be treated confidentially and communicated to the parents in writing by the doctors. The doctors explain all the measurement results to the parents and suggest to them changes in lifestyle that are appropriate for the prevention of diseases.
Cruz López explained that there were three fundamental factors responsible for overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: lack of movement, i.e. lack of exercise in everyday life, spending most of the day in front of the TV and using means of transport, instead of walking short distances.
The high calorie intake, i.e., increased consumption of sugared drinks and carbohydrates (Tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) along with a high fat and protein intake as well as the genetics to be analyzed in this research project.
Asphalt of the UNAM prevents pitfalls
Rafael Herrera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry at UNAM University of Mexico, develops modified asphalts with polymers to make the mixture more resistant to weather conditions and temperature fluctuations
It would not be necessary to repair nearly 200 000 pitfalls if the rainy season broke out in the Zona Metropolitana del Valle de México (the valley of Mexico), said Rafael Herrera Nájera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) at UNAM University, warning and ensuring that if the layout and maintenance of the asphalt coating were appropriately damaged, the number of pitfalls would be significantly reduced or even completely avoided.
In his lecture "Slagholes from a technical point of view", which he gave on the occasion of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory for which he is responsible developed modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture similar to asphalt, but which has greater mechanical resistance at both high and low temperatures.
Mrera Nájera argued that this type of modified asphalt should be used in areas with extremely hot climates, such as in some cities in the north of the country, to improve the behaviour of the road surface and thus avoid the occurrence of pitfalls.
He explained that the asphalt - the heaviest part of the oil - is a hydrocarbon compound, some of which has a high molecular weight - the so-called asphalt - and the other part a low one - the so-called Malthene. Together they give to the road surface its characteristic toelastic behaviour.
The countastic behaviour of the asphalt means that it behaves like a liquid at high temperatures of almost 180°C, at 120°C it is very viscous and at 50°C it is almost firm, while at very low temperatures it becomes fragile.
"This means that the resistance of asphalt on the roads is not uniform, but changes in one day depending on the weather conditions and temperature fluctuations," said the chemical engineer.
The researcher at the FQ noted that the streets of Mexico City had a majority of them a flexible road surface consisting of six layers of material, the last three of which included asphalt.
Between the upper strata lies a layer of asphalt that consists of small, asphalted and then fortified stones.
Every single stone of this wear layer has been bathed in asphalt.
When the vehicles move on it and forces are generated, this layer allows a good distribution of forces in the road surface.
"If it were modified asphalt, the forces would be even better distributed," said the chemical engineer.
"Over the wear layer," he explained, "a last layer is laid out, the so-called bearing layer consisting of tiny stones, i.e. sand, which was also bathed in asphalt.
Since this layer is in contact with the vehicle tyres, they need a greater mechanical force than the wear layer and they need to produce friction.
In addition, most of the power received and distributed by this road surface requires a suitable thickness and the material from which it is made must be maintained.
The weather conditions, especially humidity and temperature fluctuations, are other important factors to consider, above all the water," he said, "because it significantly affects the behaviour of the wear layer.
When the terrain becomes wet, water penetrates the layer and escapes only difficult again. This causes the dislocation of all layers of the road surface and consequently the appearance of strokes.
When a punch hole arises," he said, "the top layer is first removed, while the wear layer is only affected after that. But the damage does not occur immediately, but it is a process that would have to be maintained at the first signs by appropriate maintenance programs."
The member of the Sistema Nacional de Investigadores (Mexico's National Research System) stated that the vehicle load is another important cause for the occurrence of pitfalls. Therefore, the thickness of each layer of the road surface must always be proportional to the vehicle load and it must be ensured that this regulation is complied with in order to avoid frequent pitfalls.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that there were still a lot of research work to be done, for example on asphalt emulsions that were already on the market in other countries, with which the pitfalls could be easily repaired without the use of high temperatures.
What was missing from the candidate del Valle to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that affected Melina Ramírez Serna's failure to get the crown of Miss Colombia.
El Valle gets his 14.
Once again, Valle del Cauca went out empty at the award of the crown for Miss Colombia.
This time, Melina Ramírez Serna had to be satisfied with standing on the winner's podium, showing a silver crown and the band she has shown as a new Miss Colombia.
With the result obtained this night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico took the crown and the cedar, the departamento comes on 14 mistitles and Melina joins the legion of women from Valle del Cauca who had held the crown almost in their hands. Among the proclaimed misses are: Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Élánica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
The big question that many are asking today is: What was missing?
For the result is the decline of a great favourite who had shown at every show that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia. Not for nothing had she been elected the Queen of the Police and the Mejor Rostro Jolie of Vogue, title that had also received the beauty queens Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro, and who took the crown of Miss Colombia home.
The first factor that is decisive for the jury's decision to appoint her first miss is that she did not believe the answer to the question "Which book has most affected you and why?" that Martín Murillo Gómez had asked her by the Carreta Literaria Leamos.
The young woman from Valle del Cauca answered the questioner:
"I read a lot, I believe in literature, I think it's a way to civilize, in the end I think that the book, which was most strongly influenced for my childhood, 'The Little Prince' is a rather profound book.
At the moment I read 'guilt and atonement'. It is a book of universal culture that we should all read. I just read a book by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a beautiful book called 'Leidenschaften'.
An answer that ran into little reluctance, firstly because of the concept of 'civilizing' and secondly because she had not explained in concrete terms the way in which each of her books had influenced her.
But after the ceremony, Melina declared to feel calm and happy with the result: "The universe is wise, it happens what must happen.
And for all people, please read a little 'The Little Prince'. It's a great book.
Among other things, it is said that El Valle's favorite has been burned out.
A journalist from Bogota suggested that the fact that she was the preferred person who had received all the applause and who had received all the prizes in advance (Gastronomy Competition Easter, audience vote on the best hand-made costume and Reina Madre) "had made the other candidates jealous, which stressed the queen who could not shine on stage."
And this was noticed at her first performance in the bathing suit on the beach of the Hilton Hotel and at her two elevators at the coronation celebration.
Although she appeared safely to both, she lacked the strength and momentum of the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the program "Como en casa" at the RCN channel, said that the fact that Melina was crowned Miss "shows that the candidate who wins the most prizes during the competition will eventually not become Queen".
In addition, Valle got out of the way at the end of the press - a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle could not convince the jury of her interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Competition.
It will already have his reason that two days before the composition of the international jury Lucy Dougy declared they were looking for a woman who was engaged in the social affairs of her country.
"Beauty alone is not enough for a Miss Colombia. You have to look beyond the physical and focus on social feelings, that she had already participated in projects before participating in the competition," she said.
It is also speculated that Valle had sinned with her defects of the derriere and the fibrosis that was noted to her in the stomach area. But that is contradictory, because the jury chose her as a candidate for 'natural beauty' with a healthy body, good nutritional habits and responsible physical work.
The Queen's coach, Jorge Hernán Orozco, admits that Melina didn't have the best body that there would be better, "but her problem with the fibrosis on her belly, which was frankly hardly noticeable to me, pushed her score on the last day."
Meanwhile, the journalist Guido Hoyos of Cromos magazine believes that the faults of the woman from Valle del Cauca were the surgical procedures she had undergone.
"The operations are okay, but Valle didn't know how to make them right.
Her body has never been her strong side, and this place has had to pay her."
Because of this award, which is awarded the first time by the National Beauty Competition, a cruel prediction arose after the appearance in the bathing suit, which was to come true at night. It was whispered that Raymundo Melina had given a consolation prize in order not to let her come to the pleasure of the crown.
Whether that is true or not, the fact is that from today on, Melina will take her ruling year, not as a queen, but as a princess, a position that offers her the opportunity to represent Colombia at one of the international competitions on the appointment of the National Beauty Competition.
However, she will enter history as one of the queens who, despite her overwhelming appearance for Cartagena, escaped the crown.
So the work of the doctor who identified the body of Alfonso Cano
A Lophoscopist from Cali went into history as the man who identified "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials plays a key role.
Last November 4th, a Lophoscopist of the Procuratorial Unit (CTI) from Cali as the man who confirmed the identity of the leader of the FARC (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia) entered: "Alfonso Cano" by comparing the fingerprints.
Of the seven Lophoscopeists in the CTI department, this week Eliazar González had been on standby duty, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been involved in criminal investigation for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career González worked in communities of Chocó, where he often had to go to the jungle for five days to reach the place where the bodies he was supposed to identify were located.
In 2000 he moved to Valle over and after completing the required courses he specialized in lophoscopy, which is the examination of the skin that is exposed to friction, i.e. the palms and feet.
In the week of use against the so-called Alfonso Cano, Eliazar was advised to pack clothes for at least three days.
Something big awaited him.
On Friday night, he flew from Palmira to Cauca in the helicopter.
He knew that he should identify two bodies and that there was a suspicion that one of the men who had led the oldest guerrilla in the world could be. Therefore, he should take the ten-finger print of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
However, when he reached the place where the body was located with the investigator, he could not identify it because of its physical appearance, because it was not like the images he had seen in the mass media in the least.
He had no beard, was dressed like a farmer in the area, wore no glasses and was much thinner.
But fingerprints don't lie.
Armed with a magnifying glass, ink, a plant cellar and a flashlight, Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the body with those on the print page.
He had seen it correctly: it was "Alfonso Cano".
That same night, this man from Puerto Tejada was responsible for telling the Minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinzón, that it was actually the head of the FARC.
On Track Search
For a daktyloskopen from Sijín in Cali, the appreciation given to President Juan Manuel Santos Eliazar González at a press conference on the fight against "cano" was very important.
Many people don't know our work.
Dactyloscopy is an exact science with no error rate, which can be a key factor in resolving a crime.
Lophoscopeists not only identify bodies, they also support investigations into murder and robbery and confirm the identity of the arrested persons.
When they are arrested, many criminals present false identity documents or they have none.
We'll take the fingerprints off them and look for them in the database.
The researcher told us that he had to tear a piece of wall out of a house during a theft, because the thief had built himself up with his hand at this very point when he pulled out a safe stuffed with jewelry and money.
"Walls are difficult because their surfaces are unsuitable for fingerprinting, but in this case we could take the print of the whole hand and identify the offender who had participated in several thefts," he recalled.
The fingerprints can also relieve or relieve suspects.
Recently, a dead man was found surrounded by bottles of liquor.
In the investigation, it was suspected that a family member might be suspected of being a suspect, and in fact, a fingerprint on the bottle agreed.
Although this does not guarantee that it is the murderer, it is connected to the place where the crime was committed.
A CTI dactyloscope explained that "the fingerprints with chemical or physical reagents would be taken from the object."
When they appear, a plant cellar or a tape is used for taking along.
After that, the prints will be sent to the asif, which is the criminal database, or to the standing office.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians without ID documents," said the CTI expert.
He said that not everything was as it would be in the TV series SCI.
As not all gold shines, not everything you touch is a fingerprint.
But it can still be used if you make a corresponding comparison.
The "emports" challenge the authorities in New York
Hundreds of demonstrators gathered in tents on the Zuccotti Square.
Most of them followed the evacuation order and changed their location to a nearby park.
On Tuesday, the members of the Ocupy Wall Street movement challenged the New York authorities when they tried again with a judicial order to enter the Manhattan Square after they had been evacuated from the square in the morning grey and had tried to occupy a different place on Big Apple.
Hundreds of demonstrators gathered in front of the Zuccotti Square, on which they wanted to gain access with a judicial arrangement that allowed the "employees" to re-camp at this place. Meanwhile, another part of the movement held to the evacuation order and occupied a park further north of the city, where there were nine arrests.
"Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp in the square, we will meet in another place and continue the battle with legal means to return to Zuccotti, with sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations," said Mark Bray, one of the spokespersons of the movement "Ocupy Wall Street".
Bray explained that the response of the "employees" to the evacuation of their tent camp, which had been ordered directly by Michael Bloomberg, mayor of New York, came to court, where the judge Lucy Billings issued an order forbidding the violent evacuation of the square and approving the tent to the demonstrators.
In addition, the "Emorts" occupied a new park located at the intersection of central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue near the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and is property of the Trinity Church.
They could occupy the place for at least an hour, but then the police arrived and arrested some of the demonstrators, although Bray cannot give precise figures. He assured the news agency Efe that he had also seen several journalists with handcuffs.
The organization assures that there have been hundreds of people in this place, where a delegation of religious leaders had also arrived as a sign of their support to the members of the movement and for mediation with the police.
In the meantime, the Zuccotti site (a private property site) remains closed in anticipation of a judicial hearing that is still open for this Tuesday and to analyse the legality of the evacuation in the morning grey.
Some of the demonstrators who were driven by the square carried photocopies of this court order with them and distributed them. They even gave them some police officers who guarded the place, which resulted in "some small clashes", as Bray reported, who had indicated that some policemen had beaten demonstrators.
The court order forbids the authorities to remove members of Occupy Wall Street from the square as well as the application of "laws adopted after the occupation and prohibit the demonstrators from returning to the park with their tents and other things they had used before."
Mayor Bloomberg made it clear to the press that due to this court order the new opening of the square for public transport and the demonstrators had been lifted. The demonstrators pointed out that the city laws did not allow them to re-establish themselves with tents and sleeping bags at this place.
The mayor personally defended the evacuation of the Zuccotti Square in the morning grey, where almost 200 people were arrested, which was decided because the demonstrators "refused the law."
Bloomberg explained that he had given the order to oust the place because it had "turned into a place where people did not come to demonstrate, but to break the laws and in some cases to harm other people" because "some businesses had received threats" and the residents feared "their quality of life".
"The evacuation in the dawn was disgusting and shows that Bloomberg is essentially interested in the protection of financial interests and not in the protection of the interests of North American workers," added the spokesperson of the movement who accused the mayor of "not respecting the freedom of the press".
The leaders of "Occupy Wall Street" informed that they were thinking of organising "great actions" for Thursday, together with community organizations and trade unions, to commemorate the two months that the protests have already lasted since September 17.
Pamela Anderson is in the TV Christmas Show the Virgin Mary
Together with Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities, she will perform on December 1st in the TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas"
The Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement", rescue swimmer in "Baywatch", rabbit at "Playboy", wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary on a Christmas broadcast of Canadian television.
The private TV channel CTV announced today that Anderson will perform in the TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" together with the "Crooner" (Ballad singer) Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities on December 1st and will bring a very special Virgin Mary's life to life.
CTV today distributed pictures of the television program in which Anderson - who also appears for the distribution on the Internet of a self-made porn, in which she appears together with her former husband, the drummer of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee - as Virgin Mary with a doll in her lap to represent Jesus.
In the scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian origin who recently worked as a moderator on the show "My Violet Torpedo of Truth" by Charlie Sheen, appears as a Jesus child.
The CTV Christmas program not only focuses on Anderson and Peters, but also on the Canadian singer Bublé, who married the Argentinean model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires at the end of March, and who is not far away from this controversy.
Recently, at one of his concerts in New York, Bublé called the North American Kim Kardashian "Hure".
Japan is born again after the earthquake
GDP grows by 1.5% due to domestic consumption and ends the spiral of the free fall from the beginning of March
Since last March, the Japanese economy has been paralysed, which is still in recovery after the devastating earthquake, which led to an atomic crisis, and the worst disaster that Japan experienced during World War II.
The first estimates of the government in Tokyo estimated the damage to property at $300,000, a blow that seems to weaken despite the difficult world economic situation.
After three quarters, data on gross domestic product from July to September were finally used to conclude this chapter: GDP grew by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% compared to the annual rate.
The value measured in the second quarter - in Japan begins the financial year in March 2012 - also means the fastest growth since the period from January to March 2010.
The recovery can be partly explained by the sale of machinery for the reconstruction of the areas devastated by the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1% compared to the decrease by 0.9% for investments recorded from January to March, the first decrease after six months of unstoppable increases.
Nevertheless, the real upturn in the Japanese economy is not based solely on keynsian attacks that use the crisis to build or reconstruct infrastructures.
Japan is awakened, in particular, by the development of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japanese GDP.
This variable rose by 1%, driven by growing expenditure on vehicles, travel and leisure.
The Stigma of the Yen
Tokyo has entrusted itself to the domestic market after the yen - the Japanese currency - flees into one of the "currencies of refuge" of investors who, before the debt crisis of the Eurozone and the turbulent forecasts for the U.S.A., are a privilege charged like a tombstone on the accounts of the exporting companies.
With a tougher currency, products abroad are more expensive, a serious problem for a country whose economy is based on the health of major technology producers.
Toyota and Sony, for example, returned their weak business results from July to September to the Yen's listing.
While the markets continue to besiege peripheral EU countries, the Yoshihiko Noda government remains vigilant.
"You have to pay attention to the ongoing risks, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of flooding in Thailand and the rapid appreciation of the yen," said Motohisa Furukawa, State Secretary for Economic Policy.
The perspectives are really not very exciting.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) stated that most Member States had more marked signs of slowing down economic development in September.
The indicator, which presupposes the turning points of the world economy, revealed that the biggest economic potentials had slowed down.
Because he dropped by four tenths to 100,4 points compared to the 100,8 in August.
The eurozone is even below this average, which is 100 after it has dropped by eight tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens again raises doubts
Papadimos says the austerity measures would be adopted, but the conservatives will not sign a written agreement
With the high-level risk premiums of the peripheral countries and widespread uncertainty, Greece is also further mistaken in the labyrinth that results from the major European debt crisis.
The impression that the "consensus" of the new Greek transitional government is rather a reaction to the pressure from Brussels than a real conviction of the political forces is slowly evidenced by facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, pointed out yesterday that there were no alternatives to the structural reforms and that the hundred days agreed upon in his appointment might be too short for their implementation, the leader of the conservative party Nueva Democracia, Antonis Samaras, assured him that he would support the new austerity measures and would not in any case withdraw his demand for new elections to the scheduled date, 19 February.
"The most important task of this government is the implementation of the decisions taken at the summit on 26 October," Papadimos assured yesterday to open a parliamentary debate, which will culminate tomorrow with the vote of confidence for the new government.
A package of 24 programmes to promote employment, reform of the disciplinary law for officials and new measures to combat tax evasion are the first initiatives.
Nevertheless, Samara's communication does not clear out the doubt about his attitude: "We have committed ourselves to the support of the transitional government, but to nothing else."
The Conservative leader went one step too far with his challenge of the EU and the IMF, the organism that needs to unlock the 8,000 million that Athens urgently needs, and made it clear that he would not accept a declaration of commitment on the fulfilment of the austerity measures.
But the European Commission, which is still irritated by the impact of the poker game with Papandreu referendum, reaffirmed yesterday that its demand should not be thwarted: economic aid would not be signed if the new government and the leaders of the main Greek parties signed "a clear written agreement not as soon as possible".
The spokesperson of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, said that the inspectors of the Troika were coming back to Athens "very soon" to discuss with the new government what was "necessary" for the payment of the sixth section of 8000 million euros, although there is no final date.
The Greek knuckle still has threads for a while.
Queen Sofía: "These are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen stressed Spain's "dominant" position regarding this type of financing
Spain "has achieved a dominant position in the role of microfinance worldwide".
Yesterday, the Spanish queen Sofía reminded us that in the last two decades, Spain has become the second donor worldwide for this means of international cooperation. Its "being" is based on the fact that it is an "instrument for social progress, justice and the hope of a better future for all humanity based on trust in man".
Yesterday the Queen inaugurated the fifth world summit on micro-credit in Valladolid. She was convinced that there was "no doubt" that this kind of business would be "absolutely indispensable" in order to achieve the Millennium Goals set by the United Nations by 2015 and "especially the goal of the number of people who have to live with income of less than a dollar a day, thus below the "poverty limit".
Spain "is continuing to work" on extending the beneficiary network "to the last corner of the world and it is carrying out this task responsibly", noted Queen Sofia, who hopes that the initiatives and contributions that will start from the summit, which will last until Thursday, will be guaranteed "the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest and especially for women" as the main beneficiaries of these loans.
"We have had many successes" and "are faced with many challenges."
The Smallgest Credit Summit is not only a forum for debate, but also a platform for the launch of "two fundamental objectives".
The Queen stated that it would be hoped that by the end of 2015 175 million poor families would have access to these financial services and that ten million of these households would cross the poverty line.
The concept of micro-credit is based in Spain and the rest of the world on the path initiated by Muhammad Yunus years ago, which Queen Sofia considers to be an "act of justice and recognition".
The father of this financial instrument described her as an "admirable idealist who had dedicated herself to the fight against poverty" and whose work she has known for 15 years when the queen traveled to Bangladesh to learn about the lending strategy on the ground.
This experience followed a year later the first world summit in Washington and further meetings at the Ivory Coast in 1999 and Canada in 2006. "We have all been able to observe a continuous development," said the Queen, whose commitment to this project brought her assessment yesterday as a "family head" in Valladolid and as a "speaker of the poor".
Finally, Queen Sofia finished her lecture by animating the participants to participate in the debate and to find solutions in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical Commandment"
Spanish Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez pointed out that solidarity is "an ethical commandment" for the entire democratic state.
In this sense, she stressed that it was a mistake to bind development aid to economic booms at times, as it was a "permanent commitment".
Jiménez felt that micro-credit was a "harvest and rigorous policy to eradicate poverty", and that the governments of the industrialised states should now work "more than ever" on solidarity criteria, and should not allow the solidarity of the crisis to fall victim to it.
For Spain, micro-credit is one of the most important forms of development aid.
The State Secretary for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, declared "the success", "marginalized" people, "who are always at the door of closed doors" "Hope" and the Mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed those present in a city that opened "their gates, lit by the spirit of solidarity".
The CDU proposes to elect the EU President by universal suffrage
The first day of the Congress of Christian Democrats (CDU on Monday, 14 November in Leipzig, was for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and Chairman of the Christian Democratic Party, without any real difficulties.
The future of Europe was not originally envisaged in the programme, but it was implemented in the autumn, in particular in order to satisfy those activists who consider government policy on the Greeks today, and perhaps Italy's tomorrow, to be too lax.
The European Commission's proposal for a Presidency, proposed by the Bureau, was adopted almost unanimously.
Of the 1001 delegates, only nine had voted against, ten had abstained.
The standing ovation lasting for several minutes, which initially applied to Angela Merkel as well as for several hours later Wolfgang Schäuble, was not open to any doubt on the part of the three European finance ministers.
The Chancellor's main idea - as well as the requests - is the following slogan: the answer to the crisis is "not less, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe means peace, but also because nine million jobs are directly dependent on the euro.
For the chancellor, "the time has come for a breakthrough in Europe".
This could be reflected in a revision of the Lisbon Treaty, which would strengthen the control of the European Union as regards the budgetary policy of the countries in the euro area, but it could also mean "to give Europe a face in the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of a general vote".
However, this is certainly one of the proposals adopted by Congress, which clearly stood by Wolfgang Schäuble.
Certainly, it is little likely that the 47 agree quickly on this revolution: Great Britain is opposed to the case, and the leaders of the CDU believe to know that Nicolas Sarkozy is of the same opinion.
However, the milestone is laid.
Similarly, in an overwhelming majority, delegates have rejected the proposal for each country's weighting in the Governing Council according to the weighting of the individual economies, which obviously resulted in a first strengthening of Germany's position.
The Chancellor, based on calming the climate within her party, has therefore strengthened the references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. However, she has no longer tried to win her congress at the expense of the "small" or the European countries in difficulty, which would immediately criticize arrogant Germany.
As far as the European request for the importance of the "German-French friendship" is concerned, Angela Merkel does not call France to the plan.
At least not directly.
This reminds us that Leipzig was the focus of a bloody battle two centuries ago.
In fact, one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What does the fraud represent in the case of medical reports?
After the family support, UMP and the government are now attacking the medical reports.
Nicolas Sarkozy will arrive in Bordeaux on Tuesday 15 November to visit a family allowance fund and to present a speech on the theme of the fight against social fraud and economic dependence on the state, which has been recurring since 2007.
In order to accompany this attack, which is based on the desire to test the economy, but on the other hand does not constitute less foregleams of an axis of the right presidency campaign, the majority want to focus on employee health reports.
First of all, with budgetary objectives: the government is referring to the introduction of a fourth day of leave before the inclusion of a health report for workers in the private sector.
In good German, this means that a sick worker would lose the salary of four days without the consent of the specific company, i.e. at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure that, according to the daily newspaper "Les Echos", threatens to arouse anger, but would help to bring in EUR 280 million.
And the more symbolic character was associated with another measure: granting the state officials an unrequited withdrawal day in the case of illness (there is so far no withdrawal period for them, in contrast to the three leave days in the private sector).
While these issues are under discussion, the majority are also re-encouraging the issue of fraud, this time aiming at the abuse of work.
"Controls will be much more important, and in addition, they will be repayable if required," warned Xavier Betrand on Sunday, November 13th, in front of the station's microphone RTL.
As in other cases, the impact of this notification on the reality of fraudulent acts in the field of disease reports seems a little disproportionate.
Indeed, it has been the subject of permanent observation since 2002 and political offensives that have borne the most fruit.
The French are no longer sicker than people elsewhere in Europe.
However, let us first stay with the national figures.
According to CNAM, more than 237 million euros of daily payments were paid out in 2006.
According to the Institute for Economic Research and Documentation on Health, the daily payments in 2008 represented EUR 11.3 billion, 5% of health expenditure.
This figure included 46% for maternity leave and occupational accidents and 54% for sick leave, which is €6.2 billion.
And thus 2.5% health expenditure.
In 2010, according to a study by the Alma Consulting Group, the French were granted an average of only 14.5 sick days compared to the 17.8 days in 2009.
An average value that conceals certain differences: another published in 2007 by Monster.com, the website for career planning, showed that 75% of the 40 000 surveyed French workers did not take a single day of illness.
Another study covered by health insurance this time makes it clear that 37% of the disease reports in 2010 were of shorter duration than 8 days; 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and one month, 15% between one and three months and 11% above.
Compared with their European neighbours, French workers are no longer prone to incapacity for work than elsewhere.
A long-term study conducted in 2010 by two researchers from the French National Science Research Centre (CNRS) showed that between 1994 and 2001 the global absenteeism rate (founded by disease or otherwise) was oscillating between 10% and 11% in France compared to 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
The fraud in the case of sick reports represents a disappearing small proportion in terms of undeclared work.
With regard to fraud, only a weak measure is achieved here.
Strengthening legislation since 2002 means that there are systmatic controls in case of disease reports that exceed 45 days.
In 2008, the CNAM (public university for the training of technicians and engineers) found under 1.5 million checks that 13% of 285,000 of the short-term medical reports realized were "unjustified or too long" in 37,050 cases.
In systematically controlled cases of disease reporting of more than 45 days duration, less than 1.2 million 11% were counted as "unadapted or unjustified" cases, which is 132,000.
In total, this makes 169.000 "unjustified" cases against several million workers who have filed a health report.
A number which represents only a weak measure against, for example, those of undeclared work.
According to UMP MEP Dominique Tian, author of a report on this issue published in July, this represents between EUR 9 and EUR 15 billion of tax losses per year, i.e. more than the total cost of daily allowances, and thus much more than the defraudation of the latter.
Papademos: Greece should introduce a new adjustment plan
Greece needed a new adjustment programme to catch its economy.
On Monday, 14 November, Prime Minister Lucas Papademos announced to Parliament, together with the fact that the one hundred days granted to his government by the Union were not enough to accomplish this task.
"In order to continue the efforts to strengthen the economy, we need support from our European partners and a new budget adjustment programme," said the Head of Government in his first public speech at the opening of the parliamentary vote of confidence on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the Euro Summit on 27 October was the "main task" of the new government, as the participation of the country in the eurozone would be "at stake" as it added.
Accordingly, M. Papademos has planned to reduce the country's government deficit by "9%" of gross domestic product from today to the end of the year, after it stood at 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The rights refuse the new savings measures
Antonis Samaras, head of the right wing, had agreed on Monday to the measures already approved with regard to an attempt to escape from the debt crisis, but had been sent in advance that his party would not be prepared for an additional austerity measure.
"We will not vote in favour of new measures," he said on the occasion of a meeting of his party's new democracy.
He had declared himself prepared to reduce budget deficits and debt, as well as to fight against waste, but was hostile to any policy that would stop the economic upturn.
Olli Rehn, Commissioner responsible for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who had prevented the IMF and the EU from releasing the necessary loan over EUR 8 billion without written guarantee from all parties on their support for the planned measures, Antonio Samaras had replied that his word would suffice and he would not sign anything under pressure from outsiders.
Euthanasia and accompanied death must be legalised, according to an expert body
The Canadians live in denial of death, as evidenced by a report by the Royal Society of Canada
The board stated that governments, health care institutions and doctors worked together on pain-relieving treatment to provide the best pain-relieving medicines, and this also goes beyond cancer cases.
Canadian society lives in a refusal attitude towards death.
Only 9% of Canadians actually agree to talk to their doctor about conditions under which they want to die and make arrangements for this purpose.
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, in which six experts were involved, interrelated in various fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
This body recommends that the government amend the penal law so as to allow accompanying suicide and euthanasia where this choice is made, in the case of patients who are considered able to make such a decision.
The experts cite a recently published survey of the independent society EIU, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the globe.
Although Canada has placed itself in the 10th place, the study notes that "medical mortality care in Canada has produced a culture in which people are afraid to cut the subject of death".
Medical care or not: 77% of Canadians do not have access to painkillers, so the experts appointed by the Royal Society of Canada tell us.
And despite the Canadian majority's desire to die at home, 68.6% of these die in the hospital.
From a country-wide perspective, the rate of 86% of hospitalised deaths in Quebec is highest.
On the delicate issue of euthanasia and accompanying suicide, the authors of the report come to conclusions that are opposed to the position of the federal government, which has already taken on board, not to make any changes to the penal law regarding euthanasia and accompanying suicide.
Now, however, according to the experts who have equally inspected all those countries whose approach has legalised or decriminalised euthanasia and accompanied suicide, there is no evidence that such decriminalisation would result in abuses in their application, i.e. the practice of euthanasia or accompanied suicide by incompetent or non-consenting persons.
On the contrary, much more cases of such violations are encountered, especially in those countries where euthanasia and accompanying suicide are not legalized, as yesterday Jocelyn Downie, co-signator of the report, confirmed in a teleconferencing.
"Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
"Even accompanied suicide is practiced in Canada, although it is clearly illegal here," explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians support the Euthanasia
According to an Angus-Eid survey conducted in 2010, 85% of Canadians had already committed themselves to euthanasia, since they believe that they allow people at the end of their life to alleviate their suffering.
And 66% believe that the fact that euthanasia is legalized does not mean that the life of older or disabled people has less value.
As regards the persons who have already practised an accompanying suicide, 41% of the respondents believe that they should not be prosecuted.
As regards the maintenance or discontinuation of the medicinal products in patients, the situation is less clear, according to the authors of the report.
Similarly, they suggest in their list of recommendations that the criminal law should state that the removal of the funds for which a legally valid refusal was made should not be considered a criminal offence.
In addition, the Expert Board calls for healthcare professionals to be trained to respect the end of life and to fear this without criminal prosecution.
The board stated that governments, health care institutions and doctors worked together on pain-relieving treatment to provide the best pain-relieving drugs, and this also goes beyond cancer cases.
Last but not least, the Committee calls on the far-reaching remedies for pain relief or life-absorbing measures already used in the Canadian health care institutions to be considered at least as little as they served to reduce physical pain and to resort to the same procedures as euthanasia.
Reservations of other experts
Some health experts have already raised reservations about the conclusions of the expert report of the Royal Society of Canada.
RA Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, has referred to the attitude of the reporting experts as "extreme" as they set no limits to the euthanasia practice in the end-stage.
"This opens the doors to a situation in which everyone who is tired of life and older than 18 years of age asks another person to help him in his suicide," says RA Deschamps, who had looked through a summary of the report yesterday.
RA Deschamps also stresses that the authors of the report seemed to place the individual's own responsibility over all other values involved in the social fabric of society.
But now, he says, there would be "guidelines and obligations in a society".
Margaret Somerville, a specialist in health law, has also expressed "strong resistance" to the conclusions of the report, which she called "pro-euthanasia manifesto".
Margaret Somerville, who himself is a member of the Royal Society of Canada, is particularly doubtful about the reports on the absence of abuses in certain countries where euthanasia and accompanied suicide are legalized, such as the Netherlands and Oregon.
The king of Jordan calls on President Assad to resign
Damascus Pretends a "Complot"
Syria is increasingly isolated
The partisans of Bashar al-Assad demonstrated yesterday before the authorities of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The diplomatic pressure on Syria, Bashar al-Assads, who, thanks to Russia's support and a "combatt" directed against the country, has increased yesterday.
Two days before Syria was eliminated by the Arab League, the European Union intensified its sanctions against Damascus, although Turkey and Jordan, the neighbouring countries of Syria, had taken a position in favour of the resignation of President Assad.
King Abdullah II of Jordan was yesterday the Arab Prime Minister who had asked President Bashar al-Assad to "spend his office in Syria" in which the forty civilians and members of the government were already killed.
"Having Bashar's interest in his country at heart, he would resign, but he should also create the necessary conditions for a new era of political Syrian life," said the King of Jordan, neighboring Syria, in an interview with the BBC.
The Turkish diplomat leader Ahmet Davutoglu, for his part, had complained that the Turkish mediation attempts directed at the Syrian regime since the beginning of the year had not been successful.
"Those in the Middle East who are not at peace with their people and cannot be satisfied must go," he explained, alluding to Syria, the neighboring country, to which Turkey is constantly becoming increasingly rough.
The United States, for its part, welcomed the "enhancement of the consensus against Assad and the machinations of the Syrian regime" as a result of the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League and countries such as Turkey have, in the face of repression in Syria, hit an ever sharper tone," observed Mark Toner, a spokesman for the State Department.
During this time, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the government in the region of Dar'a in southern Syria died, so declared the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (OSDH).
According to this NGO, two other civilians had been killed in the besieged city of Homs in "Deaths of Shots and Heavy Bombings for Jobar".
At a press conference, the Syrian Foreign Trade Minister Walid al-Muallim nevertheless felt that the country was "taxing towards the end of the crisis".
By the way, he has responded with emphasis to the decision of the Arab League to suspend Damascus from its tasks, which he considers to be a "dangerous step".
Syria "will not yield," he added under the guise that "the plots forged against Syria would fail".
Following the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is currently examining a "protection mechanism for civilians" and wishes to send 500 members of Arab human rights organisations, the media and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Trade Minister Alain Juppé had also expressed himself in favour of sending UN observers to stand with civilians against repression of the regime, who were encased in his "Paranoia" after him, protecting himself.
An extraordinary reconvening of the League is scheduled for tomorrow in Rabat to discuss the implementation of the plan on the crisis increase decided on 2 November, but in particular the controversial, expected withdrawal of military troops from the besieged cities and the release of imprisoned demonstrators.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lawrow yesterday classified the decision of the Arab League as "uncorrected" in order to guard against any sanctions against Damascus, although China had already urged Syria to implement the crisis exit plan.
Italy
Monti calls on the markets to be patient and Italy ready for sacrifice
Mario Monti, future Italian head of government, has requested a little more time from the markets to form his staff and implement a program that "victims" demand to regain the creditworthiness lost during the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former EU Commissioner had held negotiations with the political parties yesterday before today's meeting of trade unions and employers' associations.
It was his job to convene a cabinet in Parliament, which is made up relatively strictly of external technocrats.
"Monti spoke of an important programme with a number of victims," said Francesco Nucara, Member of one of the many smaller parliamentary groups participating in the talks, after meeting with the President-in-Office of the Council.
Gianfranco Fini, President of the Chamber of Deputies, had, for his part, been waiting for Mario Monti to bring a vote of confidence to Parliament by Friday to make sure that the new government had sufficient support.
The agreements will culminate in the presentation by M. Monti of a strike list, which will undoubtedly reach from a dozen ministers to Head of State Giorgio Napolitano.
M. Monti commented that yesterday's nervousness in the stock exchange and bond markets required her time.
In "democracy there are certain deadlines" to prepare a government and a government programme, he stressed that it was "certain that the markets will be flexible and sensible".
His appointment by the President was welcomed by the markets, but the unrest had intensified again, especially after an unexpected decline in industrial production in the eurozone in September.
The current Prime Minister was to set up a staff consisting mainly of technocrats, although he had stressed that he would like to include "politicians".
The new government should only exist until 2013, the date of the next parliamentary elections, he estimated.
According to Gianfranco Fini, President of the Chamber of Deputies, the new government should receive Parliament's confidence by Friday.
M. Monti has been committed to working urgently to make Italy the "new protagonist" in Europe since the start of his role.
A spokesperson from Commissioner Olli Rehn had stressed that "it does not change our diagnosis of the Italian economy itself, taking into account the new government".
In particular, the EU, which is convinced that Rome will not achieve its objective of budgetary compensation in 2013, despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, has requested new themes.
Emma Marcegaglia"Chefin of Italy's leaders, who will meet at Monti on Tuesday, also insists on the need for economic growth", because a country that has no growth cannot respect deficit indicators."
M. Monti, who is known for his competence and his independence as EU Commissioner (1994-2004), stands for a "Epoch change" of Italy after 17 years of "Berlin Conism"; the "Professor" symbolizes the "challenge of trust" and a "other Italy", according to the editorials.
The great unknown is the longevity of his staff.
President Napolitano would like to prevent preferred elections, as Italy will now have to pay for EUR 200 billion of government bonds by April 2012.
Russian scientists help the Iranian nuclear programme
A Russian scientist, Wyatscheslaw Danilenko, helped Iran develop a nuclear explosive capsule, so on Monday, an American NGO specializing in nuclear risks confirmed.
The Institute for Science and International Security ISIS is based on the recent report of the International Atomic Safety Agency (AIEA) and other documents based on this UN agency to identify this scientist.
The AIEA had last week announced its "serious concern" on the basis of a "possible military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear programme.
According to a thorough study of AIEA documents by ISIS, Danilenko, born in 1934, had apparently worked for over three decades in a Soviet military nuclear center in Chelyabinsk (Ural) since the beginning of the 1960s and was involved in the production of synthetic diamonds produced by explosion.
He is said to have left the centre in 1989 or 1991 to set up a company in Kiev that produces "nano diamonds".
The economic difficulties of his company had led him in 1995 to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine.
Prior to his return to Russia, he participated in an Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002.
In its last report, the AIEA mentioned strong indications that the Iranian development "of a nuclear fuel system" had been supported by the work of a foreign expert who had not only been extremely involved in this technique but also, as a member of the Agency announced, had worked his entire professional career directly on the military nuclear programme of his country of origin via this technology."
Anti-Islamic crimes and crimes have increased by 50%
The crimes and crimes directed against Muslims have increased by 50% from 2009 to 2010, whereas other racist or religiously motivated violent crimes, according to the FBI statistics published on Monday, have either fallen slightly or increased slightly over the same period.
According to this data, the total number of violent crimes committed against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e. 49%, while a 13% increase in violence against Catholics, a 4% decrease in crimes directed against Jews, and a global increase of 14% in anti-religious crimes and crimes.
The total number of "hats-motivated crimes" had risen to 6,628 cases, including 47.3% due to racial differences and 20% due to religious differences of motivated crimes, according to the FBI.
"After a weakening in 2009, it is alarming to see these crimes and crimes grow again," stressed the Human Rights First Human Rights Organization."The increase in anti-Islamic violence is particularly significant," the organization added in a communiqué.
"Human Rights First had stressed for a long time that the violence directed against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, should be regarded as a serious violation of human rights," added Paul Legendre, a responsible organisation.
"The American government can and should do more to combat these attacks," he added, adding that this could be done by improving the police's attitude towards hate crimes.
The "hat crime" is represented in American federal law as an inheritance from the era of the struggle for civil rights.
This legislation had been passed after the death of Martin Luther Kings to punish acts of violence directed against race, colour, religion or descent and now includes crimes of sexual affiliation.
Twitter is changing the platform and is more and more similar to Facebook
The microblogging website Twitter introduced changes in the presentation of its platform on Monday to enable its users in particular to observe the activities of those who follow its entries, which makes the service more similar to that of Facebook.
The new tab "Activity" and another "Name" allow you to better understand the activities of other "Twitters", the Internet users whose messages ("Tweets") you follow and who follow your messages.
This makes it possible to find out whether these allow them to follow their messages, whether they subscribe to new posts, favor certain messages, etc.
This new Twitter menu offer had been tested with a small percentage of users before its general Internet distribution on Monday"in August", Twitter spokesperson Carolyn Penner stated before the French press agency AFP.
Twitter was known for its little instinctive functioning, endowed with somewhat esoteric word (RT to the referenced repetition of the contribution of another person). followfriday pour recommander de suivre un autre utilisateur) faisant le bonheur des initiés, s'ouvre ainsi a un public plus large avec un maniement plus compatible a celui des réseaux grand public Facebook et Google+.
On the network, users debated this innovation via the Internet with the help of certain "tweets".
"This is useless, intrusive and likes too much Facebook," writes @jemb123.
"The "Activity" function will help me track certain elements of my Flux Twitter better," said @dannykronstrom.
Austria
Entry of a "Golden Budget Rule" into the Constitution
On Tuesday, the Austrian government of the great Social-Democratic/Christian-Democratic coalition decided to include a "Golden Budget Rule" in the Constitution to reduce public deficits and also to avoid possible degradation by rating agencies in Austria's top-level government (AAA).
It was the Social Democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann personally who had announced this decision from the outcome of the Council of Ministers, although the public debt of Austria is 74.6%, far above the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty, but clearly below the level of debt of the countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's ability to pay was not reduced to a blow from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay three billion Euros of interest each year," argued Michael Spindelegger, Vice-Chancellor and Christian-Democratic Foreign Minister.
Austria also requests the Brussels Eurozone Member States Summit of 26 October: the Heads of State or Government would then have demanded the inclusion of the reduction of public deficits by the end of 2012 and the return to the public balance of accounts in the Constitution or the adoption of an equivalent law.
The measure taken by the Austrian government is similar to the "German model", since Germany had been the first European country to have incorporated such a "rule" into the constitution.
By 2017, the structural budget deficit should decrease by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year; by 2017, the structural budget deficit of the state should not exceed the 0.35% of GDP, whereas regional governments and municipalities should have balanced budgets.
The aim is to eliminate the budgetary debt under the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Agreement in the 2020/21 horizon.
Stronger Yen
Noda threatens with a new intervention on the currency markets
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that the Japanese government would again intervene in the currency markets if the yen were to continue to rise.
"If we find an excessive volatility" in the exchange rate of Yen, we will intervene as we did the last time," said M. Noda in the Senate.
On Tuesday, the Yen was in turn speeded up to the historical levels that the Japanese authorities had forced to intervene on 31 October.
On that day, Tokyo had sold massive Yen against dollar to lower the Japanese foreign exchange value, which is in the process of setting a new record value against the dollar since 1945.
However, the yen has regularly increased on this issue, christened by purchases by investors who regard the yen as "affordable" in these uncertain times of global economic downturn and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar has fallen below 77 yen on Tuesday, the euro has fallen below the symbolic lattice of 105 yen close to the levels that had triggered the last intervention.
Prior to the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar recorded around 120 yen, the euro more than 160 yen.
This Japanese currency's bonfire harms the archipelago's exports, as it costs the "made in Japan" products and reduces the income value drawn from Japanese companies abroad, as they exchange them in national currency.
"Japan is fighting for its reconstruction after the earthquake and the tsunami on 11 March, which devastated the Tohoku region (north-east)," stressed M. Noda, who fears that this expensive Yen could kill the weak upturn already in the germ.
With growth in the third quarter, the third world economic power has regained -1.5% compared to the previous quarter - for the first time this year thanks to the rapid growth in exports and consumption of households "plombed" by the disaster.
However, the Prime Minister estimates that the price of the yen does not reflect the economic foundations of Japan.
In turn, Finance Minister Jun Azumi called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its Monetary Policy Committee on Tuesday, to take all possible measures to dissuade the Yen.
However, Hirohide Yamaguchi, deputy governor of the Institute, informed that the BoJ had already launched "appropriate measures", which made it clear that no additional currency reduction would be expected on Wednesday.
At the last meeting at the end of October, the central bank had increased its government bond purchases by 5,000 billion yen (47 billion euros) to offset the 55,000 billion yen (519 billion euros) cover amounts it had spent on various purchases of financial securities to flood the liquidity market.
Eurozone:
Interest rates speed up to the level, stock exchanges make withdrawals
The risk of infection of the debt crisis is constantly undermining European indicators.
Despite the accession of the new Heads of Government in Greece and Italy as well as the best growth rates in France and Germany, the rates of the weakened countries continue to rise.
The stock exchanges, which are still concerned about the stability of the euro area, also drifted off this Tuesday, 15 November even a little more into negative branches.
In Paris, the CAC lost 1.4% at 10 a.m. and fell to 3,064 points.
Dax in Frankfurt decreased by 0.4%, London by 0.1%.
"Due to the new tensions in the yields of government bonds in the Eurozone in difficulty, the global stock markets continue to share some of their recent profits.
"The investors are nervous and only too well aware of the risk of infection," explains Terry Pratt, institutional broker at IG Markets, quoted by the press agency Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange, which, for its part, suffers from the renewed fear of market participants in terms of capacity in Europe that the debt crisis continued, had closed with a base of 0.7%.
"Japan has focused on Europe as well as the rest of the world, and trade is moving on a limited variation corridor as long as investors have no evidence that the situation has stabilized," estimates Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This revival of concern about the future of the eurozone damages the single currency that continues its baiss on Tuesday.
The euro has been moving at its lowest level for one and a half months.
At 10 a.m., the European currency was 1.3570 dollars, so it gave up 0.4%.
According to the stockbrokers, the CDU, the party of Chancellor Angela Merkel, who had gathered at the Congress on Monday, had accepted an application which provided, in particular, for countries in difficulty to leave the euro zone without leaving the European Union at the same time.
The Italian and Spanish rates are well below the 6% threshold.
The loan rates of Italy and Spain remain at a very worrying level.
This Tuesday morning the yield of the Italian bonds reached 6.85% in 10 years, the Spanish title reaching 6.2%.
These tensions of interest rates in the South, but also in France, continue to fuel the fears of investors.
The future Italian head of government Mario Monti called for more time from the markets to restore the situation threatened by the burden of debt in Italy.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos, for his part, had confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone Summit on 27 October was the "main task" of his government.
Spain is located in the visor of the markets, as the parliamentary elections take place in the country on Sunday.
The spread between the German and Spanish 10-year bonds has once again reached a new, historic high.
Expecting growth rates of the eurozone
Statistically, France recorded an economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, slightly better than the expected 0.3%.
However, the Federal Statistical Office INSEE had revised the bases of the figures for the second quarter, with a reduction of 0.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
In truth, it is the fourth quarter that worries economic experts the most.
Germany, for its part, had a growth of 0.5% over the same period.
A first euro area bill is expected at 11 a.m., with the EU Commission warning of the risk of a further recession.
Energy policy:
Facts should win over dogmas
If there is a topic that cannot be dealt with on the basis of short-term considerations or on the basis of emotions, this is certainly the energy policy.
The availability and costs of electricity directly affect the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
It is reasonable to consider this issue and the position of nuclear energy.
The debate will only bear fruit if it explores the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French should base their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
Although there are 7 billion people on this planet, demographic evolution is driving a doubling of electricity demand by 2050, a huge proportion of the world’s population is not going to have to abandon a vital element.
At the same time, it is necessary to alleviate the shortage of fossil resources in order to continue to produce electricity consistently, without forgetting the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, an issue that has disappeared from the environmental debate, in order to combat climatic irregularities.
Fukushima's accident doesn't change any of these parameters.
Therefore, Germany remains isolated in its decision to refrain from nuclear power.
This is not the case in Belgium, which is subject to its decision on the need to find a substitute source, nor in Switzerland, which is just about to build nuclear power plants of the last generation.
In contrast, Great Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to name just a few countries, continue to pursue their projects with determination.
The United States, for its part, decided after Fukushima to draw up a further unit for its park by re-establishing the plant Three Mile Island, which was shut down after the nuclear accident.
Even though the German model, which is based on renewable energy sources, is sometimes set as a model, reality contradicts the discourse.
The choice in Berlin will be in the form of an increase in the price of electricity, an increase in the energy dependence on imported gas, in particular on Russia, an increase in CO2 emissions caused by gas and coal power plants.
The totality of these unpleasant effects will already become apparent within a few months.
The case of Denmark gives cause for reflection.
Denmark, on the one hand, is a European leader in wind energy, from which it accounts for 30% of its electricity; on the other hand, it is one of the strongest users of coal and gas, alternately used with wind energy; hence its CO2 emissions and its electricity price are 65% and 50% higher than the corresponding European average.
Thanks to the permanence of our energy policy, our neighbours pay a 40% higher electricity bill in contrast to our French households.
Since the energy price in the globalised economy is a key role of competitiveness and a stability pledge for industry on national soil, French companies have an advantage due to the most favourable electricity in Europe.
Any significant reduction in nuclear power would therefore result in a strong increase in the price of energy, resulting in the noble statements about the reindustrialization of our country and the defence of purchasing power being an illusion.
Surveys have shown that this is a price that the vast majority of French people are less willing to pay than it shows resistance to the principle of this energy source.
We are aware that our country's energy policy has enabled us to build an industrial sector with 125.00 direct and 410,000 inducted jobs.
Due to its strong export character, it brings a multitude of specialised small and medium-sized enterprises to the international markets and makes them the creators of countless jobs.
If France decided to withdraw from nuclear power, the majority of these SMEs would fall victim to it, and the annual EUR 6 billion of exports of capital goods and nuclear energy would shrink more and more.
What electrician would commission an EPR designed to function for sixty years if the decline of his producer is pre-programmed?
In order to solve the energy equation, one must admit that there is no more than a devilish work a miracle medium for the production of electricity.
The low-carbon solutions developed by Areva for the use of nuclear power and renewable energy reflect the complementarity of energy sources.
Maintaining the highest possible level of safety is an absolute imperative for nuclear power.
In France, we have a security authority that carries out uncompromising and transparent controls in existing works such as construction in Flamanville.
Their work teams, who have made a name because of their professionalism, are currently obsessed with the security concept.
Within 50 years, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious incidents.
Only one, namely in Three Mile Island, entered normal operating conditions, so he left without consequences for man and the environment.
In Chernobyl, the drama was conjured up by reactor construction as well as indebted human failure.
At Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident of two natural disasters has never been caused by a mass that caused the death of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will draw its lessons from this accident as it did after the two previous ones.
As a result of this approach, as well as cooperation between the safety authorities of the French and German operators and constructors of nuclear power plants, the EPR is a design that enables it to withstand such phenomena.
Since it is considered desirable by electrical technicians to build a nuclear power plant, a construction stop in Flamanville would be a fabulous gift to the competition of Areva and EDF by allowing them to take the lead in the inevitable development of nuclear power.
It is essential and legitimate to look for the best energy bouquet for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotions, dogmas and party rulers dominate a debate that also determines the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or a chance for the economy?
The immigration policy conducted under Nicolas Sarkozy was criticized from many angles - overburdening police, judicial and administrative bodies due to a policy subject to the figures, compatibility of this policy with the status of a "country of human rights", as France had named itself.
Recently, the harassment directed against foreign students had influenced the weekly shows by the government, the Minister of the Interior had announced (see Libération of 23 May) that France "did not need any talents, masons or waiters from abroad".
But this policy was rarely analysed from an economic point of view.
There is a broad consensus on this issue between the right and the left.
On the right, the tone of Jacques Chirac, who had declared in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed people, including over 2 million immigrant workers, would not be a problem for a country", on the left, by Michel Rocard, who had presented in 1990, "could not take up the entire poverty of the world."
The only difference is the degree of growth
The fear of the invasion of the national soil by hordes of Polish plumbers was shared in 2005 both from the right and from the left.
From both camps, immigrants were perceived as a burden for the economy and French society.
The only difference is in the degree of generosity that one is willing to admit to the immigrants.
Francois Hollande, in his programme, confines himself to banalities that indicate that partnership development allows us to solve our "migration problems".
This idea of immigration as a burden, as a problem, may have an impact on the elections, but it is economically costly.
How economic experts Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron present us in a recent work that summarizes the latest findings on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 S.), there is a broad consensus among the specialists on the positive impact of the flood on economic growth, wages and jobs in the immigrant countries.
Limiting immigration would slow down growth and damage the labour market situation.
The fears about the influence of migrants are based on the idea that they threaten to replace the local workers, especially the less qualified, by exerting pressure on their wages.
Experience shows, however, that immigrants are, in fact, much more complementary than the local wage-earners, since they are mainly engaged in occupations in sectors that are technically unburdened.
The low-skilled immigrants work in sectors where local wage-earners have little incentive, the more skilled among immigrants work in dynamic sectors where training is not comparable to the supply of labour.
Positive wage effect
Just as a surgeon would find it difficult to work in a country where there is a shortage of anesthesiologists, so this complementarity between locals and migrants also has a positive effect on the labour market situation of immigrants.
Giovanni Peri has calculated in this way that a 1% increase in the influx of immigrants results in a related, long-term increase in real wages between 0.6% and 0.9%.
And this without taking into account the fact that the diversity of ideas and economic growth introduced by immigrants is contributing (high proportion of native immigrants among American Nobel Laureates; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants also contribute net to the social systems, with an average of about 1% of the total budget in the European countries.
For example, the World Labour Organisation estimates that a person aged 30 who is an immigrant to Germany will make an average net contribution to the public household (income minus expenditure) of around EUR 150,000 over his lifetime.
Nicolas Sarkozy wished to bring about the missing intersections "with the teeth" at the beginning of his mandate.
However, these said teeth, which should deter immigrants, had exactly the opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, now remains to think through European democracy
Democracy is a valuable good; it is also a sensitive good.
The European continent should be able to remember for itself who, after their invention in Athens more than two thousand years ago, had suffered the whole of the 20th century over the tragedies of the First World War, totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the Gulag, but also Francos in Spain, Salazars in Portugal and the Colonel in Greece.
Some had probably believed that it was enough to exercise the right to vote, in the most direct way possible, to see democracy triumph over its enemies once and for all.
It is known since Napoleon "the little one" that this was a characteristic of the mental attitude.
The universal right to vote, which constitutes the necessary condition of democracy, is not a sufficient condition for this and can become as well a "repressive instrument" as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot expressed at that time.
No, democracy requires far more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, separation and control of violence, training, education, economic and social community spirit, a case law.
The crisis in Europe, in which we are in, is an economic crisis, but it is just as acute and, above all, a political and democratic crisis.
The change of attitude of the Greek True False Referendum would have had a double revealing character in this respect: once the necessity of a powerful return of politics, on the other hand, but also the distressing feeling of its impossibility, its inadequacy.
This ambivalence should be considered obsolete.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle have shifted today, and that the Republican soldiers, or at least most of them, no longer aim in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain to insist on the success of the national referendum, which has been organised according to the needs and in the wrong order.
A free pass for the European ruler or a jump with linked eyes into the void of nationalist withdrawal: a great choice for the citizen!
No, we want hackebeil, but a collective task, out of full law, clarified and constantly, a choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal - we do not know where to end the list, by the way - because there is only one crisis, and it is in Europe.
It is Europe as a whole that bows to the dictates of markets and credit rating agencies, which suffer from its impotence and its lack of solidarity.
It is Europe as a whole that is humiliated at international level.
One is concerned about transfers of sovereignty towards Europe - it is the whole of Europe that gradually loses its sovereignty, and thus each and every nation associated with it.
The urgency is to restore the leadership of the European project to the sovereignty of the people.
For it is up to the whole whether Europeans can reduce the burden of their debts, free themselves from the markets and launch a future through investment.
The exit from the crisis has European-level decisions which cannot be accepted without total democratic legitimacy, without surely ruining us.
After this proposal has been fought for a long time by Jacques Delors and the Socialists, everyone is pressing European economic governance to do so today.
All right.
But to imagine this without political integration and a stronger democracy - as it suggests to the citizens - would be another folly and another dead end.
We must take on a new stage of European integration.
In order to create the Republic in France, it was necessary to "create" Republicans.
The revolution of interests alone could not do enough here.
This instruction remains valid.
We need to form a more integrated Europe at an economic level.
This can only be achieved by creating a more politically democratic Europe, a truly European people's sovereignty.
We need Europeans to create Europe.
"Contactless" chip cards become the general good
The World Chipcard Fair opens its doors on Tuesday in Villepinte near Paris in an optimistic attitude.
According to Eurosmart, 2011 should actually end with an 11% increase in worldwide sales of microprocessor chips (EC cards, SIM cards telephone), with more than 6 billion units sold.
The most important segment here is the contactless technology that allows payments in public transport or payment of purchases by simply holding the card to a reader.
Compared to the 320 million sold a year earlier, 460 million contactless chip cards should be sold worldwide this year!
Their market share should increase further in 2012 (580 million expected units) and represent more than 10% of the global chip card market (6,925 million cards).
Europe is gaining ground in terms of contactless payment after it has been lagging behind the Asia-Pacific region for a long time.
Some 26 million visa cards are already equipped with this functionality, and 75,000 payment terminals accept them.
In France, the beginnings are rather modest: only 400,000 contactless visa cards were distributed.
However, consumer markets are steaming.
Carrefour has therefore issued 2.5 million contactless Pass MasterCards this year.
In order to move at a higher speed, it is now necessary for banks to equip their customers with these cards.
"Two large French financial institutions have committed themselves to systematically handing out bank cards to their customers in the future, which are equipped with a contactless chip," says Gérard Nébouy, Director General of Visa Europe France.
Banks test payment by mobile phone
However, this is only a first step towards the means of payment of the future: the mobile phone.
A disappearing low percentage of devices has so far been equipped with the NFC technology (Near Field Communication) necessary for carrying out these transactions.
"You're in default."
"But they should experience a real upward trend at least next year."
"We expect sales of 80 to 120 million units worldwide in 2012," explains Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But the banks are taking initiative.
The Crédit Agricole announced yesterday the start of a test run in Caen, which will run from December to next June.
The iPhones of some 200 customers and employees are to be equipped with a capsule that allows contactless payment.
The BPCE operates a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the Société Générale also announced yesterday that it would prepare the market launch of an offer that would enable its customers to pay without contact by mobile phone.
Terrorist front understands itself, from the Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the relations between al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The long-standing relationship between the terrorist group al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram seems to confirm.
On Sunday, Algerian Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel himself confirmed that Algiers had now gained "certainty".
"The way in which both organisations operate and the relations of the secret services indicate clear cooperation," he explained without going into any detail.
Paris seems to be making a similar analysis.
The investigations into the abduction of two Frenchmen in the Niger last January have encouraged interfaces.
The Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory, kidnapped in a restaurant in Niamey by Aqmi supporters, are said to have been killed at the same time as several of their abductors on the occasion of an operation carried out by the French special units.
French and Nigerian investigators want to have found several telephone chips in the debris at the site of the operation that belonged to the terrorists.
Terrorist Axis
The analysis of the phone calls conducted leads to several interlocutors stationed in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), the investigators are particularly interested in the numbers of two interlocutors: one leads to a Nigerian who had long stayed in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, the cradle of Boko Haram; the other leads to a man who is considered to be the Aqmi and the sect.
"This is a step forward, but one must undoubtedly wait for more clear evidence before one can speak of operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Harem."
"But it's conceivable."
"It has been known for years that the sect has received financial and intellectual support from outsiders and that it is increasingly active," says Nigerian researcher Kunle Amuwo.
In these last months, these "support services" have become increasingly obvious in their course, as have the speeches and the operations modes of Boko Harem, which now indicate the use of suicide bombers and the use of ever more complex explosives that carry the same handwriting as those used by Aqmi.
Since then, the international community, to start at Washington, has exerted pressure on Abuja to take account of the problems caused by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have indeed for a long time considered the grouping to be a community of Illuminati, which should not be given special attention.
Fast Success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri in the vicinity of a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist Iman Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram - which means as much in Haoussa as "the Western education is a disgrace" - follows the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this mediocre region, the merger is experiencing rapid successes.
It politicates and demands strict compliance with the Sharia, while its affiliated activists engage in the fight against the godless central government.
The activists first have churches, bars and authorities in sight.
In 2009, Boko Haram's activists were particularly active with their intensified attacks on the commissioners.
The reaction of Abuja is, however, as usual.
The army surrounds the city, 800 dead.
Muhammad Yusuf, who was imprisoned, is killed in prison.
As a result, the sect becomes more radical and leaves its strongholds in the north.
Last Christmas she confessed to an attack in Jos, who claimed 80 lives, then to another in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram is assigned the guilt of a suicide attack that took place at the secured police headquarters in Abuja - the first of his kind.
In August, the local headquarters of the United Nations became a priority international target.
The formation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which is to lead from Mauritania to Nigeria to Somalia, has since troubled all security experts.
While Aqmi has occupied Mali and the Niger, the Somalis of al-Shabaab operate in Kenya, Boko Harem seems to be a new threat in the centre of the continent.
Last week Alain Juppé warned about Boko Harem on the occasion of a conversation with President Goodluck Jonathan in Nigeria and was willing to "deliver all the information".
The world according to Republican presidential candidates
With Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry rival in simplification and ignorance of China, Iraq and assistance to Israel.
Can a crisis-affected America lead a complex world with simple, not to say: simple ideas?
If you listen to the Republican presidential candidates like that, the voters could almost get this impression.
For a few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and their associates have repeatedly made their thunderous statements as well as their statements on foreign policy, a traditional republican focus.
About China, Iran and Israel - often in no way supported - slogans fall.
With regard to the appointment of the Grand Old Party, Mitt Romney threatened to quote the Chinese in front of the WTO and to accuse them of "currency manipulation" - a leading theme in an America that is most attracted by the relocation of entire industries to Asia.
He said that this would be foolish if this were to imply the start of a trade war.
Jon Huntsman, former Ambassador to China under Obama and the only candidate who seems to have a mature vision of foreign policy, has almost deflected the air with regard to his emotions-smearing gesture.
He had called for a firm but constructive exchange of views with Beijing (also the current Obama attitude).
But Huntsman is not being heard as he stagnates in the depths of opinion polls.
Reagan's Equator
Romney had also praised military blows against Iran if the sanctions to stop the nuclear programme were to fail.
"If I am elected, I will stop Iran," he said.
"If Obama is re-elected, they get the bomb."
He also promised Israel increased military assistance and accused Obama of remaining guilty of obligations to this partner.
The entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second highest-ranking candidate, has a shameful record.
Recently, he called for the Chinese military threat to be countered, as Beijing was "trying to develop a nuclear power" - and seemed to ignore the fact that China has already owned military nuclear weapons since 1964!
Texan Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and demands military battles against Iran, in turn makes it possible to be willing to engage the American army in Mexico against drug cartels.
The use of torture measures against suspected terrorists by Obama 2009 was also supported by Cain, Perry and Michele Bachmann.
It is far from John McCain, the Republican candidate in 2008, a heavyweight.
The current presidential opponents opposed that Reagan also had simple ideas and, despite all of this, won the Cold War.
They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and had to pour water into his wine, which was the subject of anti-terrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of his naive argument with Iran, the premature withdrawal of his "boy" from Iraq, his indecisiveness in Libya, which also brought him the call of weakness.
This hostility, however, is not quite so forceful.
The population rather appreciates the positive balance of national security under Obama, which Bin Laden has turned off.
Since Iraq, she has been guarding herself from military interventions that lead to paralysis.
And Obama is more surprised by his argument that America had to be reconstructed economically in order to revitalize its leadership.
North Stream, new gateway to Russian gas in Europe
The North Stream gas pipeline, which runs on the seabed of the Baltic Sea and connects Western Europe directly with Russia, has been put into operation.
It is intended to supply gas for an equivalent of 30 million households.
The Russian gas giant Gazprom wanted to celebrate this event with brilliance and Gloria.
Last Tuesday, more than 500 invited guests, including four heads of state and government, lived on the Baltic Sea coast under orchestral sound and at fine-tasting buffet the inauguration of the new North Stream gas pipeline, which connects Russia and Germany directly below sea level.
German Chancellor Angelika Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte have symbolically turned the control of the valve, which transports the Russian gas into the Western European network.
With the new gas pipeline, 27.5 billion cubic metres of additional Russian gas per year will be delivered to Western Europe through a first 1,224 km pipeline connecting the St Petersburg region with Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
A second pipeline, which allows a total delivery of 55 billion cubic metres of gas - the equivalent of total French consumption - is expected to be completed by the end of 2012.
And one already lets the possibility of building a third line sound on its own.
For Gazprom, the timely and accurate completion of this huge building seems like a victory.
The project was highly controversial in Poland and the Baltic States.
The North Stream pipeline will enable direct gas delivery to Germany, while avoiding any route through third countries (Poland or Ukraine) on the land.
For this reason, these two countries are losing a little of their power: it is now becoming more difficult for them to exert pressure on Russia by threatening to close access to Western European markets.
Warsaw, most strongly engaged in the debate, was not shyed away from comparing the North Stream pipeline with a "new German-Swiss pact" in connection with the alliance between Hitler and Stalin for the occupation of Poland in 1939.
This means that the issue is politically extremely sensitive.
Western Europe has gained even greater security of supply by supporting this Russian project.
However, this is at the expense of reducing European energy, as the project has struck a break between Western and Eastern Europe.
Russia has completed its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich, western countries, which have strong gas consumption and whose gas deposits are on the decline in just under five years.
"This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that connects us organically," confirmed François Fillon at the inauguration of the gas pipeline, pointing out to what extent the major gas contracts are also important from a political and economic point of view.
All of this explains the broad smile of the numerous Gazprom managers represented in Lubmin regarding the gas supply.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also an outstanding technique.
The submersible pipe consists of steel with concrete covering, which is intended to protect it from ship anchors.
It rests on the seabed, about 200 m deep.
Mining fields dating from the Second World War had to be removed during their construction.
"Some hundreds of mines had to be removed or destroyed carefully," said Jens Müller, spokesperson of Nord Stream.
In addition, reinforced measures were needed to protect the fauna and flora.
The line is a long hose made of metal, heavy like 242 Eiffel Towers, which is interrupted by nothing over the entire length: neither by valves, nor by maintenance stations.
A control platform was planned off the coast of Sweden, but project managers have refused to do so, as Sweden has little interest in seeing a Russian state company settle on the shores of its shores in a permanent manner.
"In the event of a disaster, we close the gas throughput in less than a minute," said Jens Müller.
In the case of a leak, the gas contained in the gas pipeline escapes into the air.
However, this case is considered by the constructors to be less likely, since the welding seams were estimated to be resistant by one leak per 100,000 years.
State control of gas transmission is ensured both by an underwater robot controlled for external observation purposes by a seaship, as well as by a device circulating inside the gas transmission line.
It has the shape of a cigar, has a diameter of one metre, is introduced into the inside of the pipe and is moved through the gas pressure.
After three complete days of movement through the wire at a speed of 3 meters per second, the device provides the most accurate information on its arrival about any deformation of the metal.
The gas pipeline was designed to work for fifty years without even having to undergo the smallest repair.
Gas circulation is simply ensured by pressure.
This is 200 bar at the entrance, 100 bar at the exit point.
Five societies have united their forces to carry out this project.
However, the management remains in the hands of Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares.
In addition, the German companies E. ON and BASF (each 15.5%), as well as the Dutch gas union and the French group GDF Suez (each to 9%), are associated here.
These five companies have formed a community of companies called Nord Stream, which is responsible for the construction and operation of the gas pipeline.
It has its seat in train in Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then leased the entire capacity of its gas transport to this company, on a renewable 20-year contract.
"Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, no matter how large the real transporter gas volume falls," Jens Müller explained.
The financing of gas pipeline construction was secured to 30% of shareholders and to 70% by bank loans.
Total labour costs should be EUR 7.4 billion for both pipelines.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment total was 240 million.
The minority shareholders, however, are aware of recovering their expenses, as Gazprom alone bears the liability risk.
The gas pipeline emerges on a sandy coastline forested with pine trees near Lubmin from the Baltic Sea.
The 4.5 meter high valves form the gas outlet.
Sensors measure pressure, temperature and other parameters of the incoming gas before it is passed on to the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal has been supplied with a million cubic metres of Russian gas per hour.
With full capacity, this would be 3 million cubic metres per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine, a trademark notebook.
Founded by an Italian company about fifteen years ago, Moleskine now wants to give the writing a new style.
It has a flair of adventure, with candlelights spent with writing hours.
The notebook of Moleskine is easily recognizable, with its black, rectangular cover, its rubber band, the eggshell-coloured sides, as over time aged.
However, the Moleskin notebook, as it is known today, was created in 1997.
At the time, the Italian company Modo Modo, which is based in Milan, decided to publish a distinguished design notebook.
Maria Sebregondi, at that time specialist consultant of the company, is responsible for the market launch of the new product.
The notebook was inspired by an ancient production technique called Mole Skin (mole skin), which is called a cotton varnish used for covering upholstery benches.
This type of notebook was very much in demand among writers and travelers.
"Moleskine has revived an old and almost forgotten object, which until the 20th century was regarded as an icon of avant-garde artists," explains Maria Sebregondi, now brand manager at Modo Modo.
Success is on the rise.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales rose by 26% and established themselves with a sales volume of 12.7 million pieces.
This is far from the usual production of the first years, in which only 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskine passes the Italian border and is exported to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to create a phantom image of the buyers, as the notebook inspires businessmen as well as students and professionals.
Moleskine has the image of cosmopolitan, cultivated and open-minded customers.
The small, Italian company, which initially employed 12 people, employs over 100 people today and has two offices since 2008; one in Milan, the other in New York.
The company sells its notebooks in bookstores, on Internet portals such as Fnac, in small city centre boutiques and understands how to enforce its identity.
"We have followed the zeitgeist and his new need for writing, which exists despite the recovery of the e-mails," said Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural trait is accompanied by the development of the company Moleskine: Recently, the brand launched an exposure called "Detour" in which architects and artists issued their own notebooks.
In August, at the film festival in Locarno, the company also launched a cover with leopard patterns.
Moleskine benefited from his success and this cultural zeitgeist and understood to diversify his products: bags, appointment calendar, fillers, computer cases... The brand has the entire range of articles.
A success that brings envy to the plan: In autumn 2006, Modo Modo was bought up by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, today's Syntegra Capital, and thus proposed a new chapter in Moleskine's history.
Why does the unemployment rate of disabled workers remain at such a high level?
About 19% of disabled people are looking for a job.
Today begins the "15th week of work for the disabled".
Despite a determined public policy introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate for disabled people is always twice the average average: 19% compared to 9% of the total population.
Discouraging?
"No, this is how Éric Blanchet, Director-General of the Adapt Association, emphasises the "week of work for the disabled."
"The progress made within fifteen years is considerable."
"At that time the unemployment rate was not twice as high, but three times as high."
"Nevertheless, there is still a great deal to be done."
However, it must be said that there are still many obstacles for the disabled unemployed before they get a job.
It is more common for the elderly: 37% are older than 50 years (17% on average).
They have a low qualification level: 80% of them do not have a degree and there are only 10,000 disabled among the 2.3 million students with higher education qualifications.
Finally, long-term unemployment is also very widespread: 53% for the disabled compared with 38% for the total.
In short, there are so many criteria that make it more difficult to start working again and that form the "core of the problem", says Christian Grapin, Director-General of Tremplin, an association founded in 1992, which helps companies to recruit disabled workers.
So much for the actual brakes.
Keep the unspoken, the mental attitudes that, although certain, but slowly evolve.
A study carried out in April by the Association of IMS Entreprendre for the magazine La Cité indicated that the managers surveyed have "a weak level of knowledge about the disabled" which was "overrepresented" by people in wheelchairs, mental or intellectually inferior.
The result is that private companies with more than 20 employees still have a long way to go in order to achieve the employment target of 6% of disabled workers, which was laid down in a 1987 law.
These latter figures from 2008 refer to a ratio of 2.6%.
"We are now at 3%," reports Pierre Blanc, Director-General of Agefiph, the organization responsible for collecting contributions from companies that disregard this law.
Evidence: The number of "fees paid" establishments has decreased from 59.000 to 46.000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros) as well as the sum of the sums paid between 2007 and 2011.
"The 2005 Law, which provides for increased contributions, created a strong pressure on the companies," explained Pierre Blanc."
"But this improvement also reflects a real understanding, especially of the large groups of companies."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of establishments employ disabled workers between 20 and 49 employees, while enterprises with 100 to 199 employees employ 82%.
Hazard:"What a happiness"
Even before they offered the "Blue Tuesday Evenings" (20:45 p.m.), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens had not hidden their pleasures that brought them the game of friendship.
It would have been too far to claim that there had been a secret agreement between them, but the picture speaks symbolic volumes.
Sitting side by side on the audience stage of the Stade de France, George Leekens and Eden Hazard could have made peace.
Five months after the temperamental gesture of his attacker against Turkey, the Belgian national coach had reaped nothing but praise for his person.
"I am very satisfied with Eden, its progress and the fact that he is Belgian."
"I want to look forward," assures the native Liller.
As to the contrast between his presentation in Club and NationalElf, "It is a unity that justifies everything."
"I am in Lille all year round, which is not the case in Belgium."
"It's time for me to go to the start."
Hazard will come to Saint-Denis, brought Friday evening against Romania regarding the match against France to finally "shine".
However, without neglecting the note of "pleasure".
The French national team he has been firing since the age of seven, and he led his victorious campaigns between 1998 and 2000.
"I was always supported," he confirmed.
This necessarily helps to strengthen the "unique" character of this encounter even more.
So much in advance:"Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) will be there," he presents.
"We just walked over the road."
"To allow them to play means great happiness!"
Leekens, for his part, made a sound of "stupid" kindness.
"The Pride of a Galamatch."
"Stolz" also to confirm - in his capacity as a "neighbor" - that France "has once again become a team at a very high level" and that little more than a year after the trauma of Knysna.
"Laurent Blanc has done a damn good job," he said enthusiastically.
Although Belgium will be missing in the next European Championship, the technician is very likely to share the plane with the Blues (the French National Elves) ... towards Brazil in 2014.
"We little Belgians come out big," he stressed.
"We're planning one thing, the players are ambitious, they're hungry."
"You will notice that in the upcoming games." The game against France included.
Portugal very confident
The Portuguese team of Paulo Bento looks forward with great optimism to the replay against Bosnia (22:00 a.m.) this Tuesday in Lisbon.
At the end of the game, both teams had missed out on materiality.
"At the end of these 90 minutes we will be a happy team and above all a happy country."
Paulo Bento already sees himself in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no doubt that "La Selecçao", his national elf, for whom he has been responsible since September 2010, will qualify for the 2012 European Championship.
For Portugal, that does indeed mean only 90 minutes of happiness.
But there is a match to play and to serve an opponent, namely Bosnia.
In view of the hint (0-0) on Friday in the hell of Zenica it seems obvious that the dice have not yet fallen.
Portugal clearly dominated the game over more than an hour, but the team was unable to press on the matter the so important stamp that would have taken the pressure from it.
"This is a good result, but there is a certain risk, as we have not achieved an exit gate."
At home, however, in its brightly shining Lisbon Stade de la Luz, the Portuguese are convinced that they are going to beat themselves in front of an audience that is equally hot at stake, even if the party was, of course, announced as "very scarce," the optimistic but clear Bento said.
"We expect a very tight match, but are fully convinced to win the upper hand," said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have a 50% chance at the 2012 European Championship", however, Carlos Queiroz's successor relativised.
The decision on Friday in Bosnia forces the Portuguese to reach and win a goal.
A decision can already suffice the Bosnians, who also need a gate.
"This is a good result, but there is a certain risk because we have not reached an exit gate," Bento laments.
"We will fight a team that has high technical qualities and has players with many individual qualities," he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese have planned to put maximum pressure on the Bosnians at the beginning, so that they do not "allow their time to think"."
A good idea, provided that it is implemented this time.
