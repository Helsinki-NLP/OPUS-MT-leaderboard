Crying for the World
The marketing campaign Looks Like You Need Iceland seems to have gone well and cries and calls in nature are starting to pull people wide and wide around the world.
"I need Iceland," says a woman in the big world, commenting on advertising from the marketing campaign Looks Like You Need Iceland on YouTube.
Another observer's greeting will preserve Iceland in his heart forever and a young woman says she has to get to Iceland as soon as possible because her fiancé lives there.
However, in the United States, she is unhappy and expects to have to wait for another month.
Another observer asks if the walk to Iceland is good, because there are no planes.
It doesn't follow history if it comes from a different time zone.
Egill Thordarson, a member of the advertising organization Peel, and the international advertising office M&C Saatchi, said that the receptions had been hoped for.
“I’ve come to many Inspired By Iceland campaigns that have gone very well, but this new campaign is already on record.
Basically, this is about creating a PR value, it's getting the foreign media to discuss the campaign, and it's been amazingly successful.
In a relatively short period of time, we have been covered in some seven hundred worldwide media, covering over two billion people.
The value of this coverage is estimated at $1 billion (U.S.).
It's not hard."
The main market is the United States, and the campaign has been very successful there, even though Americans are not on their way to the country soon.
According to Egil, such areas as Denmark, Britain, and Germany have also been well - received, as did Russia, which surprises us.
Then there were reactions from foreign areas, such as India, that were not specifically addressed.
“ These advertisements have traveled far beyond our expectations, ” says Egill, who may have seen more than four million people watching YouTube.
“We couldn’t have wished for a better start.”
The pictures on this cover took Årni Sæberg, the photographer of the Morning Paper, to the headline “Let It Out ” in the middle of the last month.
They were far and wide, such as the school guard in Reykjavík, in Reynishphjöra, at Forest Foss, on the Sun - Home Sea, and in a cave at the head of the Reindeer.
The directors were Samuel Bjarki Petersson and Gunnar Paul Olafsson, among Scottish productions and the taker of the Son of God.
In his role as a guard, the Icelandic Anna Jia and Murphy Cardenas, who come from Cuba and Hungary, were involved.
Tens of the Icelandic people were involved in the advertising, but at the same time as the recordings were made in the South, there was another group in the West and West.
According to Egil, "Let It Out" is only the first team in the Looks Like You Need Iceland campaign, but is aimed at a winter campaign in collaboration with M&C Saatchi.
"This is just the first phase of this work for the Icelandic office," says Egill, adding that the collaboration with M&C Saatchi has been extremely successful.
“ Working with them is great.
In such assignments, it is very important to have foreign partners with knowledge of the markets we are talking to."
Explosives: Talk about the position on the labour market, the pension fund, and much more
Ausmundur Einar Dadason, Minister of Social Affairs and Childhood, will be at the Explendent, which will begin today at 10:00 on the Wave.
He is also the Minister of Labour and discusses the position in the labour market as such, the Icelandair case and more.
He also discusses rural affairs and transportation to a land that has gone badly and has been debated in recent years and decades.
Ragnar Thor Ingólfsson, chairman of VR, will also be present, but he will discuss his criticisms about investment in pension funds, and will present ideas that employers and employers are withdrawing from the funds’ governance to reduce the risk of conflicts of interest.
Then there will be a discussion with Ivar Ingimarsson, a traveling minister in the Orient, and the daughter of Jahran, the managing director of the Nordic Marketplace, about the position in the country’s travel service.
They will look forward to the fall and wonder if summer’s success is a misleading prelude to what is to come.
You can listen to the feature below, but it starts at ten o’clock.
That's how she looks today 25 years later.
The actress Elisa Donovan had a successful career in each type of adolescent.
However, she received world fame for her game as an Amber in Clueless 25 years ago.
She also played in the parts Sabrina: The Teenage Witch, Melissu Joan Hart, A Night at the Roxbury, and Beverly Hills 90210.
Donovan is now 49 years old, married to one child.
Recently, however, she was moved to look at Clueress and express herself on a popular television on days.
She speaks beautifully of Brittany Murphy who died unexpectedly in 2009 and says she has been a great person.
“ I have to admit that I was mostly based on girls I met at school who were not good to me.
As soon as I read the script, I knew who this person was," said Donovan about his game in Clueless.
Didn't want to leave the police station after the night.
Some 50 cases were filed by police in the capital area today, and the police diary says that things have changed.
The day at the local police station began by requiring a police officer to interact with a man who had been recently released from a prison cell after staying there for drunk driving.
If the man did not want to leave after he was released, he would not obey the instructions of the police who told him to leave.
The man won a continued stay at the police station because of his conduct.
Then a man was arrested in the morning year suspected of burglary in a company in Copavogi.
Police also had to interact with two people in the Breithol because of reports of assault.
Then, too, a woman sitting at a grocery store in Copavogi could not pay for the bill after a meal, so she was called to the police.
There was also a report of stealing a car in the city center this morning.
For a moment, a white Renault van driver looked after her and was then taken into the hands of an inexorable man.
The car hasn't been found.
The Cursed of the Joyful League - The Horrible Destiny of the Glee Bears
That theory has won a flight on the Internet to curse the show of the Joy Team, but the actress Naya Rivera drowned in California on the day and thus became the third leading actor of the show to live long before age.
The show on the Joy League (E. Glee) is a popular series of songs, dances, and joys.
The so - called youth group in high school, their love, and their destiny were discussed.
It was not always taken out with happiness to be in the joyous party, but through singing and dancing, the characters seemed to overcome any circumstances that arose in their lives.
Outside the scene, however, a great deal of disaster has beenfallen by actors and workers, so much so that theories have awakened that the elements are cursed.
Naya Marie Rivera played the role of Santana Lopez in the show, a cheerleader who did not call all his grandmother.
After the show was over, Rivera went to own the actor Ryan Dorsey and had his first and only child, Josey.
In 2017, Rivera was arrested for domestic violence against her husband and then divorced them.
However, Dorsey refused to file a complaint and the domestic violence case was dropped.
On July 8 last, Rivera was reported missing after her four - year - old son was found alone in a boat on Lake Piru, California.
The boy was found sleeping in a life jacket aboard the boat and was able to report to the police that he and his mother had sung and Rivera had brought him back into the boat but never returned there.
Started an extensive search for Rivera.
The day after the search began, the police officer in the area reported that our search had been made on the assumption that Rivera had drowned.
Five days later Rivera was found dead and was officially sentenced to death.
It is thought to have suffered a great deal of current in the water, and it is new to its final requirement to save the son.
The cause of death was recorded as a result of an accident.
Cory Allan Michael Monteith played the role of Finn Hudson in the role of the American footballer with the angel’s voice, who played a key role in bringing the Joy League to glory and respect.
Outside, however, Moneith was struggling with personal demons.
From the age of 13, he had struggled with addiction and found it difficult to escape.
In 2013, his associates felt that they were enough, intervened, and encouraged him to seek help.
Moneith then went to treatment and seemed to look all the better.
Only two months after he finished the treatment, Moneith felt dead in a hotel room after having fun with friends.
Banamein proved to be a lethal mixture of drugs and alcohol.
It was not thought to be a willdo.
Moneith had been treated and his tolerability for drugs had decreased so much that the dose he had previously tolerated was fatal.
He was only 31 when he died.
His death was heavy on his associates, but on the basis of his rival wife, Leah Michele, it was decided to continue the program and devote them to a full part of the memory of Moneith and Finn’s personality.
Mark Wayne Salling played the role of Noah “Puck ” Puckerman in the show, Puck was an American footballer, like Finn, and had little respect for his fellow students in the Joy Team, or all the way until he got the courage to admit that he enjoyed singing and dancing.
Two years later, Salling was arrested in his home in Los Angeles, a suspect in child pornography custody.
During his house search at his home, a huge amount of child pornography was found, and the matter soon became public.
It was obvious that Salling had done it.
As a result, he was accused and convicted of his transgressions.
Had he had four to seven years ’ imprisonment, as well as the need to keep a record of sexual offenders and seek treatment for childish greed.
Before a judge had determined the punishment, Salling, who was then released from bail, was found to be close to his home.
The cause of death was suicide.
It was not just actors who fell from a long time before age.
Jim Fuller was the assistant director of the show.
In 2013, only 41 years of age, he was put to sleep.
The show also won a woman named Nancy Motes.
She was the younger sister of the great star Julia Roberts and did not bear her sister’s beautiful story, but she accused Roberts of great control and disrespectful conduct.
Motes took her own life in 2014, but she suffered from severe depression.
She left her letter to her fiancée, where she dismissed her mother and sister, among others, as responsible for how she was treated.
“ My mother and so - called siblings get nothing from me except the memory that they caused my worst depression. ”
Lea Michel was the star of the show.
She has recently been accused of using her fellow players as a bully and assailant at the scene of the film and of having a superlative starry display.
Jesse Luke was a guest in the 2012 show.
He was arrested and charged with drunken driving in 2019, which was highly scandalous.
The actress Heather Morris played a major role in the show.
In 2010, she was exposed to the fact that immaculate computer crooks were exposed to nude pictures of her and published on the Internet.
The actors Melissa Benoist and Blake Jenner both played in the show and had an outside love affair.
Benoist later reported that Jenner used violence in her relationship.
You can put flowers on almost everything.
It increases the development of children when they are allowed to play in the garden with their parents to grow flowers and to watch them grow and thrive.
Also, as Swedish photographer Anna Kubel points out, flowers can be used forever.
Just having an appointment with the children in the park is something that will never be forgotten.
They will remember the flowers, the fragrance, and, of course, the precious time they received with their parents.
Purchased a boat after the tenth grade
"I don't think we are many sailors who work in the country's playgrounds," says Axel Eagle Gudmundsson, who is fishing on the beach during the summer, but is a psychologist at the University of Iceland during the winter."
Sea fishing is a very comfortable summer job when you are studying.
If you are a fisherman, you can make good profits, and I love being able to let go of a study loan.
The profits are also good for me in the winter," says Axel Eagle Gudmundsson, 25-year-old psychologist, who is fishing for the beach in the summer as in the past summer.
Axel was recently docked at Talknavurth when a journalist spoke to him late at the beginning of the week."
“ The waters I was in the tenth grade, I took shipboard rights for boats less than six feet [12 m] long and bought my boat in the summer after I finished elementary school.
I've been fishing on my boat all summer since.
I bought the boat used by my acquaintance, Hartmann the son of Jon, and I named the boat his name.
Hartmann had grown up when I bought the boat and stopped at sea, and he was very happy when he saw that the boat had his name.
Hartmann died a few years after I took over the boat," says Axel, adding that he bought the boat for three million.
“ I made a deal with Hartmann to pay half, one and a half million, at the beginning of the summer, but the other half at the end of the summer when I had been fishing.
So I had the boat innocent at the end of my first summer."
But how could a boy have one and a half million to pay out in a boat when he had just finished elementary school?
“ I had put in and collected money, I had been working with my father at sea when I was a boy, I was all summer fishing with him and got my share.
I also put my quadruple money in my boat fund."
Axel was born on Isafur, from where all his mother's people are, but he has lived in Copavogi since he was a boy.
“ I am allowed to fish here in the West because I have a legal home with my grandmother on Issafur.
I learned in these areas west of a row with my father.
I move between distances according to how I feel, for this fishing ground covers all the West.
Although I feel best to be westward, I have also been around Snæfellsneeze and elsewhere.
"I've also given south, but then I prefer a gray drop," says Axel, who always screams one fire early in the morning and says he sometimes talks to the seagulls and sings to the sky, in the lonely hours in the ball sea.
“ The Internet on the ocean is good, so I can call, listen to TV shows, and music.
I don't think it's a problem to be alone on a boat.
Of course, I try not to get into danger, but certainly occasionally something has been wrong with the weather, but never much danger," says Axel, who is lucky that he is never seasick.
He says that the length of the working day depends on how the fishing goes on every time.
“ I’ve never been fishing for more than 14 hours at once, but I’ve been fishing in other systems, for example in the lease, but then I’ve been fishing for a day and a half on the ocean. ”
The beach fishing arrangement says that he can catch 770 pounds [770 kg] a day, which he finds to be a hindrance.
“ Other restrictions are that I can’t catch Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays, and I can only catch twelve days a month, those four months of beach fishing, in May, June, July, and August.
In my opinion, sailors should choose their fishing days by weather and nothing else.
Instead of having 48 days throughout the summer and being able to choose by heart, this unnecessary pressure is to be calmed down.
So the division of areas could also be done for me, and the well-located sea ice cream should enjoy it," says Axel, who draws most of the cod from the salty sea on his beach fishing, but also only the ufs and some other species flow with it.
Axel works in winter with a college degree at Nupi School in Copavogi.
“I don’t think we’re many sailors who work in the country’s playgrounds,” says Axel proudly, adding that he only intended to work temporarily at the playground.
“I got stuck there because I think it’s a great job.
I hope that in the future, I will be able to benefit from my psychological education, ” says Axel, who has also gone a long way in business studies.
An error occurred while registering with the registry to prevent recommissioning.
An error in a registration form that people fill out when they come to the country resulted in a person living here in the country not being reclaimed in a sample.
A registration number is not required if the person completes the form in English, as is the case when it is made in Icelandic.
"This will be examined this week," says a geologist in the field of pediatrics.
Three domestic infections were detected in the Regional Hospital virology department yesterday.
One of those who proved positive came to the country on July 15, two days after the rules of so - called home surveillance came into force.
Those who lived in Iceland are then screened when they arrived in the country and again announced in a sample four to five days later.
On the other hand, the afternoon news of RUV showed that the person had applied the old system.
The detection on the border was negative, and it was not recalled in the screening for the virus.
Kamilla Rut Sigfusdóttir, a geologist in the field of land medicine, says in a conversation with a news agency that this may be due to an error in the electronic record sheet.
If people fill out the registration form in English, they are not required to enter a registration number as it is in the Icelandic version.
In the end, it was primarily thought of for foreign tourists.
Therefore, the individual has not received an automatic invitation to be shown.
However, Kamilla says that many people have followed home - call port regulations, although they have filled the registration form in English, and in some cases employers have also been alerted to send people back to the country after they arrived.
“This will be examined in the week to see how to make it easier for people to access this process.”
The man is in solitary confinement, and six have been infected.
They're all going on a show, but two of them were starting to show signs.
The three infections that were diagnosed yesterday are now undergoing immunization, mostly due to two infections reported on Friday.
In both cases, a sequencing of Icelandic genetic analyses has shown that there are variations of the corona virus that have not been previously detected.
In the second case, the bond has been directed to Israel, although it is known that the person who carried the virus to the country had also traveled to other European countries.
Kamilla says it should be there tomorrow from where the other virus was coming from.
A total of 15 are now isolated according to the COVID.
135 are infected.
Four out of five infections disconnected
Five domestic infections have been detected here in recent days.
Of these, four are completely unrelated and have not been identified as the source of the infection that occurred at the Rey Cup last night.
Immunization is still ongoing.
Originally, by the third century C.E., the number of sick people was reduced to sixteen.
A total of 34 people are infected because of these new infections that were diagnosed yesterday.
This is the second time in a short time that infection is detected at sporting events and has raised questions as to whether such events should take place.
John K. Jonsson, Head of Communications at the Public Security Department, says it very slowly, as long as people follow guidelines and rules.
“We are constantly being critical of all those living here who need to keep up with personal protection.
We also need to alert people to the fact that there are rules that need to be followed.
Then you can hold an event," says John.
He says that the prevention of infection can be achieved by maintaining personal protection.
In addition, the rules and criteria are subject to constant review.
“ What needs to be done, and what the Public Health Department and the National Medical Office are constantly in the process of being critical of people, is to be taken into account in these individual protections.
Both at home and also at service companies.
That people wash their hands and use alcohol.
It prevents infection from continuing," says John.
“We need to keep people on the good road trip that we were on in order to keep up with the results we have achieved so far. ”
40% of the COVID-19 victims had diabetes 2
Devon Brumfield heard on the phone how difficult her father was to breathe.
Her father had diabetes, and she encouraged him to seek medical attention.
The next day, he was dead.
Death was traced to sudden breathing difficulties due to coronary viral infection.
Diabetes mellitus was identified on the death certificate as an underlying problem, and Brumfield, who also has diabetes, is terrified that the same thing will happen.
Reuters News Force says the fear of Brumfield is not without reason.
The numbers of new studies conducted by the U.S. authorities show that less than 40% of those who have died had diabetes 2 as their underlying disease.
When the proportion of those who had not reached 65 years of age is assessed, the proportion increases to half.
A study of the U.S. Disease Control (CDC) survey included more than 10,000 people in 15 countries who died of the coronary virus during the period from February to May.
Jonathan Wortham, an expert on infectious diseases at CDC, says that the results are striking, especially for those diagnosed with diabetes 2 and their loved ones.
Reuter’s slow growth led to a survey indicating the answers of the 12 countries that corresponded to comparable proportions.
10 countries, including California, Arizona, and Colombia, are not yet reporting underlying diseases.
“Sickness was already an epidemic of slow growth.
Now the COVID-19 has broken through like a powerful age," says Reuters, director of the Center for Chronic Disease Research and Policy at the University of Chicago, Elbert Huang.
Diabetes mellitus is more common among blacks and South American people, who have also progressed worse from the coronary virus.
One of the best protections for those with diabetes 2 is to control the disease with exercise, diet and health care professionals.
The coronary viral epidemic, on the other hand, has made it difficult for many to keep a routine.
In this way, high prices of insulin have forced some to keep on coming to work and thus risk being exposed to the virus.
Reuters points out that U.S. authorities may have been aware of the potential risks of the virus for those with diabetes 2.
By the year 2003, more than 20% of SARS had the disease, and in the 2009 swine flu epidemic, this group was three times more likely to have to be hospitalised.
When MERS did so in 2012, one study showed that 60% of those who died or were hospitalized had diabetes.
Charles S. Dela Cruz, a Yale University scientist, says that because of the effect of the COVID-19 virus, the epidemic could have removed the cover from many previously unknown complications.
“ I’m afraid we’ll see a tidal wave of problems when it’s over, ” says Andrew Bolton, president of the International Association of Diabetes.
Physicians have warned that the coronary viral epidemic may indirectly lead to an increase in diabetic complications, including kidney disease and renal dialysis.
Similarly, new studies suggest that the coronary virus may lead to an increase in the incidence of diabetes.
Reuters says scientists are trying to understand the relationship between the coronary virus and diabetes 2.
The virus attacks the heart, lungs and kidneys, organs that are already weak in many people with diabetes.
In this way, a high ratio of glucose and lipid in diabetics can produce a true “cell - signalling storm, ” as it is called when the immune system reacts too hard and attacks the body.
Damaged endothelial cells can also lead to inflammation, which in turn can cause fatal blood clots.
"It's all one big puzzle game," says Dela Cruz.
"It's all connected to each other."
The story has been corrected.
"We were invited to champagne, so they left the room"
The couple Ásrún Magnúsdóttir and Atli Bollason made the unusual request from the artist Ragnar Kjartansson to have sex in front of a camera for a job the artist was installing in Paris.
"We loved each other so it wasn't complicated."
Atli Bollason never forgets when he first met his wife and midwife, Ásruna Magnus daughter.
“ She impressed me very much.
Of course, it was just the radiation, but so did I.
And still feeling sorry," he says.
Ásrún remembers this, too, because the husband regularly reminisces the first encounter.
“I’m always hearing this story.
Last weekend alone," she says, who was also attracted to the husband at first encounter.
“I found and feel so much excitement around Atla, whom I like.
There's a lot going on and a lot going on and I was fascinated by it."
Atli says that their husband and wife have stressed the need to go their own way.
“We don’t tie our backs to the same knots as fellow travelers.
We avoid routines around us."
Perhaps that is why they took the message from the artist Ragnar Kjartansson, even though it would be most unusual to say so.
"Christine Anna, our common friend, contacted us and asked if we could come and eat dessert with her, Ragga and Ingibjörgu Ragnar's wife, at Snaps."
They accepted the invitation, found the cane on Snaps, and had dessert wine and their dessert.
They listened to Ragnar, who led them through his plans to perform a work of art that he intended to set up in the Palais de Tokyo, Paris, during the fall.
“He had a multifaceted videotape called Scenes from Western Culture.
He described it in a simple way."
Ásrún says that he described the work as a banal and a decade later from the everyday lives of Westerners.
“He had sketches of all the scenes he was going to shoot and last time he told us what he wanted to know if we were interested in participating in. ”
The senan that Ragnar asked the couple to participate in was to show a young middle class couple to love in a minimalist room.
"It's dating from the beginning and the end," says Atli.
The couple did not know much about Ragnar even though they knew about him and he knew about him “but they knew us and found us fit into this.
They said that they did not want to advertise people.
They may have thought that they would not get the right people, but people who would get sexual abuse from performing for others."
They said goodbye to Ragnar and agreed to think about it, but it did not take long.
“When we walked out of Snaps, we said, ‘ Are we not just ready for this? ’
It was just like that.
I trust Ragnar as an artist and his entire team," says Ásrún and Atli.
"This is about love and closeness"
Senan was admitted to a fine apartment on the Myrtle Street.
There was a very small film studio; a cameraman, Ragnar, and a musician, and the couple.
After the recording had been turned on, everyone left the room to wait in a car except Atli and Ásrún.
“ We hadn’t decided what we should be like.
We received some guidance, but we tried to forget the time and place.
To be unaware of what we were doing and who we were doing for.
There was nothing played, we just loved each other so it wasn't complicated," said Ásrún.
But was it romantic?
"Yes, it was a bit romantic," says Atli and Ásrún.
“ We were invited to champagne before they left the room.
It was a little like being on vacation in a nice hotel in Paris."
The team was happy with the couple’s performance in the work that moved them.
“When Tommi’s cameraman looked at this, he cried, he thought it was so beautiful, ” says Atli.
“This is as much about love as it is about closeness as it is about relationships,” says Ásrún.
The couple’s parents saw the work and told Atli that his mother had heard the voice in the son of Reykjavik’s Art Gallery and then realized that he was part of the work.
"Then she turns around and starts to think about it," says Atli.
“ Mom and Dad saw this in Paris.
We hadn't told anyone this way, but then Dad just sent me a message and said, "It's nice to meet the little family in Palais de Tokyo," Ásrún recalls.
And I wonder if the participation in the work deepened the relationship between Ásru and Atla.
“ At least we’re still together, so maybe it got deeper.
This at least deepened my relationship with the in-law family," says Ásrún and laughs.
Ásrun saw for himself the work in Copenhagen with his colleague.
“I found it a little difficult not to be with you but someone else,” she says, turning to her husband.
“But it was nice to see this because it’s just one sentence in a much bigger job, and when you saw it with the other effects, it’s really cool.
I was able to tear myself apart a little and was just proud.
And there was the little bean in my stomach," says Ásrún, who was pregnant by one of the couple's children when the tendon was picked up.
"It was just beautiful."
Anna Marsibil Clausen spoke to Ásruna and Atla in the Love Stories of the Channel 1.
Swansea with victory in the first playoffs
Swansea won a 1-0 victory at Brentford in a dramatic game.
This was the first game of the team in the first round of the game of getting into the English elite.
The game took place in the home of Swansea, Wales.
Half the score was 0-0.
The locals in Swansea got a hell of a minute in 64, but Andre Ayew broke the bogie of the white spot and got himself defended.
Just two minutes later, Rico Henry, player Brentford, got the red card.
So Brentford played the rest of the game less, and in 82 minutes, Swansea’s players took advantage of the difference.
Andre Ayew improved their whiskers by winning a great goal and won Swansea 1–0.
So Swansea leads 1–0 in the final, but the second game takes place next Wednesday in the home of Brentford.
Sentinel-free for five years from 2009
Jeffrey Gunter Ross, the U.S. ambassador for Iceland, is in the spotlight of the media after CBS announced this morning that he wanted an armed bodyguard who feared for his life.
However, it has not been easy for the president of the United States to appoint an ambassador here.
Since Carol Van Voorst’s resignation from the U.S. Secretary at the end of April 2009, there have been no ambassadors in the country for 62 months, more than five years.
Van Voorst resigned under special circumstances, but Kastløs reported in 2009 that she should have received the False Words.
On her way to a farewell meeting with the president of Iceland, she received a call from the president’s office saying that she would not be honored.
After leaving Iceland, she taught international relations with Army War College.
Sixteen months passed until Van Voorst’s successor came to work, in September 2010.
Some reason is that Robert S. Connan had been appointed as an ambassador, but then he resigned.
Finally, Loius Ariega had served in the foreign service for decades.
He then resigned in the fall of 2013 and took up the position of ambassador in Guatemala.
Then another missionary - free period took place.
Robert Barber was approved by the U.S. Congress in January 2015 and served shortly thereafter, but then no ambassador had been there for 13 months.
Barber was politically appointed, not a diplomat, but had served as a lawyer and supported Barack Obama’s electoral fund.
He left office as soon as Donald Trump took over the President’s office, January 20, 2017, as usual with a politically appointed ambassador.
Trump’s board was unusually long to appoint both ambassadors and senior officials in the Washington administration.
So it took two years for the United States Congress to announce Jeffrey Ross Gunter’s meeting to ask him questions and confirm that he was an ambassador in Iceland.
In his testimony in Congress, he said he never came to Iceland but often to Western Europe, but his wife, who has died, had been broken by a Dutch mountain.
Gunter, a former California dermatologist, was a prominent member of the Republican Jewish Coalition of the Republican Republican Party.
The casino owner Sheldon Adelson founded them, but Adelson is an enthusiastic supporter of Donald Trump.
Gunter came to work in Iceland in May 2019, but then no ambassador had been in the country since early 2017, for two years and four months, which is the longest example of this country.
The reason is both how long Trump’s government was to appoint key officials, and that in recent years the work of the U.S. Congress has been very slow, including the confirmation of ambassadors in office.
Since 2009, therefore, the total number of ambassadors in Iceland has been out of office for more than five years.
However, this has not prevented the operations of the embassy that opened a recent headquarters at Engetteig.
The executions are estimated to have cost about 6.5 billion, but knee - thick security walls surround the building and bulletproof glass is in all windows.
However, it does not seem to have enough to fill the present ambassador’s sense of security because he is said to fear for his life and has wished for an armed bodyguard.
Former player IBV had racism in Iceland - "It was a mistake to come to Iceland"
Tonny Mawejje, former player IBV, says that he was a racist when he was in Iceland and that he regrets coming to the country.
This is shown in an interview with Tonny, which appears on the Ugandan Daily Monitor.
Tonny recently joined the Uganda Police FC team that played in Uganda’s top division.
In the interview with Daily Monitor, Tonny talks about many things, including his time here on land, but he played with IBV, Val and Throtti in Iceland.
“ When I came to Iceland, I didn’t play in the middle like I used to.
The captain of the team was in that position, but in addition he also had the jersey number I wanted so I didn't get any of what I wanted," said Tonny, playing on the right side of the season with IBV.
Among the things Tonny talks about is a racism he suffered in Iceland.
He says this is a problem that many black players face when playing in Europe.
“ This happened to me once, but since I didn’t understand the language, I just ignored what was said to me.
Later, I heard about the matter, and then I asked my friend what it was all about.
And he told me, that my adversary made me fall by the words of a rascal saying, after I smote him.
In 2014, Tonny went from Iceland to Norway, where he joined Haugesund.
There he claims to have made the mistakes he sees most.
Tonny had not managed to join the Haugesund initial team, but he wanted to play more to join the national team.
Then he asked to go back to Iceland on loan, but he joined Val.
“ It was a mistake to come back to Iceland for a loan.
I think that if I had been in Norway longer then I would have had the opportunity that I wanted," said Tonny but he hoped that if he would play well in Norway he would probably get further.
He wants to say that the loan to Iceland ended his dreams of getting on the big team in Europe.
Find a worm in the neck of a woman
Doctors at St. Luke's International Hospital in Tokyo found an eight-inch black worm in a woman's neck who was looking for it.
Doctors were able to pull the worm out by pliers.
A study revealed that parasites were involved.
CNN reports.
A few days earlier, the woman had eaten sashimi, which is a thin slice of meat.
The woman recovered quickly after the worm was removed, but parasites such as these are often in raw meat or fish.
According to CNN, after sushi went to bed in the West, there have been cases where parasites have spread to people.
Fear of another wave starting in Europe
Spain is now on the verge of worrying about the second wave of the coronary virus in Europe, where governments have taken action to halt the spread of the coronary virus epidemic.
In Catalonia all the entertainment has been put on ice for two weeks, but there are more cities than Barcelona where infection is increasing.
Other European countries have also taken measures to increase the spread of infection in Spain, but in the UK, everyone has to go on a case-by-case basis at the time of their return from Spain, as in Norway, and France has been warned against travelling to Spain.
In France and Germany, infectious diseases are also increasing again, as governments are trying to find a balance between suppressing the spread of the virus and re-establishing the economy.
The situation in Europe, however, is good in other parts of the world, but the incidence of global infections is approaching 300 000 a day, which is where most of the infections in America and South Asia are found.
According to John Hopkins University, 16 million people worldwide have confirmed confirmed that the virus is associated with a death of 644 thousand.
At Last, Moses ’ works will be enjoyed to the full
In front of the customs office in Reykjavík, there is a large and deep hole.
There's an orange helmet on top of it.
There's a big tomb there, too.
And more of my work machines.
The street is closed for traffic.
But the sidewalk is good, and there many now stop and respect the works of art of millions of mosaics — as they have never seen before.
Maybe they've never seen it before.
At least it didn't pay any attention.
The work has thus far been hidden, directly in front of a parking lot that was always occupied.
People parked there, locked the car in a hurry, and then jumped to do their chores in the city center.
'Live and diverse public spaces' and 'attractive urban areas' guide the reconstruction of the current Security Street.
The goal is to enhance the beauty of the area and to enhance the vision of the Holy Daughter of Moses at the customs office.
In front of the job, there will be squares, and since the area is well located at the sun, it is considered suitable as a residential area for passersby.
The work of art will be illuminated, and the material wood will now enjoy itself better than it did before on this 142 - square - foot [142 sq m] surface.
In the area, there will also be small “mist sprayers, ” some water sculptures that offer a game and give the area a certain mystery.
In this way the refunds are described by the city of Reykjavik, which is in operation together with the Witnesses.
A stream of water, heat, and electricity will be reclaimed.
Many of them have reached their age, but the schoolwork and the cold - water system dates back to 1925 and have served residents and businesses in the city center for almost a century.
Once the street is reopened after completion, cars can drive it back.
However, it will become a one - way street and, at the same time, a calmer and more accessible space will be created.
According to a study of the Customs Office’s website, the house was used in 1971, whose architect was Gísli Halldorsson.
Because of the damage to the harbor, 250 square feet [250 sq m] of windowless walls were formed to the street.
The Building Committee and the architect agreed that such surfaces would have a bad effect on the overall picture, unless special arrangements were made to decorate the appearance of the house.
Thus, parties agreed to calculate by having a permanent work of art put in place there.
At that time, a great deal of words came from the artist, Her Majesty’s daughter.
Had she worked hard on mosaics in Germany and elsewhere?
It was decided to contact her first before deciding whether a competition for the work would take place.
It had often been discussed that the work would have to reflect life at the port, since the port had been a lifeline of the Reykjavik since it was built.
When talking to the artist, she became enthralled with such a work.
Agreed that she would receive plans and other assistance before she left the country, since she would work with the suggestions abroad.
Gerdur was given the time she needed, and when she returned, she made some suggestions for discussion.
It was agreed without delay to ask her to do the job.
It was also requested to make an overall agreement with her and the famous art company in Germany, the Brothers Oidtmann, but Gerður had long worked with them to set up famous works of art in many parts of Europe.
Contracts were completed, and Gerdur worked on the work of art during the installation of the workshop of the brothers, who then arranged for the installation at the customs office.
The entire work was outstandingly well accomplished, both by the Daughter of Saints and by the Brothers of Oidt, says the summary.
Since then, it has been able to withstand harsh Icelandic weather.
It took him about two years to do the work that was done and set up in 1972 and 1973.
The artist died two years after the customs work was completed, only 47 years old.
Preparing to move more institutions abroad
Ausmundur Einar Dadason, Minister of Social Affairs, announces that more public institutions will be transferred to land in the near future.
This was said by a minister on the Explosive on the Wave at noon.
Recently, it has been reported that the fire department of the Institute of Public Works will be moved to the north in the autumn.
Six fire experts work at the Agency, none of whom are expected to follow the Northern Institute and have been critically critical of the migration of residents by the Fire Department and medical personnel.
“I think we should take further steps in this being.
I'm preparing further steps in this creature.
"More transport," said Ásmundur.
He says he is convinced that the vast majority of the nation wants to see a greater distribution of public institutions throughout the country.
"I think it is necessary to make further political decisions on the transfer of public services to a country, as I was doing with the Institute for Housing and Human Resources," said Ásmundur, but he also took examples of other institutions that have been transferred to a country and were of great importance to communities abroad, such as the transfer of food agencies to Selfoss, Iceland's surveyors to Akraness and the unemployment insurance companies on Skaga Strand.
All the most from the second day of the Master’s Meeting
94. Iceland’s World Championship on Free Sports ended today at Thorsvelli, Akureyri.
A few matches were held on the second day of the race.
It was estimated that there was an exciting competition in a women’s sluggish match at Thorsvell, while Vigdís Jonsdóttir from FH put Icelandsmet in a sluggish match in 2014, which lasted until Elizabeth Rut Rúnarsdóttir from IR added the estimate in May last year.
Vigdís won Iceland’s record back earlier this summer and has been in a fancier form until late, but she has tripled Iceland’s summer score.
Elizabeth Ruth has been coping with injury and has not been able to cope with it today.
She had only one valid strike of five, she threw five feet [25.69 m], which is far from her best.
Vigdís threw the greatest number of people today, or 200 feet [60.08 m] in her last attempt, setting a standard.
Her Icelandic record she put earlier in July is 62.69 meters and so she was a bit off.
Guðrun Karitas Hallgrímsdóttir of the IR had the second best strike of the day, but she improved her best success by throwing at 50.18 meters [18 m].
In a male group, Hilmar Örn Jonsson, Iceland's record holder, won a secure victory, but he threw 73.84 meters in his next strike and set a counter-measure.
His Icelandic record in this article is 75.26 meters.
The god Valur Guðnason, the Olympics and the Icelandic Championships in the round, won a competition in a bowling alley at Thorsvell yesterday, but today he competed in a roundabout, which is his main section.
Íslandsmet Guðna Vals is 65.53 meters, but he threw the longest 59.13 meters today and won the victory.
Valdimar Hjälti’s son, Erlendsson, threw the second longest of his life today, with one valid second - seat strike, 46.43 metres [49.43 m].
Hafdís Victory Daughter, Iceland’s long-term champion, won the long-term match with excellence, but Hafdís jumped a maximum of six feet today, which is barely 40 cm from her Icelandic record.
In the 200-metre run of women, it was the IR Gudbjörg Jona Bjarnadddóttir who was the fastest but she scored 24.04 seconds, but her Icelandic record in the article is 23.45 seconds.
Godbjörg Jonah was victorious in Akureyri, who won two gold medals yesterday, in 100 yards [100 m] of running, and in 4 x 100 meters [100 m] of running, and then in 4 x 400 meters [400 m] of running today.
In a male group, Kolbeinn Höder Gunnarsson from FH was the first to score in the 200 - meter race in 21.57 seconds, 0.3 seconds before the son of Oliver Mona Samuel from the Year.
Like Godbjörg Jonah, Kolbeinn Höder won gold in 100 meters yesterday as well as in the 400 meters race.
Don't get a ticket for a $17 million bitcoin crop.
An overtax committee has rejected the requirement of a tax investigator who demanded a fine on a person for underpayment of his financial resources that had been paid for the sale of the electricity coin Bitcoin.
The committee concludes that the director of the tax investigation had failed to provide clear reasons for the need to fine the man.
The Committee’s ruling states that the Director of Tax Investigation considered that the person was able to understand materially incorrect tax advances for the financial years 2016 and 2017.
He would have misjudged his financial resources that would have been made available for the sale of the coin Bitcoin to 27 million, either on purpose or with great carelessness.
The man is guilty of his conduct.
So the man refused in a letter to the committee.
He did, however, agree that in 2016 he sold an electric coin for 27 million.
It would have been obtained with a grave between 2009 and 2010 when it would have been both easy and expensive with a normal home computer.
He then pointed out that when he sold the electric coins, tax revenue from such sales was very vague and unpredictable.
It could hardly have been expected that ordinary citizens would have realized such arrangements on a tax basis.
He would not have avoided paying a tax on the harvest and would have recognized his property in the future as the basis for a tax bill.
He would have asked both experts and government administrators how this was done but failed.
Then he thought he would have to take into account that he was neither born nor raised in Iceland and had only lived here for a few years when he began digging for Bitcoin.
So he would have been in a worse position than others to study complex rules that the tax authorities would not have made clear.
So the man thought it right that his taxes for these two years of income would be revalued and pressured, but otherwise no punishment would be made.
Then he repeated that he worked in Iceland and had paid taxes here on land since 2012.
He had never intended to escape his duties improperly.
The requirement for a fine would be out of proportion and would throw it into debt.
“ This man understands what football is, ” says the Iron Fairy.
Andersen Willumsson's Bryan Fairy has been quite apart from people's teeth, but he has also been impressed by what's left of his playtime in the Pepsi Max Division.
Candles will be on the fire line tonight when they receive the IA on live broadcast at Channel 2 Sport.
Brynjölf then takes out a ban because of four reminders at the time of the game and therefore does not show up for a game with a new clipping, as in the summer games so far.
He had written "Bla, blah, blah" on his head for the game at HK last Thursday, which HK won 1–0.
“ I don’t know exactly who he was answering, but speaking of character, this one was trying to do the game.
He didn't hide.
He wants the ball for every single time and if there was anyone going to equal this game, I thought he would do it or make it," said Gudmundur Benediktsson in Pepsi Max's booth, when it came to Brynjölf.
"I'm supposed to be here for the people."
“ It’s hard at times to figure out where he is.
He looks a little out the left when it starts to pass on the games, but he has a very free roll in the team," said Hjörvar Hafländason.
Thorkell Mona Petersson says Brynjölf is a real entertainer and rejoices to have such a colorful man in the department: “No one disputes that this is a character.
This is a fun type and I love this with my hair, and being always ready to come and answer in interviews.
There's an incredible amount of people busy with him who tell me that this man understands what football is.
“I’m an entertainer.
I'm supposed to be here for the people and enjoy it."
The people are reading the interviews with Brynjölf, people are paying in and watching what is next on his hair.
This man is just a genius," said Moni.
KR player says he wants to leave the club - "I've been in contact with a few teams in the B-department"
Tobias Thomsen, KR player in Pepsi Max Division, seems to be leaving the team.
According to the Danish medium Bold, Tobias is ready to return to Denmark.
Soccer.net also reported the case.
Tobias wants to get the start of the period in his home country, but to do so, he first has to terminate his contract with the KR, where the Danish branch begins before the Icelandic probability starts.
The company knows that I miss Denmark and have shown me a great deal of understanding," said Tobias in a conversation with Bold.
“I’ve been in contact with a few teams in the B division and will probably change before the end of the Icelandic period.
There are not many teams in Denmark who can afford to pay for my contract with KR."
Then he says that he is likely to have to take on a reduction in wages in Denmark.
"A society in Denmark has probably felt more about the economic impact of the virus than in Iceland."
Wheelwright Bjartmar has recovered a wheel for millions - Answers now for himself after coverage of DV
For over a year, Bjartmar Leosson has had interests unlike most others.
He smells up and saves lost and stolen bicycles, electric bicycles, and wallets.
As a result, Bjartmar has won the name “the Wheel Wobbler. ”
Yesterday, there was a great deal of fuss when you published an account of your dealings with Bjjartmar.
Then DV referred them to a discussion on the Facebook group of Western cities, where it was stated that Bjartmar had taken the man to the east and said that his wasps might be stolen.
There was no other way to read from the electrician’s original writings than that Bjartmar had stolen it.
The text has now been changed on Facebook and the title of the original DV news release has been updated accordingly.
Bjartmar’s initial news of the case does not at all describe what really happened yesterday in the East.
Bjartmar said that he had been informed by an electrician that these were really his electric fans.
The information was given to the accused owner by others, but the information was wrong, says Bjartmar.
“ I looked after the guy, and I knew about the shuttle, with information that it was an electric shuttle that had been missing for a long time and was looking for.
I certainly hesitated first, but when I saw him preparing to drive on the shuttle, I decided to talk to the man.
The owner was certain of his fault, so I decided to have a conversation with the man.
In general, I do very well in such a case, but before I got to finish what I had to say, the man had taken off me."
Bjartmar says that the man in the box immediately invited him to show him the receipt for the bike and called the police themselves.
"Yes, great," said Bjartmar, "let's just get this straight."
Then the owner of the electric car proved ownership of his electric car and set off.
Later, as reported in the previous report, the owner of the electric box told his story on Facebook.
In this more than a year that Bjartmar has been engaged in this practice, he says that he can count the exchanges he encountered against people on one hand.
“ I’ve been in a peaceful relationship with the most difficult men of Reykjavik, ” said Bjartmar, pointing out that bicycle thieves are by far the smallest brothers and sisters in the community, addicts, psychopaths, and other people on the street for some reason.
“Drugs are hard on masters, and somehow the next dose has to be financed, because, unfortunately, theft of such loose irons is an easy way to achieve that goal, ” says Bjartmar.
“ My relationship with these people is really so good that I have come along with many of the good people.
For example, people went to treatment and then went to see me and helped me with what I'm doing," he says.
Generally speaking, Bjartmar’s dealings with bicycles are polite.
Some know about him and what he is doing and offer peacefully to show him receipts, bicycles, and so forth.
Theft of bicycles is a major problem that has not been discussed.
In addition, Bjartmar says that the police are even pointing out that they are talking to him about stolen bicycles.
Brights disagree with previous news transmissions of DV and do not claim to be any self - appointed police in a personal search for justice.
Asked if he is still not on the ice with his actions, and if this is not primarily a police role, says Bjartmar so certainly.
“Of course the police should do this, but the fact is that the police are simply not doing this.
I have to photograph policemen driving away from a large pile of stolen wheels.
It is plainly unspeakable in these matters."
“When the cops aren’t doing anything about this, and this is just in front of your nose, and the experience has shown that I can make a success of this class, then why not?” asks Bjartmar.
He says that he has achieved so much success in riding stolen bicycles that sometimes he encounters his “rokers ” on the street that they have only just the Brighter bikes they had previously recovered.
The changes Bjartmar has been calling for police assistance have caused her simply not to show up.
“It’s just not working with the police, and it’s not my fault, and it’s not the owner of the bicycles to blame,” said Bjartmar, and I’m sorry that victims of bicycle theft have to suffer from an empty police force in this class.
The results of Bjartmar are not divided.
Many stories of people can be found thanks to Bjartmar for having recovered their belongings to them.
According to Bjartmar himself, the number of bicycles he has returned has long been lost, but the amounts are likely to run for millions, if not tens of millions.
Weighing electricity chips, electric wheels, and electric scooters, but electric bicycles can cost up to half a million.
Brighter works in the daytime at a play school, and every other weekend he works in a community.
So his bicycle search is unrewarded work that he does in his spare time.
Life insurance funds and long shadows
The year 2019 was a big birthday year in the history of pension funds in Iceland.
True, officials had been remunerated from all the streets of Denmark since the 19th century, but in 1919 an official’s retirement fund was established, which eventually led to the retirement of all public employees.
The foundation of the current living quarters of general wage earners was then laid with a total of core contracts on the labour market in 1969, which saw job - related pension funds with compulsory membership and full - time fundraising since the beginning of 1970.
Then, in 1974, laws were passed on the basis of these contracts, and the retirement system continued to grow thereafter.
The payroll system was not the only radical change that the 20th - century labor movement pushed forward with its core struggle.
In 1955, unemployment insurance had similarly been awarded in historic workshops, and the organization was gradually faced with its demands for health and medical benefits, substantial leave rights, cutbacks in working hours, housing improvements, and much more.
All of these rights cost a great and severe struggle, but they were, after thinking, far greater and more lasting prizes than the increase in the wages bill, which vanished as hard in the face of inflation as the postwar period and until 1990 as many remember.
In 1969, the applicant for the creation of a general pension fund was both long and complicated.
Although the funds would eventually be the property of a fundmate, the labor movement had to agree that their governments would appoint representatives of employees and fundmates alike.
In the next few years after the fund was set up, the majority of workers in the fund’s management were often discussed in the union of wage earners, but it was never achieved, so we still have the abnormal arrangement that representatives of funders are not in the majority of the fund’s governments.
The 36th article of Law No 129/1997 on the compulsory insurance of life insurance and the operation of life insurance funds discusses the investment policy of the funds.
It says in its 1st issue that “a life’s pension fund should guide the interests of fundmates. ”
The 5th edition also states: “The life - insurance fund should set moral standards in investments. ”
The share policy of the Food and Agriculture Fund includes the following provisions, followed by the above-mentioned legal provisions:
The LIFE Fund is in line with the United Nations (UN PRI) rules on responsible investments, along with many of the largest living and professional funds in the West Sea and in Europe.
The rules deal with how the emphasis on environmental and social issues as well as good governance can contribute to improved investment performance in the portfolio.
In this way, the interests of the investors and the goals of society are brought together in a broader context.
LV considers it important that companies, in particular those registered on the stock market, adopt a public policy: to maintain good governance and social and environmental responsibility.
The Gildi Life Fund, which has the largest funds in the country, has set itself a "policy of responsible investment" and there are similar provisions.
This is all reflected here as an introduction to the latest fashion word of Icelandic, “shadow control. ”
Since it is new to the case, the hope is not that it has been defined in full, but I now see the following definition as being “most taken”: Shadow management is when a trade union leader says in the media that he is going to send recommendations or instructions on how to take a position in a particular case to the representatives of the society under the management of the pension fund.
If they do not heed the recommendations, they will be removed from the government at their first opportunity.
If the leader does not take this to the press and does not talk about dismissal, it is not a "shadow control" because of the fact that there is always communication between people in the financial world, as elsewhere.
I leave the reader to reflect on how he feels “more shady. ”
In particular, there are two people who have tried to form this definition when it is written, on Saturday, July 25, 2020.
This is the Hardy son of Iongi, a journalist in the Newspaper, and Ásgeir the son of Jon, a banker.
The reason for both arose after Bogi Nils Bogason, president of Icelandair, had announced his intention to terminate the company’s agreements with flight attendants (speak them out), and Ragnar Thor Ingólfsson, president of the Reykjavik Trade Association, sent them recommendations to the representative of the Society’s Lifelong Shopping Fund to support no possible purchase of the stock of shares in the company, or they might be set aside.
Some time later, Bogi Nils reversed his decision, and then Ragnar Thor made the same recommendation, which, of course, was based on the decision of Boga.
Nevertheless, they saw Hard and Ásgeir reason to discuss the matter in Friday’s Newspaper with great words about shadow - control, law - enforcement, and the need for legal changes.
There, a little pigeon would certainly wonder about a heavy load, even though the blessing on you had been in the process of being connected and was quickly wiped out.
Since the matter is important, let us consider the matter itself at the end.
I explained the points in the Life Insurance Act that are submitted to this case.
These include fund management, which is to safeguard the interests of fundholders and have moral standards in investments, and these are elaborated in the agreement of both Gildis and the Life Council of merchants, as I mentioned.
Life insurance funds, on the other hand, should NOT look solely at short - term profit losses in their investments.
Such a course would be very dangerous, and it would not be long to look for examples of this in the past, as large loans from banks and funds have led to immoral adventurers and environmental waste, with disastrous consequences.
Clearly, the president of Icelandair was on the heels of ice when he thought of wiping out a whole group of employees, thus greatly reducing the goodwill enjoyed by the company in the Icelandic market and weakening its position with regard to investors.
Happily, he saw and drew back.
Time shows whether it is sufficient to ensure that the investment of a life insurance fund in the company can be held accountable to the fundmates at the time.

One of the infected did not have a homecoming method
One of the three people who were diagnosed with Covid-19 in the country yesterday came to the land from the Baltic Sea on July 15, last year, about a week and a half ago.
He is an Icelandic resident who does not live here regularly, so he did not receive clear instructions to exercise so - called home vigilance after arriving in the country and take another show a few days after arrival.
He received negative results from screening at the border.
"But he's in an Icelandic community, and he's really going to do it," says Kamilla Josepsdóttir, an expert in the field of disease control at Land doctor's and the surrogate physician during his summer vacation, in conversation with the Newspaper today.
"He used the English registration form and there is no obligation to record the identification number and if the identification number is not recorded you are not automatically announced in the second view."
She says that the man could have used the English registration form because he is actually a foreigner but because of his connection with the country as an Icelandicer he should have used it rather.
But he didn't realize.
“When the ID number is not recorded, you need to look for yourself in the second sample.
Neither he nor his employer seems to have realized that this is the right way," says Kamilla.
“ So it is clear that we need to increase the information about this while we find some way to make an automatic preaching system even though the Icelandics do not record their indexes.
Or to make it somehow clearer who are participants in the Icelandic community in the registration system," she explains.
Fortunately, though, few of those who come to the country are associated, even though they are defined as participants in an Icelandic society, a local Icelandic citizen.
Only six of them were sent to the hospital after he was diagnosed yesterday, and all six of them were in contact with him.
They're going to have a sample, but two of them are starting to show the symptoms of Covid-19 infection.
The man was adversely affected by his demonstration at the border on July 15.
Kamilla probably says that he was recently infected with the virus that she could not yet be identified with it when the sample was taken at the border.
However, she does not want to rule out man’s being infected here in Iceland but not carrying the virus to the country.
“ It is not quite possible to claim that this is definitely an imported infection because it has been a long time since he came to the country that he could have been exposed here like these two who have led a little control in connection with the sports gatherings. ”
It says that it is very unlikely, though, because of the few people involved.
“It’s really unlikely,” says Kamilla, but says that it cannot be excluded until the Icelandic genetic analysis has sorted out the virus in the human being.
“If we get a virus type that hasn’t been seen here before, it’s almost certain he carried it to the country.”
Pepper spray and bombs directed against Protestants
There was a conflict between the police and Protestants in Seattle last night.
The police used pepper spray and nonlethal hand bombs, but protestors broke their windows and set fire to fire.
45 protesters were arrested, and 21 police officers were injured.
Police violence and racial prejudice were protested in many parts of the United States last night, but protests in Seattle supported Protestants in Portland, Oregon.
In Austin, Texas, one of the protesters was shot to death.
As per the BBC, the attacker has been arrested.
In Seattle, thousands met in peaceful protests.
A group then set fire to a building site and broke a window in the city’s courthouse.
Subsequently, the police said the protests were unhealthy, and a conflict arose between Protestant and police groups.
To demand justice in Aurora, Colorado, Elijah McClain, a 23 - year - old black man murdered by police last August, was remembered by Protestants.
A car drove through a group of Protestants in the city, but no one was injured.
In Louisville, Kentucky, hundreds of Black National Guards met and demanded justice for Breonna Taylor, a 26 - year - old black woman murdered by police in her home last March.
The group carried guns and went to a closed street assembly, where the police employed the group of protestors who also carried guns.
At that time, 75 were arrested in Omaha, Nebraska, where Protestants remembered James Scurlock, a 22 - year - old black man murdered by a white barigan in May.
Solstice: Not the game that defines our season
Ole Gunnar Solskjær, soccer director of Manchester United, does not want to overreact to the importance of the game at Leicester today in the final round of the English elite.
If United loses the game, and Chelsea does not lose against Wolves, end of the Sunskir and his men in fifth place and thereby lose the Master's seat.
However, they should still hope to get to the Master’s Office by winning the European Union next month.
“We’re not at the end of the line.
If we make a move against Leicester, I think people will say that we haven't had a bad time now," said Solskjær.
“Whatever happens, this is not the end of our journey, because we still have a lot of land to catch the two teams above us,” said Solskjær.
Clearly, the nerves of people will be dangling at 3 p.m. today, but Solskjær tried to pretend that each other game was involved.
“ If you want to be in Manchester United, you have to get used to being under pressure in the last game of the season.
It's nothing new, and it's what this society is all about.
We've made a great opportunity to end the season well and now it's ours to take advantage of it," said Solskjær.
“This is not the most important game of the season, it’s just the next game.
You can ask anyone in the football game, the next game is always the most important.
The results do not define our time period, we have already had many hours to define this time period."
“ Bruno Fernandes’ arrival changed a lot for us, and I think we are in a better shape and much stronger spiritually than in the last period,” said Solskjær.
65,000 infections per day
According to John Hopkins University, 65,490 new coronary virus infections were detected in the United States yesterday.
A total of 4,178,021 infections have been confirmed from the beginning of the epidemic in that country.
900 died from the virus yesterday, while the last four days before death from the virus was more than 1,000 per day.
A total of 146,460 viral deaths have been confirmed in the United States.
According to a prediction by the U.S. Federal Agency for Disease Control, the number of deaths caused by the virus will be 175,000 on August 15, next.
Fear of the Second Wave of the Epidemic
Spain’s government is now trying to halt the expansion of COVID-19 in the country.
The Spanish Health Authority reported over 920 new cases of COVID-19, both on Thursday and Friday.
There have been no more reports in one day since the beginning of May and the reports are coming at the same time that the Spanish are beginning to unblock one of the most severe exit bans in Europe.
This setback led the British authorities to call on passengers from Spain to enter the country on their return.
A week earlier, Spain was on the British list of safe states.
The situation is worse in Catalonia, northeastern Spain, where governments have reached wider limits to try to match growth.
In the capital of Barselona, entertainment venues will be closed for the next two weeks, and wavehouses will be closed for midnight.
There is now an exit ban for 200 thousand people in Segria County in western Catalonia.
It is believed that the British decision will have a negative effect on the Spanish economy, which is very angry at the arrival of foreign tourists and is badly affected by the epidemic.
Tui, Britain’s largest travel office, cancelled all scheduled flights to Spain and the Canary Islands today.
Governments around the world are said to be preparing for the second wave of the epidemic, but there seems to be little interest in reversing a massive ban on the exit that has devastated the economy.
For example, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has taken such things very badly, like a nuclear weapon that he does not want to use.
Then Jean Castex, French prime minister, said that the nation “would not survive, economically or socially, ” if another ban was imposed on the way out.
Many councillors hope that local resources that will reach the inhabitants of individual cities, cities, or areas will suffice to keep the virus back in the next round.
Five New Infections in Iceland - Three Domestic
Three domestic infections were detected yesterday and two more were detected at the border.
Thus, five individuals with a positive Covid-19 infection were diagnosed yesterday in Iceland.
In the public safety report, one infection is related to the infection reported yesterday at the ReyCUP football convention.
Has he been sent into solitary confinement and sixteen who were in close association with him in a case of sickness?
The infected person was a member of a sports club in Reykjavik and, according to the report, is “only a part of the sports team ” in the affected area.
Others who were sent for disease have a different relationship with man.
The source of this infection is undetected and infectious in the hands of a federal police officer.
The ReyCUP convention coordinators have followed the guidelines and rules of the current anti-diarrhoeal and public safety authorities and have taken appropriate measures.
Yet, pictures of the convention caught the attention of many of them, who could be seen in a very close association to celebrate the success of their team in the field.
Just before 11 a.m. today, the conventioners published the following announcement on their Facebook page.
It says: “ATH: Parents please respect the rules that contestants themselves pick up their stuff at school.
Parents are NOT allowed to do so.
Thank you for your understanding."
Another infection was detected yesterday, but it is related to the infection reported last morning.
Says the announcement: “The infection has been identified in sequence by an Icelandic genetic analysis and has revealed a new type of virus that has not been detected here before. ”
In this case, it is also carried out and it is infected in isolation and 12 on pathogens due to the infection.
The third infection involved is from a man who came to Iceland 11 days ago, July 15.
He was identified on the southwest corner of the country.
The person is now in solitary confinement and six who were in close association with him during illness.
Two of them are already showing signs of viral transmission.
In addition, two were identified at the border and are asked for results of further studies, such as a cross - border project.
Finally, the announcement states: The Public Security Department of the State Police Department and the agrologist’s office urge people to be careful and careful about personal protection.
If there is any doubt about the presence of Covid-19 virus symptoms, the same person is asked to have a sample at the nearest health care centre.
Padresfjörður says the tent area booked for shopping weekends - Direct guests another
The tent area of the Patrek Park is fully booked this weekend, according to the announcement of the West.
Visitors are advised to consider other gistimat potentials.
The West is called the Valley of Bildu, the Valley of Tabernacles, the Melanes on Red sand, the Hotel Flocalund, and the Hotel Breindavia.
There is enough to be on the Patrek Park this weekend, for as in the previous year, the city of Shield will be a festival of Icelandic documentary pictures in the town.
It has been held since 2007 and has become a strong tradition in town.
This year, if weather does not take account of the situation, a fine encounter can be expected to take place in the tent area, but earlier today, DV reported an outrageous prophecy.
But the worst weather in the south may be expected, and the hope of the Fathers.
The web bb.is told us first, and said that all other accommodations in town were already fully booked.
A whole multi-dwelling house caves down to the best place in the city
Romanian workers live freely on Dunhaga 18–20.
While owners seek a building permit to be rebuilt, their business has been expanded over the third year.
One of the oldest, grandest, most expensive neighborhoods in the city of Reykjavik stands a magnificent three - story apartment building.
On the ground floor of the house, there is about 600 square feet [600 sq m] of shopping space.
Behind the house are the doors of two stairwells, each holding four rather magnificent apartments.
They range from 93–130 square meters, although most of them are over 100.
The house has a lot of history.
It was built in 1959 and has included video rentals, the Shoeroom, the Milk Cellar’s Milk Cellar, Joa gunsmiths, fish sales, and now, last time, the University Print.
The house, so to speak, has remembered its fiendish beauty.
The house is now under severe damage, as shown in the accompanying pictures.
The owner of the house is D18 ehf.
The owner of D18 eff. is according to a company register among others, Magnús Magnússon and Gudrún Helga Lárusdóttir.
Magnus was the owner of the Burgundy and the defender of the Burgundy Society.
One of the owners of the holding company Borgaar is the steel ship Ehf.
The steel ship Eff. is the investment company of Gudrun, the daughter of Saint Larus and her children.
At the same time, Guðrún is the owner of a third part of the D18 emph.
Guðrun and her husband, August Gudmundur the son of Victory, once carried out the steel ship.
D18 Eff. bought the house in the summer of 2009 and has therefore little or nothing been kept with since then.
Neighbors say that the situation of the house has deteriorated steadily since, most recently.
On a Facebook page in the neighborhood, one resident says that the house “was not particularly lively in the last year. ”
It may include a few years of effort by owners to change the house and its location.
Other neighbors say the house hasn't been okay for a long time.
“ It’s a long time to do something nice about this spot and I’m sorry that it has been this way. ”
At the same time, he says that he is upset about the owner of the house because he has not worked to finish it, found a common area with neighbors of the house, and stopped this “legal step. ”
“Just do this in consultation with the community around so that you can get this done and finish it.”
The ‘legal step’ referred to by the resident is the organisational process of the site that has been in progress since at least 2017.
Then the owners of Dunhaga 18 and 20 sought permission to build a hill above the current apartment building and behind the house, a new elevator and a building on one floor, as well as a basement.
The building permit granted for this operation was filed with the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, and the Committee dropped it because the implementation was not supported by a dispute organisation and there was insufficient publicity.
Then, in July last, a city of smoking started organizing a dispute and ended it with an advertisement in the News of July.
That organization was also dear to the committee and was taken out of office in March 2020.
Thus, at this point nearly three years had passed since the initial application for building permits and the homeowners entered the starting site.
At that time, the house had suffered a great deal, and neighbors began to tire out.
When DV asked the neighbors about the situation and the reaction of neighbors, the answers were in various ways.
Some had an understanding of the intentions of the owner of the house, others not at all.
Others directed their anger toward the city, others did not.
Others were just angry, but nothing was necessarily to anyone.
Still others said that the car park had a lot of controversy, but neighbors have new unused Dunhaga parking lot 18–20 under their vehicles.
One plaintiff in the case said he was tired of the administration:
“ Let’s have to go through the process three times, it’s amazing.
It's like Reykjavik City couldn't read."
Today, the house is empty, abandoned, and neglected.
A monument to the heaviness of the city’s administration and noble intentions of its owners and the many years of work of those now on the ground.
When a journalist was standing in Dunhaga 18, he was struck with a wide - open door and a pile of garbage.
A playstation computer and a recent TV was surrounded by another garbage on earth — victims of an Icelandic summer spell.
Opened into the old office of the University Print, there were quite a number of cats to judge by the smell of smelting.
Clearly, someone has set himself in one corner, but no one can see.
A bunch of sofas and beds and a few boards of geologic pages, which would no doubt become a book, burst into flames.
The stairs of the apartment were also open and life in both of them.
A reporter was so lucky to find one of them.
There, the Romanians were having dinner with a potato dish and invited a journalist in.
The Romanians work for Ztrongforce ehf.
They have been there for some time and simulate sources DV that the company has paid nothing for the house except heat and electricity.
Because of the condition of the house, renting does not seem to be justified.
The situation of mail in the house’s lobby makes it clear that there have been a number of foreign workers in the last few losses.
The company's management has not taken part in the Covid-19 situation, as a contraction in tourism has led to a contraction in the building sector, and these two industries have been the most efficient in using the services of employees.
Nevertheless, the housekeepers in Dunhaga 18 seemed to have enough work to do and hung the work jams and hobbies in the joint to dry after a long day’s work in the rain.
It should be noted that despite the poor condition of the house, the apartment the boys shared seemed to be well maintained.
When a journalist dismissed the boys from bed, the irony suddenly became clear to him: In the best place in Reykjavík, 1,500 square feet [1,500 sq m] of real estate is demolished.
Owners want to change the house for the better and neighbors want to improve the situation but argue about the definition of “improvement”.
In the middle of this period, the city's organizational areas are on the ground, the victims of endless appeals, and the potential for organisation and implementation of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection.
In the house, such bedtime workers, perhaps those who go to improve the situation, live when the Icelandics stop fighting.

Fighting hyperweight following a coronary viral epidemic
Britain’s Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, will provide 10 million pounds in a campaign against overweight, which will include a ban on quick - bite advertising, following a serious illness, in part because of his weight.
It is said that Johnson will present the campaign, which has been called Better Greetings, tomorrow, Monday, but with the campaign, doctors will be urged to prescribe bicycle rides for their clients in excess of weight and will also be attacked by the proliferation of bicycle riders.
Then, according to the British media, advertising on TV will be banned for 21 o’clock at night.
"COVID-19 has awakened us to the short- and long-term risks of being overweight, and the Prime Minister is determined that we must spend time to become healthier, more active and eat healthier food," according to the government spokesman.
Johnson himself has had weight problems, but he was placed in intensive care when he was infected by the corona virus in spring, and that is partly due to his weight because he is thought to have become so seriously ill.
Women — More Prosperous to Lead the Change
She said that the new constitution was the greatest step that the nation can take in the pursuit of greater power, transparency, and the fight against corruption and the interests of the whole.
“We need to change gear a little now, and who is better at leading such a change than the group of society that has easier to be in these values.
"There are women," said Helga.
“Women in Iceland are famous for their women’s unity.
To stick together and be together to lead change.
So now it's just time for us to make these changes."
She said she was a little apprehensive about the emphasis on Iceland as the “best in the world” in both gender rights and human rights.
“ Then we’re not as ready to look at what needs to be done.
Like the Germans, they are very aware of their history and look at everything that needs to be done.
There's a lot.
We need to know where we are coming from and know the story and listen.
Listen to the voices of peripheral groups.
We don't all have the same rules here," said Helga.
She said, in many respects, that women were in good health in Iceland, but she added that, as in many other places, Icelandics lived at enormous masculine values.
She said that politics was turned around to form its own interests, authority, and power, which were the forces that maintained injustice in all societies.
"Women have now formed this group and come together and have just become a little annoyed that the General Assembly is likely to look beyond this national referendum since 2012," she said.
“ It’s these feminine values that we’re thinking about.
Based on human rights and nature conservation, cooperation and the fact that we are all really sitting at the same level," she said, adding that the aforementioned values were the basic values of the new Constitution.
“We are a very rich land of natural resources, and it’s ridiculous that there are people here who live in poverty.
It's ridiculous, we can change things," said Helga.
“ It’s ridiculous that it’s a natural law that women’s jobs are always less paid.
It's ridiculous that stewardesses and nurses have to stand in the heart of a struggle just to earn a decent salary."
The signing list of the new constitution can be signed here by electronic means.
Attempted to rob a walking passerby in downtown
A man was arrested in the middle of town last night after threatening a pedestrian and trying to get money from him.
The police also stopped the production of drugs in Yeartown, where two were arrested for the cause.
Then the police stopped the motorbike driver on the Helms where his driver was at 146 km speed, with a maximum speed of 60 km/h.
In addition, he had previously been deprived of his driving rights.
The police in the capital area had enough to turn around last night, and over 80 cases were recorded in the police diary from five yesterday to five this morning.
At that time, there was a lot of noise reports about parties.
Saturday night, there were reports of 11 noisy gatherings, much to the attention of police journals.
Last night, however, 22 noises rang like police.
Six were saved in a prison cell last night.
In the Yeartown, a police officer was called up to the night when some people were firing fireworks.
Yet, they had escaped when police officers were in the park.
At that time, nine drivers were stopped from drinking and driving drugs.
Four were arrested for fighting in the middle of town last night, one of which was stored in a prison cell.
Then two were moved to an emergency room after they fell on their faces, one in the center of town, and the other in the West.
One was transferred to an emergency unit after he was injured in jumping on trampoline in Copavogi.
In addition, policemen stopped the driver who pulled a trailer on Kjalarnes yesterday.
According to police journal, the bicycle equipment of the trailer was in “very bad condition ” and was stopped.
You can stay in Monet's house for the shopping weekends
The house, in which Impressor Claude Monet spent the last forty years of his practice, is now available for rent on Airbnb.
The next free night in the house is about the shopping weekends.
The house is small and adorable, located in the town of Givenry, Normandy, France.
The painter lived in the house from 1883 until his death in 1926.
The house has three bedrooms, two sitting rooms, and three bathrooms.
Monet was first inspired to paint his gardens famous in this house.
If someone intends to rent the house, he must rent at least two nights.
Based on the Airbnb page it is next loose in a week, on Sunday of the merchant weekend, and therefore might be ideal for some merchants on vacation to hurry to book the painter's house.
The two nights of shopping weekends cost only 964 dollars, or just over 130 thousand dollars, as the Newspaper next comes.
Tens of the disease, and some of them have begun to show the symptoms of the disease caused by the coronary virus
Five have been diagnosed with the coronary virus domestically in the last three days and are most of the infected unconnected.
Because of this, dozens have contracted disease, and some of them have begun to show the symptoms of the disease caused by the virus.
Three were diagnosed with the coronary virus domestically yesterday, and two were detected at border crossings.
According to a geologist’s office, an increasing number of domestic infections may not necessarily mean that the virus is spreading widely to the community.
“ The first domestic infection has been sorted out, and it’s a virus that hasn’t been seen here before, so we don’t have any particular reason to think it’s ever been classified in society.
This is probably something that has just arrived in the country, but of course we need to be very careful now," said Kamilla Sigrid Josephsdóttir, an expert in the field of protection of the general practitioner.
Most of them have been infected in connection with foreign residents.
More samples are required in the near future than some associated with the infected are beginning to show the symptoms of the corona virus.
“There is no influenza now and there are other respiratory infections, so we can be quite liberal in doing these tests on individuals who have found reason to do something else first,” said Kamilla.
Immunisation is mostly complete, but it is not possible that more people may have to go into disease.
Two of the infected were diagnosed after attending sporting events.
Has it raised questions as to whether holding such events is justified?
As long as people follow standards and rules, the communication manager says it is slow.
Kamilla says that it is almost impossible for the infected to get infected at the sports conventions.
“ If no more people are isolated from these individuals after associating with them at these sports gatherings, we can claim that our conventions have worked.
But it hasn't been revealed," said Kamilla.
Public defence is under constant review.
“We need to be ready to intervene with further advice or restrictions if that seems to be the case,” said Kamilla.
After more than a week, there is a need for a multiplicity of limits to reach a thousand people.
This new situation could affect the proposal.
"Determining the way to cook" - See the menu of Elisha Vidar
Elisha Vidarsdóttir is an achievement in soccer and plays with Val.
She is also a master of nutrition, a mother, and a foodologist.
She needs a lot of energy for the day’s care and usually takes time to cook good and nutritious food.
My normal day begins with coming to work from eight o'clock," says Elisha.
“After work, I go to the store to prepare my dinner before I pick up my girl at the gym at 3:00 a.m. ”
Elisha finds it very nourishing to pick up her daughter early in school.
“ It’s good to have time with her before I go to practice the second part.
After practice, it is good to come home and just have to warm up your food.
In the evening, when the girl is asleep, we like to watch one part to empty our mind."
Elisha does not follow a certain diet.
She is putting her final touch on a master’s program in nutrition, so she knows well what it takes for her to eat to have enough energy to do work, school, family, and exercise.
“ What suits me is eating a variety of foods that are well composed of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats.
However, I think it is most important to have a healthy relationship with food and not to put food in a bad or good, rather nutritious or nutritious way.
It's all right to eat everything, just not all of a sudden and not always."
Elisha is very interested in cooking.
“ I feel a sense of reason about standing in the kitchen cooking and getting it very much.
I have to say that the confidence is with me in the kitchen and I sincerely believe that I am a good cook."
Breakfast: Oats, chia seeds, hemp, salt, a little lemon juice, left in almond milk over the night.
Top this meal so with what is available every time.
Most of the time, it's banana and jumpy musli & kaffi.
I'm a lot of coffee.
Intermediate: Unbelievably different, but fruits or vegetables, flat cakes, a clean shirt with banana and a mouse, bread with pads, and so I could eat hummus with a spoon out of a box if that is the case.
Lunchtime: I often prepare all kinds of food - rich salads from what is in the fridge, quinoa or barley, falafelballs, rock salads, roasted vegetables with good dressing is something I’m working with.
If the organization is completely out of line (which happens often) then the machine at work has helped me pretty often, and then it's 2 slices of bread with butter, cheese and soaked eggs, no longer bother you.
Interchange: Give me something rich in carbohydrates for exercise, toast, cereal, or fruit.
Dinner: Fish are very often chosen in my home, otherwise some delicious vegetable dishes.
Conflicts Between Police and Protestants in Seattle
The city authorities in Seattle, Washington, have declared a state of rebellion following numerous protests in the city center.
Yesterday, police seized blast blasts and pepper sprays to try to clear up a large area occupied by Protestants and stretched over many lengths of buildings near the city Assembly Hall.
The police reported on Twitter that at least 11 Protestants had been arrested and that a study was being carried out at a police station in the city yesterday, possibly with some kind of bomb.
The municipal and police authorities say that Protestants stoned police with stones, bottles, corrugated bombs, and other loose objects, and one police officer was transferred to a hospital where he was injured.
Yet, the protests in Seattle were peaceful for a long time.
The blast was on them to show protestors in Portland, Oregon, but there has been a repeated conflict between Protestants and the heavily armed forces of the FBI.
There, as in other cities of the United States, people gather under the terms of Black Lives Matter, remembering George Floyds, who was killed by a police officer in Minneapolis on May 25, protesting systematic racism in American society and demanding restitution.
Do not cancel until after voting time
It is not yet possible to recall the statements made by the flight attendants of Icelandair, who are due to take effect at the next month’s meeting.
An electronic vote on the core agreement of the Icelandic Airlines Company on behalf of a flight attendant at Icelandair ends at noon tomorrow.
The president of the Society, Líney Jonhansdaughter, assures us that Icelandair will not make the decision on the statements until the outcome of the vote is reached.
"It's all right," says Gudlaug Liney.
“ There have been no revocations, this must be done so that the machines can be manned.
And of course, people are tired of knowing if they're going to have a job after the month.
The kiss is about a contract signed a week ago, on July 19th.
It is expected to be valid until the end of September 2025 and is based on a contract previously signed by flight attendants.
On July 17th, the Icelandic Government and the Council of State agreed to announce a blockade at Icelandair, which was approved by the members of the Icelandic Air Force.
It never came to her, but this was decided following the decision of Icelandair to terminate discussions with the FMC, cancel all his flight attendants, and look for agreements with another trade union.
At that time, the company’s pilots were to take on a temporary assignment as security personnel.
Ask her how she feels that voting will go, says Gudlaug Liney.
“People are in pain after this activity of Icelandair, when all the airline’s flight attendants were dismissed and announced that the agreement would be with another trade union.
Now it becomes apparent whether it has an effect," she says.
At the end of April, 940 flight attendants worked at Icelandair, where 900 of them, some 95%, were dismissed.
Their notice is long, and for those who have the shortest period of work, he is three months old, and ends at the end of the month of July.
There are about 90% of the flight attendants in Icelandair.
What will be the outcome of the agreement?
“Then we wish for further discussions with our assistants.
With this deal, we're meeting Icelandair's demands.
If he is rejected, it is clear that the flight attendants have gone too far."
The vote on the Core Agreement is over and Icelandair announces the second quarter of tomorrow
A flight attendant's vote on a new core deal ends at noon tomorrow.
The cancellation of Icelandair for the second quarter of the year will also be published tomorrow, but preliminary results suggest that the company’s revenue has decreased by 85 percent from the same period last year.
Electronic voting on the core agreement between the Icelandic Airlines and the Icelandair Business Organization began on Wednesday, July 22nd, and ends tomorrow, Monday, July 27th, at noon.
Those who are entitled to vote for the contract are Icelandair employees, who pay social charges to the FVO.
Icelandair and FFI signed a new core deal on Sunday, July 19, but on Friday before, Icelandair had broken off talks with the company after the flight attendants had collapsed the previous agreement in a vote payment at the beginning of July.
At that time, Icelandair had announced Friday to all the flight attendants and airmen of the company, but they were withdrawn after a new core contract was signed.
Under a new core agreement, stewardesses need to fly five hours more a month before the same basic salary.
The agreement expires in 2025, where pilots and flight attendants have been integrated for how long they can fly in one shift.
The contract was introduced to FFI’s associates at a meeting at the Hilton Nordica Hotel last Monday and described many flight attendants who were discussed by a newsroom about dissatisfaction on the basis of the contract.
Most, however, seemed to agree that the agreement had to be agreed to keep the FFI alive.
Icelandair's retirement for a quarter of a year will be announced tomorrow other than the EBIT Society's, its operating income for financial and tax purposes, which, according to preliminary financial statements, is negative for about 100 to 110 million dollars in the United States, or about $15 billion in Iceland.
Icelandair sent a preliminary calculation to the Royal Palace last Wednesday, where it said that the company’s income was about $60 million in the fourth or about $8 billion.
At the end of the quarter, some 154 million U.S. dollars, some $2 billion, have been made available by hand and equivalent.
Icelandair is also aiming to offer the company’s shares in August.
Icelandair is aiming to complete contracts with 15 loan lords, government and Boeing aircraft manufacturer by the end of a month before being put on a partial charter.
A new variant rather than a new type of virus
“ A new virus just means that it has been a foreign person.
This is not something that has been happening here in the country," says Már Kristjánsson, chief physician at the National Hospital for Diseases, who reports that "a new type of virus" has been diagnosed here in the country.
Three domestic infections were detected yesterday and two at the border.
One person who had been identified as a social worker at the Rey Cup soccer convention, the source of the infection and the transmission of infectious diseases.
An infection was also detected in a person who came to the country on 15 July and two who were in contact with him began to show the symptoms of COVID-19.
Yesterday, infection related to the infection reported last day and after a sequencing analysis in the Icelandic genetic analysis was found to be “a new type of virus that has not previously been detected. ”
Immunisation is complete in connection with that infection.
Mår notes that it is not a new virus but is the same virus that has spread around the world, i.e. the new coroner virus SARS-CoV-2.
It is better to talk about a new variant of that virus than about a new type of virus.
Asked what that means and whether it could say anything about the onset of another epidemic wave, Már says that as it is, there is a single case, and it could lead to nothing more.
“However, if there were to be cases of non-territorial cases with the same genotype as this particular variant, the conclusion [of the second wave] could be drawn, but it is premature to do so,” explains Már.
Good luck in the hot tub.
Is the secret to the happiness of the Icelandics hidden in the hot tubs?
The BBC’s programmers lead the way in a fun video that sheds light on the country’s swimming pool and hot tub culture.
The Icelandic bath culture is unique worldwide, and it is said that no one in the world has as many baths as there are in every inhabitant.
Natural soil heat is the foundation of it, but also the tradition of swimming here.
Children’s education was legal in 1940, but older citizens are no less diligent in using hot water to improve their health.
Swimming is described as a fixed part of the country’s general well - being.
Everyone in the pot is equal, regardless of their class and position.
Freed from mobile phones, people discuss at home and in space or enjoy the graceful power of the water: meditation and recharging the batteries of the soul and body.
Should pick up a hundred days in the election
It takes hundreds of days for the United States to vote and elect a president for four years.
Donald Trump is looking for re-election, but he's supposed to pick up the track.
Joe Biden, a prospective Democratic candidate, has a strong national advantage over Trump, taken into account by the pollsters.
According to a recent AP survey, the U.S. Census estimates that the nation is on the wrong track.
Trump’s reaction to the pandemic of the new coronary virus is also very unpopular, and in addition, more Americans than before believe that the president has misrepresented the economy.
More specifically, only two out of every ten Americans say that the United States is on the right track.
32 percent say they support Trump’s reaction to the epidemic, and 48 percent say he has maintained a good economic record.
In March it was 56 percent, and in January it was 67 percent.
According to the mean FiveThirtyEight, Biden is 49.9 percent nationally followed by Trump 41.9 percent.
Trump himself has tried to draw attention from his attitude toward the epidemic to Biden, promoting so - called cultural disputes, and proclaiming policies that should be directed toward law and order.
Biden’s offer, however, makes a lot of effort to keep Trump’s attention focused and is highly likely to win if the election is really about how Trump has been doing his job in the last four years.
It also seems that unpopular Trump is going to come down on the members of the Republican Party and fear that the Democrats could even reach a majority in the U.S. Senate, which so far has been very much appreciated.
Politico told of the fact that in the daytime he would remain in the ranks and the offerer comparable, and that is now the Republican Party would be given its greatest derision for decades.
The U.S. has been particularly bad in the 2016 Congressional elections and now looks like this development will continue.
In recent days, Trump has tried to frighten the inhabitants of the suburbs to follow him, including by saying that he will become President Biden, he will destroy the suburbs of the United States and promote racial strife.
Among other things, Trump has published regulations from the time of Barack Obama in the White House that were intended to increase the diversity of the outlying areas.
He then urged the “housewives ” of the U.S. to read an article from the former deputy governor of New York, who claimed that Biden would destroy the U.S. suburbs and agreed with Trump.
“Wait will destroy your neighborhoods and your American dream.
'I'll keep it, and even do it even better!' said the President.
The population of the U.S. suburbs is an ever - increasing group of voters.
According to the NPR, they are about half the voters in the United States.
Ever since George W. Bush was re-elected in 2004, the majority voter in this group has become president.
Except in 2012 when Mitt Romney received a majority vote from this group but lost for Barack Obama.
The polls have shown that, despite the fact that Trump secured a small majority in the neighbourhoods of 2016, its follow-up has significantly decreased.
Although there are differences between the surveys, Biden has indicated a 15-percent advance on Trump in the recent yards.

After the final decision had been made to postpone the Olympic Games, an event that only world wars have fought until now, the president of the International Olympic Committee said that the Olympic fire would be “the light at the end of the passages, ” and there it was likely to refer to a world epidemic of the corona virus that the world is now going through together.
Africans have added years to prepare themselves, and Japan’s authorities are adding to the costs of the delay.
Everyone, though, keeps their heads at stake.
When it was announced that Tokyo would be the scene of this year’s Olympics, the Japanese representatives were delighted.
They cried and laughed at each other, for Tokyo had applied to hold the games in 2016, but that turned out lower for Rio in Brazil.
This time, Tokyo and Japan were to take the world’s attention.
The games were to be held on July 24 through August 9, but have been postponed for a year, starting instead on July 23, 2021, and ending on August 8.
If the games fail, if the crown virus is still too threatened, the games will be canceled.
However, no one wants to think that way to the end.
Olympics are not a regular sports event.
Nothing is saved, the show should always be magnificent and strive to top the last game.
The choice of a city for the Olympics is based on the opinion of the electoral committee in the city’s presentations.
The grander the presentation is — the more likely it is.
Tokyo spent $150 million trying to win the 2016 Olympics or more than $2 billion.
For the second time, when the contests were scheduled for 2020, $75 million, some $1 billion, were put in the presentation.
In 2013, when Tokyo was scheduled to receive the games this year, the Japanese authorities had already spent as much as $3 billion on the project.
However, that amount is just a drop in the ocean, depending on how much it costs to build an Olympic village, a stadium, and in general to strengthen the interior of the country to manage such conventions, prepare them, and hold the games themselves.
Organizers in Japan have said that the Tokyo Olympics, which were supposed to have been going on these days but have been postponed for about a year because of the coroner virus, would have cost $12.6 billion.
However, a report from a government accountant in Japan, published at the end of last year, showed that the cost was almost double that figure.
It is likely that the cost of postponing the games will not be fully estimated, but it has been estimated that it may cost between two and six billion dollars in addition to the initial cost.
Thus, the total cost to the Japanese Olympic Committee and to Japanese taxpayers could range from $15 billion to $30 billion.
There are so high numbers that all taxes in the Icelandic state were only worth about half the Olympics, compared with the lowest possible cost.
Olympics are events of the magnitude that they have often become the subject of economics, trying to guess numbers and see the benefits and benefits of the games.
In short, it seems that many have come to the conclusion that the effects of the Olympics are less positive for the economy of those who hold them.
Soon - to - be effects are some, for example, increasing numbers of jobs very quickly, but for a longer time, cities tend to run into debt and fearsome operating costs of small - scale human laborers.
Rio, Brazil, is heavily indebted for the 2016 games and has been in trouble in providing maintenance for all the major sports activities built for the games.
After the 2012 London Games, only 10 percent of those who got a job associated with the Olympic Games in the city have found themselves unemployed before.
This means that there was only a small amount of new jobs.
In general, cities have not been particularly successful in keeping the Olympics financially because of the sluggish cost of the human activators built for the games.
However, the benefits are often seen as an increase in the number of tourists who want to visit the Olympic cities following the games, but there is a great deal of uncertainty about the 2021 games.
It is also uncertain whether you can accept all the audiences who usually attend the games.
The main thing, though, is the honor that the cities are given to be chosen, but it is difficult to value money.
In spite of enormous costs, it can also be said that the joy that the games bring is not that it can be put on a price.
Of course, while the show is often magnificent and is not saved, it is not just about money.
It's the sports heroes in the foreground.
For some powerful people, it is surprising that the games are only welcome to be postponed.
For example, the Australian five - year - old and gold - medalist, Chloe Esposito, in his article on the page, is a casolite and would have been far from having a good time this summer, but there is hope of being in the form of a 2021 competition.
So it is among those athletes who are just rather happy with the postponement, for understandable reasons.
For those athletes who were going to quit after the games this year, they would have been held on time, in some cases postponing the games, meaning that they quit before the games take place.
Simply do not trust your body to go through years of rigorous training.
Few athletes were as well placed in the hearts of audiences at the 2016 Rio Olympics as Simone Bile’s star.
She came home with four gold around her neck and one bronze.
Biles has been attending several interviews in his home country recently to discuss the Olympics.
She plans to play 2021, but she may not be sure that she will still be at the top of the next year’s games, since she will then be 24 years old.
Although it is generally not considered to be a tall age, it is higher for a gymnast in the front row.
"This is a sensitive subject," says Biles, but smiles at another interview on the Instagram page of the Olympic Committee asking if she is going to make as much as she did in the 2021s in Rio 2016.
“I just don’t know if I’m still on top after a year of practice, ” says Biles.
In the past, she has said that her body can no longer tolerate the pressures of gymnastics training.
Nevertheless, she is zealously practicing for the 2021 Olympics.
Biles admits that it was an uncomfortable feeling to stop practicing suddenly when the pandemic was at its peak and the gym was closed.
There were no exceptions for Billy rather than others during the seven - week closure of all sports activities.
All of her Olympic gold could not buy any access beyond the others; she had to find various ways to stay in shape as others did.
Certainly, the basic form is slightly better than that of most people.
“We have a tough plan now.
It was hard to start rehearsing after the gym opened.
We started slowly, but we’re back on track, and I’m going to increase my practice steadily as the year goes by.
Of course, we do not know exactly what these games will be like or whether they will be held, but we can’t help but practice.
I've put too much effort into leaving the sport now," said Biles.
Like others, she has doubts, or perhaps even more, about the possibility that the games will not be held at all in 2021.
Foretelling that, however, is hopeless.
No one can know what the situation of the coronary virus pandemic will be like in July 2021 and what else to do but prepare for the Olympic Games in view of their being held in the year.
Maybe the Olympics will be the light at the end of the Covids.
Delayed Marriage Due to Epidemic
Modern Family actress Sarah Hyland has decided to postpone her wedding because of the Crown Virus.
She was supposed to marry the ex-Bachelorette contestant Well Adams this summer.
“I think it’s other more important things to think about right now,” said the actress in a conversation with People.
“ We’d love to get married sometime and have the dream wedding and have all the people present who love us.
But we decided to postpone it and focus on what is important right now, helping to share information about the importance of wearing a mask and staying at home.
I look at world affairs more than wedding affairs these days.
There are many things going on and we should focus our attention on what is happening in the world."
