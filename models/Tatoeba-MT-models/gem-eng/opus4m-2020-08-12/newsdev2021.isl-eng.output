Biden conducts peer reviews in three key countries
In just 100 days, Joe Biden, a Democratic candidate, will take advantage of three important swinging states.
CNN reports today that Biden was transferred to Florida, Arizona, and Michigan.
In Florida, Biden is measured by 51% and 46% respectively.
In Arizona, 49%–45% of Biden is in favour and in Michigan, the victory of Biden is in favour, where it leads by 12 points, 52%–40%.
To win the elections in November, after 100 days, Trump needs to turn all these states, and actually more.
Trump is in the midst of a coronal viral epidemic that is increasingly being blamed by locals, and most of the polled countries have responded badly, or very badly, at the beginning of the epidemic.
In addition, Trump has come out badly of protests and riots that sprang up at the death of George Floyd.
Trump and his government felt that they had been mistreated or mistreated.
In order to crown Trump's problems, he is now under more serious criticism of having ordered federal police officers to break behind protests in cities where city or government leaders are Democrats.
Has it created enormous wolf skin among the inhabitants of the cities, and that anger is being passed on to other Americans?
Also, pictures of federal police poaching Protestants into unmarked cars have not helped the U.S. cause.
Watch the advertising The Lincoln Project for this very thing, but it can be seen below.
Trump defeated all three states in 2016, but with a very low vote.
In fact, Trump won many countries with a low vote and won the vote with a minority vote.
For example, Michigan defeated him with only 10,704 votes.
It's less than 0.5% of the population.
Nearer to all the polls that political commentators say are to show the same conclusion, Biden is taken forward.
A new survey of CNN in Arizona shows that Biden’s lead is now out of the scope of the survey.
Same goes for the CNN and Quinnipiac University studies on Florida.
Even Fox News, who leaned well to the right and declared support for Trump 2016, has published research into the same subject in their media.
The last hope of the President, according to the surveyors, is that Trump could hope to return to important places within the fluctuation states if the campaign focuses on the economy.
The economy of the United States suffered a severe blow following the Covid-19 epidemic, but voters do not seem to be linking the economic crisis to the coronist epidemic.
In other words, the vast majority of voters seem to blame Trump for having reacted badly to the coronary epidemic, but they trust him better to cope with the economic crisis that is taking place in the state at this time.
However, Trump has failed to direct the debate in the election campaign.
As a result of the riots that have been on fire almost constantly since the news of the video was horrified, as four police officers killed George Floyd, Trump tried to direct the discussion to law enforcement and its importance.
Law and Order, became his idiosyncrasy.
Now it seems to have been a complete failure, as previously said.
As the polls are more inclined toward Trump, more and more Republicans are more likely to leave Trump and declare support for either Biden, or someone else, who is then Biden without mentioning him specifically by name.
Because of this arrangement in the United States, they do this by voting in many elections on the same ballot.
Thus, the vote can simply be marked with the second category in the vote section of the ballot, and it can be counted as a vote for all other candidates in that category on the ballot.
Thus, Republican candidates in other positions are tempted to break free from the slack of Trump’s gang and achieve independent results in the elections.
The Youth Olympics in Dakar Delayed until 2026
The youth’s Olympics were to be held in Dakar next year, but they have now been postponed until 2026 because of the coroner’s virus epidemic after the International Olympic Committee and Senegal reached an agreement.
However, the postponement of the first Olympics to take place in Africa is a shock to many young athletes.
A volunteer arrested for the fire in Nantes
A volunteer in the Cathedral of Nantes, France, has been arrested in connection with fires that destroyed the church.
According to the prosecutor, Le Monde, a suspected fugitive from Rwanda who served as a church overseer, admitted that he had lit the fire.
The man’s lawyer, in conversation with another media, says that man magnifies his actions.
Among those destroyed in the fire was an organ dating back to the 17th century and the historic windows of the church.
The 39 - year - old volunteer who has not been named was arrested shortly after the fire on July 18, but was then released.
He was then given back to report yesterday and then put in custody.
"No way out of this"
I am well received in the home of Baltasar and Christian Samper in Copavogi.
The reason for my visit is the new art show by Baltasar and his daughter, Mireya, which will be opened on August 1st at the Small Kambi barn on Snowfall Ness.
Is this the first time the father shows together?
I am led down to the Baltasar’s workshop, where a magnificent painting faces me.
Large and gloomy images of women of old but also of flying creatures; eagles of one, shadows of birds on another.
The workroom is out of the house.
“We had a horse here with us that bit the grass,” Baltasar tells me.
“The horse works much better than a butcher on these hills and hills that we have.”
Mireya is with us, Kristina and Baltasar, and she tells us how her work rhymes with the works here.
“Introductions, a combination of paperwork and jewellery.
They're all very white and in contrast to what Daddy's doing, because I'm working with the light and like that," she says.
“ It’s been a year since this idea came up.
Then there were certain works that I was working on and would have wanted to show there, but they stuck in Tokyo because of Covid.
When my father started painting, and I saw where he was going, I rethinked my part," says Mireya, but Baltasar’s work has a strong record in Icelandic folklore about women’s eagles and waders.
“ When I saw that my father was doing these paintings with the women, ” says Mireya, “I thought it would be best to make jewelry that is related to them, but the jewelry she works with Winguard Inga Bear’s son a goldsmith at the sign store.
"That's how I put in the jewelry."
Last year, Mireya attended the show of 72 artists of the Academy of Sensation on Snæfellsnei, including in the Small Kambi barn, and found the building fascinating.
“This is a new space, an old barn that has just been built up,” says Mireya, who talked to Baldvina Sverris daughter of an artist who suggested that Mireya and Baltasar set up a show.
“ She wanted us both to show, and then we thought:
“Why not?
This is a good idea."
Born in Spain in 1938, Baltasar Samper attended the University of Art in Barcelona before going on a journey to study art and research.
He arrived here in Iceland in 1961 and was fascinated by a country and a nation.
He returned here shortly thereafter, met his wife, Christina, and has lived here continuously since 1963, for 57 years.
Baltasar, a successful artist, has held dozens of private shows, and shows with the Christeans in many parts of the world.
He is best known for his large murals, including wall decorations in the Flatey Church and frescoes in the Broad Street Church.
“ What affects what I do is the bitterness that Iceland has and no other place, ” says Baltasar.
“This low sun and these shadows that stretch and stretch.
As soon as I got here, I thought, "Wow, you can work here."
Mireya is the eldest children of Kristjöna and Baltasar, born in 1964.
“ There was one thing I knew, it was quite clear, that I wasn’t going to be a artist, ” she asked if she wanted to follow in her parents ’ footsteps.
“So I went on a math and physics course in high school and did everything I could to get away with it.
Then I realized that I was on the run.
Then you just have to give up," says Mireya and laughs.
Like her father, she has shown things around the world.
A lot in Japan, to shoot.
All of Baltasar’s children and Christ’s children have followed the path of art.
"I call it a virus," says Mireya.
"There was no way out of this."
The Icelandair count has been in a grey area when flight attendants were dismissed
Minister of Social Affairs believes that Icelandair has been in a grey area when the company denounced all flight attendants in the middle of a nuclear war.
He then claims that laws that would mean firemen entering an apartment building will be reviewed after the fire at the City of Brothers.
On July 17, Icelandair was advised to resign all 38 flight attendants who worked with the partner while the airstrip at the Aviation Company was still on the board of a state charter.
Divisions found that Icelandair had been able to address these statements, and they were prepared to settle the matter before the Society.
This never came to an end, however, after the layoffs, the flight attendants and Icelandair met for about 24 hours.
Ausmundur Einar Dadason, Minister of Social Affairs, says that in his view, Icelandair’s decision was in a grey area and the right of wage earners.
“My opinion is that this is a certain right to defend wage earners.
When you're in a conversation, when you're in a peacemaker's office, it's not an option to go this way.
It is absolutely clear to me that this would not have been possible.
I think it is quite clear, in my mind, that men had entered the gray area there what this touched," said Ásmundur.
He will thus not speak for other companies going the same way as Icelandair.
“You also see now a dangerous discussion that it’s only natural to go up this system to reduce this right, so I am totally opposed. ”
In the morning, Ásmundur was also asked about the government’s reaction to the fire at the end of June, when three people died.
A minister says that the study of the matter is now being carried out on the basis of a report from the House and the Agency, to which he has made direct recommendations.
“ It’s in the law today that the fire department can’t go into the apartment.
I have asked the Institute of Human Resources to examine in particular whether there is any reason to make any legislative changes.
I'm ready to make the legal changes that need to be made to reduce the likelihood that this can happen again," says Ásmundur Einar.

United States reportedly increasing the pressure on Nord Stream 2 - RT Business News
Further efforts have been made by the U.S. government to force a European company to abandon the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which is led by Russia, according to the World on Sunday, which witnesses to people who are familiar with the subject.
According to the newspaper, officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Department of Finance, and the United States Department of Energy have contacted European contractors to ensure that they are aware of the consequences of continuing the project.
Up to 12 officials should have held at least two online meetings with representatives of the enterprises in the last days.
Those who witnessed the talks said that the Americans had stressed in a “kind ” tone that the United States wanted to prevent Nord Stream 2 from becoming a reality.
"I think this is a very, very serious threat," said one woman to the German media.
These threats are in line with statements made last week by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who warned that companies involved in the project would be best placed to ‘get out now’ or at risk of punishment under 232 parts of the infamous Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA).
In addition to the Russian energy company Gazprom, which oversees the development of the project, five European companies are involved.
These are the French company Engie, OMV from Austria, the British-Dutch company Royal Dutch Shell and Wintershall and Uniper from Germany.
In a conversation with the World on Sunday, a representative of the last mentioned company said that the United States’ efforts to undermine “a major infrastructure project ” were clear intervention in the European Union.
Earlier this week, the U.S. Congress approved a change to the law on National Defence, which aims to extend the United States’ sanctions against companies involved in the setup of the Russian North Stream 2 gas pipeline.
According to one of the legal carriers, the measures may be targeted at companies that provide or provide for ships, insurance, porting or liaison services for such ships, as well as those who offer a certificate for Nord Stream 2.
Both European companies and public officials have repeated their disapproval of the efforts of the United States to deal with European energy issues by imposing sanctions against Nord Stream 2, and some of them have even called for the Brussels operation to be carried out.
Moscow officials have also harshly criticized the Washington operation and called it unfair competition.
Earlier this week, Presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that Russia would set up a new plan for the completion of the project if Washington councillors were to keep the new sanctions under pressure.
Preparing further transfers of public institutions to the country
Minister for Social Affairs and Children intends to move more public institutions to land in the near future.
The Fire Department will be moved north of the Forest River in the autumn of the Minister's decision, but experts in the Department have previously declared that they do not intend to move northwards.
Assmundur Einar Dadason, Minister for Social Affairs and Childhood, said in Bombardy on the Wave this morning that it is important for the countryside to have public institutions transferred there.
Hence, there is a high value creation that also creates diversity.
“ It’s economically important, we’re trying to build everything around the country.
Job creation, money-creating structure, whether in tourism, agriculture, industry, some kind of exploitation, and this kind of public service work, they are very supportive of that structure," says Ásmundur.
"Creating increased diversity, creating better support for this resource allocation and the creation of the currency of the nation."
The decision taken by Mr Alsmund to transfer the fire protection area of the Institute for Housing and Human Resources has been severely criticised by its staff and by the National Association of Fire Department and Medical Transporters.
Six fire experts in the department are all based in the capital area, and none of them are planning to move to the village of Sheep’s Hook.
“I think it is quite clear that there is a political difference in opinion about how hard it should work.
My opinion is, and has always been, that we should engage in radical action to better distribute public works," says Ásmundur.
“We see that our neighboring nations, Norwegians and Danes have been doing this successfully.”
He is convinced that the vast majority of the nation wants to see a greater distribution of public institutions throughout the country.
"I think that further political decisions need to be taken on the transfer of public services to the country, as I was doing with the Institute of Housing and Human Resources."
He cites the transfer of the National Food Agency to Selfoss, Iceland's surveyors to Akraness and the unemployment insurance company on Skaga Beach.
“ It’s a place of work on Skaga Beach today that matters to that community.
I think we should take further steps in this creature."
“I am preparing further steps in this being.
More transport."
Fifty-five arrests in Seattle
Systematic racism and the decision of the President of the United States to send federal police forces to cities to say goodbye to riots were protested many times yesterday.
In 50 Protestants, Seattle was arrested.
The Seattle police used bombs and pepper sprays in mass protests yesterday that police have described as riots.
Twenty - one officer was injured, and at least 45 Protestants were arrested.
Two months later, after a police officer killed George Floyd, protesters against systematic racism began in the United States.
The blast was at the protests to show protestors in Portland solidarity.
There has been a repeated conflict between police and Protestants since the United States president sent in unscrupulous forces of federal policemen who have been driving unmarked cars.
Thousands met in Portland this weekend and used tear gas and rubber when fighting between them and Protestants.
A Miraculous Child Owned 47 Years
Kenya Moore, a real - life star in the United States, is doing well by strengthening people who need technological fertilization.
Moore, who is known for her participation in The Real Housewives of Atlanta, gave birth to her first child, 47 years of age, after she became a technical progenitor, and calls her daughter a miracle child.
"Almost all my life was waiting to have a baby," said Moore in an interview with People.
"As I know the anguish that people feel, especially women, that I might not possibly have a child."
Moore realized that she was running out of time when she was 40 years old.
“I didn’t want to have a baby alone.
I didn't want to be a single mother.
So I waited and after forty, I looked up and thought my God good," said Moore, who, though not knowing her father's child until she was 46 years old.
One year later, they had a daughter.
The real - life star claims its daughter to be a miracle child in more than one way.
In addition, as Moore was older than most firstborn, her daughter came into the world one and a half months before the appointed day.
Moore went to a difficult emperor’s canal and took much longer than a traditional emperor’s canal.
“ I call her the miracle baby because it was a child that everyone said was almost unlikely for me to have, ” said Moore during the interview.
Fathers arrested in Mizoram worth 15.4 million rupees of heroin
The home market value of heroin was about 15.5 million rupees, and it was smuggled from Myanmar, according to police
A man and his son were arrested in Hnahthial region of Mizoram, near the Myanmar border, with a weight of 1.9 kg of heroin.
The value of heroin on the domestic market was about 15.5 million rupees, and this was smuggled from Myanmar, police said.
Duhkima (62) and his son Remthangpuia (33) were arrested on Friday evening in the village of Ngharchhip, said police.
They also lost some 280 grams of heroin, at a price of about 1.5 million rupees when swimming over, on their escape from the police, to the office.
According to police information, this is thought to be one of the largest amounts of heroin in the state.
The defendants were prosecuted according to the relevant 1985 law on drugs and hallucinogenic drugs (NDPS).
Even if a border between states and Myanmar is closed because of the coronary epidemic, drugs and other commodities are not being smuggled, according to police information.
The Assam reefers recently seized 25 trucks loaded with betel nuts smuggled from Myanmar, worth some 40 million rupees.
The doctor ran 35 kilometers with a mask
British doctor Tom Lawton ran 35 km with a face mask in the days to show that oxygen saturation did not decrease with face masks.
Lawton is a doctor at Bradford Royal Hospital and has worked there during the pandemic.
To disprove the theory of oxygen saturation and to encourage people to wear a face mask, Lawton decided to run back and forth in a mask.
Before he left, he began the collection of GoFundMe for The Trusell Trust, which provides food supplies in Bradford and in many parts of Britain.
“ I am a great supporter of all those who keep us safe.
That's why I've been shocked by the wrong information that's been passed on to people about the fact that a face mask reduces oxygen saturation in people," said Lawton.
Lawton said that he had previously competed in three games, but during the epidemic, his endurance had diminished.
On Monday, he ran a mile [35 km].
“I never took off the mask (no food or drink) and the oxygen saturation was 98% persistent every time I looked, ” wrote Lawton on Twitter after running.
Prince Joakim still in the hospital
Prince Joakim of Denmark is now in the University Hospital in Toulouse, France, and his condition is constant.
The prince underwent a brain surgery yesterday after having been diagnosed with a blood clot.
“ Prince Joakim’s condition is still stable.
The prince was blessed to be in the hands of professionals in time, and after events, he feels good.
It's too early to tell how long he's going to be in the hospital right now," says Lene Balleby, Danish Royal Palace Information Officer, in a written reply to the Danish Kingdom Radio.
Only a few days have passed since the royal family celebrated the 18th birthday of Prince Felix the son of Joakim, his next son.
The birthday was celebrated in the Queen's vineyard, Château de Cayx, Cahors, South France.
When Joakim was hospitalized yesterday, the family was still on vacation.
Joakim, 51 years old, moved to France last year, where he is studying at Ecolé Militaire, the first Dana.
Then he works as a defense expert at the Danish Embassy in Paris.
The prince's French connection is strong when his father is dead, Prince Henry, French and his wife, Princess Mary, too.

Accidents in Utah: Children and two adults died in a crash in the backyard
Six people were on board a Piper PA-32 plane that crashed into a backyard in West Jordan City in the afternoon on Saturday, according to Allen Kenitzer, spokesman for the United States Aviation Administration (FAA).
Three of those on board died, including 43 - year - old pilot Lee Wyckoff, his 9 - month - old child, and Milda Shibonis, 36 years old, according to the West Jordan police.

Gottlieb warns that the unbridled spread of the Crown Virus in society makes it “very difficult” for schools to open in the fall
Washington – Dr. Scott Gottlieb, former director of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, warned on Sunday that it would be “very difficult” for school to open up a new year of study if the Crown Virus spreads smoothly within these communities.
“ I believe that local school authorities need to look at how the distribution is within the community.
If the virus is unhindered in society, it will be very difficult to open it up, ” said Gottlieb in the Face the Nation.
Since the fall break is due to begin in the next few weeks, the government of Trump had encouraged school authorities to open their schools to students and offer schooling five days a week.
However, these attempts by President Trump and Minister of Education Betsy DeVos will come a week after Trump warned that the corona virus epidemic would probably “worse before it improves” and confirmed that schooling in those places where the worst conditions may need to be postponed for a few weeks.
On Thursday, however, the Centers for Disease Prevention issued instructions on how to open school for students most safely.
Among other things, the guidelines call for a distance between people, students and staff in schools to be recommended to use face protection and for students to be divided into distinct groups to reduce transmission routes.
However, the Centers for Disease Prevention did not issue school directors criteria for when to close schools if corona virus transmissions increase, which Gottlieb says has been “unlucky. ”
“ When these uncertain conditions and detailed guidelines have not been given on how schools will be opened, ” he says, “I think more parents will be careful. ”
"That is why I think it is very important to have detailed information on the exact criteria that the Centres for Disease Prevention did not provide in their guidelines."
Gottlieb said that when deciding whether to keep schools open or to switch to online teaching, the proportion of positive infections in society, local distribution, and testing skills must be considered.
If between 5 and 10% of the analyses give a positive conclusion, "the matter is about to be solved", but over 10% is "the threshold when it is necessary to consider carefully whether to close school sentences".
“This is a sign that the epidemic has taken its toll on society,” said Gottlieb, adding that this would make things difficult for Florida, which is the center of the coronary virus epidemic in the United States, to open up to school next month.
Coronary virus transmission has increased to over 30 countries and Colombia, but the center of the epidemic is now in the sun belt called the South Coast of the United States.
Gottlieb, though, said that there were signs of slowing down the number of cases in some countries, including Arizona and Texas.
But even though Gottlieb had said that there was a 'significant sign' that the epidemic was slowing down in some countries in the sun belt, there was a beginning to 'heat in the coals' in others, including South Carolina, Alabama, India and Illinois.
Many governments have set rules that require people to use masks in public spaces and have stopped the phased reopening to stop the spread of the Crown Virus.
Gottlieb said that states should consider closing bars, limiting the number of people in restaurants, closing cinemas, and other places that offer indoor entertainment, and setting rules on masking to overcome the epidemic, which are measures that make it possible for governments to avoid reopening the strict restrictions imposed at the beginning of the epidemic in March.
In addition to the use of masks by various countries, various companies have been obliged to use face - to - face protection.
Quickbitter McDonald's is the newest company to make use of face protection as a duty and adds it to a group of companies such as Walmart, Starbucks and others who have set their own rules on masking.
Gottlieb said that he expected more companies to take on a mask duty, especially since the danger is considered to be great.
"If we can really control the epidemic when winter goes on until we get a vaccine or some kind of treatment that changes the clinical course of this disease, then we can do it with masks, it's relatively simple, something we can all do, but that doesn't change our lives and allow us to keep what's very important to us, like keeping some companies open and getting the kids back to school," he says.
Although Donald Trump did not say he wanted to wear masks in the entire country last week, he urged Americans to use face - to - face protection and said, at the White House news conference, that “they have an effect. ”
Wilfried Zaha wants to leave Crystal Palace, says Roy Hodgson: "There's news to expect"
The followers of Crystal Palace received a blow for the summer when Roy Hodgson, the company’s executive, declared it over the applicant Wilf Zaha’s freshman wanted to leave the company.
The elephant has been playing at Selhurst Park for more than five years and seems to be leaving, but it has been spoken of as a team such as Arsenal and Bayern Munich.
Since he is now 27 years old, whether a team in that category is still willing to pay high sums for him, especially during the financial uncertainties of the sport this summer, after a period in which Zaha scored four limits and made five foundations for the Palace team that caused some disappointment.
In an interview with Alex Crook at TalkSport after the last game of the season, Hodgson said that he “was expecting news of Zaha’s possible departure after having confirmed that the candidate had ‘made it clear’ that he would see his future elsewhere than his partner.
There are still three years left from the contract of the applicant with the Palace, and last year the Society indicated that 100 million sterling pounds would be needed for the union to deliver it.
The Hodgson team completed the period with seven losses in a row and a tie on the last day of the period, which resulted in the team falling to 14th place.
Zaha found the netmask only once from mid - December to the end of the period with a long shot in the loss against Chelsea.
It was reported that he had asked for sale last summer when he tried to get rid of the partner but no offer was made to tempt the Palace to sell.
Zaha changed the agent in January, which seems to increase the likelihood of getting out of the union, and in the next few weeks it will undoubtedly be his priority to secure social change.
Zaha is the player who played most of the minutes in the English elite for the Palace during the season and was the only player of the team under the age of 28 who played 1100 minutes or more, showing how much rebuilding the team might be necessary to attack with the funds made available to the player.
Hanna Hurricane: A corona virus-borne Texas State is facing a high risk of flooding in a 'twind shell'
Weather forecasters have predicted “catastrophe floods ” in southern Texas after the Hanna hurricane reached land twice, resulting in heavy rains and wind gusts up to 40 meters [40 m] per second.
When he reached the beach on Saturday, he was classified as a first-degree storm (the lowest grade on a five-point scale) and he has now been brought down into a tropical storm, but rain could still reach 150-300 mm on Sunday and wind could reach 26 meters per second.
In some areas, rain has already reached up to 230 mm, including Cameron County at the Mexican border.
Hannah was the first hurricane in the Atlantic in 2020, and meteorologist Chris Birchfield advised residents to be vigilant: “This is not nearly over yet; we are still expecting a flood of disasters. ”
Over the past few weeks, Texas has been battling a huge increase in coronary viral disease.
Governor Greg Abbott published a disaster announcement for 23 regions that are on the way to the storm, including Harris, Fort Bend, Galveston, and Brazoria.
“ All hurricanes are a huge challenge.
This challenge is complex and even more difficult as the hurricane passes through an area that has become worse because of COVID-19," said Greg.
The hurricane first landed at 5:00 p.m. on Saturday, 25 miles [24 km] north of Port Mansfield, some 200 miles [210 km] south of Corpus Christi.
The second time was not far from here, in East Kennedy County.
More than 43,700 people in South Texas, including Corpus Christi, Harlingen and Brownsville, were without electricity on Saturday night.
An emergency service in Corpus Christi set up gardens near street conventions to be used in the event of flooding across the streets.
President Donald Trump of the United States told us that the government was monitoring Hannah and the hurricane Douglas, heading toward Hawaii in the Pacific.
Sherry Boehme, who lives on the shore of Corpus Christi, said that the approaching storm had increased her anxiety over the pandemic.
For the most part, this 67 - year - old woman had remained at home because of health problems associated with chronic lung disease.
She said: “It’s almost like a double blow for us.
I think a lot of people are getting nervous.
We'll get through this.
They are all good and strong, and stand together."
Listening on a blazing cruise in South Africa
Listening in the South has been unusually successful in the summer when the weather has been favorable to farmers.
Most of them have their first stroke, while another one has a large start, and it is estimated that some will reach the third stroke at the end of the summer.
The weather has been playing with southern farmers, such as the other inhabitants of the area this summer, and it has not been damaging to farmers’ tunes.
So listening has been a success.
Victory over the Augustian son, a cow farmer in the Birting Hole in the Hrunna River, and a hardy contractor, is content and happy.
“Yes, it’s just been going great, I think farmers just have to be steep, it’s been going great, because they’ve been very good for the last six months.
Heyin is a very good end the harvest good and the quality of the hay well over," says Sigurður.
Victory says that it is growing, especially in the case of cow farmers, that they are living in flat pits or outposts, which have been very good, but it is a long time to do the most in the roll.
“ It’s lively, yes, yes, it’s actually been very comfortable for the past six months or three weeks, it’s been so dry and good and then it’s so comfortable to apply it.
It remembers everything, there is less stress and can be stored until morning at times what could be done today, so it is brilliantly comfortable.
But does Victory think that some farmers will strike three times?
“Yes, I could believe it, those who were first.
We started on June 17th, it could be that those who were first had to take three times something."
The wolf's primary solution. That's how they prevent the injury.
The edgeman Adama Traoré, who plays with Wolves in the English department, is a hugely fast player.
His opposers have had it to seize him to make sure that he does not get past them.
As a result, his shoulders have fallen apart several times, but now the wolves have brought a solution to the problem.
The Sun reports this.
In the Wolves game against Crystal Palace, the paramedics could see something lubricating on their shoulders at Traoré.
"This is something we had to do to protect Traoré," says a Wolves source, who was carrying child oil.
“ Making it slippery makes it harder for defenders to grasp it, and so we can prevent further injury. ”
His shoulder Traoré fell out first when Wolves played against Tottenham in December.
Since then, the shoulder has dropped out four times, now last against Sheffield United earlier this month.
News of Harry England’s Origin: A friend of the Duke of Sussex protests the assertions of a new book that has been between the teeth of people
Stott, in a conversation with Sky News, said that the contents of the book about Prince Harry and Meghan Markle were in no way different from the contents of the gossip, the only difference being that the book was enclosed.
The former soldier wants the sea to be increasingly focused on the positive things that his wife and his wife have done, such as their charitable work.
Stott said: “I don’t think what’s happening there is different from what we read in the gossip magazines, except now in a bound book. ”
“There’s a storyteller there, but there’s nothing certain that this has come from them.”
“I think it’s just another attack on them, just like the gossip that haunts them.”
“ I realize they’re in the spotlight and people want to know what they’re doing, but I wish that it would be more about all the good they’ve done and their charity work, rather than their personal issues. ”
"Of course, they will never get out of it, because of their position."
The support of the duke and the duchess of Sussex overshadowed another member of the royal family, according to an expert in the history of the royal family.
Dr. Kate Williams told Sky News that the royal family had not been able to benefit from the popularity of the stars of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle.
She added that the rule of power within the royal family was firmly established, but it was not possible to control the weight of public interest.
She also said: “The fact is that everything they did in support of the queen tended to overshadow other members of the royal family, and this was considered a problem. ”
"They are extremely popular."
“ They had less weddings than most siblings in the same position, Andrew had a huge wedding, Anne also had a huge wedding. ”
“ But while Harry and Meghan were smaller in size than William and Katrina, the news was as much because of the world’s interest in the couple. ”
Donald Trump admits that he often regrets his voice on Twitter
Donald Trump has admitted that he often regrets his Twitter records as a source of war.
During a Friday interview with Barstool Sports, the president of the United States said that his unattended reprints on Twitter — some of which have contained material from white racial minds — would cause him the greatest trouble.
When the reporter Dave Portnoy asked him if he could see for his records, Trump replied: “Frequently, too often.
It was so in the old days, before this came, that you wrote a letter saying that this letter was very large.
You put it on your desk and then you came back the next day and said, "Oh, how glad I am that I didn't send it," right?
But we don't do it on Twitter.
We send it out right away, we feel great, and then you start getting calls — “Did you really say that? ”
I say, "What's wrong with this?" and you'll find out something.
Last month, Trump caused a great deal of anger after reintroducing an account (divided material from another account) with a video of his supporters in the Villages area of Florida, where an elderly couple called "White Power!" or "White Power".
And in 2017, Trump renewed three posts directed against Muslims, published by Jaydu Fransen, leader of the right-wing British First.
The president told Portnoy that the rebirths that would have caused him the greatest trouble.
Trump said: “You see something that looks good and doesn’t study it, you understand, and you don’t know exactly what’s on your helmet, which is a little bit, and you don’t grow it, sometimes — I’ve found out that it’s almost always the rebuffs that get you into trouble. ”
The president often shares praise for himself, a voice about his opposers, and the teachings of conspiracy with 80 million of his followers on Twitter.
Trump says Twitter helps him get through the so - called “false news ” in television programs and newspapers, which he says are distorted by falsehood.
But the President’s own lies have often come under the microscope, and now Twitter means Trump’s records are misleading.
The GPS system may be insecure
A lot of countries are working to develop a different location technology than the GPS system.
Engineering lecturer says there might be a reason to worry about the security of the GPS system, which is owned by the U.S. Army.
The old Loran system has been revitalized.
GPS technology is tracking us every step of the way.
We use it when we fly, sail and drive, in surveying, in industry, and in leisure.
Most people think that it is a military device owned by the U.S. Army, which first opened it for general use in the 1980 ’ s.
GPS technology uses satellite coordinates at 20,000 miles [20,000 km] above ground, so conditions in nature have little effect on it.
“ But it’s very easy to disturb her.
And malicious people can easily interfere with the reception of these signals," says Sæmundur E. Thorsteinsson, professor of engineering at the University of Iceland, and expert on risk management and safety in communications.
He also says that it is easy to send error signals with the wrong location, such as in warfare.
“The GPS system is owned by the US Department of Defence.
They have assured the public that the system is ready at all times.
But certainly they can turn this off if it fell into the head of a very wise president to do such a thing, then he could probably do it," said Sæmundur.
Thus, many countries have begun to consider other systems and locational techniques.
Both the Russians and the Chinese operate their own satellite systems, and the European Union is pushing off the Galileo location system.
“The Galileo system is primarily built for civil use.
It may have more precision and, of course, is under the control of the European Union.
Then it's not one government that rules it completely, it's many," says Sæmundur.
But a lot of people are also looking back at the old loran technology.
It is based on radio waves and was used from the 1960s until the GPS technology took over.
The loran-signs are sent on very long waves from sent down to the ground.
“ It’s a new version of the Loran system called eLoran, which stands for Enhanced Loran, that people are seriously looking at it in many countries as a system of backup, because it’s a bit different to interrupting it, it’s much harder than disrupting the satellite system, ” says Sæmundur.
However, it is probably safest to have access to as many locations as possible.
The experienced Senator Vern Buchanan died of the coroner virus
“ Gary was a professional at fingertips and a loyal servant of the public, ” said Buchanan on Facebook.
“ He touched the lives of so many and was loved and admired by those who knew him.
I will never forget how uplifting he was, the sense of humor and the sheer joy he had in helping others."
Buchanan’s office published a report earlier in the month stating that Tibbett had had no recent contact with others in the office.
Tibbett, who worked outside the office, had worked for Buchanan since 2011.
Florida has reported 414,511 cases since the onset of the pandemic, which is more than 411,200 cases in New York, according to national health authorities.
Data from the State Health Administration show that hospitalisation has increased by 79% since the U.S. National Festival Day, July 4.
The data also show that at least 50 ICUs in Florida reached tolerances on Saturday.
"We informed them that this could have an impact," said DeSantis in June.
“At the same time, police work and the imposition of countermeasures could have an adverse effect.”
Flights from Hornafjord to Cape Town
A dove, a rosary, a dove, a cross - nose, a glass jar, and the tears are among the birds that have wandered this summer to land.
The site of the Birds of the South East.is is home to a few short news reports about the contaminants, where they have been seen and sometimes their gender.
They're a lot of bird lovers in Iceland.
To this end, the number of people who like the Facebook page Icelandic bird species can be mentioned.
The number of members of the group is about 14,600.
It shares pictures of birds, and it is evident that Iceland is dominated by good photographers who have the patience needed to make birds.
Brynjölf Brynjölfsson is one of them.
As he is called, a staff member is a Southeastern and Southeastern Birds ’ Association, and he carefully monitors bird life in that area.
He speaks beautifully of these creatures that enrich the life of Iceland and play an important role there, and then it doesn’t matter whether the bird is a large and large bird of prey or a small sparrow.
It was founded in 2005 on the birthday of Half Dán Björnsson in the Krýskerk in Öreva, with the aim of sustaining and continuing the significant natural research that he conducted from 1940 onward.
“ Fifteen years old was thirteen when he began to gather information about birds, ” says Brynjulf in a conversation with the nucleus.
“We at the Birds Control Centre are not doing exactly what Half Death did but are building on his data by counting and marking birds.”
Half - dead was a farmer and a translator, born on March 14, 1927.
He wrote numerous scientific articles about plants, insects, and bird life.
He died on February 10, 2017, at less than nine years of age.
Half dead and his siblings in the Quakers aroused the interest of many who became acquainted with Icelandic nature.
This group includes Björn Gísli Arnarson, the "employee" of the Birds ’ Eye.
Bear grew up on Reynvillal in the South, and he was given ample natural shelter by his neighbors, Half - Death on the River.
What, though, is the work of the Southeast Bird - Ladder Center?
By March 20, each year, the Bird - Ladder Center sets up a special bird nest in Einarslund, a tree - grove located within the Port of Horna.
It contains standard meanings for the birds entering the nets.
The nets are taken down around May 10 at the beginning of the warp season.
The nets are up every day, at least from about six in the morning until noon.
And they have to visit every hour.
The birds in them are marked, measured, and then released into freedom.
Every hour, a journalist asks the forerunner.
“Yes, we share this with ourselves, Me and Bjössi.
Since we now have to work for ourselves, this can be a lot of puzzles, but somehow we manage to do it," says Brynjulf.
The nets are then reestablished from August 1 to November 10 — every day that weather permits.
Between watching the nets and the periods they are not up to, Brynjölf and Björn are marking the crayons, foams, and various motbirds where they reach them.
In addition, they take on a number of special tasks.
One of these projects is carried out in cooperation with the Icelandic Institute of Natural Sciences and is about collecting forest species of birds.
“The ticker jumps on the birds at their winter stations and then takes them here to land in the spring.
This will happen shortly before they leave, and that is why these ticks are not big when they arrive in Iceland.
Then he jumps off the bird and tries to find himself another host when he needs it."
But enough for ticks.
Asked how the birds in the South East were doing this summer, Brynjulf says that the crane’s pitch seems to be going well — over the head.
“ The nest’s share here is at Hala in the South, where everything is going well.
But there's nothing to be found any more at Jökulsárlon, where a few years ago there was a huge pitch."
He says that a few years ago there was more than a thousand catapults, but now they can be counted on the fingers of one hand.
“When we look at moose and waterfowl, I think it’s reduced in the last few years what you find out about them.
But, of course, there's always a change between years."
According to Brynjölf, what can explain this great change is probably about food supply.
"It's all about food."
Then, too, man’s work may have to do with the offspring of birds and other animals.
Some birds, however, seem to have a pretty good time in Southeast that summer.
“One of the things that I think is positive is that it is growing again after a great deal of depression, ” says Brynjulf, “but in the meantime the cloud has deteriorated tremendously in recent years and decades. ”
From sparrows, it is reported that, as in the past, the Marian woman seems to be going well in her throw during the summer.
The number of forest thrushes and deer had decreased somewhat, but Brynjulf says that it does not show up until the fall of this summer how they proved to be.
But let's get to the complicaters.
They often attract much attention, especially if they are very ignorant and even colorful.
These two notable features have one of the most popular attractions of the summer: the Rosary.
“Others have been relatively calm during the summers in the complex, ” says Brynjulf, mentioning that the country is now finding a gray line, and then doves have been seen and are laying here.
When Brynjölf and Björn get in touch with complex people, they also mean them, just like other birds.
Meanings are international, and they are practiced worldwide.
The meanings, such as the location of the bird’s winter spots, the place where they lay, and the route of their journeys can be found.
“ You can even see how long they are on the move, ” says Brynjulf.
This information is useful in many ways, for example, when it comes to epidemics such as avian flu.
“ There’s always an increase in knowledge. ”
If someone in the world finds a bird that has been marked by the Southeast Birds Control Centre, the information is sent to Iceland’s Institute of Natural Sciences.
“We have been reclaimed from Cape Town, South Africa.
There was a cricket that we had marked.
One cry from us was later found in the United States."
One bird is Brynjulf’s particular mentality, and that’s the foam.
"The cloud is our bird," he says, pointing out that the Birds ’ Center and the Nature Laboratory of his South East country have the task of monitoring his offspring — which has become quite relaxed and is now on the list of quays.
It is difficult to say what caused a collapse in the trunk, but one theory is that the foam has made its way into the sea, which was once thrown out by fishing vessels and into the sea for good, but it has become much more useful and affects the cloud.
Are you in the best place in the country to watch birds?
“ Of course, you don’t make me say no, ” says Brynjulf, laughing, adding: “Since we’re also chasing contaminants, I guess we need to go further. ”
But surely the Southeast is special when it comes to bird life.
“This area is like being moved into the country from Europe, but then the birds are scattered from here.
Visiting birds and migratory birds is very interesting, but there is less to be found in laying birds than in other parts of the country.
It is not far from the distance to the desert, so that the area as such is suitable for the inspection of birds."
What about Brynjulf's favorite bird?
For a short time, he will think about it before answering.
That's a tough question.
“ My wing nose is my bird, for I have found nine of the ten that have been seen in the land, ” he finally answers.
“ I now find it most enjoyable to take pictures of horse - drawn fairy tales.
It's always nice to find birds that haven't been seen in the country before or are rare, so I'm not talking about finding a new species for Europe."
But they have both done so with your friends and Bjössi.
If you would like to monitor more closely the work of Binna and Bjössa at the Fuglaganungskontor South East, you can monitor their work on Facebook and on the Birds web site.
Saudi Arabia – The Sun’s Beach of the Future? No Alcohol or Bikini
The tourism industry has grown enormously around the world in recent years and now the authorities in Saudi Arabia want their share of the cake.
Consider the destruction of authorities that account for some 60,000 billion dollars to create a tourist paradise in the country.
The Guardian reports this.
But this tourist paradise will not be in the style that the Icelandics and Ilanders are supposed to get used to in southern Europe.
Alcohol will not be available, and women will not be allowed to sunbathe in bikinium.
How, then, should tourists be lured into this strictly religious Islamic country?
This should be done, for example, by building a new city where white beaches, moons (of course, made by humans), drone cars, and robots that serve people.
The Guardian says that it is Mohammed bin Salman, Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia who wants to invest in this investment.
Of course, the money will be brought to the oily land.
The Crown Prince says that it is not a question of women not being able to cover shoulders and knees in public places, but at the same time admits that it is not a simple matter to create a tourist paradise in the country because it is too hot when the sun is high and it cannot be relied on for wind.
But it may be wondered whether it would not also diminish the interest of prospective tourists if they could not buy alcohol.
Francois Bozize, formerly elected by the Presidential Council of the Central African Republic, reports on the presentation of the President
The former president of the Central African Republic, Francois Bozize, who had been thrown out of prison, announced on Saturday that he would be present in the presidential elections in December, despite the United Nations' use of sanctions and the fact that an arrest warrant had been issued for his perpetrated crimes against humanity.
He announced his offer in a speech to a large group of supporters at his party, Kwa na Kwa (“work, only work”), in the capital of Bangui.
This 73 - year - old former general and general was removed from office in 2013 in the rebellion of the alliance of the largest Muslim rebels from the north who plunged the majority of the nation into a violent civil war and a severe and long - lasting humanitarian crisis.
"The country needs a man of experience, peace and conviction," said Bozize in a speech critical of the President's current term of office, Faustin-Archange Touadera.
Bozize first took over after the election in 2003 and served as president for 10 years before he fled the country in 2013.
The new government sought to arrest him for alleged crimes against mankind and for inciting genocide, but he has not been arrested since his return from exile in the latter part of the year.
It is not clear how the arrest order or foreign punishments affect his service.
In January, Bozize said that he would ask the United Nations to cancel the sanctions imposed in 2014 for alleged support of armed Christian groups of Anti-Balaka.
Today, Touadera is steering the country with the support of extensive peacekeeping of the United Nations, which counts more than 13,000 military and police officers.
He was elected in 2016 and is expected to be present for a different term, but his offer has not been confirmed.
The first round of the elections will be December 27.
In February 2019, the government signed a peace agreement with 14 armed groups who generally claim to defend the interests of certain communities or religions.
Since then, violent crime has been reduced, but bloody incidents are still taking place, most of which are due to resource conflicts, but the majority of this diamond - rich country is not under the government’s authority.
Violence has forced more than 1.5 million people to flee their homes.
The situation of Gareth Bale at Real Madrid is 'unacceptable to all', says Toni Kroos.
Toni Kroos, middleman of Real Madrid, says that Gareth Bale’s position with the Spanish team is “unacceptable to all. ”
Bale did not participate in any of the last seven games of the team and he participated little in the LaLiga celebration of Los Blancos, and now this summer the gamer has come to the conclusion that the player intends to stay and let his contract expire, but the party hopes that he will go on track.
“ There’s no way to avoid an unacceptable situation for everyone,” said Kroos in the Lauschangriff Endlich was mit Sport.
“ He wasn’t bought to play as little as he is now.
I think he really wanted to leave the club last summer and that the club actually said 'yes' but so said 'no' later.
I don't know if he's still a little angry about it.
When asked if the situation had had a negative effect on Real’s atmosphere, Kroos said: “Not as much as it could be expected.
I've known him for six years, and we've worked a lot of important things together."
In China, Reykjanesby gives 2,000 face masks to support the fight against the corona virus
Chinese ambassador Jin Zhijian handed over two thousand face masks to Mayor Reykjanes over the past week.
The reason was the visit of the mayor to the Chinese embassy on July 22, last year.
The news of the week first reported.
The city’s visit to Reykjanesby was due to reimbursing the Chinese ambassador’s visit to Reykjanesby, where he visited the town hall and met with the mayor.
News reports that there was a discussion of promoting friendly township cooperation between Reykjanes and Xianyang City, but the communities began working together between 2014.
The gift, 2,000 face masks, is rooted in this friendship collaboration, but the Xianyang city authorities wanted to give masks and thus support the fight against the coronation virus epidemic.
Reports in the news of the Victim News that masks will be used in the sensitive institutions and workplaces of the Reykjanese community for both employees and other guests who will be there.
In addition, the accompanying picture shows the flag of Iceland and the People’s Republic of China, the inscription on the face mask box, which reads, “Ber is the one behind it, except for a brother. ”
Thomsen wants to leave KR - Calculates to lower the salary
Tobias Thomsen is going to try to get home to Denmark, from Iceland’s KR, next month and says he is interested in Danish 1st.
Thomsen has been playing in Iceland since 2017 and has become an Icelandic champion both with Val and KR.
However, this 27 - year - old visitor says that he is beginning to miss Denmark and wants to move there with his girlfriend, the daughter of Stephen Jacob.
Danan’s contract with K.R. is valid until the end of this season, so it is clear that a Danish company would have to negotiate with K.R. for its purchase price in August, before a new season begins in Denmark.
Otherwise Thomsen would have to wait until winter to get to Denmark.
“Yes, I know that the Danish departments will start again at the end of August.
That means, of course, that I would have to cancel my contract with the KRs, but I've told them I miss Denmark, and they have a full understanding of it," said Thomsen to the ball.dk.
He added that he had a very good relationship with a coach named Rúnar Kristinsson, who had shown a full understanding of the situation, and Thomsen said that he did not think that the purchase price would be a big problem.
“ I’ve also had conversations with two 1st Branches since that department was finished and I knew where they would end.
There has been some interest already in the coming period, so it may well be that I go to Denmark before the Icelandic division stops," said Thomsen but added that it is clear that there are not many companies in Denmark that could buy up his contract with KR.
“It’s not quite clear right now, but it’s been an interest.
I also need to find the best opportunity for me and my girlfriend, who is from Iceland and comes with me.
This depends on some things," said Thomsen and said to look primarily at the Copenhagen port.
Thomsen said KR-inga didn't have to worry that he wouldn't give up all the exercises and games, even though he missed Danmark.
“KR knows what it gets from me, and it’s that I do things 100 percent.
I can totally overlook the fact that I miss Denmark when I'm in practice or in games," said Thomsen, who realizes that he's going to cut his salary by leaving the Icelandic champions in the next department of Denmark.
“ I’ll probably have to lower only in salary, because of the coronary virus crisis that seems to have scared Danish companies a little more than Icelandic.
But I’m also studying, and one solution might be that a company got me a job.
Most of the 1st class have an agreement with the sponsor.
I'm learning sports management through the game club and I'm finishing the bachelor degree," said Thomsen.
Thomsen has only been in the K.R. in two games in Pepsi Max during this season, but he has played five games and scored one goal.
He started 21 games for the team last year and scored seven goals.
KR is an equal choice to the top of the Pepsi Max department and to the top of the game for good, but the team meets KA at Akureyri today.
Dealing with the corona virus on board a bus when a driver gets into a hot argument about a face mask
The video shows passengers and drivers onboard the Arriva Street Wagon in Liverpool taking on mask use.
The driver is told to explain to a woman that it is not his job to tell passengers to wear a mask.
The driver said: “It’s not my job to tell everyone who gets into the wagon to wear a mask. ”
Regarding the incident, a Witness said: “A man and an older woman began to see her, and much quarrel broke out. ”
“ The driver had to leave his seat and came to ask what was going on and he told one woman that she wasn’t even using the mask right. ”
“That woman then jumped out of the wagon and said she was going to report the incident.”
A spokesman for Arriva said: “The safety of our customers and employees is as much our priority as ever.
"Our customers are obliged to use masks when using public transport (exceptions apply)."
"Experience of customer guidance and labelling on this matter and all other distance rules are on board the streets, on the community media and on our website."
A duty to mask has been in force in public transportation since June 15.
More than 16.3 cases of COVID-19 have been identified worldwide.
More than 650,000 have died.
More than 9,900,000 people have recovered from the corona virus worldwide.
Most cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the United States, or more than 4.3 million.
Octavia Spencer calls for Hollywood to hire people with disabilities more often in roles
The actress participates in a new effort to increase the participation of people with disabilities in the entertainment sector.
The campaign is underway at the same time as 30 years have passed since the United States Law on Disability Rights, which applies on Sunday.
In the video, Spencer discusses the importance of people’s seeing themselves and their lives reflected in a real way on the screen.
“ Nothing can replace personal experience and real - life displays, ” she says.
“That’s why it’s so important to hire a suitable actor in an appropriate role.”
Spencer discussed the effect she had of seeing skin - black people on the screen when she was a little girl watching the “Good Times ” feature.
The events shown at CBS between 1974 and 1979 were made by Norman Lear, and they paved the way as the first comedy shows showing two parents of both African backgrounds.
An organization against hunger push Yoho aside after an incident in the Assembly Hall
WASHINGTON (AP) — Regardless of the Christian organization that wants to end hunger, Saturday Saturday they said that they had asked Senator Ted Yoho to resign from the government of the organization, and that he had done so, after what they called the “attack” of Senator Alexandriu Ocasio-Cortez.
Ocasio-Cortez, New York Senator of the Democratic Party, accused Yoho, Congressman of the Republic of Florida, of using a lowly and masculine harsh saying when he rebuked her when they met on the steps of the House last Monday.
Yoho claimed that he had not used the words quoted, but a reporter who witnessed the incident confirmed that the expression had been as she described it.
Bread for the World declared that the organization’s government had met Yoho on Friday, and he longed for it to “cause our commitment to stand with women and skin - dark people, domestically and globally, who lead us to the world with increased participation of all races and increased justice. ”
The Bread for the World website says that their “joint Christian voice ” pressure the Congress and government to end hunger in the country and worldwide.
“ Since Bread for the World is independent of a Christian organization whose aim is to reduce hunger and poverty with solid public policies, the organization upholds the respect, dignity and concern that Jesus asks us to show when dealing with people in positions of power, wherever they are on the political spectrum, ” says the Declaration.
“In our opinion, recent actions and the words of Senator Ted Yoho, reported in the media, do not reflect the moral requirements of our members of the government. ”
When the news was being processed, a spokesman for Yoho had not responded to an e - mail with an invitation to respond.
In an amazing speech in the House last Thursday, Ocasio-Cortez dramatically told us about the incident and directed her words against what she called a men's suffrage theory, which "consents to violence and violent speech against women".
More than a dozen of her colleagues agreed with her statement that the incident was an example of much too common behavior in men.
Yoho described the incident as a brief policy discussion and that “no one had been harassed, harassed, or attacked. ”
He said that he regretted having shown “a terrible attitude. ”
The 30-year-old Ocasio-Cortez is in her first season as a progressive senator and she has received both praise and reproach for her cleanness.
The 65-year-old Yoho is one of the most conservative senators of the Congress and will be placed in the holy stone after his fourth term.
Wait until 98 minutes in the locale to score the first goal of the period
Jesse Lingard had not scored or joined the English elite during this season, until he scored against Leicester today at 98 minutes in the final round of the league.
Since he scored twice against Cardiff in December 2018, Lingard had not scored in the top English league.
He entered Manchester United today as a backup when Leicester was in the finals of the Championship.
When more than seven minutes had passed, Lingard took the ball from Kasper Schmeichel’s goalkeeper Leicester and scored for the empty goal.
Jesse Lingard's long-awaited goal.
Real Madrid Players Subject to Discrimination Rules
Zinedine Zidane and his disciples in Real Madrid will be able to attend England in their second game at Manchester City, in the European Championship, without having to go to two weeks ’ sickle.
The British government has decided that tourists from Spain need to go to two weeks of disease to stop the spread of the coronary virus.
There are exceptions, however, as in the case of competition teams at the highest level of sport.
This confirmed the government’s sporting affairs with Sky Sports.
The government says that those who are exempt from the rules will only be in restricted areas, at the door.
This applies to sports stars, judges, trainers, medical teams, and the media.
Thus, the Madridians can face Manchester City on August 7 without having to stay in England for a long time, but they are 2-1 below in the final after losing on Santiago Bernabeu on February 26th.
The victory team will continue in an 8-member final in Portugal.
The rains of great rain and the land of the holy places of the merchants
From reports of overcrowded hotels and tent areas to judge, at least southwards, it is clear that the Icelandics have been able to travel domestically this summer.
Have those who have laid low at the same time been extremely lucky with the weather and the weather giver DV agreed that the summer has just been outspoken beautifully, so far at least.
But now it is time for a shopping weekend, which has so far been the biggest weekend of the year.
However, it is unclear what it will be like this year, compared with other weekends, for events that in a normal year have attracted a large number of people not to be held.
Enough to mention the festival as an example.
The weather will, of course, play a major role, but now there is a view of the rainstorm throughout the country, but especially south and south-west.
The weather room predicts a rainstorm from Thursday evening to Saturday evening at least.
It should be noted that long - term prophecy is not a sacred truth here in the north of the Atlantic Ocean and can certainly make changes.
In his prediction of his weather tissue, Blikah, the meteorologist knocks Einar Schweinbjörnsson, saying that it is humiliated to expect the weekends of merchants.
He says: A medicament in the sky with a common cold that too often goes down to the surface, leads to the arrival of warm southwestern air, only a low wind and a result.
Of course, there is also a warm air that “flies ” up here in the north.
In support of his prophecy, Einar says: “A small wave from America travels to the east and with it summer - warmed air.
As it approaches, it reaches the point of ‘ flourishing ’ in the form of lowering air pressure and relatively low summer temperatures. ”
The big prediction, the European calculation center to the left on the map, and the American GFS to the right are somewhat parallel to this development.
The understanding of the humiliation goes through the prediction late on Thursday and early on Friday with a steep A-direction and rain throughout most of the country.
The drugstore of 985 hPa will then follow.
This time, quite a warm air will follow in the North and East on Saturday and even Sunday as well.
On the other hand, it could blow together.
A man was seriously injured when a cattle car was dropped in Wexford
A man was seriously injured in a traffic accident earlier today at the Ferrycarrig Bridge in Wexford.
A cattle truck ran to the bridge and dropped into an unmanned stationary car.
The 34 - year - old driver was seriously injured in the accident, which took place around 13:50 a.m. today.
He was taken to the hospital in Wexford, where he is heavily held.

Chasing actress from Law and Order all the way to New York
"I was impressed with it as if you were getting such a childhood shot," says Birna Krönn Björnsdóttir of Mariska Hargitay, the leading actress of the series Law and Order: Special Victims Unit.
She was so stunned by the actress that she showed up at the scene and waited for her for hours, just to say hi.
When Birna Krönn Björnsdóttir, the owner of the travel agency Pink Iceland, looked like many Icelandics at the exciting show Law and Order: Special Victims Unit from the turn of the century, she was collapsing for the main actress of the show Mariska Hargitay.
Birna tells the story of her and the actress's meetings on the Love Story show on Channel 1.
When Birna was a teenager herself, at the age when many began to develop intense love shots, she did not experience it as her peers, for she was hard to suppress her own feelings.
She pretended to be interested in boy bands and young amazing movie heartbreakers, but she did not have them at all.
“ I was cutting poppies and hanging pictures on the wall of Backstreet boys and Jared Leto.
But there was nothing behind it, it was just me hiding that I was a lesbian."
She says that sometimes it is said that when people come out of the closet, they go through the late estuary.
“ We spend our teenage years suppressing these teens, these shots and stuff.
I think it was one of the things that drew me to her," says Birna about the actress.
“And there was something about her.
I thought she was a good actress, beautiful and warm, and I was just shot at her."
When she was in New York a few years ago, the actress ran a string.
One of her best friends, Erling Ottar Thoroddsen, was shooting a movie there and getting Birna and their friend, Gunnar Helga Guðjónsson, to help with the shooting.
“We were working on a 30 - year - old film crew and spending some time with strangers.
This is a naturally intimate atmosphere when you spend so long a day together, so it was talked about everything and nothing."
One day, Birna is a huge admirer of Mariska.
One woman on the film tells her friend that he knows the actress because he was on the film team.
Birna could not stop thinking about that fact and regularly ask her new friend how her friend would like to work with the actress and whether Birna could get to meet her.
"She tells me to stop, she doesn't know if she can let it happen," says Birna.
When the film is finally finished, the group will toast, and Birna will try to convince the woman to try to get around the meeting.
"She had had a few glasses and said she would just fix it."
A few days later, Birna sends the woman a message asking if something is happening.
The woman does not respond, and Birna decides to give up.
One morning, she wakes up with a long - awaited message.
“I watch the phone and scream out.
Gunnar Helgi wakes up with a scream, and I say, "I have to shower and I have to make myself nice and go down to town."
The woman had then written to Birna that her friend, actors, and recording team Law and Order were present at a hotel in Times Square.
“I don’t know when they start or when they quit, but this is the name of the hotel, you go well,” says the message, and Birna dresses up in a hurry.
She sits down and waits until a member of the staff comes to her and asks this uninvited woman if she can help.
"I say I'm looking for Jason and asked the woman to tell him that Birna from Iceland is here."
When the friend finally arrives, he looks at Birna with surprise and asks how she got to the end of the set to be strict security.
Birna explains that she just took the elevator and asked to see Mariska.
“Yes, I don’t know.
"Sit here," says the friend, "and Birna's gonna sit down.
At her side, an extra player sits in the show, and they start talking.
"I say to him, 'I am a fan, but you?' says Birna.
"I played it as if it were the most normal thing in the world."
We're running out of time, and Birna's waiting.
The actors perform regularly when a break is made, they have a snack, and Birna looks around and looks for Mariska, which is nowhere to be seen.
Finally, the friend comes and tells her that he is leaving sadly.
Bears asked him to hand over to another employee because she did not think of going anywhere right away.
Surprisingly, the friend agrees and gets another employee.
"He comes with his second friend and says, "This is the woman from Iceland who wants to see Mariska."
Then he goes.
Finally, after two hours of waiting, the new friend comes running to Birna.
“ He says: ‘ Hurry!
This is an unusual situation today, there are reporters with her so she won't stop anything.
She's going straight to the car with them, so you have to take the chance and go down and find her trailer.
It's white and it's marked.
Hurry up."
"So I look to the right and lose my face" Birna starts off and takes the elevator down to Times Square.
There she finds about forty bicycle homes, some marked and some not.
However, Mariska’s trailer does not find her, and she begins to feel desperate.
“ I feel the breakdown overflowing because I had spent half a day in this, but then I thought, well, I tried.
That was fun."
The bad news keeps Birna back towards the hotel, where she sees through the window the film crew look at her with pity eyes, and it is clear that Birna failed to do her job.
A bear accepts fate, and it begins to rain.
“I go under cover to cover myself from the rain.
Then I look right and lose my face."
No one but Mariska Hargitay stood there in her pantsuit, which she wears in the parts, and Birna knew well — but Birna could hardly move with emotion.
“ I look at my body and my hands and think now you have to move.
Now you must go towards her."
Bears do that and look forward to pecking at the actress’s shoulder.
“She looks at me and I can hardly say anything.
But I just say hello," Birna recalls.
“I say I’m from Iceland and a big fan.
She says, "It's so nice to meet you."
The conversation did not go much further, for Mariska’s car is here, and it is whistled on.
Turning to Birna, Mariska says: “I have to go, but it was really nice to meet you. ”
Birna says goodbye to the idol, watches the car drive away, and then collapses.
“ I’m calling Erling and Gunna, and they thought it couldn’t be done.
But I was crying with excitement and joy.
I say, yes, I met her. You have to see me now.
Then we toasted in soda and tequila," says Birna.
She does not regret anything, although she admits that she would probably not repeat the game.
“It’s like this once in a lifetime, sacrificing such time and energy to make such a thing happen.
But I'll always be an admirer of this woman."
Anna Marsibil Clausen spoke to Birna Krönn Bear's daughter on the Channel 1 Love Story.
Police don't spread the virus.
There is no reason to worry that the crown virus may be transmitted by the police by means of alcoholic beverages.
This is said by a police officer in the police force in the capital area in conversation with mbl.is.
Indications have been received from people who are concerned that the same mouthpiece is used for all drivers when the police get around, get on the road, and let anyone who is on the road blow.
The police, however, say that hygiene is the best way to do it.
“ It’s not really a special mouthpiece, ” said a police officer, “but we recommend a cup that people blow into. ”
“Some people want to put their lips to this, but we guide people to keep a little distance, up to a few tens of centimeters.”
Asked if there is enough distance, says a police officer.
If you have a positive view, the police will use it to a different extent.
He has a mouthpiece, but it comes from a sealed plastic bag and is used only once.
Abdominal distension: Anise can be absorbed to reduce pain
The association with depression is not a coincidence.
Individuals suffering from inflammatory bowel disease, which is a condition characterised by abdominal pain, convulsions, bloating, flatulence, constipation and diarrhoea, often experience anxiety and depression, which may lead to worsening symptoms of the American Anxiety and Depression Association (ADAA).
“This is because the colon is partly controlled by the nervous system that responds to stress, ” explains ADAA.
If temban does not decrease, food intolerance may occur.
The judge is trying to stop the ruling that children are being released from the immigration authorities.
In his Saturday ruling, Judge Dolly Gee invalidated the expected deadline by saying that immigration and customs authorities in the United States do not need to release children if it is not possible to do so by any of the three means described in her previous order.
However, Gee also stressed the need for the immigration and customs authorities to remain obliged to release their children without undue delay.
The three ways that Gee set out are to release families that are kept under the control of immigration and customs authorities, to release children from the responsibility of a responsible person or to release families to the federal court.
Shalyn Fluharty, director of the Proyecto Dilley Agency, who provides legal services to families, condemned the decision and told it to leave it to the immigration and customs authorities to decide whether children should continue to be held.
“I believe that children are being held for a while and that they will not be released unless the immigration and customs authorities agree or families agree to be taken apart,” said Fluharty.
Families are kept in three positions of the immigration and customs authorities in Berks, Pennsylvania, South Texas (Dilley) and the Carnes County, Texas.
The children in these places are between 1 and 17 years of age, according to lawyers and legal advisers.
In June, Mr Gee, who supervises the implementation of the Flores Convention on the Care of Children, said that, since "rules on masking and social exclusion are not or are not well followed" it was urgent to move children from these establishments.
969 persons detained by the immigration and customs authorities have been diagnosed with the coronary virus and are in isolation or surveillance as of 23 July, according to the authorities of immigration and customs.
Of these, 25 are confirmed cases in Karnes, one in Dilley, and two in detention centers for families.
Overall, more than 3700 cases have been confirmed in custody
Will consider the law on government independence
The prime minister does not unnaturally say that pension funds set a benchmark in their investment policy on the rights of workers.
Notes from the Bank Manager on the need to ensure the independence of the governors of pension funds, possibly by law, will be taken into consideration.
After Icelandair concluded talks with the Icelandic Airlines and denounced all flight attendants, the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors of Icelandair, or voted against the participation of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors of Icelandair.
Ragnar Thor Ingolfsson, president of VR, went on to say that if they did not comply with the recommendations, the rulers would be replaced.
Ragnar Thor withdrew his declaration three days later, as did the government of VR.
Ásgeir Jonsson, banker of the bank, said on Friday in the news of RUV that independence from the government would have to be guaranteed in the approved funds and possibly through legal changes.
The Prime Minister’s daughter, Katrin Jakobs, says it is important that the governors of pension funds are independent, but they already feel that this is legally guaranteed.
"Now, the bank manager, who is of course dealing with the Financial Supervisory Authority, has said that it is necessary to look at the rules around this independence, we will of course take it into consideration if something has to go over there," she says.
Katrin says that according to law, pension funds should set moral standards in their investment policy.
It is desirable that it discusses the social and moral criteria that they want to highlight in their investments.
“ I didn’t think anything abnormal about the same thing that pension funds also set out criteria in their investment policy on the rights of workers.
But I think it's normal for such decisions to be made through a policy rather than through individual investment decisions," says Katrin.
'Unbearable traffic jams at Elfásár Bridge,' said the President of the City Council of the Year.
Helgi S. Haraldsson, president of the City Council of the Year, says a traffic jam that forms at the Elf - harbour Bridge on Selfoss daily is totally intolerable.
He hopes to make an offer because of a new bridge over the River Elf into the fall.
As Icelanders travel through their country, and there are heavy traffic on the country’s highways, there is daily traffic congestion at the Elf - syrb Bridge when drivers are on their way to Selfoss or through the community.
Long lines are formed at the edge and can take the patience of the drivers to wait in a row.
“Yes, it’s totally intolerable, it’s a traffic jam here and not just on Fridays, because it’s only become in working days as well.
It's a long way to go, sometimes completely on Hellisheiði for those who want to get here on their way east to land and those who are coming west, so that it gives us a way to get a new bridge and not later than last night," says Helgi S. Haraldsson, president of the city council in Årborg.
Helgi says that the city authorities in the city recently met with the director of the Road Administration and the designer of the Road Administration, and that meeting was very positive.
“If you’ve ever been optimistic that it’s been working on these issues, then I think I can say it now because it’s really working on this and we should be able to see that a new bridge is being invited out in the fall.”
But is there any counsel on the part of the drivers who are in the line at the Bridge of Olives all the days of the summer?
"Yes, you can go through the stencils and through the Soundstream, it's fast, but those who are going east can't be told to go through the Valley of the Low Plains, but those who are going into the tracts should use Mosfellsheijð, the House of Commons and the Low Plains of the Low Plains".
Helgi S. Haraldsson, president of the City Council of the Year, who says the traffic jam is forming at Alfosaur Bridge at Selfoss.
Long calls are made every day at the Elf River Bridge, and drivers often have to wait for a considerable amount of time to get over the bridge.
Then the only advice is to take a deep breath and think positively.
The future of the koal bear in northern Brisbane is being organized
In addition to the area’s vital home of koal bears, swishes, and gray gecko, the city government said that it was an important link between the natural areas of Cabbage Tree Creek and Albany Creek.
Operators have called for the rejection of the municipal government to the Court of Justice on organisational and environmental issues, arguing that the construction is in line with the 2014 Urban Organisation Act, would meet the organisational and social needs that have not been met and “could be done without undue impact”.
There is a great deal of opposition to these planned projects in the neighbourhood.
The executives argue that although the arrangement is fully consistent, it could be changed if it did not meet the requirements rather than reject them.
At present, the work involves many points, including a service center, child care, and 39 homes.
Official submissions were more than 120 at the time of the convention, and most objected to the proposal because it was too large and inappropriate for the area.
The leader of the minority in Brisbane City’s government said that the city would have to buy the land to protect the koala bears.
“[Citizen] Adrian Schrinner has to stop wasting taxpayers’ funds in battle with the executioner before the court and buy this land to protect the natural and animal life of Brisbane,” said city councilman Cassidy.
“This is one of the most important home of koal bears in the Mountain to Mangroves natural area, and there are numerous koal bears.”
Schrinner said in the week that the city government wanted to bring home the koal bears in the area to be protected.
"We didn't think it was suitable for the area," said Schrinner.
“I understand that this is now going through the judicial system and obviously we hope that it will result in a good and positive outcome that will preserve the home. ”
Schrinner said that mapping the home of koal bear is the common responsibility of the city government and government, but that the government is responsible for accurate maps of the home of koal bears supported by local authorities when they accept applications for treatment.
Solskär: The next step is to win something
Ole Gunnar Solskjær, coach Man Utd, was hoping that the team would secure third place in the English elite today.
The team will therefore play in the European Championship in the next period.
United needed a match or victory against Leicester today and was the result of a 2-0 victory of the Red Devils.
“It’s a great achievement for the players to get third in terms of the situation during the season.
I think we boys might have gotten over a spiritual heel by winning such a big game, since we've lost twice in the first place during this period.
We knew we'd have to finish today, now we can start the next chapter that's with these boys to win the titles," said the Solskjær winner.
Manchester United still has the opportunity to win a title during this period, but the past play in the European Union in August and is almost finished in the 8th team there.
Weapon break begins at midnight in war - torn Eastern Ukraine
Kiev, Ukraine — Ukraine’s army and opposition forces in eastern Ukraine are now preparing a “complete” ceasefire that will begin at midnight and that representatives hope to be the first step towards peace after a six - year conflict.
On Sunday, representatives of the Resistance said that they had ordered their soldiers a ceasefire and issued an order for a ban on the use of weapons.
Ukraine’s army said that it had “prepareded ” for the ceasefire.
If this were achieved, it would "prove the way for the implementation of other provisions" of the Minsk Peace Agreement, as declared by the President of Ukraine's office earlier this week, when the ceasefire was called a pacepiece.
The aim of the Minsk Peace Agreement, which was carried out in 2015 by France and Germany, was to resolve the conflict between Ukraine and the separatists in Russia, which began in 2014 following the integration of Russia into the Crimean region and the support of the country to the separatists.
More than 14,000 people have died in the conflict.
The presidents of Russia and Ukraine both welcomed the ceasefire in a call on Sunday and stressed the importance of implementing the agreement reached at the Paris meeting in December.
Vladimir Putin, President of Russia, expressed concern at the appeal made by Kiev that the Minks Convention should be reviewed and said that the position of President Volodimir Selenskiy, Ukraine, on "the inviolability of the Minsk Convention, which he again expressed in this call, should be reflected in real action".
However, Selenskiy stressed the need to take 'further action' to free the Ukrainians who are prisoners of the rebels in eastern Ukraine, in the indigenous Crimea and in Russia, as declared by the President's office.
According to the 2015 agreement, Ukraine can only gain control of the border with Russia in the areas that its separatists have in their hands once they have gained extensive self-government rights and when elections have been held in the territories.
The convention reduced conflict, but the Ukrainian army and rebels have continued to split up.
When the leaders of Ukraine, Russia, France and Germany met in Paris in December to hold other talks, support was expressed for the Minsk Agreement and agreed to resume the peace process.
Selenskiy, who won the 2019 elections with the promise to end the conflict, wanted Ukraine to take control of the border for the first regional elections, but the Kremlin government demands that the agreement be concluded without any change.
The new ceasefire agreement was reached on Wednesday for the assistance of a three-sided working party, appointed by representatives of Russia and Ukraine, as well as the European Security and Cooperation Agency, and was therefore welcomed by EU officials.
The traditional Sunday blessing at St. Peter’s Square also reminded Pope Francis of the ceasefire, saying that it would have to “reconstruct trust and lay the foundation for much needed and long - lasting peace with the people. ”
Police: A man shot to death in protests in Texas
AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — A man was shot to death at protests in Texas when he approached a car and the driver in the car fired his weapon, police say.
Katrina Ratliff, police spokesperson, told reporters early Sunday that the shooting occurred just before 22:00 at a protest in Austin.
The man was taken to a hospital where he was later sentenced to death.
The car had whistled, turned down the road and then speeded the journey towards the Protestants, said witness Michael Capochiano to the newspaper Austin American-Statesman.
According to Capochiano, the man who had a rifle on him approached the vehicle and was shot by the driver.
The driver then drove away, said Capochiano.
Ratliff told the newsmen that the first report indicated that “the victim could have had a rifle ” and added that the suspect was in custody and was willing to cooperate with the police.
According to newsrooms, the group had gathered for the Black Lives Matter protests on Saturday.
The protesters were streamed live on Facebook, where they heard the whistle of the car and a few shots fired.
Mark Soup in the First Victory of Blicke in July
A moment later he won his first league victory from June 29th, when the IA was defeated, 5–3, in the Pepsi Max Division of Men at Copavogsvell tonight.
On the other hand, the locals lose their third game in a row in the league.
After winning the first three games in the league, Breitlau played five games without rejoicing and had lost three in a row for the game at IA tonight.
So it was to do or to die for Blika who came into the game with great strength.
Alexander Helgi the son of Sigurðar led the team with a nice delivery in the 11th minute after the Christian Steindorson sent him through the defense of IA.
Six minutes later, the Christian doubled the headship after the fine preparation of the Gísla Eyylf Son on the left.
There were no countries or beaches in the first half of the game, where the local press made it very difficult for them to link shipments together.
The blonds had all the power on the field and reaped the third goal in 36 minutes when Danin Thomas Mikkelsen balded in the horned hog of the Gunnlaud son of Gunnlaud.
Then, just three minutes later, the Christian son of Steindor scored his second goal and the fourth goal of Blika.
However, the story of the first half did not end there.
For the second, when Trygvi Hrafn Haraldsson scored from a whimsical game shortly before a break, Kwame Quee had then clumsily broken Viktor Jonsson inside the pond of Blika.
Thus, 4-1 was the position for Breathing at the time of the half-flow of the bile.
Only three minutes had passed by the second half when the Skageman again scored.
At that time, Sövar Jonsson’s hustle and bustle was alone and unelected in the market, and the ball was easily steered into the net by Tryggva Hrafn Haraldsson.
On the other hand, within three minutes of his break in Alexander Helga, he became a criminal.
The White Knight was judged, and Thomas Mikkelsen scored with certainty to get the Breitblick 5–2 over when only seven minutes of the second half had passed.
Five minutes after Mikkelsen's goal, the Skagemen scored again.
Anton Ari Einarsson, Blikah's goalkeeper, came under the pressure of Viktor Jonsson, and gave the ball to Viktor's foot, from which the ball was rejected in the net.
Unbelievable 5 to 3 positions were seen when less than ten minutes later, but the score was slowed down.
Despite a fine opportunity for both teams to add to the limit, including two Kwame Quee death squads from Breiðabli, they won no more and 5–3 wins of the game’s Breiðabliak finale.
A moment later, the first victory was won for less than a month, from June 29th, and the victory was over with 14 points in third place, two points from Val, which is above and three points from the top KR.
KR and Valur, however, both have a game in Blika.
The IA has to accept the third loss in a row in the division, but the team has 10 points in the eighth place, five points from the prize.
The Puppy League is not in danger despite the White House’s comments
Yesterday, the Puppy League’s producers were not in a position to stop showing the child’s material in the near future.
The declaration follows on from the statement by Kayleigh McEnany, White House media representative, that the elements dealing with, among other things, law enforcement dogs were the victims of "cancel culture".
Canadian producers of the components responded quickly to McEnany’s words and announced that their fans would not have to worry about the future of the Puppy League.
A number of television programs dealing with police activities have recently been taken out of the U.S. exhibition following a protest against police violence.
However, the pups are not included, despite the reputation of the material on the social media.
At a press conference in the White House on Friday, McEnany said that President Trump of the United States opposed “exclusion culture ” and especially when the police came.
The term refers to a person’s comments or actions or to a company that induces a strong reaction to the community media and calls for a person to be renouncing in protest.
“We saw a few weeks ago that shows at the Puppy League, child stuff about cops, were stopped.
The same goes for the Cops and Live PDs," said McEnany on Friday.
Then she added that the Danish toy manufacturer Lego took out a law enforcement agency, but there is no foot for that claim, according to the defenses of Lego.
However, the reality of Cops and Live PD has recently been taken out of the West Sea show.
Among other things, both actors argue for showing footage of real police jobs without having permission from individuals appearing there.
A total of 29 years - Sometimes jealousy and skepticism arise
A family therapist, Kristin Thomas daughter, answers readers’ questions about family, children, and love in the family corner of DV.
This time, she answers readers who have never been single.
We have been together since we were 15, have been together for 29 years, and have two children.
We know nothing but being together and feeling well, but we have both felt as if we were missing out on something.
We have never been with other people and have no comparisons as to how this might be different.
This has sometimes led to jealousy and distrust in connection with whether the other person is looking around, thinking about adultery, or even divorce, and changing.
When we discuss this, we agree to cultivate our relationship, but it is such a bruise that always hangs over us.
Do you have any advice?
Thank you for the wonderful question, and I'm glad you're so open-minded that you can discuss your complex feelings in connection with your relationship.
What would scare me would be if you were to think about this in each corner, couldn't discuss this, and even take some steps that you could so later regret.
Everything on the table, isn't it always best?
A strong self - image has the greatest prediction of happiness in the future and the stronger your self - image, the more likely you are to have a marriage mate with a strong self - image.
The reason that relationships that start in adolescence do not always last for the rest of their lives is often that people grow up in one direction or another, but in those cases where they become more cohesive, individuals can become stronger than many others.
Since your relationship is beginning to develop in your greatest formative years, it can be concluded that you have grown together and have a positive influence on each other’s personality.
In fact, we are united by the relationships in which we are.
The way I speak is shaped by the way you listen.
The way I show myself depends on the way you see me.
Relationships shape who we are.
Could you turn the example around and think: ‘ What do we have that others do not have?
What does this many years of speciality give us?
I allow myself to claim that the benefits can be a lot more than the flaws.
You have been shaping each other for years, and as a result, you can say that you are customized to one another in millimetres.
That's more than a lot of people can say.
It's worth it?
You’re talking about feeling that you’ve missed something, but it’s important to remember that major changes such as divorce and a new relationship are also accompanied by accompanying fish for which you are not necessarily excited.
You may be missing out on a new start, learning to be alone again, getting to know a new person, and putting families together.
This involves new challenges, a different problem, and possibly something new and exciting.
But this isn't just a pink cloud and happiness, no, at your age it can become a very complicated task, which can possibly never be as small as you've already done to each other.
Is it worth it?
Nor would it be advisable to focus on what you can do to increase tension, unforeseeableness, and new things in your relationship?
You haven't put your shoes on the shelf yet.
There are so many things you can do to deepen your long relationship.
What can you do in connection with that?
What do you need from your mate you're not having?
What can you do for your mate, who you have never done before?
You may need to sit down and redefine your relationship.
Do you want to spend more time alone or together?
Would you like to try something new?
Today, much more tolerance for various forms of relationship is being developed, and couples have begun to define their relationships in various ways, such as open relationships, multi-loves, or decide to temporarily terminate.
I'm not at all telling you what to do, because no expert in your solutions, but maybe it would lighten these heavy fat that dares you, if you face this and think about solutions.
What do you need so much distrust and fear disappear?
You've been together for 29 years, that must mean you're capable of things together.
Take advantage of it as strength and hold on to your deliverance.
We encourage readers to send their questions and concerns to Kristin by e-mail at: hoonbandssaela@gmail.com.
The questions will then be answered here in the family corner, of course, without name and in full confidence.
Lost the cup and broke it.
In spite of the great experience that Branislav Ivanovic has in lifting cups and celebrating titles, he lost and broke an impressive prize for joy after becoming a Russian cup master yesterday.
Ivanovic won a number of titles as a Chelsea player in 2008–2017 but then went home to Russia and joined Zenit.
There he has become Russian champion two years in a row, and yesterday he won the Cup Championship with a 1–0 win over Khimki, where the victory goal came from Artem Dzyuba’s victories in 84 minutes.
The prize in the Russian cup is made of glass, and when Ivanovic, who is the leader of Zenit, he lost the cup to the ground so that it broke, as you can see.
Ivanovic and his companions did not give it up and continued to celebrate until the night.
It's a war!
Coleen Rooney advises the lawyer Johnny Depp in the Wagatha Christie rasm of Rebekah Vardy
Coleen Rooney has asked David Sherborne to defend himself against charges of injury against Rebekah Vardy
After discussions between the football team’s partners broke out, their acquaintances expect a dramatic comeback.
Coleen Rooney has hired the astronaut in the reported Johnny Depp injury case to defend himself in his so - called Wagatha Christie legal dispute with Rebekah Vardy.
The Mail on Sunday simulates that Rooney has ordered David Sherborne to defend herself against the accusations that she has been injured against Vardy, claiming that personal information has been leaked to the media by her closed Instagram access.
A few days after the submission of the data to the Supreme Court, reports that Rebekah Vardy, married to Jamie Vardy of the Leicester City football team, suffered physically and spiritually as reported by Coleen Rooney.
The magazine reports that the five children of the 38 - year - old mother had “severe panic attacks and panic attacks, so she was afraid to leave the house ” and that then seven - month - old Vardy“ had been hospitalized three times for anxiety attacks caused by the entry and consequences. ”
In addition to being Depp's attorney in his case against The Sun, because of the claim that the actor beat his wife, Sherborne, 50, goes with the Duke and the Duchess of Sussex in their private case against the Associated Newspapers, published by The Mail on Sunday.
After conciliation between the two football owners failed, those who are familiar with a dramatic settlement in the courtroom are expected.
"If you found the Depp trial a spectacle, don't underestimate the future war of football owners," said one source.
"Now this is a real war, and Coleen doesn't give up, neither does Becky.
Coleen Rooney claimed that someone who used Instagram access Rebekah Vardy leaked inventive stories about her to the newspaper.
She was named "Wagatha Christie" after she had clarified how she spent five months gradually limiting the number of friends who could see updates on her Instagram stories, until only Vardy's account was left.
Coleen then said that he had put a false story on Instagram, which had then appeared in a gossip.
In the Vardy case, which denies participation in the case, she argues that after Rooney published the charges, she was made a blouse “with the intention of causing great harm and great suffering. ”

Biden's voting team denies "Fox News Sunday" for an interview one week after Chris Wallace's interview with Trump
In Trump’s interview with Chris Wallace last week, President Trump doubted that the expected President of the Democratic Party, Joe Biden, would manage the flood of questions Wallace had dropped on Trump.
We may never get an answer to that question — at least not for now.
On Sunday, Wallace informed the audience that Biden’s polling team had told Fox News that he was “not available ” for an interview.
"In our interview with President Trump last week, he doubted that his opponent in the Democratic Party, Joe Biden, would be in a similar situation," said Wallace.
"In the week, Biden's electoral team asked for an interview and they said that the former vice president was not available."
"We continue to ask each week," he added.
Trump’s polling team has spent months criticizing Biden for avoiding election meetings and press meetings while interviewing during the coroner’s viral epidemic.
Although Biden has recently resumed his campaign, Trump and his associates have continued to mock the former vice president for “hiding ” in their Delaware home.
Biden’s reluctance to attend public events, however, has not spoiled his presentation, as recent surveys show that Biden has a good advantage over Trump, both nationally and in major combat countries.
Real Clear Politics averages that the president was 7 percent in Florida, 6.7 percent in Pennsylvania, 8.2 in Michigan, and 6.4 in Wisconsin.
Trump worked in all four states in 2016 when he turned them over to the Republican Party when he won the White House battle.
In the latest Fox News Poll survey, Biden has a head start in Minnesota, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, outside the margin of error in all cases.
Studies also suggest that Biden has a slight head start in Ohio, North Carolina and Arizona, three other important battle states in these elections.
And the investigations indicate that formerly strong Republicans, such as Texas and Georgia, are now sharing Trump with the former vice president.
Presidential elections in which the President-in-Office will be present during the second term of office in the White House are often a vote on the President – and this seems to be the case now in 2020 in the Trump-Bidens struggle.
The most important issues have been the crown virus and the economy, which are depleted by the epidemic — and the performance and history of the president in both classes.
Kanye West and his wrestling with bipolarity
Today, musician Kanye West apologized to his wife, Kim Kardashian, for the remarks he made in a brazen manner.
Mental - health counselors believe that he takes his creative powers into his bipolar state, but a psychiatrist says it is important that people take drugs to control the disease.
The rapper Kanye West is not only one of the most original and influential musicians of his day but is no less famous as a husband of the real - life star Kim Kardashian.
Much of his personal life has taken place before open tents.
Earlier this month, when he announced that he was shy about presenting himself to the president of the United States, he gave an emphatic and unbreakable speech.
Later on, a number of peculiar facts appeared from him on Twitter, claiming, among other things, that his wife was trying to have him hospitalized.
Kim Kardashian later published a statement on Instagram asking people to show understanding to their husband and family; he had bipolar disorder, and it would be difficult for his loved ones to help him if he did not want to seek his own help.
Since then, he has publicly apologized to her.
This famous family is not alone in coping with this problem.
About one percent of people are thought to be bipolar.
Ferdinand Jonsson, a mental - health specialist at a London hospital, is well - acquainted with the disease.
“ This disease can cause such tremendous hardships for individuals and especially their families and loved ones.
This mania, or mania, can destroy relationships and work and cause tremendous grief.
And then the other sides, the depression, it's often very dangerous, because there's a high rate of suicide in that group.
So I thought it was nice for her to say that.
And it's just human and human," says Ferdinand.
The director of Psychologists Unnsteinsson himself has been battling a mental breakdown — and is a fan of Kanye West: “He seems to have a very powerful imagination.
If we are four strands of earthy counterbasses, he is a hundred strings of heavenly harps.
And he is so superlatively creative, superlatively powerful and complete in his powerful sense of union, because one will realize this connection thought which we who have been able to try to get into a state of manhood know so well."
Kanye West doesn't want to take drugs, because he thinks they're depleting his creativity.
He's been talking about the maniacs, including on the Ye album.
The heresy says it's his choice not to take drugs.
“ Many feel that it engenders this creative element of this unconventional bonding thought and superstitious creative power of the fire he has, but then naturally the flaws in it are often great suffering, and the valleys of the waves and dark cellars and darkness. ”
Ferdinand, on the other hand, says it is important that people with bipolar disorder receive treatment.
“ If you have a great deal of mania, you’re not making a great deal, you’re just on the side.
And just as when people go into major depression, people are completely paralyzed by that condition," he says.
So you'd advise Kanye West to take drugs?
"Finally," says Ferdinand.
“And especially working with someone to find the right doses, and so that there will be a balance between helping him the most, and ruining what is remembered for him and his abilities and his creative power.”

Delhi Metro pours the first pillar at the fourth stage
Delhi Metro reached an important stage in the fourth stage of construction when the first pillar was plunged into the road between Janakpuri West and R K Ashram Marg, which is being laid, according to employees on Sunday.
The pillar was cast in Keshopur and on an uplifted section between Keshopr and Mucarba Chowk on Saturday evening.
"Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) took another important step in the fourth stage of the operation when the first pillar at this stage of the expansion of the train system was plunged into the road between Janakpuri West and R K Ashram Marg," said the DMRC.
This 'important stage of implementation' was achieved in spite of a high level of labour shortage and other organizational challenges posed by the pandemic, according to employees.
The average height of the columns along this route is 10 meters.
On the other hand, the pillars will be 20 metres high at Madhuban Chowk, where the route intersects at road 1, and 25 metres at Haiderpur Badli Mor, where the route meets road 2.
At Haiderpur Badli Mor, the 28 - foot - high [28 m] highway, the largest hill in the history of Dehli Metro, is described in the Declaration.
The highest point of the train system is at Dhaula Kuan, where the road leads 7 to 23.6 meters [23.6 m].
In the context of structural engineering, pillars are vertical stress - bearing human works that support the near end of two pathways.
They form vertical human works that support the elevated bridges of the train system.
These columns can be seen on the countless highways under Deli’s railway lines.
The numbers of the columns now play an important role as a landmark for residential addresses in the Deli metropolitan area.
The 28.92 km long route from Janakpuri West to R K Ahsram Marg is an expansion of the Magenta route and 22 will be stopped.
21.18 km off the road will be raised and 7.74 km underground.
Construction work at this part began in December last year.
July 17 began working in the underground section of the road when building a crawling wall at Krishna Park Extension train station.
On 24 June, DMRC started to build up a U-carrier that would later be installed in the uplifted section of the route.
At the fourth stage of the project, 61,679 km of the new train will be set up three different routes with 45 train stations.
These new items will offer connections between the parts of the train system already operated by Delhi Metro.
Of these, 22.5 miles [22.35 km] below ground will be raised, while other parts will be raised.

"A paramedic" ambassador wants a gun, an armored car and a stab-vessel - said the subversives are the ambassadors of the "deep state"
The U.S. Secretary of Political Affairs, Jeffrey Ross Gunter, is reported to want to carry a gun on CBS news today.
“ Despite being placed in one of the safest states in the world, Jeffrey Ross Gunter has been “weaned” about his safety since he arrived in Reykjavik last year. ”
Refers CBS to 12 diplomats, government dragons, and former representatives, as well as individuals familiar with the matter.
Gunter’s conclusion was to demand from the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs that they request permission from the envoy of the paranoid to march here on land.
He must also have wanted an armored car that traveled with him between places in Iceland and a life jacket.
The U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs refused to comment on the security of the ambassador, but representatives of the U.S. government said that the ambassador was told that Iceland was a safe country and that he was safe here.
Yet, according to the Icelandic papers, a bodyguard would have been advertised, says CBS, and if it were involved in meeting the ambassador’s demands.
CBS reports that the Icelandic Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not want to comment on the matter with CBS.
However, according to their sources in this country, the U.S. news agency has said that there has been no wish for this to be received by local governments.
In addition, CBS says that Gunter was spoken of as walking about an armed force as it would offend the guest state, Iceland.
The ambassador was rewarded with ample support for Donald Trump's election fund in the 2016 presidential election.
Previously, he was a skin doctor in California.
Since Gunter took over in May, when he said that he had created an “impossible ” work environment in the embassy, he has already had seven subordinates, known as the Deputy Chief of Mission, the ambassador’s subordinates, who are also sent out by diplomats.
Were all experienced diplomats from the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs.
The first one was sent away by the ambassador “because he did not look at his appearance. ”
Had he already prepared for a year and learned Icelandic.
The next one lasted only six months.
Afterward, a rotation of staff was made, and the idea was to make Gunter measure as much as possible until he looked at one of them.
In addition, CBS says that Gunter is looking to the staff of the embassy to carry out the mission of the “deep state ” and to have undermined it against the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Washington, D.C.
The officials of the D.C. State Department are well aware of the situation in their embassy in Reykjavík, but have been hesitant to resort to the control of the embassy in the light of Gunter’s relationship with the White House.
It is also said that Gunter had trouble following the orders of the State Department in Washington, and he was said to have refused to return to D.C. while the Covid-19 epidemic was raging.
He left the embassy in the hands of his staff for several months.
When he said he was going to work from his California home, except for the Secretary of State himself, Mike Pompeo, to return.
Reverse cap
At last the order was given, Gunter turned back to Iceland in May.
His new deputy, Michelle Yerkin, came to the country this month.
CBS has not received answers to their enquiries to the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not want to communicate with CBS, or with a request for DV.
Gunter is one of the many political ambassadors appointed by the Trump government who have noted unusual behavior in recent months.
In order to produce a hard reaction, Woody Johnson noticed that he was trying to move the British open championship in golf on a golf course in Trump’s property.
The ambassador in South Africa has also been charged with firing his number two men and trying to appoint her son for the job.
42% of the U.S. ambassadors are politically appointed.
30% were politically appointed to the Obama government, and 32% to the George W. Bush government.

Poland will report on the European Convention on the Prevention of Violence against Women
The right - hand government of Poland says that the country will withdraw from the European Convention on the Prevention of Violence Against Women.
The Istanbul Treaty is the first binding law in the world to prevent violence against women, whereas the Polish Minister of Justice, Zbigniew Ziobro, describes the text as “harmful, ” demanding that schools teach children about sex from a sociological point of view.
This weekend, Ziobo said that on Monday, he would begin to prepare a formal procedure for the country to report on the agreement.
"This ideological element relates to attempts to change education in schools and leisure, to study, attitudes and convictions of young Polish generations, based on the conclusion that we believe wrong, that biological gender is old-fashioned and that everything really revolves around social gender."
Ziobo believes that the provisions of the Children's and Young People's Education Agreement, as well as family ties in the context of the LGBT people, are unacceptable.
"We also reject the LGBTs in the discussion on family links, because this is an opinion held by left activists or groups of homosexuals who want their opinions to become binding laws," he said.
The European Council said on Sunday that it was “anxious” that Poland was reluctant to tell itself about the agreement.
On Friday, in Warsaw, about 2,000 protesters, including groups of women and other groups of right - wing fighters, protested outside the offices of the right - hand organization Ordo Luris, who support the country’s declaration of the treaty.
"We won't be victims," they called.
Objections were also expressed in other cities in Poland.
Poland signed the Istanbul Convention to prevent and combat violence against women and domestic violence in December 2012 and ratified it in 2015.
Maurice Petty, engineer at the Palace of Honour, dead 81
KANSAS CITY, Kansas (AP) - Maurice Petty, a member of a quarter - mile [4 km] power that includes Lee’s father and Richard’s brother, who was the first engineer to be taken into the Nascar Palace of Honour, died on Saturday.
He was 81 years old.
Petty's family didn't give up his cause of death.
His funeral has not been reported.
While his other family members were praised for their talents behind the wheel, Maurice Petty won the nickname “Chairman ” for his talent with the wrench.
He helped his family win 198 racers and seven titles in NASCAR, and he also built machines that won the Victory of Honor Hall Companion Buddy Baker, Jim Paschal, and Pete Hamilton.
"The manager was one of the best mechanics in the history of NASCAR," said the Chairman and CEO Jim France.
“He came with the power that helped Petty Enterprises to gain their advantage in the field of sports.
Although Maurice was known for his work under the hood, he also performed various roles behind the tents and did what was necessary to get his cars on the track. ”
Maurice Petty was born on March 27, 1939, in Level Cross, North Carolina.
He followed his father on the racetrack when he was little, and his knowledge of mechanical engineering soon became a vital factor in the landing of Lee Petty in the 54 races and three championship titles.
He competed 26 times in the NASCAR Cup between 1960 and 64, was seven times in the top five seats, and 16 times in the top ten.
Soon, though, he decided to focus on what would happen under the hood rather than behind the wheel, which proved to be a trail for his older brother, who relied on his machines for his victory.
Richard, then known as the King, won the first championship with the Governor in 1964 with the Plymouth car.
They won again in 1967, two years in a series in 1970 and 1971, and gained three more titles before the end of the 1970 ’ s.
With these seven titles on their back, they share the record with Dale Earnhardt and Jimmie Johnson in the largest number of titles.
“ Maurice Petty was one of the true pioneers of NASCAR and was involved in Petty Enterprises’ career in building one of the top teams in NASCAR, ” said Winston Kelley in a statement.
“ Although Petty is registered as 212, he is entitled to over 250 victories if taken with all the machines he built for his competitors.
The manager will be remembered forever as the best engineer in the history of NASCAR."
Lee Petty died in 2000, and Patricia, Maurice Petty’s wife, died in 2014.
He was also the uncle of the former driver and the mediaman Kyle Petty and Trent Owens, captain of the truck race.
“ Although we now say good - bye to Maurice Petty, one of the true and zealous pioneers and heroes of NASCAR, his legacy and name will be preserved in our memories, held up and preserved forever, ” said Kelley.
"We sent our deepest condolences to the Petty family."

Serbia wants to increase military aircraft in growing tension in the Balkans
BELGRAD, Serbia (AP) - Serbia will strengthen its army and seek to buy more military planes as tension increases in the Balkans, said the president of Serbia on Sunday.
President Alexander Vucic said that “certain requisitions ” were in the process of buying fleets of war machines, accusing the United States and other Western states of having armed the neighboring country of Serbia, which is in NATO, as well as Kosovo, which was formerly a region of Serbia.
“The Americans, the Turks and the Germans take good care of their beloved offspring,” said Vucic, referring to Kosovo.
He said that the United States had recently handed over a number of armored cars to Kosovo security forces.
In a tour of the Serb military tankers, Vucic told his people that he could not compete with “NATO’s contributions to neighboring weapons, ” and that“ that is why we have come up against ourselves. ”
Vucic did not specify the type of military aircraft Serbia liked to buy, but the media side-facing governments say his government has publicly requested the release of 20 U.S. assault planes.
It is stated that no response was received from Washington at the request from Belgrade and that it is likely to be rejected by the purchase of a Sukhoi-25 attack aircraft from Russia.
Serbia, which advocates neutrality in military matters, has recently received a highly developed air - protection system from Russia, which has also provided jets of war, attack helicopters, and armored vehicles.
China, also an allied nation of Serbia, has been handing over the nation to military use.
U.S. officials have openly discussed the use of sanctions against Serbia in the event of more weapons coming to the country from Moscow, in particular weapons that could endanger the security of neighbouring NATO member states.
In the West and neighboring Serbia, people are anxious about the Russian and Chinese arms regimes in Serbia.
The tension is now rising in the Balkans, where civil war was fought in the 1990 ’ s.
The Atlantic Alliance was involved with Serbia to stop the bloody acts of Serbia against the Kosovo-Albana separatists in 1999.
Despite formal efforts to join the European Union, the Serbian Populist leadership has strengthened its political and military ties with the Kremlin and Beijing.
Serbia, as well as Russia and China, do not recognize the independence of Kosovo, which the United States and most Western countries have recognized.
Heart attack: The risk of this fatal condition may be reduced by eating chocolate once a week
A new study suggests that certain benefits may be good for the heart muscle.
And how could this reduce the likelihood of a heart attack?
Scientists have conducted a meta - analysis of coronary artery disease that covers more than five decades.
The main symptoms of coronary artery disease (also called ischaemic heart disease) are three: chest pain (angina), heart attack and heart failure.
Other signs of illness may include palpitations and excessive shortness of breath.
"Sucrose contains nutrients that are good for the heart, such as flavonoids, methylxanthines, polyphenols and stearic acid, which can reduce inflammation and increase good cholesterol."
Good cholesterol, also called high - concentration lipoprotein, collects and carries “bad ” cholesterol — a type of cholesterol that narrows the arteries of the heart.
The “bad” cholesterol (low - concentration lipoprotein) is broken down into the liver and then secreted from the body.
However, the new study does not evaluate the dose or type of chocolate consumed.
It is not clear whether participants ate dark chocolate, milk chocolate, or other cocoa confectionery.
The results were based on an earlier study that concluded that the intake of cocoa (which is found in chocolate) reduced the risk of a heart attack.
Scientists believe that flavonoids found in chocolate reduce blood pressure and improve vascular function.
Vascular function means how well the blood distributes oxygen and nutrients through the body and transfers waste materials away.
No life-style factors were mentioned in the results of the new study.
Dr. Alice Lichtenstein said about the data that those who had admitted to eating chocolate were more likely to have healthy body weight.
She added that they could exercise regularly and feel less stress.
"Each of these factors could have an independent effect on the health of the cardiovascular system," she added.
Coles replaces plastic toys with books in a new presentation campaign
“We have really listened and that was a key element in the preparation of a project, ” Ronson said.
“We don’t believe that people want to recycle the books – we think they will want them, but they can recover them at home if they want to.”
Ronson said that the new campaign had been in progress long before COVID-19 came up, and despite the epidemic, she believes that the timing of the new campaign was “somewhat good” because of the amount of time parents now spend with their children.
Researchers have expressed concern that consumers are getting tired of the ever - increasing toy - collecting campaigns of the largest supermarket, but Ronson says that there is no sign of fatigue yet.
"We haven't seen anything like this yet, but we keep our eyes open for this," she said.
“We report a lot of data, from week to week, months to months, to ensure that what we give off is consistent with our customers.
It was Cloes who paved the way for gathering campaigns such as Little Shop in Australia, but the first in mid - 2018 was the driving force behind the best quarterly wholesale sales from the beginning.
Woolworths followed up with Lion King Oosheis, who also helped the supermarket to boost its sales, and now lastly, the Discovery Garden campaign offers customers free plants and flowers for planting.
However, this time the new gathering campaign could be less effective as UBS operators predict an increase in sales to wholesalers in Australia during most of the financial year 2021.
Ronson said that customers can expect more diverse campaigns in the future and that campaigns such as Little Shop are likely to be less common.
“ There’s a lot of publicity campaigns around the world that we’re looking at, and we’re getting inspiration from other countries all the time, ” she said.
“We need to do this to make sure that we always do better with our customers.”
5 laps around the country this summer
The photographer and material producer Jon Ragnar Jonsson, often known as Jon From Iceland, has been more and less familiar to Iceland since the epidemic.
Jon completed his business studies at the University of Reykjavík a few years ago, but now he is working to travel and produce marketing materials for individuals and businesses.
The summer began early at Joni’s, or in April, when he traveled all over the West and stayed in his car.
For the rest of the year, he's gone about five or six laps around the country.
In addition, he has gone on countless day trips here and there.
What journey has it taken?
“ For someone like me who is always on the move and has seen everything, it’s hard to name a favorite place.
It's more weather and company that matters.
Recently, after opening roads in June, there has been a great deal of going uphill.
They are always on their way, for it is so much an adventure to get to the destination.
The last trip there is the possible favorite trip of the year, but then we went 25 together on 5 large cars up the riverside and from there to Lake Elf."
What's up with you this summer?
“ It’s very exciting for me, but I just finished my dive course with DIVE and now take a dive here and there around Iceland.
Besides, I was adding a surfboard to my “toll box ” so I’ll be more out in the sea than before.
I'm about to go on a ten - day solo journey with everything I need my back, but it's gonna come out later in the summer where I go.
Otherwise, I'll be a lot up on the highlands, because you can't look at that area all year long."
What place in Iceland is your favorite?
“ It’s always hard to pick a place, but the Jacuzzi has been a part of my life since I remember.
Every summer my family and I lived at the foot of the Breitmark glacier, and since then I have always felt good in that area.
I think it's safe to say that I've been there over 100 times."
Which place in Iceland do you recommend that people visit?
“I’m going to bring one pearl from every part of the country, but it’s: Mulagljuf in the South, Westerland Support, Aldeyjarfoss in the North, Westerland Red Sand, Westerland Snowflake and, last but not least,...
What is essential for the journey?
“I don’t go ashore unless I have the following in my car: good flashlights, hangars, lopapysa, fishing knives, incubators, refrigerators and Vådebitar... those who know me know what I’m talking about.”
Seeking 24 roses afraid of drowning off an island in Malaysia
KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) — The Malaysian authorities said on Sunday that they were looking for 25 peaceable refugees who were afraid of drowning after hopping off a boat from the tourist island of Langkawi, north of Malaysia.
Zawawi Abdullah, a high - ranking official of Malaysia’s National Sanctuary, said that the first information from the police revealed that only one of the 25 rowers who had jumped off the boat had been able to swim to land.
The man who survived sought help from the police late on Saturday and has been held while the case is being investigated, according to Zawawi.
Hundreds of thousands of Muslim seditions have fled Myanmar because of military operations, and many of them live in overcrowded refugee camps in Bangladesh.
Muslims are the majority of the inhabitants of Malaysia, which has been a frequent destination for boaters who promise refugees a better life in another country.
Zawawi said that two ships and airways were used in the search.
He said that the county sanctuaries will also alert local seamen and local authorities in the neighboring country of Thailand to assist them in their search.
He didn't provide any further information about the boat.
Last month, the authorities in Malaysia imprisoned 269 rowers and found bodies aboard a boat suspected of being used in smuggling off the coast of Langkawi, who claimed that he had been deliberately damaged so that he could not return to sea.
Malachi’s country sanctuary later said that the 269 individuals had been taken out of a larger ship with dozens of people who were thought to have died and that their bodies had been thrown into the sea.
Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin said that Malaysia could not accept any more peaceable refugees because it is struggling with the economy because of the coroner’s viral epidemic.
He said, however, that those already in the land would not be sent back to sea.
In Malaysia, more than 2 million illegal immigrants live as well as some 180,000 refugees and asylum seekers — including 101,000 roses — who are registered with the United Nations Refugee Organization.
People in Aswan collect, watch and return a shipment of chocolate to Sudan after a car accident
On the way to Sudan, with many tons of chocolate, on the international road between Aswan and Abu Simple on Sunday, at the street conventions at the village of Wadi Karkar, when the driver fell into a coma because of a heat stroke.
The villagers grouped to help the driver where he was lying and to save the produce that had been produced.
One of them, Alaa Bahr, expressed his view that the driver was “passing past our village; we could not just stand by.
We're supposed to help people in need, no matter where it comes from."
He added that the villagers had come to an ambulance to pick up the driver and then tried to save the truck’s cargo, estimated at three million Egyptian pounds.
Bahr said that the villagers had been on the scene from morning to evening and saved as much of the cargo as they could.
“ What we thought was most important was saving the driver’s life, protecting the cargo and reopening the international road, ” he said.
The villagers were willing to provide the injured driver with water and shelter, Bahr said, adding that they just wanted to make sure that he got to and from the village safely.
There were already victims at the Congress, and the coronary virus could make them worse.
"The global epidemic alone calls on our elected representatives for the leadership and vision we expect in difficult times," says a report prepared by Leonard Steinhorn, professor of communications at American University, and Mark Sobol, author and expert in organizational development and management.
“But we are also faced with other debts that are related to the inherited sin of our nation and the racial imbalance that has plagued our country from its institution.”
The study examines familiar material related to the Parliament's pitiful state of affairs: lack of real links between categories, programme limiting opportunities for communication, excessive integration of power in leadership positions, constant demands for financial resources, peer-to-peer assessments, negative effects of the daily working media, the fact that the most important elections for congressmen are often pre-elections and finally the silence of minority groups.
It is also warned that because of the pandemic, where such a system, which allows elections with the help of deputy representatives without the need for congressmen to travel to Washington, could increase the problems that exist.
If the idea of a remote conference reaches its feet, it would be a serious setback for attempts to increase inter-class communication, as stated in the report.
"For the sake of the global epidemic, the Congress was forced to transfer most of its activities to the Internet and we certainly understand why," says the report.
"But even though it was necessary, such things should not be interpreted as virtue."
The document says that the Assembly needs “more, not less, contact between parliamentarians, face - to - face. ”
They need to study each other’s territory better, have polite conversations to find common ground, and build a bond of trust that can lead to increased understanding and solutions. ”
The call for politeness was particularly relevant this week, when Ted Yoho, Senator of the Republic of Florida, attacked Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Senator of the Democrats from New York by protests and his associates in the Republican Party, to attack Liz Cheney, Senator of the Republic of Wyoming with hostile words.
Congresswoman Val Deming talks about the Vice-Presidentship, makes Trump hear it for mercy.
The Congresswoman Val Demings (Democrats, Florida) was not ashamed to discuss his interest in serving as vice president of the possible government of Joe Biden and to express sincere gratitude for being taken into office for his office.
This respected member of the black party group was interviewed by BlackPressUSA on live broadcast for the #FIYAH! Live show and told of its history, strength and commitment that has put her in the place she is today, starting with the words “You know all my history. I grew up as a daughter of a maid and a housekeeper in Jacksonville, Florida”.
Daming was one of the four prosecutors at the Donald Trump trial in January.
Regardless of whether the Senate condemns Trump, it is recorded in history that he is the fourth president to be charged.
During an interview with the NPR of his office at Capitol Hill, the ex - Attorney General was quoted as saying: “Was this worth it?
She added that despite the disappointment of the ruling, democrats were obliged to follow the case regardless of its outcome.
During the interview, Damings made it clear that she was opposed to Trump’s arrest at Roger Stone’s prison, which was sentenced to lie before the Congress (including other crimes) and his mercy on other criminals who were convicted of similar crimes, saying, “The lack of decency to reach your friends, those who have lied and cheated to cover over your iniquities. ”
Deamings is at the top of Joe Biden's list of potential candidates for vice-presidents, which also holds Karen Bass's chairman, CBC (Democrats, California), Stacey Abram's former senator, Georgia's congressman, Senators, Harris (Democrats, California), and Tammy Duckworth (Democrats, Illinois), Keisha Lance Bottom's mayor, Susan Rice's former ambassador, and some others.
However, she stated that only one person would decide who would volunteer with Joe Biden in the fall.
"It's Joe Biden."
Then she took her hand to her mouth while she laughed and seemed to whisper to those who watched the live broadcast, adding, “If you want to call... you can do it for me. ”
There is no doubt that regardless of the political views of each individual, history books view this period as a time when developments in American politics and attitudes developed.
This did not go unnoticed by Deming.
She pointed out that the number of women involved in the presentation to the vice president of the United States is an opportunity to break through what remains of the “glass roof ” — especially for women of African origin.
“ It’s precisely this opportunity that I work so hard to create my whole life for young boys and girls who have heard that their color is wrong, that they don’t have enough money or that they’re of the wrong sex, ” she said.
The Assembly decided to ensure that the Democratic Party and the Biden electoral panel would advertise and work with the Black Press of America to get as many people to vote as possible.
"I will call Tom Perez (President of the Democratic Party National Committee) and I will put this at the top of my list," promised Deming.
She agreed that this would have to happen now rather than later in the campaign.
When she replied to the words of former Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton that Trump might refuse to leave the White House, he lost the election, and another editorial saying that the president is preparing to reach himself, lived over Deming: “As much as he suggests to reach himself, I made myself feel uneasy. ”
“But who would ever do that other than Trump?
I think he hates this job.
It should not be possible to get away with breaking the law and ignoring the constitution in this work.
I think he hates the job, but he hates losing.
I can absolutely believe that the President will not want to leave the White House, but we have our ways to take care of it, and if that happens I just want to be with those who let it happen."

Alibaba and Jack Ma filed for trial in Gurugram because of the ex-worker's complaint
Gurugram, July 26: The company Alibaba and its founder, Jack Ma, have been brought to justice in Gurugram, after the former employee of the company claimed that he had been expelled from the company for protesting written and false news in the company’s programs.
The case is settled in the Gurugram district court, and the private court judge Sonia Sheokand has published a policy for Alibaba, Jack Ma, and more than 10 others, asking them to attend court on July 29, according to news.
According to Reuters, the judge has also requested written answers from the company.
Parmar, who served at the UC Web office in Gurugram until October 2017, claims 268,000 U.S. dollars in damages according to court documents.
“We are committed to the Indian market and the well-being of its employees, and its policy is in line with current legislation.
We can't express ourselves about the current case," said UC India in a statement.
'The application also contains a 'list of sensitive words' containing passwords in Hindu and English such as 'India's border with China and 'China' and 'China-India', which is claimed in the complaint that UC Web is using to write material on its systems in India,' says Reuters.
Last month, the Ministry of the Interior banned 59 Chinese mobile phone programs, including UC News and UC Browser, in line with increased tension between the two countries.
The New York City fire department's representative says that it is "extremely" all right to exclude a white fireman from an honorary guard.
A representative who deals with the subject of diversity at the fire department in New York City says that it is "extremely" right to keep a white fireman from the honorary sword so that flagbearers can all be black, according to a new report.
White fireman Daniel McWilliams has filed for racial discrimination after being removed from the flagbearer group at a memorial Mass in November 2017 to commemorate the fallen members of the Vulcan Society, which is the brotherhood of black firefighters.
The chief fire department representative in the field of diversity and accessibility, according to the New York Post, was also responsible for the decision to question the New York State Human Rights Department.
McWilliams is one of the three fire fighters in the unit who, in a historical fashion, are shown lifting the American flag at Ground Zero on the days following the September 11 attacks.
According to McWilliam's lawsuit, the fire department had chosen him to be the sole owner of the flag bears at the memorial ceremony.
Being a flagbearer at this ceremony was a "great honor and privilege" for McWilliams, as stated in the CNN case.
When he arrived at the ceremony, however, he was prevented from participating in the honorary ceremony of the then president of the Vulcan Society, Regina Wilson, for it is claimed that she had asked that all flagbearers at the Mass be black.
She then asked McWilliams – a 29-year-old New York City firefighter – to help in another way."
Among the claims that she asked him to do so is to accompany the civilians and to set up separate firemen from the Mass.
McWilliams claims in his lawsuit that he asked Wilson if she was taking him out of the honorary court because he wasn't black.
She confirmed that it was so, he said.
Wilson, who has served in the fire department of New York City for 21 years and who also participated in the rescue work on 11 September, will have replaced McWilliams with one of the members of the Vulcan Society.
McWilliams claims that he left the memorial ceremony “to spare himself further shame, humiliation and shame, ” when friends and associates heard what went between them, according to the New York Daily News.
When Blackloving testified in court, counsellor McWilliams, Keith Sullivan, asked her this: “So asking everyone to be black in the honorary court is not a disparity? ”
"No, it isn't," said Loving, according to the New York Post.
Sullivan also asked Loving if it would be all right to ask that all be black at an honorary sword, which she answered: “Absolutely. ”
Loving explained that it would be all right to replace a white person with a black person to “have our speciality and different origins to create pride, harmony, and support for one another. ”
McWilliams first filed a racial discrimination lawsuit against New York City fire brigade in January 2018.
He then filed a lawsuit against Wilson, New York City Fire Department, New York City, and non-attached individuals in May 2019.
Sullivan said that after McWilliams filed his charges, Wilson’s supporters would have avenged him and threatened him.
At one point, one of her supporters will have laid his hands on McWilliams and said: “I’ve heard of you, they told me that you would behave like this, and now you know who I am. ”
In an excerpt, Sullivan wrote that excluding McWilliams from the honorary service at the Mass was “a tragic thing” and that one thing was not valid for all of the fire department.
“If you’re a black person and you’re a white person at work, you’ll get a reminder at most,” said Sullivan.
According to the law, Wilson received “one hour’s counseling” for her treatment of McWilliams.
Meanwhile, a white person who discriminates against a black person receives “a severe punishment, ” wrote Sullivan.
"The New York City fire department has created a policy and process that is intended to please members of the Vulcan Society, who act in a racist way, excuse their actions and assist them ... and this must be stopped," Sullivan also wrote.
Threatened a walking passerby and demanded money
One was arrested in the city after a robbery, where he threatened a walking passerby and tried to get money from the victim.
The man was saved in a prison cell.
Then the police were notified of a man with a knife in the center of town.
The knife was confiscated and reported.
More than eighty cases were filed by police in the capital area from 5 p.m. to 5 p.m., and this morning six were saved in a prison cell.
Among other things, police stopped the driver of a car that pulled a trailer on Kjalarnes, where the bicycle equipment of the trailer was in very bad condition.
The trailer was housed, and the owner intended to provide transport equipment to move it into town.
Then the police stopped the production of drugs in the Year.
Two were arrested for the matter and were released after reporting.
There was also an announcement of individuals firing fireworks in the town.
When a police officer arrived, they had escaped the scene “and probably known the shame that is still considerable to the end of the year. ”
Thousands of Khabarovsk residents still demand the resignation of Putin
Thousands of the city's inhabitants joined the Russian city of Khabarovsk yesterday and protested the arrest of the district governor in the same region south of East Russia and his successors, who have never lived in the region.
The former governor, Sergei Furgal, enjoys great popularity and scores of thousands of citizens protested when he was arrested and taken to Moscow for custody earlier this month, accused of having ordered murder of three businessmen 15 years ago.
In a recent week, Furgal was formally appointed as governor and his 39 - year - old class brother, Mikhail Degtyarev, appointed in his place, with little enthusiasm for the locals.
Degtaryev is said to be inexperienced and, worse still, unconnected with Khabarovsk and called the citizens of the city after his account the fastest.
They've been calling Degtaryev. They've been blowing their ears.
Yesterday, Protestants were few in number than in the first Protestants, or fifteen to twenty thousand, and the demands were the same as before: the liberation of Furgal and the resignation of Vladimir Putin, president of Russia.
"We want the governor to be released, because we believe that his arrest is very likely to be illegal," says AFP newsroom Alina Slepova, a 30-year-old Protestant.
She claims that Kremlin’s agents had Furgal arrested “to defend their own interests, not the interests of the region. ”
A police officer in Khabarovsk left protestors unbridled despite the clear violation of the current ban on the Korean virus epidemic.
In Moscow, however, the police arrested at least ten people who met on Pushkin Square to show protestors in Khabarovsk support, reports the British newspaper Guardian.
The group of Furgal, Russia's Liberal Democratic Party, is a group of hard-line internationalists, and is considered by political commentators to be quite loyal to the Kremlar government in most cases.
On the other hand, the same political commentators inform the BBC that the victory of Furgal in the district election two years ago — which was great and unmistakable — was a major blow to Putin and the United States of Russia, and although evidence suggests that the takeover of the Kremlin in the Eastern Territories was weakening.
Furgal was arrested on July 9, and moved to Moscow, where he is awaiting trial.
He is charged with ordering three murders in the years 2004 and 2005.
Two of them were dead, and the third went out.
Sarah Rainsford, a BBC reporter in Moscow, says that the followers of Furgal, who enjoy great popularity at home, are convinced that the charge and the arrest have political roots.
They want to know why governments have kept him under arrest until now, says Rainsford, 15 years after his alleged offense.
Tree branches gave way when Hurricane Hanna rode over South Texas

Jorge Castillo shared this video on Twitter and told Storyful that he had taken it outside his home in Combes, Texas, on Sunday morning.
Homeless women with disabilities participate in the fight against COVID-19 in Chennai
Shanthi, a disabled woman educated as a tailor, visits 250 homes every day to identify people with symptoms in Kodambakkam, a large Covid infected area in Chennai, where some 10,000 cases have been reported.
The working day starts early at 7:30, and ends around 16:00.
It measures the temperature in the population, asks about symptoms, and teaches them about the importance of using masks, washing your hands regularly, and keeping away from others.
In fact, her work has led to the early detection and treatment of infections in four positive individuals.
Shanthi is one of the 16,000 employees of Chennai City who care for the domestic cloud, but are not healthcare professionals.
The project, according to the authorities, has contributed to a 50 - percent reduction in positive cases, in the daily Chennai count, while they are growing in other areas of Tamil Nadu.
Shanthi says not all the people are cooperative.
She adds: “Most people are cooperative when a disabled woman approaches them.
Some, however, become irritated.
But this is not to worry about.
I think people should be able to be safe.
When I come back the next day, the people are polite.
It helps to build a good relationship."
And there are more women like Shanthi who live in the city's gistyl for women with disabilities and fight against Covid-19.
Not far from Kodambakkam, who is also disabled, Kavitha has also taken part in the campaign as an overseer.
Although Kavitha has a specially designed bicycle, she starts to meet people and hold her heels.
'I'm happy,' she says, but she adds: 'I want to see them go down to perhaps about 100 a day.
I'm sure we can make it."
On the first floor of the gistatory where the two live are Matilda Funceca, a basketball player who uses a wheelchair, and Manimekalai, a teacher, and they transmit all the data transmitted from about 40 women to the Chennai City web server.
Matilda says she is not afraid of being infected by the corona virus.
“ When we help others, God protects us, ” she adds.
When asked what measures she is taking, Manimekalai says: “I use a mask, keep my distance, and wash my hands often.
I also drink Kabasura Kudineer, a sit-a-drink that enhances the immune system."
A few months ago, when the crown virus first arrived in Chennai, these disabled women protected their time and ability to make masks for health - care professionals in the city.
Dr. Aishwarya Rao and the director of the Gististophilia, as well as the Dorcas Research Center that runs the shelter, says: “They adapt to the needs of each hour.
In the past, masks were missing, and they did not leave their own.
Now it is time to intervene in society, and they answered the call."
Coronary virus transmission in Tamil Nadu has now reached 200,000 after a new case of 6989 cases in the past 24 hours, but there is also the largest number of infections detected in one day, according to official data.
Eighty - nine have died, and 7758 have recovered in the past 24 hours.
The total number of infections in the state is now 206,737.
Police are trying to find out about a teenager's last journey in Helensburgh.
Investigators investigating the death of adolescence in Helensburgh are now trying to put together a timeline for his last trips.
The body of 19-year-old Kirk Allan was found in a home in Johnson Court about 6:25 a.m. on Saturday.
A 30 - year - old was arrested, and the police confirmed on Sunday that he had now been charged with death.
He'll be in court in Dumbarton on Monday.
Police officer Steve Martin said: “Our mind is with Kirk’s family and friends in these difficult times.
Policemen will continue to work with and support the community.
Our research continues to focus on getting a full picture of what happened, especially the Church's last days before his death, but we are not looking for anyone else in connection with the death."
South Africa: Ashwell Prince and Marsha Cox report their experience of discrimination
The last few weeks have shown that many skeletons are still in the closet in connection with racial rights in South Africa sports.
A constructive conversation needs to take place, and action is needed to welcome everyone in sports.
Ashwell Prince, a former cricket star of Proteas, told his former white teammates and accused them of racial prejudice by saying that he and other blacks were “quota players. ”
Prince said Proteas’ black players have been officially called “quotes ” by their white teammates.
He added that it would be sad that even though black players such as Makhaya Ntini and now Kagiso Rabada still got the top marks in the sport, some people still connected them to the quota discussion.
Prince, now the coach of the Cape Cobras team, made this statement fall at the United Coalition for Sport and Community Based Organizations (UCSCBO) on Thursday night.
The aim of the organization is to continue the intense discussion on historical racial rights in South Africa’s sports.
“As I said when I lighted up on social media, it’s not my intention to come and draw people’s names down to the ground, but these are real incidents...
"You're doing everything right, but you're still getting infected"
Paul Roberts, a former musician and builder who became a NASA developer, now works at a software company.
He and his wife, an ex-sister at the Methodist Hospital, who sees himself as an optimist, held an amateur magazine on the Internet and attended Comic Con events earlier.
Once a week, they puzzle with their two daughters, their son-in-law and a 7-year-old granddaughter and play violent Uno games.
"They are amazing nerds," says Roman, 38 years old, about his parents.
Sheryl Roberts, 65 years old, is aware of the dangers of the pandemic — she has diabetes, asthma, and heart disease that can put her at increased risk.
Her husband has a chronic lung disease and a stifle that keeps a blocked coronary artery open.
"We've been so careful, very careful, and kept away from people," said Sheryl Roberts.
Her husband began working away from home in the spring, when the epidemic was raging in Washington, New York, and other areas around the country.
Paul has occasionally gone into the “old age ” market, and according to Sheryl, the only real date they made in the last month was when they started looking at wildflowers through the car window.
Their younger daughter too was cautious.
But then she came home sneezing from work one day in the middle of June and thought she was allergic.
Soon she developed cough, fever, headache and diarrhoea, and lost all sense of taste and smell, which are typical symptoms of the coronary virus.
“ She said, “I don’t know what’s happening, Mom, but I had a mask, had gloves, washed my hands, ” said Sheryl.
“ You do everything right, but you get infected. ”
Elaine Roberts, who was diagnosed with positive coronary virus infection, did not become seriously ill.
However, the situation became much worse for her parents.
Paul Roberts and his wife began sneezing and then coughing, just like their daughter, and then they got a lot of heat and pain in the body.
Then he became “absolutely ill, exceedingly quick, ” said Sheryl Roberts.
On June 22, he became confused.
She worried about his level of oxygen.
It was low, and she asked their older daughter to take him to an emergency room, for the second time in two days.
The royal couple formerly felt that the Queen’s Christmas speech was “regarded ” according to a new book
MEGHAN Markle and Harry Bretaprins felt that his grandmother, Queen of Britain, had “feeling ” them during their Christmas speech.
The couple’s new life story, “Finding Freedom, ” shows that they were overlooked by those in the collection that could be seen in the Christmas speech.
Pictures on the desk on which the queen sat showed, among others, the William of Britain, Kate Middleton, and their three children, Karl Bretaprinn and his wife, Camilla, as well as Prince Philip.
But Meghan and Harry were nowhere to be seen despite Archie’s birth in May, yet the boy was mentioned as Her Majesty’s “eighty granddaughter. ”
The new book, published in August, also says that Meghan and Kate Middleton “were never friends ” because they“ found it difficult to get over superficial politeness ” and met only a few times.
Yesterday, it was claimed that his brother Harry and William began some years before his relationship with Meghan began but that this was climaxed by William and Kate Middleton’s marriage.
The Duke of Sussex felt that he was a “contrary ” to events with his brother and Kate Middleton, claiming that“ he wanted to change things long before Meghan came up. ”
Congressmen charge labor leaders with wanting to keep public officials “world forever. ”
Congressmen accuse labor leaders of wanting public workers to be “world forever ” after the leaders protested Boris Johnson’s call for people to return to work
Warriors were accused of wanting staff “to be at home forever ” after protesting Boris Johnson’s call to return to work.
Congressmen were angry when a public and general - trade union group told their associates to kick their feet when their leaders ordered them to return to their places of work.
Andrew Percy, former minister, said that it was “unacceptable” that the necessary public service, such as the issue of passports, would be stopped while public service workers would have worked hard to keep society going in the course of the coroner’s viral epidemic.
“ It is unacceptable for people to refuse to return to their jobs while warehouse and factory workers throughout the country have continued to work so that official staff can eat during this period, ” he said.
“ Many of these workers now want to go on vacation but cannot do so because of the people who refuse to go back to their places of work, although they are safe.
Commanders of labor cannot maintain this policy of living at home forever – especially now that we know that people can return to work safely."
After a call by the Prime Minister last week, Alex Chisholm, a newly appointed head of public service, announced that the government would “remove from the job of public service workers and speed up their return to their places of work until August 1. ”
Public and public workers’ unions expressed to their associates, who number some 200,000, that they would not have to comply with this requirement, saying that this is about politics.
A spokesman for the Public Employment Association, the largest trade union of public employees in the United Kingdom, said that the requirement to return to work was “not given priority to the health and safety of our associates, nor to strengthen the economy.
This is one thing because of political pressure from members of the Sanhedrin who demand that public service be used as an example to get others back to work.
Our advice to fellow workers is clear: if you do your job at home and someone in your department asks you to come back to work, don't take it as a matter of course that you have to do it."
The dispute is due to growing dissatisfaction with a delayed version of passports because employees work at home, but some 400,000 people are now told to wait for their applications to be processed.
The Ministry of the Interior has now published that it will be "seeking to expedite" British applications for travel over the next two weeks and from those who have been waiting for a passport for more than four weeks.
Public and public employment organisations have admitted that some have had to wait for passports for up to 143 days, but they claim that “small and often narrow offices ” make it difficult for 4,000 people in the passport service to maintain the necessary distance.
Former government minister David Davis urged trade union leaders to “be reasonable ” and to seek cooperation with government to get people back into their places of work.
He added that if he was in government, he would ask a labor commissioner: “What is it you want, that people stay home all summer? ”
However, Britain’s largest business has also ignored Johnson’s recommendation to people to return to work.
A study of larger jobs with a total of 400,000 employees revealed that only about 40,000 of them have returned to their jobs.
Focusing on history can play an important role in reconciliation
The giraffe has grown, but understanding and reconciliation should be the goal.
The school system is partly to blame for this lack of knowledge and understanding.
Too little is taught by Australian history.
The fact is that without radical action, the only teaching article that specifically deals with our history — “Australia Story ” for 12th grade — will die out within the next five years or even earlier.
Last year, only 628 students in Victoria completed a course in Australia of 49,324 students who completed primary school, or only 1%.
Over the past six years, this number has almost halved, but nearly 100 fewer students enroll each year.
The main reason why so few students choose to learn about the history of 12th - grade Australia is that little has been done in previous years to arouse their interest.
History is not even a unique field of study, but it falls under the broader “intellectualism. ”
This is why students in 7th and 8th grade will complete only one short unit on the 'early and island beards on the Torres Strait and their culture'.
In the 9th and 10th years, there is another unit on Australia during World War I.
For many students in Victoria, this is all that is taught about the history of Australia during primary school years.
In the 9th and 10th years, there is another optional unit for the period 1750-1918.
It is important to take three measures to save Australian history in Victorian schools.
First, history must become an independent subject, such as English, mathematics, and science.
Since history is taught only as part of a mental science, it has little room for study.
It is usually felt by people who have a general education in the field of intellectuals but who have not learned history.
Historical skills such as data analysis are complex.
To ensure that such skills are taught in an accessible and exciting way, we need more specialized history teachers.
Third, from 1788 to 1914, Australia’s history will become a subject of obligation.
Students appreciate what they know.
So many of my former students chose not to learn the history of Australia during the 12th year of study, since they would have had to learn the material from the ground up.
Knowledge of history alone does not bridge a deep gap between races.
But without it, as is clearly seen in the Victorian study plan, the project is hopeless.

Aron Elise in a European seat - ice cream game divided by half
Aron Elís Thirandarson is in the finals for European seats in the Danish football league.
Isaac Bergmann Johannesson played only the first half with the top team of Norrköping against Falkenberg, Sweden.
Aron Elís was a member of the OB in Denmark when the team continued to play a final game on seats in the European Union's lead race.
The OB will meet AGF or FC Köbenhavn in the final game, depending on whether the teams end up higher after the final round of the top Danish championship later today.
Aron Elís played the whole game in a 1-1 match with Horsens in an outfield today, but OB had won the previous game on the homefield, 3-1, and thus won a total of 4–2.
Isaac was in the lead team of Norrköping, who was unexpectedly 2–0 below after the first half battle against Falkenberg in the Swedish elite.
At the beginning of the second half, Norrköping made a threefold division, and Isaac was one of those who had to depart.
Norrköping achieved a level playing field, but Falkenberg reached 3–2 in 89 minutes.
But there was still time for Norrköping to get out of hell at the last hour, 3–3.
Norrköping remains on top, with 24 points, four points ahead of Elfsburg, and five points ahead of Malmö, which plays well later today.
Falkenberg managed to get away from the bottom for a while, but there is a stage above Helsingborg and Kalmar who have a good game.
Collecting sources of the Crown Virus Time Festival
Anna Lilja, daughter of Victory, founded the Facebook group “My National Festival 2020 ” to gather information on the national festival that the Islanders are planning to hold next weekend.
Many will camp in their gardens and rejoice with friends and relatives.
Anna Lilja talked to Motta on the weekend part of the wave.
“ Nothing has come in yet that is very exciting too, ” says Anna Lilja, “because there are 600 people in the group who are obviously going to do something. ”
Something about the Islanders going to have tent parties at home.
“ People have spoken of having their own [festivities], perhaps camping in the park, and honing the family together, ” says Anna.
“You expect people to spend time with their people.
She probably says, though, that many people will not simply be there “but still hold some small national festival somewhere else. ”
The National Festival Committee is now working hard to repay the tickets that were purchased, but Anna believes that many locals are more likely to secure a holiday ticket next year.
"People are even investing in the tickets now and are valid for 2021."
“I’m a great National Celebrating Man, I love the preparation and everything about it, but sometimes something comes into your life that you don’t control at all, and that’s just the way it is,” says Anna, but it has been said that people ask if the Islanders can’t let go of the National Festival “one time.”
Anna Lilja claims to have formed the group, not for herself, or to encourage people to observe their own Festival of Nations, but to gather records of the Festival of Sanctuaries in the Islands this year.
“ What did people do in these strange times?
I'm not going to use this in something or anything, but then there's somebody who uses this kind of authority in something, but I was just creating some area where people can put in what they're doing."
At the same time, a fire has been fired each year.
“ I think a lot of people are excited to get burned on Friday night.
The only thing that makes a line in the account, of course, is that the prophecy is nothing special."
“ It’s going to be set on fire, but it just has to be revealed how it will be, ” says Anna Lilja.

Will Prince Andrew be mentioned in a new paper on sexual immorality?
The British royal family is now preparing to respond to possible new information in court documents on his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell
A U.S. judge has ordered that secret documents on Epstein and Maxwell be made public
Amongst what is found in these 80 pages of papers are parts bearing witness to Maxwell from 2016
The display of these pages could also put a great deal of pressure on Prince Andrew, in which there is a communication between Maxwell and Epstein from January 2015
In 2015, Virginia Roberts, the alleged sex slave of the disgraced American financier, asserted in court documents that she had been forced to have a conversation with Prince Andrew.
Prince Andrés is now preparing to defend himself from the possible publication of information this week with even more damaging charges of his friendship with child abuser Jeffrey Epstein and his alleged accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell.
This week, U.S. District Justice Loretta Preska ordered the publication of 80 secret legal documents related to Maxwell and Epstein, which number hundreds of pages.
The publication of these vast documents would be a shock to 58 - year - old Maxwell, as they contain much of her testimony before lawyers in 2016, including what her lawyers have said is “rapid questions” about her sex story.
They could also put a great deal of pressure on Prince Andrew, as one of the documents involved communication between Maxwell and Epstein from January 2015, when Virginia Roberts, the alleged sex slave of the disgraced U.S. financial officer, asserted in court documents in 2015 that she had been forced three times to have a conversation with André.
Andrew has repeatedly and unequivocally rejected these claims.
An e-mail from 2015 that has been leaked and the BBC released last year seems to indicate that Andrés asked Maxwell for help in responding to Robert’s claims.
We have no doubt that the Duke will receive an oath of rebellion.
There he said to his wife - in - law: “Let me know when we can talk, and I have some questions I need to ask you about Virginia Roberts. ”
Maxwell replied: “I have information, so call me when you have a moment off. ”
Last night, a source near Andrew said: “The Duke of Jorvik has done nothing wrong, so we are not worried about the opening of court documents.
As courts in the United States have tried to point out, this does not mean that an accusation is true even if it appears in court documents.
The U.S. courts have urged the media and the public to take full care to deal with the allegations raised in court documents.
We totally agree with that.
We have no doubt that the Duke will receive full retribution in the next few weeks."
Maxwell is now in detention in a Manhattan detention centre, waiting for a trial to locate and seduce some of Epstein’s victims who were under legal age from 1994 to 1997.
She is also accused of a perjury for refusing to know when reporting on his abuse.
She refuses all charges.
Maxwell last spoke to lawyers in April and July 2016 in connection with Robert’s claims, now under the surname Giuffre, which she mentioned after marriage.
Some 40 pages out of a total of 418 of these testimonies were made public last year, but after the ruling of Judge Presna in New York last week, more items could be opened first on Thursday.
Lawyers Maxwell received one week to file an appeal.
Epstein was found dead in his prison cell in New York last year when he was being tried for sexual offenses.
Detectives are looking for a gang of criminals for a violent attack on the streets of Edinburgh.
Three attacked a man in Edinburgh and caused him injuries that could prove permanent.
The 29 - year - old victim was attacked on Drum Street, Gilmerton, between 23:00 and 23:30 on Saturday.
The Scottish police reported that he had been transferred to the royal hospital with serious injuries.
Investigator Dale Miles, who directs the investigation, said: “This was a violent and unwarranted attack. ”
Suspects fled to Newtoft Street.
One of them was thought to be in its 30 ’ s, about a hundred feet [180 cm] tall and strong.
He was short - cut and dark - haired in white shirts, dark pants, and dark shoes.
“ When the attack was made, ” said Detective Miles, “I would ask everyone in this area to see something suspicious of presenting themselves, ” he said.
The ambassador wants to carry a gun in Iceland.
Jeffrey Ross Gunter, Ambassador of the United States to Iceland, wants to carry a gun here ashore and want to increase security.
He has been said to have been “weaned ” about his safety since he arrived in the country last year.
This is stated in the CBS report, which also says that although Gunter works in the “one of the safest kingdoms in the world, ” he wants it.
Gunter is said to have asked the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs to report to the Icelandic government that he may carry a gun.
Then he has asked for an armored car and vest to protect him from knife tongues.
CBS sources say the Ministry has repeatedly announced to Gunter that it is not at risk in Iceland.
According to CBS, Iceland’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not provide information on whether a request for the possible armaments of Gunter had been received from the United States because the authorities did not comment on the security measures taken by foreign traders.
However, the reporters say that no request was made.
Then CBS also has it after his sources were told that Gunter should not seek to carry weapons, since it would be taken as an insult here in the country.
Gunter is an unexperienced businessman, who has for years been a skin doctor in California.
He is a member of the Republican Party of the United States and a supporter of President Donald Trump.
He recently attracted attention in this country when he spoke of the “invisible Chinese virus. ”
CBS sources also say that Gunter was seriously downgraded by the U.S. Embassy in Reykjavík.
He had already had seven second - rate employees in the May embassy.
Among other things, he has accused them of belonging to the so - called “Deep Kingdom, ” a network of U.S. officials working against Trump, and he was angry that one carried snow into his office.
The sender traveled to Washington DC in February for a conference and refused to return to Iceland for several months, according to CBS sources.
Gunter is said to have wanted to work from California, but eventually Mike Pompeo, U.S. Secretary of State, had to order him to return and did so in May.
The home game form is a key element for Jose Mourinho, who says Tottenham has easier games to play when fans get to play again
With the help of Jose Mourinho, Tottenham Hotspur has not lost a game on the home ground since the prime minister went back to work, but he says that it would be much easier to maintain a good team at home if the audience were released.
Questions has won 12 victories at home during this season, but lost four times — only one of the six teams that are above them has lost more at home.
The coach in Portugal said that while such a victory would be possible without its adherents, it would be easier to maintain it if they were there.
"We have to do this with the fans, but without them you can build some kind of work where the game plan is in the foreground," he said.
“But I think it would be much more powerful to do so with the fans, because they add to the emotional side of the game, which only comes with the help of fans at the home playground.”
Mourinho believes that with stronger competitors, it is becoming increasingly difficult to maintain the long victory periods in a homefield he knows from Chelsea, or that Liverpool has built up over the past three seasons.
However, this is also a key factor in determining whether the past will achieve its goals at the end of the period, especially in games and neighbourhoods, where the atmosphere in the field can change.
"I believe that the policy in the elite department is that this record is becoming increasingly difficult to beat because of what has passed well."
“However, it is very important to be strong at home and at the end of the season have brought in a number of points with victory in home games.”
“ I’m happy with the finals from home games recently, without the fans, but we need them back.
I imagine a victory against Arsenal with the field full of Tottenham fans.
This is compassion that is built up gradually."
The buyers excited about the wanted lifestyle in Lovely Banks
"Bigger is better" is clearly the motto of new owners of huge real estate in the Lovely Banks neighborhood, recently sold at 1270 Australian dollars.
Interesting buyers looking for lifestyle near the center of Geelong moved to visit these 1.35 hectares of land, where there is a garage for 14 cars, a swimming pool and a view over the Corio River.
Joe Grgic, a real estate agent in Harcourts, North Geelong, said that an offer to the estate that Cuddhy Court 1 had been approved within 10 days of its placing on the market.

Home Default for Isolation
“ We got a lot of offers from different parties, ” said Grgic.
“The property was sold to a homemaker who is very excited.”
The property is accompanied by four rooms on two levels, which include a separate bathroom that is large enough to accommodate a sofa.
The new owners have a choice of three living rooms and can make use of their kitchen and upgrade outdoor areas with views over the pool.
"It was because of the composition of the property, that it was three acres, and that it was in this place," said Grgic.
“ Here came interested buyers from Melbourne, who wondered what the property was in the center of the country, but who still had a farm break.
“I have people who missed and buyers who are still looking.”
He said that the spacious storage area, which includes a double garage and a free - standing shelter that covers 10-12 vehicles, would be perfect for industrialists or for the storage of trailer and trailer.
Counting its security threatened in Iceland
“Despite having been appointed as the safest country in the world, Jeffrey Ross Gunter has been paranoid about his safety since he arrived in Reykjavik last year.”
This is how CBS News on Ambassadors of the United States of America begins, which simulates numerous sources of CBS from the U.S. foreign service.
CBS reports that Gunter requested that the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs obtain a special authorisation from the Icelandic government to carry firearms.
Then he should also have wished for an armored car, as well as for ideas about vests that could protect him from knife - tongue attacks.
The U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs refused to state publicly whether Gunter’s security is really a threat in Iceland, but according to officials, Gunter has repeatedly been declared not to be in any particular danger.
In spite of this, the U.S. Embassy in Iceland recently announced a full - time job for bodyguards, including in the morning paper of July 18 last, but CBS reports that it is being done to ease Gunter’s concerns.
The U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs does not comment on any specific security measures associated with its embassy, but it always states that the objective is to ensure security in a preventative way.
The Ministry does not answer questions regarding Gunter’s request for weapons to be made and the Icelandic Ministry of Foreign Affairs does not want to tell whether the United States has formally requested that the ambassador carry firearms, and they usually do not comment on the security of foreign agencies.
According to the Icelandic authorities, however, CBS never submitted its request, and according to three U.S. officials, Gunter was overtaken by these plans, which could lead to domestic abuse in Iceland.
CBS also discusses the various problems that have been affecting the United States Embassy in Iceland since Gunter was appointed ambassador last year, but he will already have replaced his deputy seven times.
Thus, the first deputy is said to have prepared for his work for a long time and learned Icelandic only to have been denied the position at the last moment because Gunter “does not like him” at their first meeting.
His followers have not gone much better under Gunter’s leadership.
Governments in the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs are said to be aware of the position of the embassy in Iceland, but they are reluctant to intervene in matters related to the president’s close ties.
In addition to all of this, Gunter is said to be reluctant to comply with the various rules of foreign service and to respect the rule of power.
Gunter traveled to the United States in February to participate in a convention in Washington, and it is said that he has refused to return to Iceland as a result and allowed his temporary substitute for his work for months, in the middle of the pandemic.
Will Gunter have even wished to do his job in the distance and said that he would not return to Iceland unless the Foreign Minister himself, Mike Pompeo, specifically wished for it.
According to information provided by the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs, Gunter had decided to take personal permission for the conference to be completed and the Crown Virus Epidemic delayed further, but according to CBS sources, many within the Agency would have asked Gunter to return to Iceland, but he had not done so until May, after Pompeo had contacted him and kindly asked him to return to the embassy in Iceland.
CBS also reports on Gunter’s unpopularity in Iceland, particularly in connection with the timing of what he calls the ‘invisible Chinese virus’, which has been highly critical.
Gunter is one of many, almost inexperienced ambassadors appointed during Donald Trump, president of the United States.
Sachin Pilot against Ashok Gehlot; the Bharatiya Janata group says government crisis in the state; Congress wants vote
Ashok Gehlot said that if needed, the Congress would have to attend a sitting protest outside the Prime Minister’s home.
On Saturday, the day after peaceful protests against Raj Bhawan, Jaipur, Ashok Gehlot, chief minister of Rajasthan, said that if necessary, Congressmen would have to meet the president and material for a sitting protest outside the Prime Minister’s home to end the crisis in the state.
At the Congressional Assembly meeting, Gehlot indicated that it was planned to hold a vote to see if the majority of the Congressionals and the coalitions were with him in the power struggle.
"He said the government had a majority and wanted to vote," says Mahesh Joshi, Congressional Party Chief Guard, after the meeting.
The assembly meeting was held at a hotel where the members of Gehlot’s Congress held their last days.
“ The prime minister asked us to be prepared to stay longer at the hotel.
If necessary, he said, he would meet the President and also hold peaceful protests outside the Prime Minister's home," said a leader.
The main minister of Rajasthan can convene the Congress and let the Congressional Party demonstrate its majority, said the leader of the party Rahul Gandhi on Friday, indicating that the Bharatiya Janata Party had come up with a plot to overthrow Ashok Gehlot's government.
“The country is now governed by law and constitution.
Governments are formed and served by the representatives of the people.
The advice of Bharatiya Janata to overthrow Rajasthan’s government has come to light.
This is insulting to 80 million Rajasthan’s inhabitants.
The main minister must convene the assembly in order for the truth to come before the land," said Gandhi in a tidbit on Hindus.
Ashok Gehlot, chief minister of Rajasthan, said on Saturday that he was prepared to go to India’s president’s meeting to ensure that what he calls “the plan of Bharatiya Janata ” to delay a vote of confidence.
Gelot, who protested for many hours at the home of the governor of Kalraj Mishra on Friday to press a convention, met with Congressmen and the government on Saturday, and after the meeting, new proposals were made and approved by the government.
Last night, Mishra asked Gehlot to reinstate the motion for a meeting and referred to six objections.
The proposal will soon be sent to the governor.
Gehlot has accused the governor of delaying the conference, where he is “under pressure” to delay the vote payment that determines his confidence in his government.
When Gelot met his government, the Bharatiya Janata Missionary Committee met with the government leader, Satish Poonia, and the leader of the government opposition, Gulab Chandra Kataria, to discuss the position of COVID-19 in the state.

Toywoman Spencer Grammer given a ditch outside the Manhattan restaurant
NEW YORK – Playwright Spencer Grammar said he was trying to calm a man when he cut her arm and put her friend in the back outside a restaurant in New York City last Friday.
Grammer, 36 years old, said that she and her friend had done what everyone else had done in the same situation that they had been trying to prevent things from getting worse when they were attacked.
Grammer and her 32-year-old friend were sitting at the front table of The Black Ant in the East Village neighborhood of Manhattan at 11:30 p.m.
on the Friday, when a man came up to them, and demanded delivery, and was shutting down the restaurant.
Grammer and her friend were injured when they tried to “resolve differences between an unknown man and other guests on site, ” police said.
The man ran off after hurting Grammer’s right arm and stabbing her friend in the humpback with an unknown tip, said a police officer.
No one's ever been arrested.
Grammer, who speaks for Summer in the series "Rick and Morty" and previously played in the series "Greek" at ABC Family, is the daughter of "Frasier" star Kelsey Grammer and actress Doreen Alderman.
Grammer said that both she and her friend expected to recover quickly.
Neither of them suffered serious internal injuries, she said.
In a statement to the US Weekly, Grammer thanked those who responded at the scene and the Bellevue Hospital staff who looked after them and spoke of the “unbelievable struggle” of these staff against the coronary virus epidemic.
“ It really touched us to have an opportunity to thank them in person, ” Grammer said.
“I don’t want to be like McGregor and show my money...
I'm here to help people" – Chimaev after a historic night at UFC Fight Island – RT Sport News
Khamzat Chimaev, a fighter from Russia, is now named as the next star of the UFC after recording himself in the history of Fight Island, but he does not say he is going to flag his wealth in a ridiculous way like Conor McGregor.
Chimaev carried the Northern Iranian Rhys McKee in their throttle fight in Abu Dabi on Saturday night when he defeated his rival when three minutes and 9 seconds of the first round were over by letting his blows hit him on the floor.
The victory recorded the name of Chimaev in the history of UFC for the shortest time between victories in the modern history of the contest, where only 10 days had passed since he defeated the British John Phillips in a similar decisive way, then in an intermittent way.
Chimaev, who has a victory ratio of 8-0, received a 50,000 U.S. dollar bonus for the performance of the evening against McKee and has captured the attention of the MMA world so fully that he is now called "Khalib 2.0", which can be said to be an inevitable comparison because of the odds between the superiority of Chimaev and the UFC champion in the light and where he is born in Chechnya, which is close to Khabib's hometown in Dagestan.
Despite newfound fame and financial gain, the translated Chimaev has said that he would not like to flag his wealth like the MMA-money machine Conor McGregor or his peer in the boxing world, Floyd Mayweather Jr.
“I’m not just doing this for myself, I’m doing this for everyone I can help.
“I don’t want to be like Mayweather and McGregor, show my money or anything like that.
I want to help people," answered Chimaev when he was asked on Fight Island how he would use the bonus.
He has, among other things, brought to the attention of Conor McGregor's teammate and active Twitter user Dillon Danis, who wrote to the community that he could "easy" defeat Chimaev with a delivery drive.
There was no toxic answer from the fighter named “Borz, ” or“ wolf, ” in his native Tetenian language, who said that he would “paint Danis with his eyes closed. ”
Chimaev, who now lives in Stockholm, Sweden, after moving to the country at the age of 19, may not be doing much for his financial power, but he is clearly indisposed to his fighting abilities.
“I can grind anyone...
How many fighters are in the RV?
I can grind them all," he said.
"Give me 77 kilos of champions, 84 kilos of champions, I'll grind them both, that same day."
Israel continues to protest the Prime Minister’s reaction to the pandemic
JERUSALEM (AP) — Thousands of Israel protested against the prime minister of many parts of the country on Saturday and were the largest protests besides the official headquarters of Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem.
The protests have lasted for several weeks, but they began because critics believe that the government’s failure to act on the coronation virus epidemic should be remedied after the initial threat of the virus has been controlled.
Prosecution of Netanyahu for corruption has added to the protest.
"Bibi, go home," stood on a sign of one of the Protestants.
The second card stated: “Everyone sees that the emperor has lost his clothes. ”
Also, hundreds of Protestants gathered outside Netanyahu’s beach house in the wealthy city of Caesarea.
Last week, the police used water guns to scatter groups in Jerusalem.
After what has been called the rapid and unorganized reopening of the economy in May, the average number of new cases per day increased to 2000.
The economic situation in the country has been affected by the limitations of the virus and unemployment has increased substantially to nearly 20%.
Protestants say that the government’s financial support has little to do with it.
The protests took place in the shadow of a trial of corruption charges against Netanyahu, which began again in the month.
The hearings begin in January.
He is accused of betrayal, betrayal, and bribery in a series of scandalous matters.
Hundreds of Protestants meet in downtown Los Angeles to express their sympathy with Protestants in Portland
LOS ANGELES (CBSLA) — About 300 Protestants met in downtown Los Angeles on Saturday afternoon to support two - month - old movements in Portland, Oregon, where attention is drawn to federal police officers after fighting Protestants.
Similar Protestant meetings took place throughout the United States, including Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, and New York.
The protests in Los Angeles were organized by the Repose Fascism and Youth Liberation Front groups.
The group headed for the Los Angeles police headquarters on First Street and Main Street and then to the metropolitan detention centre.
The participants also moved to the Alameda region by 101, but later abandoned it.
Some of the people were seen breaking windows in federal buildings in the center of town, and they were written on federal marks.
At least one individual was arrested in the protests.
50 people in mosques at the Eid Festival and no prayer meetings in Eidgah, say the government in Karnataka
The festival of Eid-ul-Azha, or Bakrid, is on July 31st and August 1st.
The government of Karnataka has announced that only 50 may be gathered in mosques for prayers for Eid-ul-Azha, and have banned prayer meetings at Eidgah and other sites for the coroner’s viral epidemic.
Guests wishing to pray in mosques must wear a mask and keep a distance, as instructed by AB Ibrahim, the managing director of minority issues and Wakf.
The order states that the Hilal Committee decided that the Eid-ul-Azha festival, also called or Bakrid, should be held on 31 July in the provinces of Udupi, Dakshina Kannada and Kodagua, while on 1 August elsewhere in the country.
The order states that while prayer meetings are one of the most important rituals of the Bakrid Festival, such events will be banned in Eidgah and other places because of the COVID-19 epidemic.
Prayers, however, are allowed in mosques provided that no more than 50 participate at one time.
If more than that is required for the time of prayer, says the Governing Body in the decree.
To that end, prayer meetings should not be held elsewhere, such as meeting halls, social centers, or “Shadi Mahal. ”
The Karnataka government authorises the opening of temples, mosques and other places of prayer to those who wish to pray from 8 June, given that the protection of the COVID-19 virus is well protected.
The U.S. Ambassador wants an armed bodyguard.
Jeffrey Ross Gunter, Ambassador of the United States to Iceland, thinks his life is a threat here and wants to carry a weapon.
At the beginning of 2020, the U.S. Embassy repeatedly advertised the word bodyguard in Icelandic newspapers, using the English word bodyguard in the advertisement.
According to Kveik’s sources, the main reason why these jobs were advertised is that Ambassador Jeffrey Ross Gunter considers his life to be a threat in Iceland.
A source in Iceland and abroad has spoken to the ambassador, convinced that he is in great danger and that he is of Jewish descent.
The threat is not as obvious, but the speakers of Kvek said that Islamic terrorists had been called a threat.
The CBS TV station discussed the issue on its website this morning, and according to the Washington authorities, Gunter is paranoid, demanding to carry weapons himself, to get a stabbing vest, and armed escorts as well as a bulletproof car.
According to CBS sources, Gunter has repeatedly been told that there is no threat and that the advertisement after "bodyguard" is only for the sleep of Gunter.
According to Kvek’s sources, the positions had not been taken in June, but the application deadline expired in February.
According to Kvek’s sources, the United States Embassy has not given formal notice because of these changes.
No formal request has been made for increased security or for a warrant for lifeguards to be armed outside the walls of the embassy.
The law of Iceland states that this is not permitted except by a special authority from the governor of the State.
The members of the board of directors say that there is no information about any threat.
The latest threat assessment by the Governor of State is somewhat decisive in the field of terrorism.
There is no evidence of terrorism in Iceland and there is no evidence that terrorists or extremist groups are working here.
According to Kvek’s sources, there are no conditions under which the arms of a foreign embassy guard on the streets of cities and villages in Iceland are allowed.
Gunter drew considerable attention to this country when he shared the tithe of the President of the United States and called COVID-19 "China Virus".
With the tithe, he had the American and Icelandic flags.
Radioman in Seattle who mocked Trump's reaction to protests now says he needs to get a gun after the Starbucks coffeehouse below his apartment was destroyed – RT USA News
Paul Gallant has had a new perspective on violent protests after mocking President Donald Trump of the United States in June for saying that the anarchists are burning and robbing Seattle City.
All that had to be done was to fight the riot closer to the director’s home.
“I feel like I’m going to have to buy guns because this will clearly continue to happen,” said Gallant on Twitter on Saturday night after he saw that the wreckage workers had “damaged” the Starbucks café on the bottom floor of his apartment house.
“That’s enough, it looks like a street party down the street from me.
The contrast was very different when Trump complained last month that the mayor of Seattle was allowing violent Protestants to take over the city.
"These liberal Democrats are hopeless," said the President.
“The terrorists burn and rob our cities and they just think it’s wonderful, even death.”
Gallant, co-director of the "Danny & Gallant" part of ESPN's cooperation radio station in Seattle, replied with a tithe: "Go through the news last night and see neither burns, robberies nor deaths.
Gallant said last night that the police had advised the residents to stay away from his apartment building where explosives could be found in the damaged Starbucks cafe.
He published pictures of the damage, saying, “Well done, you idiots, ” and stated that he had also seen fire a few blocks away.
"I don't know what's going on, but the cat and I are going to find out."
The turnaround did not go by people who mocked Gallant for his previous opinion and chirped messages such as “Just relax on salmon,” and “Yah, maybe Trump was right”.
Jason Rantz, second radioman in Seattle, said: “I guess we’ll finally go on this tour we talked about. ”
Gallant laughed: “Awake and saw that a lot of people were talking to me about “sleep on salmon. ”
He said he was standing by his first claim that he had walked through the Chaz anarchist self-government area and although it was not as bad as it had been agreed.
"So it was burned and robbed after all," he said. "Exceptional."
White Lines star Laura Haddock, 34, looking for an apartment with his 28-year-old lover, Tom Rhys Harries
Laura Haddock and her boyfriend, Tom Rhys Harries, started together at the White Lines film scene, which deals with the swallowing and swallowing of Ibiza, but in a search of accommodations over the past week, their appearance was different and calmer, far from the pleasures of the party island.
The couple, who play the siblings in the Netflix show line popular, were seen viewing a magnificent country farm in Oxfordshire, which is for sale at 1.2 million pounds.
They arrived at the area of Range Rover, which Laura, 34, drove, dressed in jeans and white shirts, and met real estate agents who led them on a tour of the five - room house.
In White Lines, which was taken up last fall, Laura played the role of Zoe Walker, who learns the darker side of Ibiza when she investigates the murder of her brother, Alex, who is played by Tom, 28.
Not until this month, less than a year after the end of Laura’s six - year marriage to Sam Claflin, known from Hunger Games, did not reveal their relationship.
Together, the four - year - old son Pip and the daughter Margot, who is two years old.
When they reported on the divorce in August last year, Claflin, 34, wrote to Instagram: “I have decided to understand divorce, we understand in love, friendship, and with deep respect for each other, and we will continue our cooperation in the training of our children.
Laura and Sam met first in 2011 in an audition, and Sam, who has also played in Peaky Blinders, described their wedding in 2013 as “no doubt one of the greatest achievements of my life. ”
Before Laura got her role in White Lines, she had played in the first Inbetweeners movie, and in the crime drama The Capture of the BBC, which was shown last year, where she played the lawyer Hannah Roberts.
Tom played a role in the second Inbetweener film and in the series Brittania from Sky.
Counts too early to claim another wave here on land
A health - protection expert at the agrologist’s office says too early to claim another wave of the epidemic.
Three new domestic infections were detected in the Landspital virology department yesterday and dozens have contracted disease.
Two domestic infections were detected on Thursday, one in a male in his 30 ’ s and the other in a male in his 20 ’ s.
At that time no infection had been detected since the beginning of the month.
Yesterday, three more domestic infections were detected, one of which had been at the Rey Cup soccer tournament in Laugardal.
In a conversation with a newsroom, a government secretary named John K. Jonsson said that fewer people had to be screened for this infection than was originally thought.
Another infection occurs in a person who came to the country from abroad on July 15.
At that time, the so - called homecoming gate rules had become valid.
Kamilla Rut Sigfusdóttir, a health - protection expert at the National Medical Office, says that this person, on the other hand, followed the old procedure.
His vision was negative when he came to the land, but he became ill when he was isolated and six were put in sick.
They're all on their way to the show, but two of them are starting to show signs.
The third infection has since been associated with the older man who was diagnosed on Thursday and who has been diagnosed with disease.
It has been found that there is a new variation of the coronal virus that has not been detected in the country before.
“We don’t know exactly where this virus type comes from, but we haven’t seen it before.
He who is believed to have carried the virus to the land had been in Israel but also in other European countries."
She believes it is too early to claim that the so - called other waves of the epidemic have started here, just as other countries in Europe fear.
“ While the majority are still traceable, it is not appropriate to do so.
But we are on our toes and are watching, thinking of ways to fail if anything like that could go forth."
Megan Fox expresses herself about the relationship
Megan Fox says he found his twin soul in the machine gun Kelly rapper.
“ As soon as I met him and looked into his eyes, I knew.
I am interested in constellations, and I immediately knew that my twin soul was involved," says Fox, 34 years old.
“A twin soul is when the soul has reached a level of existence enough to divide into two different bodies at the same time, ” said Fox.
“ So we are two halves of the same soul, I think.
I told him as soon as we met.
I found it right away."
“ After we had known him for two days, I asked him to meet me at lunch, and I taught him about the constellations and asked him about his life.
I decided to go to the depths right away."
Machine Gun Kelly takes the same line as they met when they were filming.
“ I was just hanging outside her trailer and hoping to see it.
She has the most beautiful eyes I've ever seen."
Only two months have passed since Fox divorced his husband to ten years of age, Brian Austin Green.
They have three sons together.
Kanye Apologizes Kim
The U.S. musician, the tyscogul, and Presidential Representative Kanye West have apologized to Kim Kardashian West for making public statements about family privacy.
“ I’d like to apologize to my wife Kim for discussing private matters publicly, ” he wrote on Twitter last night.
The situation of their relationship has been very uncertain, but Kanye has recently gone a great deal on social media and at a mass meeting held last Monday, he discussed among other things the birth of his daughter North West and said that he almost killed her.
Kim then stepped up to Wednesday and sent a message to his followers on Instagram, where she discussed her husband’s illness, which is diagnosed with bipolar disorder.
Not before, Kardashian West has made public statements about her husband’s illness, saying that it is because of their children and the rights of Kanye to privacy when he or she comes to his or her health.

Increased emphasis in protests against racial rights in the United States
Protestants have walked the streets of many cities in the United States to draw attention to racial injustice.
Objections have lasted for two months in Portland, Oregon, since May 25, when George Floyd died in a police station in Minnesota, Minnesota.
The Trump government has sent FBI officers to Portland, and thus still fueled the protests.
Protestants are now also protesting the presence of federal policemen in the city.
In Seattle on Saturday, after a protest meeting to support the protests in Portland, police used bombs and tear gas and arrested 45 people.
According to police, more than 20 police officers were injured.
One died on Saturday night in Austin, Texas, when a gun was fired into Black Lives Matter's claim walk.
Media reports that the man may have walked up to a car - armed rifle before he was shot.
“The point is that it’s terrible that someone should die in protests, ” said Mayor Austin, Steve Adler.
Adler said that he was “compassionate and speechless. ”
In Lousville, Kentucky, a group of armed Protestants demanded justice in the case of Breonna Taylor, a black woman who died in Louisville when a police officer broke into her home, with permission to enter without knocking, and shot her.
My girlfriend Taylor had first shot at the police, because he thought they were burglars.
One officer has been expelled for Taylor’s death, but the other officers have not been charged.
The leader of the NFAC group, an armed group of black rebels who have participated in the protests, calls for more transparency in a police investigation of Taylor's murder.
According to police information, three members of the NFAC were injured on Saturday when a gun was accidentally fired by the rebel army.
Possible group infection in the sickle
Five have been diagnosed with Covid-19 infection this week outside the border.
Two of them were diagnosed with previously unseen variants of the virus and appear to have three out of five known to be completely unclear.
Whether the individuals were infected by tourists who have left the country or by an assimilated Icelander, who probably infected many more people, is uncertain.
The presence of a pathologist indicates that a possible group infection may be associated with one of the infections.
Two were diagnosed with Covid-19 in the country last Thursday, with each type of virus.
The source of the infection is still unclear.
Three were diagnosed with the virus yesterday; one of them has been infected by one of those who were diagnosed on Thursday, the other came to the country on July 15, last year, and probably became infected outside, but the third is also infected with an unknown source.
After a sequencing analysis in the Icelandic genetic analysis, it was found that the two individuals who were diagnosed with the virus and associated with the new variant of the virus that has not previously been detected in this country.
Kamilla Josephsdóttir, an expert in the field of disease prevention at Land doctor and a substitute for a health - care professional, says that an Icelandic genetic analysis is now under way, which is most likely the source of this type of virus.
“The second case was similar to a virus that has been in Switzerland but not quite the same.
They're going to look at this and try to map it out better and lead a lot of people to what part of the world the infection comes from," she says.
"But it seems to be right here on the side of the Atlantic."
Thus, the two that came up at the beginning of July were exposed to the United States.
Do you assume that this new species has come from outside rather than from within?
“Yes, this is different from what has previously been found here, ” Kamilla answers.
“There is every likelihood that these individuals may in some way have become aware of a person who has just arrived somewhere outside, without knowing it for themselves.”
She says that so far there is no indication of where this new virus might have come from.
“ It could be a tourist who has left the country again, but it could also be someone who does not have symptoms and does not realize that he has been infected, and then, of course, more infections could result.
We'll be on our toes the next few days to watch it."
“At the moment, there is no clear-cut group infection.
But there are individuals who have contracted disease in connection with one of yesterday's infections, who have symptoms and have already taken samples," Kamilla continues.
“We haven’t yet got their results.
Thus, this could potentially be group infection in a sickle."
Do you expect that there will be community contamination now?
“ It’s not impossible.
It has not been recently, but it is not impossible because we do not know who has carried this infection in these individuals, who were diagnosed on Tuesday and on the other hand yesterday." she replies.
Could it be said that there is now a new wave of the virus?
“ No, not yet.
Of course, we need to be very alert, and we need to keep that in mind, though, there is such a limit to how much vision we can take in people.
We don't take samples from asymptomatic people, but first that we're getting infections that seem to be undetectable, we need to be given a little more hands off by taking samples from people with symptoms," she says.
In this way, it can be expected that the Department of Bacterial and Virology will be involved in the screenings in the next few days in order to try to better map the situation here nationally.
Does the National Hospital have the ability to increase domestic screening and screening?
“Not unlimited, no.
Therefore, there must be some basis for taking samples in individuals who are not in the screening subjects; the subject must be sick and show symptoms or then have had symptoms and suspicions of contacting someone who has just arrived in the country or something like that," says Kamilla.
It notes that the infections detected yesterday are still being transmitted and that much work is now being done to obtain information about the individual’s journeys.
It says that the origins of domestic infections seem undetectable, but it does not rule out the possibility that some of those who have now been infected may provide evidence that eventually leads the infecting team to the original infections.
The restaurant that most people don't know but one of the best
Not everyone knows where the restaurant Björgsteinn is located, and it probably has more fans in the country than in the country if it is mentioned on TripAdvisor and other sites.
There have been reports of people who have flown to the land in order not to be surprised.
Mountain fountain of daughter-in-law, food blogger and cookbook author, hit Björgstein in the daytime, and kept water in for a thrill
“ I don’t know where to start, so the Björgsteinn restaurant on Grundarfurt is clearly a wonderful place.
The story of the house is one of the most adorable things I know, the food of ten, the view not of the worse end, and the wonderfully entertaining servants," says Bergspring.
“ Gunni, the owner of Bjargstein, magically honored each one of us before us.
My wife and I sat down with our girls for a whole evening, so it must have told me how good the food was," Bergspring adds.
“The house where the restaurant is run is an old apartment house that was moved in one piece on Grundarfjörd.
Present owners kept their eyes on this house for sale in Akranes, found a beautiful track of waters on Grundforst, and made the dream come true.
You can read more about the history of the house on the home page of Bjargstein."
“Houses and all the surroundings of the Rock are unique.
The family has accumulated differences, and it truly brings home its taste.
On the upper floor there is a lounge and a really cozy and homely place to enter this wonderful restaurant.
The quality and cooking then do not conceal themselves, and it is evident that much is being done to enchant tasteful and beautiful restaurants," says Bergspring.

Mick Fleetwood praises Peter Green: "His music will live"
Mick Fleetwood praised Peter Green, cofounder of Fleetwood Mac, who died today at the age of 73.
Green was a founding member of this historic rock band, along with the former Mick and Jeremy Spencer.
Although Green left the band in 1970, before reaching her peak with records such as Rumours, Mick has praised this former band member and assured fans that “his music will live on. ”
"For me and all the former and current members of Fleetwood Mac, losing Peter Green is a great memory," said Fleetwood in a conversation with PA.
“Peter was the man who founded Fleetwood Mac together with me, John McVie and Jeremy Spencer.
No one has ever joined Fleetwood Mac without having deep respect for Peter Green and his talents, and the fact that the music should shine brightly and be conveyed with unshakable passion."
"Peter, I will miss you, but be sure your music will live," added the 73-year-old rock star.
“I thank you for asking if I wanted to be your drummer all those years ago.
We did well, and we did a good job of running a track of music that has been enjoyed by so many.
"God be with you, my dear friend... with love and respect, Mick Fleetwood."

Prince Jehoakim’s Feelings Said Constantly
Joakim Danaprin, the younger son of Margaret Thorhildar Dana Queen and Henry Danaprin, is still in a hospital in Toulouse, France, where he underwent surgery the day before because of blood clots in the brain.
According to the speaker of the Danish court, the Danish government radio, DR, says that it is uncertain how long the 51 - year - old prince will be in the hospital, but his condition remains stable.
According to a report by DR, the effect of the blood clot on the prince’s health is now being investigated.
It is reported by your doctor Peter Qvortrup Geisling, who deals with the health care of DR, that the consequences of a blood clot in the brain often do not occur until days after surgery.
“ It can be anything from minor symptoms to paralysis, memory problems or difficulty in expressing, ” says Geisling.
He says the prince could be waiting for months of rehabilitation.
Joakim Danaprins, who is called Joachim Holger Waldemar Christian and is also Count of Monpezat, stayed at the family vineyard, Château de Cayx in southern France when he fell ill on Friday night.
He was first hospitalized in the town of Cahor, which is close to the ranch, but then transferred to the university hospital in Toulouse, where he underwent surgery for blood clots in the brain.
Google Pixel 4 can form the Milky Way galaxy
A double optical zoom allows the extra lens of Pixel 4 to be seen in a three-dimensional way, thus providing a better contrast in the background with a face-to-face setting than in previous Pixel phones, which fully trusted software to achieve these so-called "bocheh" effects.
To demonstrate the quality of the camera, Google’s legendary photographer Annie Leibovitz was asked to discuss his experience in photography with Pixel 4 in the past 12 months.
Computer studies are still in the foreground in all aspects of new Google smartphones, and in this phone, "computer-controlled photography" is new to improve HDR+ settings by combining up to nine different images.
New dual lighting controls offer different brightness and shadow slides and allow users to preview HDR+ in real time.
The phone also relies on mechanical engineering to offer better automatic whitening and improved Night Sight night settings, which are so sensitive that it can capture the Milky Way galaxy in the night sky.
In addition to the second camera actuator, Pixel 4 Soli introduces a "circuit recorder" on the front of the phone that distinguishes Motion Sense motions so that users can skip track, turn off timing, turn the alarm on or turn the phone off by waving a hand.
All calculations of Motion Sense are performed on the device instead of connecting to the Internet and the same applies to improved Google help, where the technician now emphasizes reducing response time and improving the privacy of the user.
Google’s continued emphasis on making full use of its machine learning capabilities has also resulted in a new voice recording app that transfers audio directly without sending data to the Internet.
The app is currently only available in English, but more languages are expected.
Pixel 4 will also be the first phone to support Google Stadium, a playground in the cloud that will be launched on November 19th, U.S.A., but will still report the date for Australia.
In addition to new Pixel phones, Google also introduced a new Pixelbook Go Chromebook computer and another generation of Google Pixel Buds hearing aids.
The new Bluetooth 5.0 smart earphones, which are expected next year, are completely wireless and have a sound adjustment that listens to the environment and constantly adjusts the sound to its maximum clarity.
The new Bluetooth 5.0 smart hearing aids are completely wireless and adjust your volume to the noise around you.
Google also announced an update of its connected Wi-Fi homebone in the Nest Wi-Fi line with a special bone, along with many bases working together to improve wireless connection within the home.
The new Wi-Fi system, which will record the Nest name, doubles its predecessor's drag and adds built-in microphones and speakers to use the Google-helper at each base in the home.
It's for sale in Australia on November 5th, and costs 399 australyls for the bone and one Wi-Fi point or $549 for two Wi-Fi points.
Google Home Mini has also been updated, but a new 79-dollar Nest Mini improves the sound quality by doubling the bass and has received a built-in wall fixation.
All Google Smartphones will have a new call system capability for communication between devices in the home as well as the ability to call Nest Mini outside the home with the Google Home app.
LIGHTING DAY: Final Day of the Great Division, Juventus Can Seal the Victory
Here is a review of football in Europe on Sunday:
This is the last day of the season, and much remains to be done: participation in the Championship and the European Union, the last two bases and the Gold Choir.
Manchester United, Chelsea and Leicester are fighting for the last two seats in the championship after Masters Liverpool and Manchester City, second place.
One point clears the past three, and Leicester receives the United.
Wolverhampton and Tottenam are fighting for a seat in the European Union.
Aston Villa, Watford and Bournemouth want to avoid the two bases left next to Norwich, which has already fallen.
When there's one game left, Jamie Vardy from Leicester is the top player with 23 borders, two more than Danny Ings from Southampton and three more than Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang from Arsenal.
The gamble to get into the elite department begins with Swansea receiving Brentford in their first play.
Fulham plays Cardiff in the other playoffs that begin on Monday.
Leeds and West Bromwich are already out of the next division.
Juventus can beat his own record by winning the ninth title of Series A, with victory over Sampdoria.
Thus, Bianconeri would be seven points after Inter Milan, which is second place when two games remain.
On the other hand, Lecce needs to work in Bologna to further hope of staying away from falling down the branch.
Lecce is four points behind Genoa, which is in the 17th place and is one game ahead.
A pole-hunter "saw a bottle of beer in a sell" in Devon
A barber threw a bottle of beer at a sale when he interrupted the fishing line, according to a charity organization.
Images taken at Hope's Nose near Torquay seem to show a man on a rock that throws a share towards an animal.
Duncan Kenny, who took the pictures, said that the gray seal had been fishing when the pole hunter emptied the bottle and threw it behind the animal.
Kenny called it “a fear - inspiring and reckless behavior. ”
He said he was picking up garbage at this beautiful place in Devon last Sunday morning with other people in the seal Project when he witnessed the attack.
"The seal tried to get to the fishing line," he said.
“ The barber stretched the beer, emptied the bottle, and threw it into the stall.
“The bottle landed on the back of the seal and he swam away.”
One scholar said that “happy, ” but that the seller was simply doing what was natural to him.
“ Throwing a bottle of glass into it means stopping it on its hunt, ” he said.
The Seal Project Society said that this was "not an isolated case" and that it had recently received "many reports of this aggressive behaviour".
The company's Facebook account says that its volunteers collected 12 bags of garbage in the collection at Hope's Nose on Sunday and that 'many examples of anti-social behaviour' were seen.
All sales are protected by the laws on the protection of celeries, and people are asked to stay away from them.
Giants From Christian Pollen in Laxah, Dalum
The first centurion was caught in Laxá, in the valleys of Dalum today.
It was the work of Arnor Isfjörd Gudmundsson.
He had put in a cave in a Christian pool this morning and was 89 centimeters [89 cm].
After lunch, he again had a chance at a Christian pool and was reminded of a story that he had heard about the slowness after the harrowing.
With this in mind, he took the Collie Dog King and threw over Christian pollen.
Soon he was taken and, as he himself tells.
“ After about five seconds, he cleaned himself completely, and I realized that it was the meter.
I got stressed because I had 11 pounds.
Usually I catch fish, but I had it for forty minutes.
In fact, he was quite comfortable.
I took a few trips up and down the pond, but then I got to strand it, and it was a great feeling.
Crawl off my pole and jump on it.
He measured ten inches [102 cm], and I doubted him," said a merry hunter in the huntsman's house, a Serpent's gild in Laxah, Dalum, in conversation with Spores.
Arnor is like no beginner when it comes to hundreds of calls.
That was his eighth.
He received such fish in Mix, Black River, Rush Valley, Kjarrá, two in Langadalså, and one in the East of Ranga.
According to Arnor, fine fishing is in Laxah, Dalum.
Tomorrow’s Hollow, which will finish at noon, has 35 salmon, and our husband has 18 of them.
Expecting a Great Flood From Hannah
Hannah, the first Atlantic hurricane of this year, caught land in Texas, U.S.A.
Hannah quickly lost her strength and experienced storms, but despite this, there has been a great rainfall in the area and is expected to be a great flood.
Thus, it is expected to rain up to two inches [30 cm] in one day, but in special locations it could reach up to six inches [46 cm], according to the AP Newspaper.
In particular, they warn of dangerous flash floods that could occur as a result of the rain.
The area where Hannah landed has been hit by the widespread spread of the new coronary virus there.
In addition, seas have gone ashore causing damage.
There are now at least 43,700 people without electricity and a large number of relief stations have been opened in the area.
Donald Trump, president of the United States, was talking about the hurricane last night and told people that they were listening to experts and following orders.
Below is a photograph taken by the AP News Force’s cameraman this morning.
House burned, shops robbed and internal damage
More than sixty are dead and sixty more wounded after an attack in the village of Masteri in the Darfur region of Sudan yesterday.
The attack “was the latest in a series of serious security incidents in the last few weeks in which houses were burned, shops and markets robbed and internal damage, ” as stated in a statement from the United Nations Office of Human Rights in the capital Map issued today.
Abdalla Hamdok, Prime Minister of Sudan, has announced that security forces will be sent to the war zone to “protect the inhabitants and the crops. ”
Only two days ago, an unknown army in the area killed at least 20 civilians, including children, in another attack.
"The atrocities of violence in different parts of the Darfur region are leading to increased upheavals, endangering agriculture and threatening people's lives and livelihoods," says the United Nations.
The conflict in Darfur, in western Sudan, began in 2003 when most Arab rebels rose against the governor of Kartum.
The forces of government and Arab troops, who tried to overthrow the rebellion, have been accused of widespread atrocities, while some 300,000 were killed in the United Nations ’ judgment.
Omas al-Bashir, who was overthrown by a chair as leader of Sudan, is wanted by the International Criminal Court for alleged war crimes, genocides and crimes against humanity in Darfur.
Meanwhile, new governments in Sudan are now trying to negotiate peace with major rebel groups.
TV reporters thank the audience for noticing cancer lumps
TAMPA, Florida (AP) — A TV reporter in Florida thanks an observer for noticing her neck and e - mailing her that she should be checked.
Victoria Price, a reporter at WFLA in Tampa, took this advice and was diagnosed with cancer.
Price said on Twitter that she was going to have surgery on Monday to remove the tumour, the thyroid, and some lymph nodes.
"The doctor said it was dispersing, but not too much, and we hope that this will be my first and last operation," she said.
The observer e - mailed Price for the last month and said that the nod reminded her of a knot she had had.
Price, a 28 - year - old researcher, said this week that her TV station’s slogan was “8 on your side. ”
“ But the role was changed recently when the audience was involved with ME and I couldn’t be more grateful, ” Price said.
“ I will be forever grateful to the woman who made it possible for me to send an e - mail to a totally foreign woman.
She had no obligation to do so, but she did.
Talking about being with a man in a team."
The Jeronimo Open Space area is temporarily closed after two Gulf attacks – CBS Los Angeles
Two were bitten by the coyotes near the Oso Creek footpath on Jeronimo Road in Mission Viejo on Saturday morning and had to close the route temporarily.
Laura Wittmer says she sees a coyote almost every morning, and usually she tries to avoid them, but on Saturday morning, one came right to her and bit her foot.
The route has been closed while the attacks are being investigated.
"Today, two different parties announced that the coyotes had been bitten by a human being.
Wittmer tried to take off the coyote with a bottle of water.
She called the emergency line to get to her car and was able to drive to an emergency room herself.
The coyote disappeared, but public officials hope to fire it and test it for rabies.
Wittmer will be treated for rabies as a precautionary measure for the next two weeks.
She said that this frightening incident would not keep her from the morning races, but from now on she would choose another place.
The condition of the other person who was bitten is not clear.
The protesters of racial hatred come together with the Seattle police.
Battles in Seattle on Sunday between police and Protestants against racial hatred ended with the arrest of a number of people, but dissatisfaction among the public because of President Donald Trump's plan to send a number of federal policemen into major cities.
Objections to racial hatred and police violence have arisen following the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man, in Minneapolis, May.
On Saturday, protestors in Seattle cut their bicycles and broke windows in their wheelhouses on the protests, causing police to declare riots and empty the streets with pepper sprays and blasts.
Opposers also set off bicycle homes in a construction site for a future juvenile prison.
The police said they arrested 45 people, but 21 police officers had been injured.
The protest march was held in support of the protests held in the neighboring city of Portland, Oregon.
Portland is in the spotlight after Trump ordered very controversial radical action by federal police forces, in spite of local authorities, who say the police are exercising excessive power.
Objections have been held in Austin, Texas, as well as in Louisville, Kentucky, New York, Omaha, and Nebraska, Oakland, and Los Angeles, California, and Richmond, Virginia.
In Austin, Texas State Capital, one was shot to death in armed conflicts in downtown on Saturday night, according to the police.
At the same time, Trump is increasingly fighting for reelection in November, and has adopted a tough policy of law enforcement.
