Food debt due to European inflation
The main reason for the rise in inflation in the euro area is the rapid rise in food prices.
In the 13 countries of the Eurozone, inflation was higher than expected in November - after 2.6 percent in October, an annual inflation rate of 3.1 percent was recorded, as reported by the EU Statistical Office in Luxembourg.
Official forecasts are based on only 3 percent, Bloomberg reported.
In contrast to the American, British and Canadian central bank, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not reduced the Leitzinsin. In its opinion, the reduction in interest rates would favour the rise in raw material prices and the slight fall in unemployment to create a spiral of inflation.
The ECB aims to keep the inflation rate below two per cent, or at least close to the two per cent mark.
According to one analyst, the ECB is in the zwickmühle: inflation had to be "agreed" in order to rule out the need for further action.
At 3.3 percent, the inflation rate reached a 12-year record high in Germany in November; in Spain, the rate rose from 3.6 to 4.1 percent.
The rise in inflation in the euro area was due to the rise in food and energy prices.
The MATIF wheat quotations increased by 88 percent, and the price for soybeans has also reached a record high since 1973.
There was also a significant cost in 2007 for food oil and dairy products.
The world market price for crude oil rose by 52 percent this year - last month the price per barrel of black gold reached nearly 100 US dollars.
According to the ECB, inflation will rise from 2.1 to 2.5 percent in 2008 but is expected to fall to 1.9 percent in 2009.
For the next 3-4 months, analysts estimate a 3-percent inflation rate, but the annual average rate is 2.1 percent.
For 2008, experts expect the ECB to reduce interest twice.
Gallup local government crisis
After long stagnation, the number of Fidesz sympathizers has grown considerably until the beginning of December. For the first time since 2002, the party has had the largest base camp, while according to Gallup, the socialists' approval has reached an unprecedented low of 13 percent.
In the case of party voters, the difference is evident thanks to the high determination of the opposition advocates: More than two thirds (71 percent) are opposed to a fifth (20 percent) consent for the MSZP.
According to the survey, MDF and SZDSZ are below the parliamentary entry rate: they reach two percent in the total population.
The number of party voters has grown by one percent in both camps.
Compared to the last low point, the general economic climate has worsened further - never before has the proportion of those who consider the country's economic situation to be "very bad" been so high (41%), while another 46% consider it to be "very bad".
After more hopeful prospects in spring and summer, families see the change in their financial situation again more pessimistic.
For the coming year, the majority of the population expects a further deterioration in the situation; only one tenth is expected to improve.
A Gallup survey conducted in December found that 71% of respondents - a historical high - considered the Prime Minister's work to be "better bad than right".
Thirteen percent of respondents have great confidence or confidence in Ferenc Gyurcsány in general, while the percentage of supporters for Viktor Orbán is 38 percent.
Some 54% do not trust the head of government at all, compared with 27% mistrust of Fidesz's party leader.
One of the indicators of the political mood is the number of people who think they could get the dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister even without change of government.
If, after the unrest last October, 35% were still in favour of the government and the head of government, this figure is only 20% today, while the relative majority (33 percent) sees the solution only in re-elections.
Asked for their interest in the referendum, 60 percent replied that they would participate "with certainty" and another 20% would "probably" give their vote.
By comparison, if the parliamentary elections were to take place on this Sunday, only 55 per cent would go to the urns "with certainty", another 15% would consider their participation "probably".
74% would vote against the tuition fee, 79% against the practical fee, and 84% against the hospital daily fee.
Turned to the group of participants in the referendum "with certainty" the shares of the opponents of study, practice and hospital fees would even amount to 81, 84, and 89 percent respectively.
Also the most expensive, Tesco increases by almost a fifth
Hypermarkets in the Budaörser trade area have also maintained the average price increase of 16% last year, with the difference that there was no increase in VAT this year.
Article from Napi Gazdaság
In the Budaörser Handelsdreieck, the price of the usual Christmas basket of the "Napi" has increased by 16 percent this year, but price increases of more than 1,000 HUF have been recorded in all hypermarkets.
After last December's prices in the food markets have been "davongalopped", the price rate has not fallen dramatically, compared to the already high, earlier starting level.
However, it certainly has a deterrent effect on consumers that what they paid for last year is not even available for HUF 10,000.
The price of the "Napi" basket exceeded the magical 10,000 HUF limit by at least 91 HUF in the investigated markets.
The highest price was HUF 10,573.
(In 6800 the price was 6,800 HUF.)
Prices for Unicum and live fish remained almost at the previous year's level, while prices for turkey breast fillets, nuts and poppies have risen sharply.
Prices for flour and bread corresponded to the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary, but there were 1kg of bread Weeks for 139 Forint.
There was no competitive price drop of less than 200 forints in the product.
Also surprising here was the price of a two litre Coca-Cola pan bottle of less than 200 Forint, so the drink including deposit cost only 257 HUF.
Nevertheless, this year the "Napi" basket comparison also cut off the most expensive, and Cora the most favorable.
Our calculations have shown that Cora has increased prices in the "Napi" basket compared to the Christmas prices last year by 15, while Tesco and Auchan each increased by 18 percent.
The difference between the cheapest basket of the previous year and the most expensive of the year was 12%, while the increase between the cheapest basket last year and the most expensive of the current year was 21%.
The average price increase was HUF 1,480.00.
The average price increase was still at 1,206,00 Forint in the previous year, but the increase in value added tax (VAT) was noticeable at last Christmas.
This is precisely the course of trade: it seems that the department stores could not quite decide which price range to apply to the individual articles, since the impact of the price increase on consumption was inevitable.
(If the dealer has a bad plan for the speed of circulation of a product, he can fall for substantial gains in the price range, which is based on the traffic intensity.)
The price of the "napi" basket last year was so radical that the most expensive basket exceeded the 2006 value of 1720 forint, whereas the price difference for the cheapest basket was only 844 forint.
This year, such extremes were not observed, as the most expensive basket cost about 1,630.00 Forint more than in the previous year, and even at the cheapest there was a price increase of 1,284,00 Forint.
Compared to the last two Christmas seasons, a catastrophic price increase has been observed, with the price of daily consumer goods in hypermarkets rising by more than 30 percent in less than 20 months.
(This, in turn, does not necessarily confirm the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary: for some basic foods, the Statistical Office established a more than 30 percent price over the period of 12 months.
So in about next to flour also with eggs.)
However, if you take a look at the "Napi" shopping cart, this seems almost impossible at the latter, as the price level of the product already expensive in the previous year has risen by hardly more than 10 percent even in the worst case.
Apparently, flour suppliers are in a stronger position than egg suppliers - at least they could shift the drastic price increase to the multis.
In the golden trade triangle, hypermarkets are not complaining; good years are constantly being reported.
Our experience shows that the majority of customers in the three department stores no longer look at the prices.
It is bought out of all large quantities, durable food goes in pallets across the barn tables.
Wednesday morning morning in all three department stores there were endless snakes at the cash register, when suddenly the number of customers exploded.
However, a lower customer frequency is reported by the country, so that many multis complain to opinion researchers that they could not even achieve the planned turnover, not only for food but also for sustainable consumer goods.
In many places, disinfectants are saved
This year, more than a thousand infections have been recorded in hospitals due to improper handling of antibiotics.
The hygiene conditions in the hospitals, the overcrowding of beds, the overcrowding of staff - all factors that do not exactly contribute to the containment of infections, according to the leading doctor of the National Epidemiology Centre.
In many places the disinfectants are also saved.
In the traumatology department of the János hospital an MRSA infection was recently diagnosed.
The antibiotic-resistant bacterium was found in a male patient who was hospitalized after a serious accident.
The patient was isolated.
At the beginning of the year there was already a similar infection here.
The injured person of a serious car accident was released from the hospital, but a little later the man had to return with an MRSA infection. Since then, an important operation has not been performed due to the bacterium still in the patient’s body.
Until December 10 of this year, multi-resistant pathogen-induced infections to the National Nosocomomialis Surveillance System were reported from hospitals in 1094, according to Karolina Böröcz, the lead doctor of the National Epidemiology Center.
So many infections caused by multi-resistant pathogens have been recorded in hospitals with certainty, but the dark figure is likely to be higher.
About two thirds of infections (683 cases) were caused by MRSA, the Staphylococcus aureus resistant to methicillin oxacillin.
The Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria carries about one third of the people in their nose without causing any disease.
SA-related infections (such as sore throat, almond inflammation, inflammation of the skin or wounds) usually respond well to antibiotics, they are well curable.
However, if the substances are used too high or inappropriately, they are caused by the well-responsive bacteria, antibiotics-resistant, which spread rapidly in hospitals under appropriate conditions.
Especially in patients with weakened, or permanently malfunctioning immune system, but also in the elderly, or patients with low body weight, these bacteria can cause severe infections, such as wound infection or blood poisoning, i.e. sepsis.
According to the medical director of the János Hospital, MRSA infection is nothing special, such incidents are part of the everyday routine of the hospital.
One should not confuse the infection with the epidemic, Tibor Nyulasi warned - MRSA just doesn't exist where it's not being searched.
Resistant to Antibiotics
"These patients are isolated, the caregiver wears rubber gloves and masks in the supply, and we have the antibiotics necessary for the treatment" - says Tibor Nyulasi.
Although patients are being examined for MRSA at their hospitalisation, an infection cannot always be avoided.
Samples taken too rarely
The majority of infections caused by MRSA in hospitals would be avoidable, but the current conditions and circumstances would be unfavourable for the inhibition of the emergence or spread of the multi-resistant pathogen, says Karolina Böröcz.
After this infection occurs mainly in hospitals and old-age homes, the hospitals should examine the patients who have been hospitalised and immediately isolate MRSA-infected patients.
However, microbiological sampling is not practised so often in Hungarian hospitals.
Not least because there are no grants for this investigation from the State Health Insurance Fund.
Most of the cases would therefore only come to light when the patient already has a notable MRSA infection, according to the medical director of the epidemiology center.
There are strict recommendations from the European Union on the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine, but there are also guidelines in Hungary for the treatment of certain infections and diseases.
Antibiotic therapies should be targeted, i.e. microbiological tests are necessary to prevent resistance to the drug, but this directive is not always complied with by hospitals.
Among the outpatients, or patients in primary care, microbiological samples are even rarer, says Karolina Böröcz.
Saved in the disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that MRSA is most often transferred from one patient to the other by the caregiver.
This is precisely why hand washing, or wearing gloves and masks, is of great importance, but there are also considerable shortcomings in hospitals in this area.
MRSA is transmitted by droplet infection or contact, but in local hospitals there is not always the possibility to isolate the infected patient.
The rooms are often crowded, the beds are scarcely lined, although there should be a distance of at least 1.5 meters between them from an epidemiological point of view.
As Karolina Böröcz further notes, unfortunately, even in the less well-off hospitals, there are few caregivers, many patients - all factors that actually favour the development of infections.
Such infections are proven to be far less common there, or the further spread of the pathogen can be stopped where these protective measures are observed, says Karolina Böröcz.
Government programme against MRSA
Getting MRSA infections into control causes the health insurances enormous costs, so they are fought everywhere.
In England, for example, the prevention of MRSA, or its containment, was recorded in the government programme.
After first signs, the program is successful - as published data prove, the trend of MRSA infections in England is decreasing.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention (ECDC) has identified the prevention of the development of multi-resistant pathogens (including MRSA) and the prevention of infections in hospitals as one of its priorities.
Head of Death Control wasn't drunk.
In the case of a fatal car accident caused by the chief police officer of the XXII district, the official opinion is now available.
The now retired chief of police of the XXII district, who killed a pedestrian in a car accident on Tuesday, was neither alcoholic nor drug-induced, said Attila Morvai, the press spokesperson of the Budapest Supreme State Attorneyate on Friday after the official opinion was presented on the case.
The opinion confirmed the results of the initial investigation, according to which the chief of police had not consumed alcohol before he put himself in charge.
The former chief of police, with his own car in the XXII district, bent into Kossuth Lajos Street, crossing a 55-year-old man who crossed the road at an unmarked spot.
(According to StVO, however, this is not a mitigating circumstance - the handlebar has, even if pedestrians do not cross the road on the zebra strip, aftergrowth.)
The pedestrian is injured after his submission to the hospital.
According to police reports, the handlebar suffered a shock, then abandoned its functions and asked for retirement.
The Budapest Procuratorate has initiated investigations into the incident.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former police chief had cooperated with the investigators from the beginning.
Another EUR 400 million for infrastructure
Finance Minister János Veres and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), signed three credit agreements worth EUR 400 million on Friday in Budapest. The money will flow into education, transport and environmental infrastructure and the energy economy.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) approved a EUR 300 million framework for the financing of transport and environmental projects financed by the Cohesion Fund. The loan agreement of EUR 100 million was signed earlier and the current agreement covers the use of the EUR 200 million granted.
The sum of EUR 150 million agreed in the loan agreement will also be devoted to the budgetary financing of education projects.
The EIB has approved a total of EUR 300 million for this purpose for Hungary and the remaining EUR 150 million will be decided later in the context of the extension of the credit agreement.
In the area of innovation, the Contracting Parties have signed an agreement of EUR 50 million, which will mainly be implemented in research and development programmes at the University of Debrecen.
At the meeting the metro line 4 was also spoken.
It was agreed that once Hungary has clarified the details of metro financing with the EU, the original contract and any modifications will be re-examined.
According to János Veres, this would be possible in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed a total of 113 projects worth EUR 8.4 billion in Hungary.
The loan rates are EURIBOR-bound, the loan is provided by the EIB with a deferral of 8 years, free of commission.
Bulgaria, the real estate paradise of the EU
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is fabulous - the whole of Europe is attentive to the previously rarely mentioned Balkan state.
What, where, and who buys the cheapest market in the EU, but it is becoming more expensive?
An analysis of the Bulgarian Re/Max Division.
Bulgaria is currently undoubtedly the most sought after patch for real estate purchases in the Eastern European region, with cheap ski apartments and houses by the sea.
Between the mountains the regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa are among the most popular, by the sea are Albena, the "Gold Coast", the "Sun Coast", and the historic towns of Sozopol and Nessebar the racers, but real estate around Kavarna and Balcik are also increasingly in demand.
According to estimates by Re/Max analysts in Bulgaria, the interior of the country will also attract investors sooner or later, for example Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, and Triavna, as well as the extremely favorable area of Russians, more buyers are listed.
The capital Sofia also offers tempting offers - commercial and office spaces offer the highest returns.
Bulgaria is best placed to become one of the most attractive European golfer paradises, thus attracting tourists in addition to the summer and winter seasons also in the other two seasons.
For this reason, prospective investors are already purchasing in a large style, for example around Bansko.
According to analysts, people who acquire real estate in Bulgaria are also striving to change their way of life.
Most buyers are English, but there are also interested people from France, Belgium, Spain, and more and more from Romania.
Investors from Malta and Cyprus are also present, while there are mainly Russian buyers at the Black Sea and in the ski resorts.
There are three groups of foreign buyers, says Georgij Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Those who want to settle buy either revitalized properties by 50-100.000 euros, or come down houses by 5-15.000 euros, which they then renovate themselves.
Good connectivity and accessibility as well as communication opportunities are widely written, but also the proximity to a large city, shops and doctors are crucial for the buyers.
The second category includes those who are looking for a holiday home (Bulgaria was listed among the top ten holiday destinations of the Germans in December).
The third group is business people who invest with the aim of a medium- to long-term increase in value.
However, real estate in the capital is becoming increasingly expensive due to the ever-growing demand.
Within the EU, real estate prices are the lowest in Bulgaria, but in the last five years, there has been an annual price increase of 21 percent.
The price of real estate prices far exceeds the increase in salaries.
Fodor and the six Hungarian percentages
As Environment Minister Gábor Fodor announced, the expert meetings will end on Tuesday, and the debate on the international climate regime after 2012 will continue on Wednesday after the official opening.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries discuss the Bali roadmap, which sets out emission reduction measures for the period after 2012, i.e. after the end of the Kyoto Protocol.
There is currently a heated debate between industrial and developing countries.
The US has already signaled that they do not want to negotiate specific figures, but they would be willing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40 percent by 2020 compared to 1990.
The other major issue of the conference is whether the industrialised countries are willing to support developing countries both financially and technologically in addition to reducing emissions.
An agreement was also reached on the support of developing countries.
The Kyoto Adjustment Fund is to be managed by a 16-member Council, which is expected to be part of the UN Global Environmental Facility (GEF), as shown in the 'Piac és Profit'.
Six percent of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, Environment Minister Gábor Fodor supports the EU's efforts to maintain its pioneering role in global climate change measures and to reach a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister said that the EU would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2020 (as measured by 1990 values), regardless of whether the "agreement after 2012" was successful or not. The Union would even be willing to use itself for a 30% reduction, provided that other major industrialised countries in the world, or developing countries, are also willing to fulfil their obligations according to their strengths and responsibilities.
Gábor Fodor stressed that the objective of the countries that had joined the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 was a reduction of only 5.2%, whereas the EU had already committed itself to a reduction of 8% with its 15 Member States.
The target for Hungary is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6% compared to 1985-87 - a target that the country will meet, as can be seen in the Ministry of the Environment's press release.
The commitment is high in Bali - after all, the long-term international climate agreement must be completed within two years, otherwise it would certainly not enter into force until after 2012. In this case, the reduction project set out in the Kyoto Protocol would not follow a renewed international emission reduction system, the importance of which has also been highlighted in its latest report by the IPCC, the UN Scientific Committee on Climate Change, which is awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
This would delay the emission reduction, and the increase in the average temperature of the earth by more than 2°C would be inevitable, which, according to scientists, would result in extremely serious and irreparable consequences.
British army advertises on YouTube
Units of the British Army have published recordings of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan to increase popularity on the video portal.
First, the British Air Force (RAF) discovered YouTube for itself: Since March 2006, special units stationed in Afghanistan have been uploading videos of operations conducted against the Taliban, reports the BBC.
The miniature cameras, which are mounted on helmets, are controlled at the Air Force Base in Kandahar and then sent to London, where they are placed on the Internet.
Political message inevitable
Air Force soldiers have already contributed 139 such recordings, their "channel" has been viewed more than 75,000 times.
The British Ministry of Defence was registered under "defenceheadquarters" in spring 2007 to publish videos on Iraqi and Afghan operations, but also the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Commonwealth Office) and the International Peace Forces (MNFIs) stationed in Iraq have their own YouTube channels.
Use in Afghanistan
Originally, the Air Force has published the videos with the aim of recruiting soldiers, and, as the Ministry of Defence says, the contributions also serve the purpose of informing the population about the actual objectives of foreign operations.
According to defense expert Gordon Mackenzie to the BBC, this kind of published propaganda is almost free of charge compared to conventional television advertising, but these videos always carry a certain degree of political message in themselves, as they confirm the existence of the military measures decided by the government in their own way.
Americans advertise with game
But the army must also fight against amateur shots that create it alongside the carefully processed, censored shots into the net - such as those that show the death of the soldiers: In the somewhat hypocritical, "official" propaganda films, it is spoken of at most the losses, but the bloody sides of the war are not shown.
By the way, many videos of the war scenes in Iraq and Afghanistan have already been loaded into the platform, but the British have only recently discovered this "gift".
The Americans, however, advertise in a slightly different way, namely with the free downloadable shooting game "America's Army", in which the player can slip into the soldier's skin as part of a more or less life-threatening simulation.
Christmas party with tombola and pogatsche in the ministries
Minister of Labour Mónika Lamperth is by no means simplistic: instead of a Christmas celebration, she is organising a work conference where her employees can end the year 2007 with coffee and pogatsche.
Some ministries celebrate with live music, others enchant Christmas spirit with tombola or impulses into the official hearts.
Party, Christmas spirit, concerts and buffet - this is how power celebrates.
The Christmas fever has already taken over the offices.
The largest Christmas celebration of a Ministry is held this year in the Defence Department, but the staff of the Ministry are not expected to do so.
At the "Christmas Celebration of the Orphans" children are given by fallen soldiers, during the "Mission Celebration" family members are hosted by soldiers currently stationed abroad, but there is also a reception for the press.
The resort provides around 25 million for the celebrations.
Compared to other departments, the National Development Agency (NDA) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport beat over the strands.
The 4.32 Mio Forint Christmas celebration of the Ministry of Economic Affairs is held in the House of the Future, about 350 of the 600 employees are expected.
Although the focus of the celebrations is on Christmas, there will also be live acts and a tombola draw.
The National Agency for Development (NFÜ) has held its 4.7 million forint-priced Christmas celebration on Wednesday at the House of the State Justice Council (OIT), with concerts and a banquet.
The hall rental was 1 million forint and the rest was spent on the more than 400 invited guests.
According to our information, a section of the NPSU is also invited to another Christmas celebration organised by the Hungarian Economic Development Centre (MAG Zrt) from EU funds.
For the celebration, the building of the Lustspieltheater ("Vígszínház") was rented.
The MAG Zrt has not confirmed this information, as we have not reached the authorities.
What's the suit for?
The OIT building was open not only to guests of the NFD, but also to the Ministry of Justice and Police, which held the Lucia Ball there instead of a Christmas celebration on December 7.
They did not have to pay rent to the OIT for the use of the premises.
About 500 visitors came to the ball.
The celebrations were opened with a minister's speech, after dinner there was live music to dance.
Upon request of [origo] one said: There was no ball dress or suit duty at the ball.
The Ministry of Health, Labour, and Self-Administration prepare themselves for puritanic celebrations.
The Ministry of Health organises the celebration for employees in its own four walls for about 400,000 Forint.
Minister of Labour Mónika Lamperth officially invites her employees, not to a Christmas celebration, but to the conference to the end of the year.
One expects about 180 guests, who - according to the press department - are only hosted with coffee and pogatsche, so the celebration goes out with 350,000 forint.
Minister of Self-Administrative Gordon Bajnai will simply start with his colleagues in the Ministry's auditorium.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) organises a Christmas celebration in its own festival hall, to which 436 employees are expected.
The expenses were measured at 2,500 Forint per head - about this money there is a buffet reception with subsequent incitement.
Since the beginning of the term of office of János Veres, the employees of the PM have been celebrating in this way every year.
However, there will be no real party mood - not only because of the official speech of the Minister, but also because the celebration was scheduled for the afternoon.
The Ministry of Agriculture invites you to a New Year's reception on 20 January, and the Ministry's Christmas celebration is scheduled for this time.
One hundred guests are invited to the Vajdahunyad Castle in the city park ("Városliget") and according to the information of the resort the expenses are measured at 1,000 forints per guest.
As the press department reports, it will be a very simple reception, to which only foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary will be invited.
The receptions, which are held each year, traditionally start with a short speech by the Minister and sound with restraining filth.
As the relevant press offices report on [origo] request, there will be neither a Christmas celebration at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs nor at the Ministry of Education.
Asked about the costs of the Christmas celebration, no information could be given at the press department of the Ministry of the Environment.
In any case, more than 400 guests were invited to the celebration held at the Museum of Fine Arts.
More and more forces mobilized for giant strike
On Friday, the League of Trade Unions and the Hungarian Trade Union Federation will form their coordination committee for the indefinite duration of the strike beginning on Monday.
On Saturday a large protest assembly is held, on Monday - on the day of the referendum to the Health Insurance Act - the work is to begin.
It is expected to have strike-related, significant traffic barriers, as rail traffic is almost completely stopped, and the Budapest public transport companies (BKV) also strike until 1 p.m.
Details of the strike on Monday are announced jointly by the League of Trade Unions and the Trade Union Federation on Friday afternoon.
A LIGA - MOSZ strike committee is also being set up, which is responsible for coordinating the actions on Monday.
On Saturday, a large protest assembly will be held, and from Monday, all the organizations that have joined the strike will lay down the work for an indefinite period of time, unless agreement is reached with the government.
In other words, the end of the strike started on the day of Parliament's vote on the Health Insurance Act was not defined.
If the National Council does not accept the Health Insurance Act, the unions immediately withdraw the call for strike.
However, if the law is passed, the strike committees will meet to discuss further action.
Due to the agenda of the National Council on Monday, it is even conceivable that it will only be in the later evening hours, or even at midnight to vote on the Health Insurance Act.
The strike that starts on Monday will have to be expected to cause considerable traffic difficulties: the railways are laying down their work for an indefinite period, in the morning the majority of public transport and more than half of the Volán companies are at rest.
At the same time, there will be highwayblocks of one direction in many places.
The call for strike has been followed by numerous trade unions and civil organisations - the list of participants is constantly updated on the League website.
Some organizations announced strikes for an indefinite period of time, others plan a temporary retirement.
Until Thursday afternoon, no agreement was reached between the Hungarian railway company MÁV and the Free Trade Union of Railways VDSZZZ on sufficient performance, although more and more people are on the way by train around Christmas holidays.
According to previous reports, the BKV will be stretched from start-up to 1 p.m., at Budapest Airport between 7 a.m. and 9 p.m., the LIGA unions for electricity and heat energy will lay down the work for four hours, and the teachers' union, for example, the democratic teachers' union, has called for 2 or 2-8 hours of strikes.
The Hungarian Association of Doctors strikes nationwide at different times, the EDDSZ, the Democratic Union of Health and Social Workers, a sub-organization of the SZEF, the Trade Union Cooperation Forum, holds a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four points demanded by the League is that the government withdraws the draft reform of health insurance and submits a new concept for social discourse.
The second claim concerns the gradual introduction of the new pension calculation model, which will be due from next year.
Demand number three is that the eligible professional groups will be able to access the early retirement scheme before 2010.
The fourth point is that the VDSZZ, a member of the League of Trade Unions, has not accepted the offer submitted by the Ministry of Transport and is now calling for a new concept.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard Increases State Risk
According to the Political Capital Risk Analysis Division, the activities of the Hungarian Guard, which was founded this August with the support of the "Movement for a Better Hungary", have raised the risk of Hungary and the region in several respects.
Among other things, the Institute's "Risk Warning Report" states that in connection with the activities of the Hungarian Guard, the highest political risk is the "enhancement of existing ethnic tensions between the Gypsy and non-Gypsy population in Hungary, which could even lead to violent ethnic conflicts in the short term".
The main reason for this is the strategy of the Hungarian Guard, which is probably aimed at provocating such an argument, according to the Research Institute.
As reported, this is seen as a failure on the part of the political leaders: "People of public life have left the discussion of the Roma issue to representatives of radical political groups who have now built up their political strategy on the Roma-Hungary-comparison".
It is believed that this would exacerbate the problem, make reasonable dialogue impossible, favour extremities, and increase the likelihood of violent confrontations.
The research institute also believes that the activities of the Hungarian Guard, not least thanks to the enormous attention of the local and foreign media, "have seriously damaged Hungary's image abroad, especially in terms of confidence in stability and democratic maturity".
We remember: Since the fall of 2006, the reorganisation of radical and extremely right groups in Hungary has been constantly on the rise, so that since the summer of 2007, several "national self-defense association" organizations have been established.
"These groups are common that they define themselves as civil organisations, while openly boasting in preparing their members for defence tasks - sometimes armed - (catastrophe protection, defense, order-keeping), calling for the inadequacy of the police, the army, or the state itself," it said.
And further on: All of this happens in accordance with the method that tries to disguise various political and party-based aspirations of the population as a bourgeois initiative based on the political and party devastation of the population.
The emphasis on the civil character and the form of the association is therefore not merely to avoid legal obstacles that could arise in the course of registration in court - it is also a political strategy.
As the analysis shows, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are also a risk-enhancing factor for relations with neighbouring countries.
"In recent months, the Hungarian Guard has been cited as a potential source of danger in several neighbouring countries, as some ultra-nationalist politicians from certain neighbouring countries see in the emergence of the Hungarian Guard the confirmation of their own anti-Hungarian policies.
All of this has an impact on the political stability of the region" - it said.
From the point of view of the Research Institute, the establishment of the Hungarian Guard is not a single phenomenon in Central Eastern Europe, so the political risk for the entire region has grown.
As reported, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are similar to those of the Bulgarian National Guard, whose establishment was announced in August 2007 by the right-wing extreme Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
In the background of the formation of the Bulgarian Guard stood the Roma mass exodus that took place in a district of Sofia (Krasna Poljana).
The BNU took the incidents immediately to the occasion of the National Guard's establishment, arguing that the aim of the organisation of "national protection".
In her opinion, in the past 17 years a real "Gypsy terror" has been felt in Bulgaria, but the state has remained indifferent and indifferent - according to Political Capital.
And further: the initiative had started a heated debate in the Bulgarian public.
As has been said, the increased risk of ethnic clashes is also demonstrated by the fact that some Bulgarian Roma organisations have announced that they will set up their own guard for resistance purposes.
Since the activities of the Hungarian Guard have so far shown many similarities with those of the Bulgarian National Guard, it is not excluded that the Hungarian Roma also react to the threats with the organisation of their own protection, says the Risk Warning Report of Political Capital.
Attila Juhász, Research Director at Political Capital, said at the request of the news agency: Risk analysis is one of the research institute's activities.
Annually, risk analysis reports would be published and trends of risk change should be visible, public opinion will be informed as in the case of the issuance of the risk warning report.
Holidays are not everywhere holidays
In Hungary, holidays are regulated by law, so that the practice of redeploying the working days around the holidays has now established itself, but the coming year provides us with less such days.
In the EU and in America, too, something else is referred to as "the holiday".
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes between public holidays and working days.
Unemployed days are mostly church holidays, or are related to important historical events.
For example, we are also celebrating New Year: both the last day of the old year and the first day of the new year are days without work - the latter alone, so that the New Year's celebrations can rest.
All year round we have a total of fourteen holidays.
The public holidays are the 15th of March, which commemorates the revolution of 1848, and the 23rd of October, the anniversary of the revolution of 1956.
On August 20th the foundation of the state, on May 1st the work is celebrated, on November 1st and 2nd we commemorate our dead.
In addition, there are two holidays each at Easter, Pentecost, and Christmas.
Since our state, national or religious holidays rarely fall on a weekend, the practice of "working day shift" has proven itself in cases where we would only work one day before or after the holiday.
The price of the extended weekends, however, is that we have to work very well on the Saturdays before, or go to school.
When this day, which falls before or after the holiday, is finally to be worked out, the Minister of Labour has been laying down a separate regulation for many years.
The legislation applies equally to all employers, public servants and civil servants.
Only companies and institutions in which the operation is continued without interruption, i.e. also on the holidays, are excluded.
This year the working order is only mixed up by the holidays at the end of the year: from 24 December, life will remain in this country, as most people take the time off for the days between Christmas and New Year's Eve, or the special holiday for it.
In the next year, more holidays fall into the middle of the week, or the end of the week, so that there will be fewer redeployments in the working days than this year.
The calendar is first placed "on the head" around the day of work, so that people can stay at home for four days.
Saturday, April 26 will be a working day so that Friday, May 2 can be a day of rest.
The second re-disposal is linked to the holiday on October 23rd: on Saturday, October 18th you will have to finish the Friday, October 24th.
The end of the year will, however, be the sign of the holidays after December 24th, even if New Year's Eve falls on a Wednesday.
Six deterrent little things to annoy workmates
E-mails we forget to send out language messages we never receive - harmless lies that no longer notice us: they bring "color" into everyday life at work.
The only question is whether you get used to these little inconveniences, or whether you face the challenge better and try to avoid these misunderstandings consciously for other annoying situations.
Tips.
"Sorry, I forgot to tell you that someone called from the marketing department," says a colleague.
That you missed a meeting?
At best, you regret it and try to make it up again by perhaps calling at the marketing department and confessing remorsefully, you would have forgotten to direct the message (this is the less common method).
Most of the time, it's done with an apology.
Before you get caught up in embarrassing excuses, you should think about how you can really prepare unpleasant moments for your colleagues and try to avoid these situations consciously.
Borrow something you don't own?
There's hardly anything more nervous than grabbing a document, office accessories, or the phone, but it's not there.
Yesterday the stapler was still on the desk - this morning it's gone?
Or is the lost believer discovered on a colleague's desk?
Without question, you should not borrow anything from colleagues, because they are rightly annoyed when they find that something has gone away.
So, don't put envelopes or post-it out of the office in your pocket, because it could hit you yourself: none more, if you need it urgently.
Talking about the private life of colleagues?
There is no effective means to stop a gossip that has already been put into the world.
Who did with whom, what?
Where and why?
The information (or assumptions) about the private life of colleagues should not, if possible, be tied to everyone's nose!
And if someone opens up and reveals his innermost secret to us, we should not abuse that trust!
It is best to keep silent like a grave, rather than to arrange the one that is not present, even if others also know about the problems of the colleague.
Reported ill without reason?
If you call in the office to report ill with painful headaches, because you feel unwell or just want to rest, you should be clear about one thing: your own work, insatiable executions, projects with fixed dates now have to be done by your colleagues instead of yourself.
So don't play along with your colleagues!
If you already know the day before that you won't be able to get it into the office the next day, or that something could come in between, why you have to stay at home, you should report it in time so that neither the colleagues nor the boss are unexpectedly confronted with the absence.
Total, geeks, phone calls
You're just getting deeper in your work, but are you suddenly disturbed by the loud geeks of your colleagues?
Is there a phone call that you shouldn't have heard?
You should not bother your colleagues with summing, singing, loud conversations (which you lead across your heads), gettampling, constant shimmering or nörgeln nerves.
All of this can be very disturbing, even if they are not precisely in a task (write, plan, organize).
Are the others always to blame?
If a project is not completed in due time, you have forgotten to send an important letter or messages, you should not seek the fault of your own forgetfulness with others!
If possible, you should not talk about the chaos in the office or the loud colleagues!
The best thing to do is to admit your mistakes, and if others were affected, apologize!
The question of how to make up for the mistake, or how to make up for the failure, is just too appropriate!
In the office - a feeling like at home?
Training pants and slumbers: Comfortable for home, but has not lost anything in the office!
Not even then should one dress so badly if it would actually allow the workplace!
Just don't get too sloppy - you should respect both your colleagues and yourself so much that you dress accordingly in the office - if desired, also nice and elegant!
To justify it to everyone - or how to become uninteresting to others
Stop and go traffic, the car in the middle of the morning traffic jam.
From the radio a strange melody sounds: the sound of a violin, paired with electronic effects.
I'm turning the volume higher.
The pace changes, to the previous sounds comes the bass, and as a real sound jewel a female choir.
It is the song "Wings of Love" by Zagar, which sounds on mr2.
The domestic music scene hasn't spoiled us for a long time with qualitative electropop.
But now you can even see the jam differently when you hear the new album by Zagar.
The appearance of Yonderboi, so many new and exciting productions from the domestic digital underground scene contribute slowly to a change in the overall picture, and even if the Garagen rock is "in" with its guitar quilt again, the local electropop proves: There is new stuff under the sun.
Baláz's Zságer started in Pécs, even in the band Yonderboi, before he - perhaps because a inn can't handle two pipes - began to take his own path.
The breakthrough with his project (Zagar) and his music, which melts elements from jazz, electronic, and pop, was only achieved when one asked to compose the soundtrack to a movie that had approached him (e.g.
"Szezon" by Ferenc Török).
The formation, which had initially occurred in smaller clubs, became known to the wider audience only when the magazine "wan2" ranked its first album from 2002 among the top 50 domestic albums and Zagar, together with Yonderboi, was the almost only trendsetter, marketable in the West.
Undoubtedly, Zagar and his band were "trendy", but no one was interested in whether they would like to wear this brand.
The band has responded as it should: with a new, even better album.
The new album now released entitled "Cannot Walk Fly Instead" could open up new ways for them, but the title already expresses the desire for continuity with the Pécs years.
The expression comes from the time when Balázs Zságer was still on the move with another band.
The airy, flying allusion would be all right, but besides the essential character of the music, the louder guitar, the influences of the Rock'n'Roll, correspond to the zeitgeist and the trends.
With these songs the singer György Ligeti, who lives in England and works with the band "The Puzzle", introduced himself at the premiere in Millenáris.
A song from the album has even made it to the radio beater - the latest broadcaster from early to late pop music mr.2 Petőfi has gradually set the earworm to the listeners with the song "Wings of Love", which was recorded with the help of six local singers ("Underground Divas").
So everything's okay (?).
The hvg.hu asked Baláz's Zságer.
hvg.hu: This new hit raises the question: To what extent is your music reserved for a certain layer?
Baláz's Zságer: The term "layer music" doesn't mean much to me.
In my opinion, there are two boxes in pop music, not mainstream and underground, or alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
Even the so-called alternative or underground music can be sighing and unspeakable, but they can also be produced only for the sale that makes them commercial music.
A good pop number can also come from an honest motive.
The willingness to accept the listener also works independently of languages and national borders according to this principle.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference in the openness of Hungarian and foreign audiences to your music?
B. Zs.: Abroad, especially west of us, pop music has a bigger tradition.
There are not only teenagers or Twens going to concerts, but also the older audience.
They follow the trends in pop music that are happening around them much more attentively, because they also consider them to be part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role does the audience play in your work?
Is it important who, where, how many hear your music?
B. Zs.: Of course it is a good feeling to see that more and more come to our concerts.
But we never composed for the market.
With us the music is not created to serve a purpose, but for a certain reason.
The role of the audience is usually noticeable at the concerts, where there is already a mutual interaction, but in turn there is only in the immature changes of the moment.
Nevertheless, I have noticed one thing: if you want to make everyone right, you are no longer interesting.
hvg.hu: How far do you want to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He is on his way as a soloist and has built his career in the West.
B. Zs.: We don't really go his way, sometimes quite apart from trying repeatedly to interpret this into our music.
We see ourselves as a team player who trusts in the musical presence of the other and lets them unfold.
At first, of course, comparisons of our work with that of Yonderboi were inevitable, as several of us came from his band and took a different path.
hvg.hu: In the charts of mr2 Petőfi, "Wings of Love" takes the lead.
Many have only heard the name Zagar in connection with this number.
Was the opening deliberately staged with a slightly more popular style towards a wider audience?
B. Zs.: We had no plans to write a hit, which should then be kept as a drag horse for the album.
This song is about more.
It was thought to be the finale of the album with which we wanted to resolve the sound orgy and the slightly more difficult themes.
hvg.hu: How did you select the six singers?
Why her, what was the guiding principle?
B. Zs.: The basic idea was to make a gospel-like choir.
Then came the idea of putting together the choir from talented soloists of the domestic music scene.
This is how the six-member choir - Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikő Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh - was created, which we then baptized the apetic "Underground Divas".
hvg.hu: Did you want to have the song the same, or did the girls design it?
B. Zs.: The song was in the instrumental version for a longer time, but when the material was ready for the album, we thought that this song still needs something.
The chord sequence has formally demanded a vocal voice.
I sang the melody the same night, and later they learned the girls.
It all came practically on the move and terrifyingly spontaneous.
I remember being pretty electrified at the time, but it also needed the "Divas".
With my voice alone, the song would never have become so powerful.
hvg.hu: Both on the record and at the concert, however, you had the impression that the girls were in the background.
There is no solo part (except for Judy Jay's short solo), they don't have their own role, they sing together completely and are not louder than music, so their singing is not just accompanied by music.
They were also on stage.
Is it intentional?
B.Zs.: The fact that they stood behind was the case because of purely technical problems.
However, we did not deliberately want to let them have solo roles.
In the number it is also about forgetting one's ego a little, forgetting who came from where and where to go, we simply allow ourselves to lift these particular wings, the wings of love.
I would like others to feel this euphoric state that we felt when the song came into being.
hvg.hu: What was the most elaborate song?
B. Zs.: In the musical creation actually none at all, there has been more difficult tasks when mixing.
For example, at "Dorian Gray's Dilemma", in which I play on a concert piano, or at "Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls", where the groove no longer wanted to work, but gradually everything came together, as with a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite song from the new album?
B. Zs.: This changes with the concerts continuously and even now, where I have "released" the album.
Currently, it is "Prophet Is A Fool", "Escape From The Earth" and the number "Never The Same".
Fraud brokers risked billions because of feelings of inferiority
Groundless Fraudster
Thus, his former employee Jerome Kerviel refers to the French bank giant Société Générale, owner of the local Komerční banka.
It came for its sake by almost five billion euros.
But it seems rather that Kerviel was just a big player who wanted to do it right away to his colleagues, beyond that was certainly not incapacitated.
Unlike all major banking houses, he recognized the crisis in time on the American mortgage market.
"He is mentally rather weak," was heard from the mouth of his superiors who showed him to the police.
But as the statements of Kerviels, published by the French media, such as the Le Monde daily, show, he was a human being who made profits of EUR 1.6 billion at the end of last year's business.
Crisis Not Only in America
"All I wanted was to make money for my bank," he says in his statement.
In the summer, he managed to earn half a billion euros at the time of the American crisis.
He had already seen the opportunity to do so at the beginning of the year.
In February, there was already the first news that so-called sub-prime mortgages, such as those given to low-income customers or those who had earlier problems with paying off, would be in trouble.
However, this crisis should not affect the whole economy.
Kerviel did not believe this and kept it right.
At the end of the year, he had cut his profits up to EUR 1.6 billion.
"Even when I made the first half billion, I didn't know how to explain it," Kerviel admits and continues that he definitely didn't keep anything for himself.
During the entire interrogation, he admits that he has falsified documents so that he can't be blamed.
He even managed to lead his bosses behind the light, even though the Eurex stock exchange gradually became interested in his business.
Risk-benefit
Was he afraid to fly up?
I don't think so.
"I thought she was satisfied with the simple fact that I made 1.6 billion for the bank."
Where did he take the courage to risk so much?
He had to work out his position gradually.
He entered the Société Générale in 2000, immediately after completing his studies at the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was about $51,000.
After two years he was already an assistant to a real estate agent and in 2005 he became an independent real estate agent with an annual salary of $90,000.
Nevertheless, he knew that he would never earn as much as others.
"At the time of my first conversation in 2005, I knew that I was being watched.
Because of my training and also because of my professional and personal development," Kerviel told the investigators.
But soon after his entry, the first great success came.
With the shares of Allianz he earned a lot by putting half a billion euros on the price losses of this title in the London bombings.
And that was the trigger - now he wanted more.
As long as you win, we'll let you.
"It's like a snowball," he told the police.
But the bosses supposedly knew everything, or else they knew.
"As long as I made money, they closed their eyes."
But then came the big blow at the beginning of this year.
One day he lost a billion euros.
On a weekend in mid-January, he wanted to make it up to him.
When he came to work on Monday, he was no longer employed by the bank.
And a few days later, the bank announced that it had lost five billion euros for it.
And how did they get to him?
He suspected himself of a vacation.
"I only took four days from the previous year.
A real estate agent who doesn't take a vacation is one who doesn't want you to look at him in the cards," Kerviel concluded.
Czech Republic has the chance to come to 365 billion
Czech ministers and representatives of the European Commission signed a total of nine development programmes yesterday, which will enable the Czech Republic to reach EUR 14 billion in the next few years (about EUR 365 billion).
This is about half of the sum that the Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels in the years 2007 to 2013.
About 125 billion crowns come from seven regional development programmes.
Czech companies will be able to receive approximately 100 billion crowns from the "Company and Innovation" programme.
Most of the money, about 150 billion, will flow into transport expansion.
The transport programme is the largest development programme and covers up to 22 percent of the funds that the Czech Republic can receive from the Fund.
This money will increase according to the budget of the State Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will have more than 90.8 billion next year.
The "Company and Innovation" programme is intended to help entrepreneurs and companies to raise funds for innovative businesses.
The companies will thus gain finance for the introduction of new technologies, for business research, as well as for the introduction of more effective organisational methods.
The Czech Republic is one of the least successful among the new accession countries in the EU funds so far.
Nicaraguan court confirms twenty years of imprisonment for ex-presidents
On Thursday, an appeal court in Nicaragua confirmed the twenty-year imprisonment of former President Arnold Alemán, to whom he was sentenced in 2003 for financial fraud of $100 million (almost 1.8 billion crowns).
Later, however, he was released from prison and lived under house arrest on his Hazienda at the Nicaraguan metropolis.
Whether the former head of state (1997 to 2002) of this Central American state comes back behind bars is currently unclear, according to the news agency AP.
According to the chairman of the appeal court, Ileana Pérez, it will now depend on the prison officers whether Alemán is to be held at home or whether he has to go to prison.
A court noted four years ago that Alemán had regularly moved government money to accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
These companies were fictitious and the accounts actually belonged to his relatives and closest followers.
Some of this money ended up in a fund set up by Alemán to finance his election campaign in 2001.
Budget is through
Yeah, it's done.
The state budget is approved.
What is special about this household?
It is the first budget designed by this government and adopted without the support of the opposition by the coalition majority.
The current year was approved with the support of the ČSSD (Social Democrats) because Minister Sobotka (of this party) had presented him, and the ČSSD could not therefore allow itself to reject him.
Unlike the lively debate before the vote on the motion of censure against the government, nothing dramatic happened this time.
The House of Deputies approved this traditionally little-considered, yet highly important law in peace.
That's kind of paradoxical.
All government begins and ends with the individual chapters and items of the household, whether you like it or not.
The budget is an essential part of politics, but it is hidden by the power struggle of the government and the opposition.
This is a more grateful topic for the media, and therefore they pay more attention to him.
A dispute among politicians is much more interesting to the public than sober figures.
The state budgets of the past Social Democratic Governments suffered from three weaknesses, which the budget for 2008 cannot eliminate at once:
The first is the high proportion of expenditure that is compulsory by law, not only in terms of pensions but also in terms of social expenditure that the "silent" coalition of ČSSD and KSČM (Communists) decided last year before the elections.
The second is deficit budgetary policy as a result of the first weakness.
The third limitation is the deficits of public finances, i.e. the budget deficits of the municipalities.
However, the greatest risk is not the government budget deficit.
This budget is public and somewhat under control.
However, a true time bomb is the budget deficit of the municipalities.
Many mayors, in addition to income from taxes, taxes and bank loans, often issued unconsidered bonds that they owed to their town halls in excess of money.
In recent years, they have been able to pay off these debts by mass sale of shares in the energy and other supply networks that they had received in the course of privatisation from the state.
Now this source is already drained.
To the extent that we only adhere to official and verifiable facts, we note that:
Our economy, like the rest of the world, has been going through a period of growth that ČSSD boasts without letup.
This was a unique opportunity for their governments to put public finances in order.
Instead, however, these governments owed the state even more.
Other countries, apart from a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have done much more rationally than our Republic.
This is a huge shame which is mainly due to the former governments.
We are among the countries that, on a global scale, are least at risk of poverty.
This is why there is no need for massive social programmes which, unfortunately, have been inflated to an enormous extent in recent years.
Although it has been possible to delete some of the nonsense populist expenditures that were adopted this year before the elections, it is clear that if it does not come to a postponement of retirement age and pension reform in the near future, then virtually any policy in this country will end, and no matter who is in power, nothing will remain to him as a mere administrator.
It is only slightly exaggerated when it is said that then the government of ruling politicians become officials, who split the majority of the tax revenue mechanically into pensions and social expenditure.
That is why this year's budget cannot be a revolution, but can only halt the displacement of normal expenditure by compulsory expenditure.
The 2008 deficit of 70 billion kronor would certainly be superfluous if previous governments had not spent over the last ten years, which went well.
If we do not want it to really happen that politicians in power become purely administrative officials, then we need to be patient and this not too strong coalition government, which is aware that the state can only spend as much as it can take on taxes and charges, to want peace in the preparation of further reform laws.
Only these allow the gradual implementation of a balanced state budget.

Banks Want to Deal With Crisis
The US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the central banks of Great Britain, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight together against the crisis in the financial markets.
Thus, more than 100 billion dollars will reach the currency markets through auctions.
At these auctions, the banks auction interest rates at which they are willing to borrow money from each other.
For example, the US Fed sends $40 billion to auction, another 24 makes it easy for the European and Swiss central banks.
It is the first time after the attacks of 11 September that the central banks of the individual states have agreed on such a coordinated approach to the defence or mitigation of the consequences of a financial crisis.
"This step is intended to remove the biggest difficulties of the economy, i.e. the growing lack of free capital that the banks can give," wrote Bernard Baumhol of the consulting firm Economic Outlook Group in a report for its customers.
"The coordinated action of central banks has reduced the likelihood of a recession in the US from 65% to about 50%," added Baumhol in his report.
Banks have already lost 60 billion dollars because of unserviced loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts expect further billions of losses.
"The central banks must have been really afraid of what can still happen when they decided to do this," said ABN Amro's chief economist Kieran Davies.
"It looks like the situation is really bad," he continued.
The central banks fear that if banks themselves have difficult access to bonds, loans will also be more expensive for their customers.
This would reduce consumption and plunge the American economy into recession, possibly with implications for economic growth around the world.
The central banks decided to do so after they had failed to lower the so-called LIBOR, the London Interbank rate used for the loan of funds between banks.
This means that the banks were constantly afraid of borrowing each other's money, and this despite the fact that the central banks of the United States, Canada and Great Britain had lowered their interest rates several times during the fall.
"This will have the same effect as a further reduction in interest rates," said Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting of the agency Reuters.
Some analysts believe that this step helps central banks to heat up the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem, namely the case of the real estate market in the US.
Klaus: Debates of the ecologists are unbelievable
Global climate change is said to harm developing countries the most.
President Klaus once again spoke about the problem of global warming.
The criticism now focused on the UN's final international conference on climate change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book "A Blue, Not a Green Planet", he explained that the debates of the ecologists were unbelievable.
According to Klaus, not only is the structure of the conference unacceptable, which represents a strange mixture of government representatives and such non-governmental organizations, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric they accompany and reality.
"The debate there is unstructured, it is a word fireworks that is only a substitute for a real solution to current problems," said Klaus.
The Czech President stressed in the presentation of his book that his subject matter was very important to him and that he therefore committed himself to it.
He also expressed his satisfaction at the fact that his book appeared in German translation, because "I often meet caricatures of my views."
Now, then, interested people could read his attitude undistracted.
Klaus recalled that he was not a climatologist, but he felt that he had sufficient conditions to write such a book.
Finally, he was an academic, able to understand and assess professional treatises, has experience in statistics and is also an economist.
As the main statement of the book, he referred to the theory that the climate is constantly changing and that its changes are therefore normal, that there is no consistent opinion among the scientists that the consequences of the current changes are not too great and serious and therefore are not a threat, and that the efforts to influence the development of the climate are superfluous, ineffective and unacceptable.
In addition, he considered it unacceptable to someone who had experience with totalitarian systems to impose unproven views on others, he considered this to be a dangerous restriction of freedom.
On questions from those present, he repeatedly stated that he was not against "a reasonable environmental protection, but against militant eco-activists who do not take into account the relationship between effort and income."
Klaus had already spoken about the same topic in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600000 people failed to change their driver’s license
600,000 drivers missed the deadline to exchange their old driving licence, which expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day that you can apply for the exchange so that the authorities can manage to issue a new driving licence by the end of the year.
The Ministry, however, is not afraid that after New Year’s rides hundreds of thousands of drivers without valid driving rights.
According to the authorities, mainly those who do not want to drive have changed their driving licence.
While small places report a sharp decline in interest in the exchange of vouchers, the offices of the capital are being flooded with requests, and the interest in the exchange grew this week.
The city administration manufactures around 2000 customers every day.
You have to stand for about half an hour.
In Prague, about 140000 drivers have not yet changed their driver's license.
The exhibition of a new driver's license lasts 20 days.
But it is possible to request the exhibition with a reduced period of five days.
In this case, however, the driver must add 500 crowns.
Motorists who do not create the required exchange until the end of the year and leave without a valid driver's licence are at risk of a fine starting in January.
The perpetrator pays a maximum of 2000 crowns.
However, the police can also turn it around with a reminder when it is violated.
In the event of an infringement, the penalty may increase to 2500 crowns.
According to previous information, the church can also impose a punishment that does not go at all.
He could, it was said, face a penalty of even 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry has already called upon the offices to exercise mildness and to impose a maximum penalty of 1000 crowns.
According to the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka, no one threatens a thousand crown penalty.
The driving licence is a document in which everyone can decide whether to own it or not.
It is not a personal identity card that everyone, a valid one, has to have.
People who don't want to drive any more should give their driver's license.
It is sufficient to take him to the competent municipal authority or send him there by registered mail.
At the end of the year, licences issued between 1964 and 1993 will be invalid.
However, drivers must gradually also exchange other types of driving licences.
People with driving licences from 1994 to 2000 still have three years for the exchange.
The validity of driving licences issued between 2001 and 2004 ended in December 2013.
According to Hanselka, it is about 2.6 million other driving licences.
Court lowers penalties for detectives who were allied with Berdych
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík, who are accused of having made a case with the band of David Berdych, received 13 or 10 years imprisonment.
This was decided in a final judgment by the Supreme Court of Prague, which reduced its sentence by one or two years.
Originally, the detectives of the "Office for the Fight Against Organized Crime" threatened 14 or 12 years respectively.
There is no appeal against today's judgment, only revision at the Supreme Court is possible.
Berdych himself is also accused of this matter, but he is at first faced with the first instance judgment.
However, in other trials he had already received penalties of a total of 16 years.
It cannot be condemned for any more.
A district court accused 19 people in January of being involved in robbery, and the Supreme Court today negotiated the appeal of 16 of them.
Most of the accused disputed the charge from the beginning on the grounds that it was a constructed case.
According to the Central Bohemian District Court, policemen handed information from police sources, covered various robberies, and helped gang members to evade the prosecution, among other things.
The band left Opava and Koňařík 30 percent of the spoils.
The charges concern crimes committed by gangs from 1999 to 2001.
In particular, robberies whose victims have often suffered serious injuries, but also because of official convictions and illicit possession of weapons.
In the case of house searches, the police discovered illegal pistols, ammunition with steel cores, a laser target tube and a machine gun.
According to the charge, the gang has enriched itself by many millions of crowns because of their robbery.
Except for nearly 20 men in this trial, Berdych and a number of others recognized as legally guilty because of further robbery.
Other men from Berdych's circle have to be held responsible in another trial, other cases have not yet been brought before the court.
The main proceedings have so far been conducted by Tomáš Půta and Maroš Šulej, who are in Irish prison and are awaiting the final decision on their extradition for prosecution in the Czech Republic.
Children exchanged - Bill: 12 million
For the exchange of children in a maternity clinic, the lawyer of the injured parents, Igor Veleba, wants to demand 12 million crowns of compensation plus court fees from the hospital in Třebíč.
For each of the mothers three million each, for the fathers two million each and for the children one million each.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent couple.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ondřej Dostál, therefore entirely disagrees with the proposal of Velebas.
"We reject such a proposal, it is too high," said Dostál after today's debate.
"But in order to make an opinion on this counter-proposal, we need the opinion that had the opposite side created.
We'll find out if it has any significance.
But we insist that this should be in the hundreds of thousands of areas together," said Dostál.
According to him, the amount was to move between 100,000 and 200,000 crowns for each of the four parents.
In the beginning, the family from Jabloňov wanted a million crowns for every month that she had not raised her biological daughter.
For Veleba, the basis for compensation negotiations was an opinion that the University Hospital in Prague Motol had prepared for him.
The parents of the children, according to experts in psychology and psychiatry, suffered psychological damage and stress symptoms in different strengths and depths.
The men misplaced the stress situation better, even if they saw accusations against themselves that they could have prevented the confusion of the newborns.
The women, in turn, do worse with the aftermath of the trauma experienced, as well as with what is now happening, Veleba summarized the content.
Veronika and Nikola exchanged nurses at the maternity clinic in Třebíč on 9 December last year.
Last week the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to the Čermáks in Přibyslavice, and Veronika to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanová to Jabloňov.
At the end of October, the district chief of Vysočina (Böhmisch-Mährische Höhe) handed over 100000 crowns to each family as a substitute for expenses incurred by the failure of the hospital in Třebíč, which is subject to the district.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are legally insured for liability.
In case of doubt, they must resort to a reserve fund, only exceptionally can they apply for assistance from the institution.
The courts have so far allocated comparatively low damages to those affected, the amounts were determined by tables and moved in the range of hundreds of thousands, with the exception of millions.
Polivka came to his kingdom Walachei
Bolek Polívka lost the dispute over the brand "Kingdom Walachei".
According to the judge at the District Court in Ostrava, he was the first to use the name "Walachian King", but the project had built a team around Tomáš Harabiš in collaboration with the actor for many years.
Polívka did not take part in the negotiation today.
According to his lawyer, however, the matter is probably not over and his client will probably make an appeal.
"The issue is that Mr. Harabiš and his team want to participate in the popularity of Bolek Polívka's parasite," said Polívka's lawyer after the trial.
Everyone introduced themselves to this actor and comedian in the words "Walachian Kingdom".
The same opinion is also Harabiš.
"We have almost ten years of work behind us.
Money raising and concepts of activities," he said.
According to him, the cause is a dispute over money.
"After years, they noticed that the project was successful and that they could have some of it.
They want to win parasitic at our work," he continued.
Lucrative business
According to the court, Polívka used the name "Walachian King" for the first time in one of his television shows.
In 1993, he was crowned by actor Radoslav Brzobohatý.
However, this did not coincide with the intention of establishing a fictional kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš came up with the idea of issuing Welsh passports.
From an originally fun action a business and an entrepreneurial activity crystallized out, to which Harabiš then joined the founding of the company "Walachian Kingdom".
In 1997, Polívka agreed to use his name and signature in the passports and even offered her owners discounts when visiting his farm and his theatre performances.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge also said today that Harabiš used only the mere idea that Polívka had made public in the show "Manege" for his entrepreneurial intentions.
"Polívka's popularity has certainly helped the project of the Welsh kingdom," said the judge.
She added, however, that the soul of the project was Harabiš and his team who had devoted themselves to him.
The cooperation of the parties that are now divided lasted until 2000, when Harabiš organized the official coronation for Polívka in Vsetín.
Since then, however, the disputes between Polívka and Harabiš have begun to accumulate, culminating in the retirement of King Boleslav I until Saint-Nimmerleins Day.
The leadership role then took on Harabišs Jarmila Šuláková as a queen's mother.
In 2002, Polívka filed an action against Harabiš and his company which the court rejected today.
Clarity in the dispute could bring the battle prepared by Harabiš for the throne and half a princess.
A new king should come out of this.
Details and an appointment he didn't want to give up yet.
"We don't want to rush.
It was supposed to be something like the king's move in Walachey.
The king was to be elected for a certain time.
Mr. Polívka can also calmly register," added Harabiš.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: Disappearing front parts
To tell the truth, I was never a special fan of the Peugeot 206.
Its driving characteristics were not worth much, the quality of the gearing, steering and also the processing could be described as rather below average.
But now his successor, the Peugeot 207, is on the market, and he is much better.
The combination with the name SW is still a bit further, and I just have to revise my opinion.
When I tested the classic Hatchback of the 207, I had to complain about the lack of headroom on the back seats.
These complaints no longer exist, because the body of the combination is designed so that even two-meter men will not suffer.
Move to the next level.
I just go through the interior so I don't have to repeat myself too much.
It is a rather successful design, where I only have objections because of the carefree middle tunnel.
There I would welcome a little more design design, where otherwise the car makes such an elegant impression.
The seats are comfortable, and past are the times when we may complain about too short seats or head restraints.
The side position has also improved significantly compared to the 206.
With regard to the space supply, you can also feel the enlarged dimensions of the bodywork.
In the combination, the already mentioned lack of headroom has also been eliminated.
Suitcases in the trunk
But the main thing about this car is the cargo hold.
I have to call it (even because of the foldable rear window) very loadable and space-saving.
The cavities are equipped with straps that represent an ideal compromise.
They do not disturb, are torn apart and also hold heavier objects.
But let's talk about the charge volume.
According to the table in the basic equipment, it is 428 litres, which is a rather average value compared to the competition.
However, not compared to the Czech best-selling vehicle of this class, Škoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the product from Mladá Boleslav, we find that the Peugeot remains by clearly noticeable 52 liters.
This value is already critical for a trip abroad or when a stroller is invited.
But to highlight the positives, I still have to mention the very flat loading space or the very low loading edge after folding the rear seats.
120 hp in four rows
Our test car was equipped with a four-cylinder gasoline engine with a cylinder capacity of 1.6 litres and an output of 88 kWp.
And to be honest, this is what a 1600-cubic engine should look like, driving a family-hatchback.
He's quiet, has a low consumption and moves away well.
If I compare him to his counterpart at Škoda, who sometimes seems to be stuffed with a rag, then I can only be thrilled by him.
The price list speaks volumes
The price of this car is not exactly popular.
But we have to remember that we have tested a well-equipped car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with the 1400 petrol engine in the amount of 329900 crowns still goes on.
With our engine it costs from 410900 crowns, which is already quite a lot.
The equipment Premium of the test car beats once again with 80,000 crowns in addition to beech.
However, we had head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic windscreen wiper trigger, electric window lifters in the back and...
Thus, the car costs a total of simple 531900 crowns.
This is a lot, but once you calculate the additional equipment of a Fabia and you will arrive at a very similar amount.
So only the decision remains which brand you want to choose.
Integration of Slovak students into British schools is not successful
In British schools, the number of children from Eastern Europe is increasing, leading to the further development of the local school system in the case of local fears.
The integration of the Eastern Europeans has so far encountered a number of obstacles.
British schools even detect cases where disputes between immigrants and the children of the original inhabitants increase in violence.
The problem of the integration of children from Eastern Europe into British schools illustrates the case of North Kent, where disputes between the local and Slovak immigrants gradually increase.
Disputes, harassment and robbery among students have shifted to the relationships between parents.
The situation has already developed to the point that the police in Chatham arrested a Slovak woman who had beaten a ten-year-old boy with an iron rod.
The accused defended himself because the boy had insulted them with racist insults.
The police also had to intervene after an attack by two minor girls on a Slovak immigrant.
The girls had allegedly made racist remarks to the man and threw stones at him.
"When we went home, a boy climbed onto a bus house and spit on us.
When I told him to stop, he threw us apples and pears and then blew his ass off," a mother of Slovak students in The Times described another unpleasant incident.
Complaints come from both sides.
One of the locals even referred to the conflict with the immigrants from Eastern Europe as a survival struggle.
The cases cited show that the mood between locals and immigrants in British schools is becoming ever more tense.
In the UK, 70000 Slovaks have been reported coming here for work.
Thus, about 30,000 Slovak students attend British schools.
Cuba - the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors it is really an island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your holiday, it will come true if you only select the right one.
Golden and white beaches, high waves or a sea that is quiet like a pond.
Palms and All Inclusive with waiters offering pizza, ice cream and captivating cocktails on the beach.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean you will find this in abundance.
But only on one island you will find much more, and this island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the Great Antilles.
At the time of the Spaniards, Cuba was their bastion for the conquest of America.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place a human eye has ever seen.
Havana once became a warehouse or transit warehouse of treasures that the Spaniards had robbed in America and then transported to Europe.
And then came the American era.
The Hotel Nacional was created at the very end of the 20th century.
Building it left it one of the bosses of the American Mafia, Lucky Luciano, because everything that was considered a crime in the United States (especially during the trial) was liked to be seen and supported in Cuba - drugs, gambling, prostitution.
His guests included:
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana high houses grew, across the wide boulevards drove cars that were among the cult symbols of the fifties of the past century.
Ernest Hemingway bought himself a property in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Cojímar he had his yacht lying.
On the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio, stars of the show business and politicians from all over America left their signatures.
And today?
You can also leave your autograph on the walls of the Bodeguita of Havana.
At the bar at the Hotel Nacional you mix cocktails as desired.
And the cult cars of the fifties drive around in Havana to this day, because the once imported jigulis and fiats have long since fallen apart in the salty and damp air.
May Havana, especially its oldest part, have come down strongly, nowhere in the vicinity you will find as many wonderful colonial sights as right here.
Other places are being cleaned out, for example Trinidad.
In view of the urgent need for money from tourism, there was a green light for this development.
In the last fifteen years, new hotels have been created not only in Havana, but also in Varadero, on the coast of the province of Holguín and also on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a Marotte that is unique in the world and attracts railway lovers in particular.
The sugar cane from remote plantations brought steam and diesel-powered narrow rails to the sugar factories.
Their fleet has not been renewed for decades, and so you can see there neat and fully functioning locomotives, whose peers are located elsewhere in the museum for a long time.
Exploration objectives
The most important places do not leave out the majority of Cuba's visitors.
So you don't have to write about Varadero or Havana in detail anymore.
Just mention that in the already mentioned estate Hemingways there is a museum, whose visit should not be missed by the one who likes this writer.
The Viñales Valley in the west of the island is one of the most picturesque corners of Cuba.
The lush vegetation grows on limestone soil.
The mogotas, calcareous hills and rocks, rise steeply from the valley floor, and in their cavities, fertile soil accumulated, covering even weathered rocky areas with dense vegetation.
This valley is where perhaps the best Cuban tobacco is grown.
In its final form you can meet him when you visit one of the cigar factories of Havana.
It may also seem interesting to some that the Chilean episode of the television series "Major Zeman" was filmed there.
Trinidad
An ancient city that was founded shortly after the Spanish colonized the island.
Glory and wealth brought her to the trade of slaves and sugar.
The wealth was embodied in the beautiful beauty of the small city.
The Spanish colonial architecture, strongly influenced by the later French settlers, has hardly changed for four hundred years.
Trinidad, located between the sea and the Escambray Mountains, is such a remote place that in the 1950s there was no road that would have connected the area to the rest of the country.
This isolation contributed to the fact that it was ignored.
Nothing was built there, but therefore nothing was torn down, everyone was glad that he had a roof over his head.
If you have more than one afternoon time for Trinidad, then it is worth looking at interesting places in the area, such as the beach Playa Ancón or the "Tal of sugar factories".
In the evening you should go to the Casa de la Música, which lives after the darkness, and where the music does not keep silent until the morning.
Baracoa
This small town in the east of Cuba is some of the most beautiful of the island.
Surely this view is also influenced by the way to it.
Both streets that lead from Guantánamo must overcome high and crooked mountains and pass through a landscape that is hardly touched by human intervention.
This eastern precursor of Cuba included UNESCO in its world heritage directory thanks to its untouched nature.
There the best chocolate is made, in the church one shows the cross of Columbus (in reality it was created about a hundred years after the rides of Columbus), and from the hill, where the former castle, the current Hotel El Castillo, stands, there are several Table Mountains, of which El Yunque is the most famous.
About the coffee, the rum, the cigars, the Sierra Maestra mountains, the Bay of Pigs and the island of Isla de Pinos, about the Tropicana cabaret, the sanctuary of Cuban patron Caridad del Cobre, about the Santeria, an African religion to which the descendants of slaves confess, about all this one could write many pages.
But, as you say, look better with your own eyes.
Allies in Afghanistan are passive, claim Americans.
According to the United States, too few soldiers and the lack of necessary equipment influence the course of the mission in Afghanistan.
NATO should, in the words of Defence Minister Robert Gates, draw up a concrete plan for the next few years.
The mission in Afghanistan did not go according to their ideas; in Edinburgh, Scotland, representatives of the countries that have stationed units in the south of the country agreed on this.
In addition to the growing resistance of the Taliban, the eight participating states are also discussing further coordination plans among the allies.
While the United States, by its Minister of Defense Robert Gates, called for more activity on NATO units, Britain sees the priority in strengthening the authority of the Afghan government and in intensifying development aid.
"In Afghanistan, forward development is noticeable, but military power can only be part of the solution.
Another part is to enable the inhabitants to start developing their own economy and security," says British Minister of Defence Des Browne of the BBC.
Ninety percent
According to the U.S. Army, the activity of the Afghan insurgents has reached its highest level for five years.
The number of violent actions increased by 27 percent compared to the previous year, in the southern province of Helmand even by sixty percent.
The NATO countries have stationed some 40,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, about a quarter of them in the southern territory.
According to the United States, however, allies have reached an absolute limit in terms of the organization and equipment of units.
In concrete terms, they call for further helicopters, soldiers and experts to train the Afghan units.
"We will have to think seriously about the concrete goals for the next time and how we can achieve them," said Gates.
Similarly today, the Secretary General of NATO, Jaap de Hoop, said.
"I am not pleased about what we have available in Afghanistan to land and in the air.
We have about ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment we need, and that is too little," said De Hoop of the agency Reuters to conclude three-day talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive?
Among the countries involved, there has also been a dispute over whether all all the allies in Afghanistan are doing their best in recent months.
Germany, for example, was criticized for its passivity.
"The Germans are relatively numerous in Afghanistan.
But they are stationed in areas where there is only a minimum of violence and the fighting requirements for them are not as high as for us in the southern and eastern part of the country," said Gates.
This week, the British boulevard newspaper "Sun" called the German soldiers lazy.
"Afghanian non-students deflected: The Germans are playing games while our boys are fighting," wrote the "Sun" in a contribution supplemented by photos of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German imagery went over to counterattack and printed a picture of a British unit at a rugby competition in the southern part of Afghanistan.
Government debt will accelerate to one trillion in 2009
Every Czech person owes 84000 crowns of government debt.
Total debt rose to SEK 842.7 billion by the end of September.
The government had planned to owe it to 159.2 billion wives this year.
At the beginning of December, however, thanks to the better development of government budgetary policy, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion.
The government debt of the Czech Republic rose to 842.7 billion crowns by the end of September.
Thus, within the first nine months of this year, they increased by 40.2 billion.
Since June, however, they have dropped by 13.4 billion.
The Ministry of Finance thus confirmed its information on the government debt from the beginning of October.
Every Czech person owes 84,000 crowns.
Over the entire past year, the state owed more than 111 billion crowns.
"So far, it seems that thanks to the lower deficit for the coming year, we may not be able to exceed the limit of a trillion crowns until 2009.
Next year the debt should move between 900 billion and a trillion crowns," said David Marek, analyst of Patria Finance, the server iHNed.cz.
Similarly, Vladimír Pikora, analyst of the Next Finance, says: "To exceed a trillion we could come in the course of 2009.
When exactly, depends on the next household we don't know yet.
If the situation on the political stage is to change, and politicians should be prepared to save more, this could last until 2010.
But I do not expect such a change," he remarked.
Debt growth
Government debt stems from government debt and comes mainly from the accumulation of government budget deficits.
The government debt is financed by fiscal instructions, government bonds, direct bonds or, for example, bonds issued by the European Investment Bank.
Domestic government debt increased this year to SEK 719.4 billion.
The state's foreign debt has now risen by 1.7 billion crowns to 123.3 billion.
The so-called marketable government debt reached 803.3 billion crowns at the end of September and decreased by 13.7 billion since June.
The average maturity of government debt rose to 6.5 years.
"Total debt increased by 13 percent over the year from the first to the third quarter, which is really a lot considering how well the economy is doing.
It is interesting that the growth is particularly evident in debt securities, where the increase is 20 percent.
It is bad that debt increases, but on the other hand this shows that something can be done before the pension reform comes," Pikora commented on the data.
Better Than Expected
The financing strategy and the handling of sovereign debt for 2007 show that the government had planned to raise SEK 159.2 billion for this year.
At the beginning of December, however, thanks to the better development of government budgetary policy, the Ministry reduced the plan to SEK 152.8 billion.
This amount comes mainly from the government budget deficit, which will obviously reach 76 billion crowns this year instead of the estimated 91.3 billion.
Furthermore, these are the maximum committed appropriations for the consolidation agency of 13.3 billion kronor, a ten billion reserve for the payment of pensions, the financing of sovereign bonds for 43 billion and the instalments for the bonds of the European Investment Bank of 1.8 billion.
For giving a name to a Teddy bear, she was presented today to a court in Khartoum.
On Thursday evening the British teacher, who had been accused of insulting Islam in Sudan, was sentenced by a court in Khartoum to 15 days' imprisonment and subsequent expulsion.
The British were accused of allowing six to seven-year-old students to give a Teddy bear the name Mahomet, although any representation of the Islamic prophet is forbidden.
She would have deserved to be whipped.
After parents of students complained several times to the Sudanese Ministry of Culture, the 54-year-old primary school teacher who worked at the Unity High School of Khartoum was picked up at home on Sunday and accused of insulting Islam under Article 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Code.
In fact, this matter begins in September when the teacher asks her six-to-seven-year-old students to choose a name for the class teddy.
The children suggest eight names, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed, reports headmaster Robert Boules.
Finally, when the class votes, 20 out of 23 children choose Mohammed as their favorite first name.
Certainly, Mohammed is the name of the Islamic prophet, but above all also a very common first name in Sudan.
Afterwards the children have created a book for the class, with the picture of the bear on it and the caption My name is Mohammed .
The bear itself did not carry a sign with this name, but the problem is quite simple that the representation of the Islamic prophet is considered an insult to Islam.
One of the Muslim colleagues of Gillian Gibbons, who teaches at the same school in Sudan, said that he knows them well, and she would never have done anything to draw them too close to a religious faith, I just regret that she asked the children to vote for a name, in his opinion this is just an innocent mistake.
An opinion shared by numerous teachers who describe it as very attentive to their students and as a person who never talks about religion in the class.
Remember, the first name Mohammed is also the second most commonly given second name in the UK, for which there are 14 different spellings in English.
This first name, often chosen by Muslim families, is considered to be a kind of tribute to the Prophet (he is often given to the firstborn of a family).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this first name?
Can you give him a toy, for example?
This is, of course, a question of interpretation.
On Wednesday, at the last negotiating session in Vienna, no agreement was reached on the future status of the province.
At the end of the failure
On Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria, the Serbs and Albanians from Kosovo concluded a sixth and final discussion session without overcoming their controversy about the future status of the separatist province.
It is regrettable that the parties could not reach an agreement on the status , said European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger at a press conference in Vienna .
With emphasis on the threat of peace in the region, his American counterpart, Frank Wilsner Belgrade and Pristina, urged them to fulfil their obligations to maintain peace, and to continue their talks beyond the end of the negotiations.
No violence is expected in the immediate future, but we are at the beginning of a very difficult time, he added and indicated that there are quite clear tensions.
End of the conciliation procedure on 10 December
The Troika mediators, which unite the European Union, the United States and Russia, will meet on Monday for the last time in Serbia and Kosovo.
The future of the 90% Albanian-speaking province could become clearer if Ischinger, Wilsner and the Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko submitted their report to the UN Security Council by 10 December.
The talks of Baden, near Vienna, formed the sixth and last negotiating session since the Troika last August from the UN had been commissioned for a new mediation.
Americans and Europeans expect their commission to end on 10 December.
The Russians, who had already blocked Kosovo's independence from the Security Council, are continuing the negotiations beyond this deadline.
Russia was and remains advocate of a negotiated solution, a mutually agreed solution, said Botsane-Khartchenko.
One-sided declaration of independence?
After Kosovo has been under the administration of the UN for eight years, the Western countries consider independence supervised by the EU to be the only solution for the future.
Pristina is willing to announce this unilaterally if the Security Council is not to decide in their favour.
Belgrade is based on stronger autonomy
Unfortunately, no agreement could be reached, the president of the autonomous authority of Kosovo, Fatmir Sejdiu, announced at the hotel in Baden, where these negotiations have been taking place since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former leader of the Kosovar rebellion and future prime minister of the province, shared his regrets.
However , he added that the plan proposed by Belgrade belongs to the autonomy of a past that led to murders and deportations .
Domino Effect
Serbian President Boris Tradic, for his part, felt that a compromise was always to be sought, and warned the Albanian majority from Kosovo about the consequences of a unilateral declaration of independence of the province.
Belgrade believes that it is particularly a "domino effect" in a region that is so weakened by the wars of independence of the 1990s.
For Serbia this does not mean that a compromise would be impossible, he said.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that any decision be taken solely by the Security Council, where its Russian ally has a veto right.
The Kosovo Parliament will have the last word
Only a decision from the Security Council is acceptable to Serbia, said Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
These negotiations took two years.
They must end as they have begun: in the Security Council.
The journalists replied to Fatmir Sejdiu that the Kosovo Parliament would have the last word on the status, adding that any unilateral declaration of independence on the part of the Albanian-speaking population would proceed in agreement with the Western countries.
Bush unleashes an agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
At the opening of the international peace conference, which met on Tuesday under his direction in Annapolis, Maryland, President Bush announced that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint declaration.
He also stated that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to start negotiations immediately in order to find a final settlement of the 60-year-old disputes between their two peoples.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised that he would do everything in his power to help them conclude a peace treaty before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, the Palestinians have to destroy the terrorist infrastructures and Israel has to stop its colonisation work, said Bush, reminding the two parties of their commitments to the Roadmap for Peace that they had agreed to in 2003.
The head of the White House stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority under Abbas ultimately sought a peace treaty that would clarify all open issues without exception, including the central issues.
This term includes the three serious problems that are mainly the result of the conflicts between the Israelis and the Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of the Arab refugees, who were expelled from their homelands in the course of the 1948 conflict in the present state of Israel.
After the President of the United States, Abbas took the floor and insisted that the forthcoming negotiations be conducted in a comprehensive and thorough manner and provide for all points, including Jerusalem, the refugees, the borders, the colonies, water and security.
When Olmert took the floor, he undertook that the forthcoming ceasefire negotiations would be conducted directly and without interruption and that he would endeavour to end them before the end of 2008.
Bush has set the deadline for the implementation of his vision of two states, a Palestinian and an Israeli who are side by side, by the end of 2008.
Saudi Arabia has made it clear that it has received a guarantee in this sense from Bush before it decided to take part in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a great success for Washington, has led a plan taken over by all Arab countries, which offers peace to Israel, in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis is a skirmish in the history of the Middle East, especially because it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central points of view, the Saudi-Arab prince in his interview with the Saudi-funded daily Arabic-language newspaper.
According to the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As always with this kind of local news, official versions and rumors are facing each other.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first results of the investigation of the National Disciplinary Authority of the Police (IGPN), on Sunday, shortly after 5 p.m., a police car drove on Rue Louise-Michel towards Villiers-le-Bel.
He had no effort, but was on the road, and drove at 40-50 km/h, without blue light, explained a spokesperson of the police.
A green motorcycle of the Kawasaki brand, without approval, not released for public road traffic (see below), came, controlled by two youths without helmet, at very high speed.
It hit the left side of the police car after it had ignored its progress from the right, a policeman continued.
The alcohol control carried out on vehicle passengers is very negative.
The condition of the car (encrusted wing, split windshield, torn shock rod) testifies to the severity of the impact.
Very quickly, as early as yesterday morning, the prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérèse de Givry, announced that she had entrusted the IGPN with an investigation into the "facts of the involuntary killing of persons and the lack of assistance to persons in danger", in agreement with the main management of public security of Val-d`Oise.
In the afternoon, on the occasion of a press conference, the prosecutor stated that it excluded the IGPN from identifying the police at this stage.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses of the accident that were heard on Sunday evening confirmed the version of the policemen, namely that this small-power bike has arrived relatively quickly on their left side.
Yesterday showed some sort of grooves, certainly caused by the friction of the footrests on the ground, that the two vehicles had remained intertwined until the police managed to slow down.
The vehicles have been confiscated and will be the subject of a technical assessment.
The body names of the two victims were obsessed yesterday.
What happened after that?
Yesterday, in Villiers-le-Bel, a rumor quickly made the round that the police had left the accident site very quickly, and that without helping the two young people.
Although the IGPN remains very cautious, it would rule out this matter with regard to any serious errors.
According to a police source , this is a difficult aspect of the investigations for which further investigations are necessary and for which one has to act very carefully .
Libération met an eyewitness of these few moments shortly after the accident.
From one of his windows he had a direct view of the scene.
We immediately went out with my cousin, who is a nurse in the hospital, to try to revive her, this witness tells us.
There was nothing to do.
Then he saw a totally disturbed police officer limping.
Two more tried to rejuvenate one of the youths who telephoned the fourth.
In view of the tension that arose rapidly around the events and, as it seems, due to the certainty that the people present had about the unexpected situation of the young people, the police were taken into the car by colleagues who had arrived at the place of the accident.
Still according to this testimony, the rescue forces arrived about twenty minutes after the police left.
They have also applied cardiac massages, but in vain.
I will not allow it to be claimed that the police would not have helped the young people.
First aid has been given to these young people.
The fire department has arrived immediately.
Everything was done to try to save them, for their part the attorney stressed.
In Pakistan, the tension increases
On Monday, the Pakistani police defeated the first demonstrations since General Musharraf proclaimed the emergency two days earlier.
According to testimonies, in the city of Lahore in the east of the country, about 2,000 lawyers protesting against the measures taken in the context of the emergency were injured by the tear gas grenades deployed by the police there.
Then they threw stones at the police.
At least 350 lawyers were temporarily arrested.
Similar scenarios existed in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where policemen attacked and injured lawyers.
Several had been temporarily arrested.
In Islamabad the lawyers of the Supreme Court attorneys have called for a general strike and announced demonstrations as a result of a wave of about 500 arrests of opposition officials, human rights defenders and lawyers during the weekend.
On Monday morning the streets leading to the Supreme Court had been blocked to prevent the assembly.
Other demonstrations had been found in Multan (Mitte) and Peshawar (North East).
On Monday, the lawyer movement received the support of the religious parties united in the powerful alliance Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal, whose president called on the population to send flowers to the judges who had protested against the emergency and to the waste that had taken an oath before Musharraf.
Musharraf's promise is no longer valid
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly affected by the special measure announced on Saturday evening.
In the following days he had to take a position on the legality of President Musharraf's re-election in a direct ballot on 6 October.
The President of the Court of Justice, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was removed from office and replaced.
All that we represent is illegal, anti-constitutional and contrary to the decisions of the Supreme Court, the magistrate of the newspaper The News stated.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to give the command of the army and to become a civilian president no longer applies since the call for emergency, said on Monday the Deputy Minister for Information Tariq Azeem.
It was expected that he would surrender his military uniform by 15 November, the date on which his first term as President ends.
The Deputy Minister for Information has also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
In addition, the Pakistani government denied the persistent rumors that President Musharraf had been assigned a place of residence by his deputy army leader.
More than one third of pregnancy is still not planned
This calculation takes into account the unwanted pregnancies (24%), as well as the poorly planned or unforeseen births.
Even today, 40 years after the adoption of the New Wirth Act, which allowed contraception in France, one in three pregnancies (36%) is not planned, as a study by the National Institute of Demographic Studies (Ined) shows.
This calculation takes into account the unwanted pregnancies (24%), as well as the poorly planned or unforeseen births.
The Ined estimates that the different methods of contraception such as the pill or the spiral still have a failure rate of 5-6%.
According to the Institute, which notes that the percentage of pill users between 20 and 40 years of age who use the pill has increased from 5% in 1970 to 60% today, the liberalisation of contraception has nevertheless enabled better control of fertility.
At any rate, eight out of ten births are carefully planned today.
With one of five couples even calculated exactly on the month, and, if possible, in spring, the season in which it seems most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular repair at the space station
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and his comrades from the crew of the International Space Station (ISS) will have taken more than seven hours in space to perform the spectacular repair of a defective solar collector, which is indispensable for the continuation of scientific work at the station.
A daring exit which, due to its duration, the removal of habitable modules, the speed with which it was organized, and the tools built by the astronauts to perform the repair, has achieved several records.
The problem occurred on Wednesday when the astronauts had downloaded the Harmony module from the Space Ferry Discovery, a large cylindrical part which is soon to be taken up by the European and Japanese scientific laboratories.
This module is a kind of landing bridge for the module laboratories.
But you have to be able to power them.
The second task of the crew was therefore to implement a 17,5 tonnes heavy module for power generation via solar collectors already on the ISS to bring it to its final position.
After moving it, the crew engaged in the restructuring of the solar collectors of the module, whose span is 76 meters.
And it happened that one of the collectors, who can be folded like accordions, was damaged by a clamped cable about a meter in length
The restructuring was stopped in order not to damage the collector any more.
The astronauts, who originally left the space shuttle Discovery for a control walk and then had to repair another solar collector whose rotational system was faulty, were forced to dedicate themselves to the damaged collector.
And Scott Parazynski was chosen to walk around at the end of the 30-metre-long remote-controlled arm of the space shuttle that had been installed at the station to carry out the repair.
He is one of NASA's best spacewalkers.
Large, resilient, very capable, he has a well-developed upper body and long arms.
The 46-year-old doctor was thus chosen to operate the injured solar collector.
After carefully examining the damage, he cut through the faulty cable and attached some kind of rail to the damaged spot.
He was supported by a second Spacewalker who stayed near the lock, and, inside, by the other astronauts, among them Peggy Whitson, commander of the crew.
The tool he used, a mini hockey bat, wrapped with insulator to prevent an electric impact on the solar collectors, which generate several hundred volts, the astronauts had devised and built on board the station.
When the action was over, Scott Parazynski waited until the collector was fully unfolded before counting his tools and returning to the station.
Yesterday afternoon the astronauts enjoyed half a day of relaxation before today seven astronauts returned to space shuttle Discovery to set off on Wednesday's return flight to Earth.
The title EADS sanctioned on the stock exchange
After the Group has announced that it will have to spend between EUR 1.2 billion and EUR 1.4 billion to counter the A400M's residuals, the stock EADS is currently showing a significant decline on the Paris Stock Exchange.
Currently, EADS loses 4% to EUR 21.96 on the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group was forced to review its business forecasts for 2007 again referring to the residues caused by the slow development of the engine of the A400M, which delay the flight of the young aircraft.
The costs announced in October to offset the delay in the delivery of their military transport aircraft amount to between EUR 1.2 and 1.4 billion, of which more than one billion for Airbus, announced the mother company of the European manufacturer EADS.
Due to this cost, EADS will be forced to announce new operating performance targets (EBIT) for 2007 next Thursday when presenting its quarterly results, he added without further detailing.
The Group also states that the assessment of the new costs is related to the six-month delay.
To remember, the business performance of the EADS has fallen from 86% in 2006, mainly due to the costs associated with the delay of another program, the very large carrier aircraft A380.
Originally, the group had planned a first delivery of the A400M to the French army for October 2009.
The choice of the status quo
On Sunday it will not be exciting to count the urns: the mass of Russians will choose President Putin's party, United Russia.
After a very closed election campaign, she confirms her desire for stability, even authoritarianism.
Three days before the parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin sends a message to the voters, who have already been recorded, but whose contents are kept secret.
He is doing this in his capacity as the top candidate of the United Russia, the Pro-Crem Party, for which an overwhelming victory is announced.
Yesterday the president did not let anything clear when he received the foreign ambassadors, and was satisfied with delivering a new attack against the Western powers, which are accused of interference - his favorite theme during the election campaign.
We know the price of true democracy and hope for honest elections, extremely transparent and open, elections without fraud, he added.
From the point of view of the opposition, they have been displaced there.
She brags an electoral campaign stained by oppression.
The Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says there had never been such dirty elections, not even in the time of Eltsin.
After the suppression of the demonstrations last weekend, former world chess champion Garry Kasparovder was sentenced to five days imprisonment for unauthorized demonstrations, according to his lawyer continued to be banned from visiting.
The Russians have preserved the mentality of Homo Sovieticus
After these parliamentary elections without tension, two much further questions arise:
Who will be Putin's successor as president?
The Official Journal announced yesterday the date of the first round of the presidential elections on 2 March 2008; the candidates have time to make themselves known until 23 December.
Since he was elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot stand for a third term in succession.
And now there's no successor.
What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
President of the majority of Parliament and the all-powerful United Russia Party, which will elect the government and the president?
Whatever it will be, in the parliamentary or presidential elections, the previous power will triumph.
That's tradition.
The Russians have safeguarded the mentality of Homo Sovietus, they are not the master of their fate, says sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the Independent Centre Levada.
Historian Nikolai Kopossov of St. Petersburg State University goes even further: bourgeois society has developed very slowly in this country, which has been christianized five centuries after Europe; the famous community spirit has delayed the development of individuality.
Following the liberal reforms of the 1990s, Putin has once again linked to the model of a paternalist state, which was completely accepted by the population, all the more so since this new paternalism was not followed by terror, but by a certain economic prosperity, says Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today the Russians renounce the personal responsibility they have shown for a short time after the collapse of the USSR.
What's to think about for a long time?
This phenomenon affects all social classes, including the business world.
And the administrative elite understands to keep the status quo: 65 governors (of 85 Russian regional presidents) lead the local electoral lists of the United Russia.
The new freedoms coming from the West are often as significant as chaos, as they were in the 1990s.
The general public prefers stability.
In this sense, the Russians will not vote for the extremist parties either.
Conclusion by Tamara Tcherednitchenko, a 54-year-old professor: What are we thinking about for a long time?
Those who are in power are not so bad why they replace?
A heavy reminder
After more than 60 years of confidentiality, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which document the fates of 17,5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are now freely accessible.
The 47 million documents of the archive, which are housed in Bad Arolsen for a total length of 27 km, could not be seen until now, unless with a humanitarian intention, that is, individually and name-based, i.e. at the request of a former victim or his family.
The eleven States entrusted with their administration - including Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May 2006 to make them available to researchers and historians.
After the ratification process of this Decision has been completed, the opening has been valid since yesterday.
Key information
The access of historians to Bad Arolsen will make it possible to conduct research, especially on the deportation of prisoners, the inmates of the concentration camps and the health status of the forced workers, explains Reto Meistern, head of this archive, which is managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (CICR).
Until recently, several states, including Germany, have been opposed to making these documents related to their names available to the public because of the delicate nature of certain information.
Like the alleged homosexuality or the mental disability of some deportation victims.
The inmates' lists of concentration camps or the warrants issued by the Gestapo had been gathered after the war for a practical reason: to find civilians who had been deported or forced to work, and possibly to provide them with evidence of their arrest, thus paving the way for their compensation.
Even today, more than 300 permanent employees are processing tens of thousands of personal requests in Bad Arolsen.
Nevertheless, a part of the scientific community shows only a limited interest in accessing Bad Arolsen.
One cannot expect anything fundamentally new in these documents, said Pr. Wolfgang Benz, Head of the Research Center for Anti-Semitism at the Technical University of Berlin, 2006.
The EU and India are seeking a free trade agreement in 2008.
At present, trade between India and Europe is already reaching EUR 60 billion a year.
The EU is India's most important trading partner and accounts for 18% of its external trade.
European Trade Minister Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath, stated that the European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008.
The EU's Foreign Ministers gave the European Commission the green light last April to open negotiations with a view to signing free trade agreements (ALEs) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
The EU is India's first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its external trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but according to the figures of the European Commission, India is only the ninth trading partner of the EU.
A free trade pact will bring the two economies forward enormously and India would improve its access to a market of 450 million prosperous Europeans , confirmed Peter Mandelson .
Europe is the first or second market for the ten most frequently exported products from India, the European Commissioner continued. Asian and European giants exchange goods worth EUR 47 billion each year and services worth EUR 10 billion. This week, Daniéle Smadja, President of the European Commission’s New Delhi delegation, explained and regretted that mutual trade has not yet exhausted its potential. The EU and India meet on Friday at their eighth diplomatic meeting in New Delhi, with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and President of the European Commission José Manuel Durao Barrosso.

The Bank of England takes note of the concern and offers 10 billion pounds for five weeks
On Thursday, the Bank of England was concerned about alleviating the ongoing concern about credit conditions and announced an offer of ten billion pounds with a basic interest rate of 5.75% for five weeks, an offer with unusual maturity.
In order to mitigate the fears that the financial market conditions will be particularly harsh at the end of the year and to give banks greater certainty about the way in which they are to organise their liquidity positions at this time , the Bank intends to offer a significant part of its savings during the maintenance phase starting on 6 December , in the form of an open market operation for five weeks , it sets out in a notice .
The Bank also declares that this will bring about 10 billion pounds (EUR 14 billion) on 6 December at 12.15 GMT, at the basic tax rate and only until 10 January.
This seems to be the first time that the BoE has been circulating for five weeks in an open-market operation.
This usually happens for a week.
In its Communication, the BoE adds that it is prepared to take further measures to obtain the interest rates on interbank loans at their basic interest rates from day to day.
The average daily interest rate was 5,829% on Wednesday.
The three-month interest rate has risen to 6.6%, slightly higher since 18 September.
Since the beginning of the financial crisis of the summer, the sums spent by the Bank of England have been linked with penalties which the banks had withheld from using them.
According to certain rumours, reinforced by the development of the pound rate in contrast to the euro, many preferred to sign for the sums put into circulation by the European Central Bank at more favourable interest rates and with safer discretion
UMP and NC refuse to review PS proposals for purchasing power
On Thursday, the groups UMP and Nouveau Centre refused to discuss the articles of the socialist bill on purchasing power, which amounts to a rejection of the text.
The text produced by a socialist niche (meeting on the initiative of a parliamentary group) indicated about ten measures adopted by the PS National Committee on Wednesday, most of which amount to 50% for employment allowances, the reintroduction of the TIP flotante, a transport check or the limitation of rents.
After UMP and NC had voted against the examination of the articles (180 votes to 115), the meeting was dissolved after the main discussion, which gave rise to some violent exchanges of words between the majority and opposition, a few hours before Nicolas Sarkozy's television contribution on the purchasing power.
The leader of the PS Jean Marc Ayrault announced that his group will present the whole of its proposals as an amendment to the legislative proposal for the correction of the finances which was examined last week by the Assamblee.
A New Festival Is Born
As a result of numerous rumors about the creation of a new music festival in Philadelphia by C3 presents, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with the festival Republic of British producer Melvin Benn.
It is an honor for our company to work with a person who, no more and no less, has served as a model for the current festival movement in America, Charlie Jones announced from C3 on Bilboard.com.
C3 hosts the Lollapalooza Festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer destination for camping holidays.
The festival will probably take place from 8-10 August on a 500 Acre private farm about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
The director of Festival Republic Melvin Benn, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the producers of the world's most prestigious festivals.
In 1989 he took over the management of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts around 80,000 people each year.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added his portfolio to the Leeds Festival, and then, in 2006, Festival Republic created the Latitude Festival in Henham Park in Suffolk.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn has also been a co-owner of the production, licensing and organizational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Charlie Jones of C3, who describes Glastonbury as the most inspiring event he's ever attended, says that his company and Melvin Benn's company are working side by side to offer the area a festival event in European style.
We have chosen Philadelphia as a market and are working diligently with the Fairmount Park Commission to create a festival in Philadelphia City Centre, says Charlie Jones.
We had negotiations with the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiastic about this project.
Regrettably, we have stayed in political debate on the current administration, Charlie Jones continues.
"Unfortunately, we were able to discuss with Melvin Benn and we are preparing to create a great festival in an extraordinary place that will ultimately benefit the population."
C3 Presents has brought the Lollapalooza Festival back to life in the Grand Park Chicago in 2005, after it has been profiled together with the Austin City Limits Music Festival in the world of the festival in 2002.
The two events were able to reach $9.8 million in 2007 and $11.8 million in gross tax payments.
These two festivals take place in an urban environment.
"The European model of Melvin Benn is a rural festival, whereas ours rather take place on the urban green spaces," says Charlie Jones.
"The aim is, in one way or another, to merge these two concepts in order to simultaneously convey the impression of a rural festival on the European and a urban way in the American way."
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The community of Vineland, including the mayor, takes on the burden of this event with joy," says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to disclose the terms of the agreement, but he confirms that "they are sufficiently interesting to invest in such an event and to include a festival that hopefully will have a long life."
Charlie Jones says that the reception capacity of the festival is "very large", corresponding to about 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says that the invitations were sent to the groups, but that nothing could be confirmed when they were printed.
"Vineland will offer tasteful rock, but the music will be very diverse, hoping to attract all kinds of spectators," says Charlie Jones.
His partner from C3, who has received the Top Independent Promoter Award of the last Bollboard Touring Award, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal meets the Terminator.
Not easy to get the main platform for Hollywood movies to Montreal if no less than the terminator opposes it.
These lock attempts are among the delegated tasks.
A political "heikles mandate" because the Governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, denounces the Runaway Productions.
Is it difficult to negotiate with the governor?
"You have to be careful, because it is the industry that decides where it goes.
If she finds that the conditions in Montreal are favourable, she will go there.
Our role is to offer those who are thought to be the best," he says.
The run to the festivals.
For Denis Turcotte, however, the main priority is to present the cinema there at the moment.
The hunt for the Oscars started.
At all the festivals on the west coast, although that of Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, it will be about presenting, evaluating and ensuring that the producers give interviews.
The dark age had a successful performance at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
He will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake hands with the Devil is on the poster in Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
This month Quebec also presented four long and four short films at the American Film Institute Fest.
Is the stock exchange facing a one-year rally? Disagreement among experts due to the US mortgage crisis
With almost five weeks until the end of the year on the stock exchange, investors are already rubbing their hands in view of the upcoming end-year rally.
Nevertheless, the experts cannot make safe forecasts in this regard.
Banif believes that purely statistical, the month of December is usually accompanied by positive market developments on the stock exchange
Nevertheless, it is not advisable to draw up forecasts in the short term and only on the basis of statistics.
Although other experts do not approve such a strong price increase in the last weeks of the year, they nevertheless note that the stock exchange price is determined by the given liquidity of the market and the market participant. These invest mainly in pension funds due to the lack of secure equity funds, which are strongly affected by the value-added trend.
According to these experts, the stock exchange will therefore have a rather lateral price trend influenced by market fluctuations, mainly because we are not yet able to estimate the extent of the possible fall in the interest rate of the U.S. central bank, an uncertainty which is mainly due to the rise in the crude oil price and the risk of the increase in the inflation rate.
Javier Barrio, president of the sales department at BPI in Spain, agrees that it is a daring time to announce a forthcoming market rally.
The chances are not very good, the expert assures.
The Spanish stock index Ibex has already lost a figure of 4% since its highest brand on 8 November of 15.945.7 points.
But not all experts share the same negative opinion.
According to Juan Solana, analyst at Intermoney, the Ibex 35 could successfully conclude the year with almost 16,000 points due to the restructuring of the investment funds and the traditional grant of the pension fund made every year around that time.
Nevertheless, the expert points out that this year things could develop a little differently, especially because of the final year rally already taking place in the second week of December, and then directly after the bridge day to the day of the Constitution.
In the opinion of the analyst, the price fluctuations would not affect market trends.
According to Federico Olucha, analyst at Bank Inversis, the previous assessments of the market situation are at an almost technical level, which could lead to an immediate deviation from the index values, the extent of which depends on the consequences of the US mortgage market crisis.
The analyst trusts that these are positive.
When selecting the values to drive the Ibex to new maximums, the analysts agree.
Solana of Intermoney argues that this year the great values are on the line.
The expert would include the two major banks and some real estate companies, as the electricity sector will be too expensive at the given time.
In the meantime, Federico Olucha assures Bank Inversis that the increases will be accompanied by the banking and industrial sectors.
If the rally actually takes place, the real estate companies will benefit from it.
The ACS has been on a catch-up course in recent months and we hope that other real estate companies such as Ferrovial and FCC will follow the same path, according to the expert.
In terms of increased consumption during the Christmas days, the last half of the periodical consumption will determine market events.
On the other hand, the expert believes that the technologies will also achieve positive sales results, even if they are represented on the Spanish market only in small numbers.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, December has seen only two declines in the course of the course.
When the technology bubble burst at the end of 2003, this led the stock market out of its crisis and simultaneously initiated the last real end-year rally.
This year, in which the Ibex 35 picked up 28.17 percentage points, December showed an increase of 6.68%.
Whether 2008 will be the fifth year in a row (the Ibex has been rising by 8.36%) and a final year rally will be shown.
Popular will have its 200 credit institutions open 12 hours a day from Monday to Friday.
Popular has decided to modernise a large part of its branches.
A total of 200 of them are located in the most economically strong regions of Spain.
For the institute, which operates under the brand name Popular Max, these offices mean a big milestone.
But also for the rest of the Spanish institutions, as Popular as the first banking group is daring to extend the opening hours of its branches weekly until 20.30h and set on Saturdays from 10h to 20.30h.
The banking group BBVA, which also read the extension of its opening hours in the branches, has not yet reached a definitive decision.
The current negotiations of the Bank with the trade unions seem to be aimed at reaching an agreement in which 75% of all branches are closed on Saturdays and open for this on a weekday afternoon, though not for the customer.
Whether other banks join the new initiative, which adapts to business opening times, will depend on the experience of the Popular Bank.
And that's exactly what popular pursues with their project.
The aim is to extend the opening hours of those branches which, due to their location, can cover the buying-in customership of independent, small and medium-sized enterprises, but also those of large department stores.
The Bank wants to open the new 200 branches over the next 18 months, as these are not new, but changed opening hours.
For this purpose, the Bank will reorganise the premises of the branches already located in business zones while at the same time aligning them with the individual customer profile of the different zones.
Thus, the extension of opening times is linked to a new design of the premises, which is characterized by a more up-to-date, colourful design.
The competent bank representative Ángel Rivera assures that the restructuring does not require major investments, but that it was accompanied by an increase in staffing, since a branch no longer needed six but eight or nine employees.
The branches, which will even be equipped with additional premises for SMEs, will not sell financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already tried his concept at nine branches in Madrid.
And the values of experience were positive, says Ángel Rivero.
The offices of the streets of Bravo Murillo, O ́Donell and Gran Vía have been chosen for what seems to have been a wise decision.
Popular currently manages about 2500 branches.
And another 60 who operate under the name Mundocredit. These are specialized in immigrants and also have extended opening hours, even on Sundays and holidays.
In these branches of PopularMax, the model of BBVA is not used, as most of them will instead offer a wide range of non-financial services for sale.
We do not want to compete for our customers, explains Rivero.
With Telefonica they have reached a preliminary agreement to sell mobile phones with the help of external banking personnel.
The Spanish private broadcaster Telecinco doubles its market value for the first time and thus overtakes its rival Antena 3.
We did it.
With this sentence, the managing director of Telecinco, Paolo Vasile, expressed his satisfaction at the closing of the stock exchange. The broadcaster he led had increased its value by twice its rival Antena 3.
One aspect, however, dampened his joy: that is exactly what hurts me; not that we had higher growth, but that we had lower losses, he noted.
He stressed that, despite the weak market, they did not fall too deep.
Telecinco finished the day yesterday with a plus of 2.54%.
This profit reduces its previous losses to 15.66% this year.
According to Bloomberg, the company's value now reaches EUR 4,488,88 million, with Mediaset controlling the majority of the capital (52%), and Vocento participating only 13%.
The rival Antena 3 lost 1.52 percentage points yesterday and has reported a total loss of 40.5% since January, so its market value amounts to 2,193.46 million in half.
On the other hand, the market value of other listed communications companies is rising, in the case of Sogecable to 3,571 million, in the case of Prisa (editor of Cinco Días magazine) to 2,518.53 million and in the case of Vocento to 1,779 million.
The comparison with Antena 3 can be derived from the fact that these are two similar companies, says Vasile.
The question remains, to what extent we can actually operate on the stock exchange, at what price and how we can make it lucrative at customer level.
Telecinco announced a week ago his plan to increase its first television channel with more than 1000 million gross profits from advertising revenues this year. This assured Guiseppe Tringali, the CEO of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the advertising company of the group.
If the project were to be implemented, the sender would increase its advertising revenue by 3.6% compared to the 965.4 million in the previous year.
In the case of Antena 3, net sales increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the stock exchange (up to 734.4 million), while net income from the television business could only increase by 0.7% (630.4 million).
The analysts see the main factor for the better market performance of Telecinco at the high payout ratio that the company was able to show up to this point in time: in 2006, Alejandro Echevarría led the company to pay 100% dividends.
Vasile, however, assures that after the purchase of 33% of the shares of Endemol, with mediaset as a parent company, the ratio could still vary, even if it is too early for official disclosure.
We are committed to the official compromise to pay at least 50% of the shares, even if we have so far indicated much more.
I hope that we will be able to satisfy our shareholders this year, whose share values we have already been able to increase by purchasing 33% of the endmol shares.
According to the analysts, the market is currently showing some loss trends.
Lehmann Brothers recently reduced its profit calculation at Telecinco by 4% for this year and 7% for 2009.
This is the consequence of the reduction in the expected growth rate, which will decrease from 10.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
This also reduced the expected profit calculation of Antena 3 by 4.5% for 2008 and by 7.5% for 2009.

The Congress agrees with the MIFID Directive, which entered into force on 1 November.
At the same time as parliamentary drafting, which ended today with the Senate Congress decision on the additional/amendment requests relating to the project, the government published the provisions resulting from the new law with the intention of enabling the entry into force of both regulations by the end of the year.
The representatives of the various companies unanimously praised the efforts of congressional and Senate members, who had pursued in their negotiations and votes the objective of establishing the best possible regime that ensures investor safety and regulates the individual business activities in order to guarantee a generally efficient market event.
In addition to the modernisation of the financial markets, the MIFID, which is revising the Securities Services Regulation, is pursuing an improvement in investor protection, an increase in the control requirement of the Spanish Securities Commission (CNMV) and the promotion of cooperation between the various control authorities of the European Union.
The new Directive makes it possible to provide both specialised companies and natural or legal persons with financial advice and also contributes to the creation of new financial services companies (ESIS), the consultancy companies that are merging with the investment and brokerage companies of securities.
In addition, it extends the number of systems for the execution of financial transactions so that the regulated circulation markets are added to the multilateral securities trading systems and to the systems for the internationalisation of trading orders, which would eventually enter into competition with the current economic operators.
The law obliges investment companies to disclose the focus of their corporate profile, confrontation and forms of dealing with risks on the market and to register all projects carried out in order to facilitate the control task of the CNMV.
The Congress's Economic Commission subsequently introduced further amendments, with the decision that the titled bond should now be considered as complex financial resources to the investor due to its high level of risk, having been confirmed by the US mortgage and banking crisis.
In addition, the entry into force of the directive on the legal delimitation of the activities of certified economists was used; 30 years after 1977 the regulation was adopted which restricted the fields of work reserved for economists.
The Senate, for its part, defined new positions in the financial sector, such as those of the economic mediator, who is working on a foreign account, does not require any authorisation from the CNMV and can offer its services for the commercialisation of products and for the acquisition of customers at the same time several investment companies.
The Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (VPI) increased by five tenths in November and is now 4.1%.
The indicator used by Eurostat to assess the inflation rate within the European Union provides the average price trend in Spain in November.
Its publication is in line with the principles of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB), which, through the publication of the data, seek to compare local and quality with US products.
The forecast for the indicator can be prepared in advance by applying the same approach as the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, but at the same time by using various other statistical modelling methods to estimate the information not available at the time of calculation.
However, the Spanish Statistical Office (INE) warned that the indicator identified in advance should only serve as a benchmark and should therefore not be consistent with the final result announced next December 14.
The Consumer Price Index (VPI) will remain at a relatively high level
According to the Deputy Head of Government and the Minister for Economic Affairs and Finance Pedro Solbes, the increase in the VPI in November was a temporary development, while at the same time ensuring that the price index would remain at a relatively high level in the coming months.
However , Solbes found in the halls of the Congress building that even if the current figure is not good , the inflation differential between Spain and the other members of the Monetary Union has remained more or less the same in recent years .
He also stated that in November there were less surprises than in the previous month, when the government did not expect such a high increase.
We expected a figure of around 4%, the Minister of Economic Affairs and Finance announced in view of the forecast published today.
Virgin expects Northern Rock revenues of over EUR 42 billion over the next three years
The value of Northern Rock has fallen by more than half after the Bank had asked for emergency credit in mid-September of last year due to crises, and it now amounts to only 12,000 million pounds (which is equivalent to 16,800 million euros).
At that time, the Bank’s assets amounted to record 25,000 million pounds, a sum that has fallen significantly within two and a half months due to the loss of customer confidence, and also despite the government’s 100% guarantee that the money will remain secure until the end of the crisis.
The company Virgin, which would continue the group after the acquisition under the brand name Virgin Money, will have to collect about a quarter of the income of the British banks that will be composed there from the investments over the next three years to acquire exactly those 18 billion pounds that are still needed to achieve their target of 30 billion.
The group of multimillionaire Richard Branson, who is known for his prominent advertising campaigns in the UK, intends to channel 50,000 million pounds (equivalent to around 70 million euros) annually into advertising and marketing campaigns in order to achieve its goal.
This week, Northern Rock appointed the Virgin Group, with three more companies involved, as its preferred bidder to take it out of insolvency.
The mayor of Totana arrested for alleged suspicion of participation in urban corruption
The Spanish police arrested the current mayor of the town of Totano (Partido Popular) in Murcia this morning, due to the urgent suspicion of involvement in urban corruption that was revealed this week.
In addition, one of the secretaries of the municipal council and the chief of the municipal police were arrested.
José Martínez Andreo represented the office of Juan Morales, currently a member of the Partido Popular and at that time chairman of the municipal council of Totana, and could, according to information from the radio station Cadena SER, be the original wire puller of the plot.
Officials continue to search the business records of the municipality and the Ministry of Urban Planning and do not exclude further arrests in the coming hours.
In addition, the lawyer was accused by Juan Morales of the main suspect in the case of urban corruption discovered at the beginning of this week.
According to information from the Cadena SER, the lawyer of the popular , and thus privileged MP Juan Morales on leaving the residence of his client was arrested on the basis of important burdensome documents that should be related to the plot.
In addition, other sources of information report on the alleged payment of morale's orders to a Galician construction company that provided for the conclusion of an urban contract in which the construction of a 200-hectare area was decided.
Eight people are currently under investigation.
Bono agrees to accept the candidacy of the PSOE in Toledo and to take the fall of an election victory at Congress.
Former Minister of Defence José Bono has accepted the offer of the President of the Government and Secretary General of the Socialists, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero. Accordingly, he will list the PSOE candidates in the forthcoming general elections in Toledo and, in the event of a Socialist election, will take over the office of Congress President.
For example, José Blanco, Organisation Secretary of the PSOE, and Bono announced at the press conference, after a meeting with Zapatero took place today at the headquarters of the party.
In the opinion of the Head of Government, the offer to the former Minister is justified because it is important in politics to be able to count on the best and Bono is among the best.
In addition, in the event of a victory for the socialists in the forthcoming elections, the Mancha politician would appear to be the chairman of the Congress for the Party.
Bono would replace Manuel Martín as president of the Congress, who announced last November 15 that he would no longer take part in the next general elections, end his career in public policy and instead take up his place in the university field for climate protection.
The former Minister had to admit that since his resignation two years ago, the President of the Government had been constantly pressing for his return to political action.
He also pointed out that the party, as in the appointment of the vice-president of the economy, did not want to deter citizens from taking over the post of Congress president in the event of an election victory, and called this an act of transparency .
If he should actually take over the office, he hopes to transform the chamber into a house of respect and not of insult or scabbardness to make it appear more and more similar to the citizens.
Regrettably, from time to time you get the impression that the only place where you can't talk quietly and quietly in Madrid is Congress; so the president of the government was interrupted in the Senate up to 26 times.
At the same time, he praised current President Manuel Martín and his good work and indicated that he did not want to appear to have already taken over the office, as otherwise his political opponents would call this arrogance.
Climate Propaganda
Since the climate debate is pitifully critical of both climate change skeptics and those who put a social and political debate at the forefront of this, the movement as a whole must show strong cohesion.
Above all, it is a leader of the movement who, as in the case of President Zapatero, considers the fight against climate change to be more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and even proposes to conclude a new treaty with the planet.
However, this proposal brings him to the fore in terms of the action or non-action of his government, which has made a decisive contribution to Spain's being at the top of the countries that have least met the Kyoto Protocol's requirements within the EU.
Who are responsible for the failure to comply with the requirements to which sectors this is due, and why has his government, which had proposed the treaty with the planet, not stopped this development?
Furthermore, it is now forced to explain to Spanish citizens the measures it intends to take to combat climate change without undue delay.
Which companies will be affected, which behaviour of citizens will be changed, which individual and collective austerity measures will have to be implemented and what the economic consequences will result from.
More specifically, who has to sacrifice himself and will pay for the salvation of the planet.
However, there are and will be no such explanations in the future.
Just because it's about sacrifice and payment.
Because the measures that can be taken to combat climate change really are unpopular.
They are costly, inconvenient and threatening for the accounts of companies and citizens.
Even the petrol centre proposed by the PSOE appeared strategically dangerous in view of the fact that Zapatero was forced to withdraw the proposal.
Accordingly, it is now necessary to save the planet with nothing, i.e. with pure propaganda and empty sayings without any real consequences.
With impressive statements, commissions, committees, protocols and new offices.
With his contracts with the planet, the otherwise suitable politician for election campaigns must neither speak nor accuse, nor demand, but instead pursue the demanding expense of decorating the meetings and inspiring others with his gentleness and kindness.
But this can only happen if the contract does not deviate from its purely virtual nature and therefore does not imply that the bike will become the only means of transport in the future or we can only refresh ourselves with a compartment.
The mayor and the police chief of Totana because of alleged involvement in urban corruption.
The Guardia Civil has arrested the mayor of the town of Totana, the popular politician José Martínez Andreo. In addition, the local police chief, the secretary of the mayor's office and a hotel entrepreneur were arrested because of the suspected suspicion of urban crimes, it was today called from investigation circles.
The city council was arrested at its residence, from where it was taken to the municipal office and in its premises until this time, surrounded by numerous agents who had also arrived at the municipal administration and at the municipal construction management Suelo Industrial y Vivienda.
The three arrests are related to the last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, where it turned out that more than 2 million hectares of unexplored land for urban construction projects should be reconstructed under the direction of the Galician construction company Nuaria, which should be built on the property 4000 homes after the local administration has received illegal commissions during the last legislative period.
In addition, two more persons were not directly arrested, but were subjected to an investigation procedure initiated and conducted by the First Court of Totona.
The first six arrested have been presented to the judge today.
According to investigators, it is also determined against the former mayor of Totana and current independent PP member Juan Morales.
Furthermore, his ex-wife, the owner of a property company registered in Totana, as well as his current friend residing in Murcia, are suspected.
The chairman and owner of the Nuaria Group, the lawyer and entrepreneur Manuel N.A. from Vigo, was arrested in the village of Nigrán (Pontevedra), as well as the managing director of Suelo de Inmonuar Pablo José M.G., whose company is said to have acted as a sub-group of Nuaria and received the lubrication money.
The investigations are carried out by the Municipal Authority against urban crimes, under the supervision of the Central Unit of Guardia Civil, whose representatives in addition to the arrests carried out 11 more searches, most of them in companies directly related to the arrests carried out in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
At that time, only one person was arrested in Totana: the owner of a regionally known poultry farming industry, which is said to have acted as a middleman.
The Nuaria assembly was commissioned to build the largest residential complex in Murcia, which included more than 5000 apartments, a golf course and two spa hotels.
The company acquired over 2.2 million square kilometres of land in Totana, which was to be converted. The aim was to realize a construction project that would raise the population of the municipality to 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria group includes other companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which promote the sale of real estate; Conyase, which operates in Vigo the parking spaces of Coruña, Venezuela and Plaza Fernando el Católico; Hogartel, whose activity is limited to the direct marketing sector and Preconiza, specializing in the promotion, sale and installation of components.

Our Finnish correspondent explains to us the comment published yesterday in the most important Finnish newspaper, the Helsingin Sanomat (Finland, by the way, is at the top of the PISA study), which refers to the comment published in the same newspaper, on November 18th; by chance on that day, whose issue contained the criticism of the book Blackburns.
The content of the philosophy subject has become the subject of public debate after the tragedy of Jokela's school.
Responsible for the cruel murders is a graduate who quoted Plato's and Nietzsche's works in his news.
In an interview with the daily newspaper Helsingin Sanomat, chairman of the Education Council for Philosophy, Pekka Elo, asked teachers to take a more critical position against Plato and suggested that Plato's teaching be removed from the sub-level curriculum for philosophy at high school.

A colleague informs about the inclusion of illegal Internet downloads in the criminal code:
A. The download of a song would be a violation of the law, which would be dealt with with with six months of imprisonment.
However, if you again rob a music business of a value of 400 euros, this is only considered to be a simple violation (Article 623.1).
B. If you rob the business up to a value of EUR 1000, theft is classified as a crime, but the penalty is lower than a download (Article 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you claw a car and give it back forty hours later, the penalty is still lower than with a download (Article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight than in a music data exchange.
A prison sentence of three to 12 months follows (Article 154 of the Criminal Code), while the exchange of data results in a detention period of six months to two years
(Article 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. According to Article 184.2 of the Criminal Code, sexual harassment at work is considered to be less serious than downloading a DVD movie from the Internet.
F. The trade in copyright-protected films, whose authoring did not take place, is subject to a higher penalty than the distribution of pornographic film material to minors (Article 186).
Well, if my colleague should be right, someone would have screwed up his demands.

My family doctor gives me one of his long, strange research articles entitled: Money leads to activation of certain brain areas, especially when others get more of it.
So the feelings arising from the monthly salary pay depend on the salary of the colleagues.
The study was produced by means of an tomographic-magnetic reference analysis at the University of Bonn, and the results were published in the latest edition of the Science magazine.
According to Bernd Webers, author of the study and director of the Bonn brain research center Life&Brain, activation was the strongest if the participant gave correct answers and his co-player failed.
The researchers were able to see that brain activities were always very moderate when both participants were correct with their answer and thus also received the same salary; but if one of them received the double, there was also a stronger brain activity.
I am not quite sure whether it really takes so much scientific effort to achieve such a result.
The Minister of State from the Balkans
For eight years, Carla del Ponte has been relentlessly following the criminals of the Balkan wars. Her seat is in the prosecution of the Criminal Court of former Yugoslavia, located in La Haya.
Her mandate will expire at the end of the year, and Carla will leave her office with a weeping and laughing eye, as the chief culprits of the massacre of Srebrenica - in which eight thousand Bosnian Muslims died - namely the former General Ratko Mladic and the former Serbo-Bossian leader Radovan Karadzic are still on their own.
Their names are listed by Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach as a template for the title of his documentary film La Liste de Carla (2006, not yet started in Spain); a film that, at the pace of a political thriller, follows the Swiss attorney from Belgrade to New York in her project to track down the escaped criminals and put pressure on the respective governments to tighten up their networks.
Which insurance is best for me?
The motor vehicle insurance, which covers a possible damage caused by the driver, involves a high cost, the amount of which again depends on different factors, including age, gender, date of creation of the driver's licence, family status, type of car to be insured and its use, etc.
Owning a car is just the beginning.
Because it is even more difficult to find the right car insurance than the right vehicle model.
First of all, you have to be clear about what we're dealing with here.
Auto insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and an insurer.
This agreement shall be recorded in writing by means of an insurance contract, which shall determine that the company receives the agreed insurance premium and shall, in return, be obliged to present the corresponding amount of compensation in the event of a loss or injury.
The insurance premium is the price of insurance consisting of several factors, including age, sex, date of creation of the driving licence, family status, type of vehicle to be insured or its use.
Insurance companies set their prices according to the statistics, so that higher contributions are also payable in the event of a higher risk of accident.
For this reason, both over 25-year-olds and women have to make less contributions, as statistics show that these groups have a lower accident rate due to their caution.
The same applies to married persons, since, according to statistical data, they tend to have fewer accidents than single persons, even after the company has been convinced.
The benefit to the vehicle affects the frequency of driving and thus the likelihood of an accident.
The more frequent the use, the more likely the damage.
When setting the premium, insurance must take into account a whole series of points.
For this reason, the driver must also study the situation thoroughly in order to select exactly the car insurance that best meets his personal needs.
We are now listing the most important points which should be considered when choosing insurance in order to make not only a performance but also a price-oriented choice.
The 25-year-olds face numerous obstacles, such as low driving practices and young driving licences, when choosing a low-priced insurance policy.
Even if it would be best for an ideal insurance cover to complete full insurance, there are still cheaper alternatives.
The cautious drivers can choose a full-box with self-participation, so that the services of a full-payment insurance are covered but offered at a low price.
This type of contract includes that the customer must pay part of the amount resulting from the damage himself.
The amount is fixed before the conclusion of the contract and on the basis of the amount of the insurance premium. This is higher the amount to be paid, explains Luis Noguera, Spain’s main representative at First Europa, a brokerage company for online insurance.
Another option is the extended insurance, which assures the customer against external accident damage, but not against the damage caused on its own car.
In addition, this type of insurance would cover theft, fire and vehicle loss.
Here's a advice.
If you are under 25 years of age, it is in your hand to reduce insurance costs; so your credit increases by trying to drive carefully and avoid accidents.
A credit is a reduction in the basic rate for the relevant insurance company.
On the contrary, a penalty payment includes an increase in the rates stated.
The amount of credit and penalty payments depends on the company and its income.
If the company has a profitable year behind it, it can be allowed to increase the bonus payments, explains Noguera.
As soon as the 25-year mark is exceeded, it is easier for drivers to conclude a contract. The reason for this is that with increasing driving practice the accident rate decreases.
It is therefore most appropriate to opt for full insurance with self-employment.
Normally, young people cannot benefit from their previous experience, both in the event of an accident and at the time of driving , explains the Spanish president of the European company, and adds that the majority of accidents occur in the second practical year after the fear of the beginner was put down.
Nevertheless, for a married customer who has no children, it is more advisable to take out full insurance; of course only if it allows the financial situation of the person concerned.
On the part of the insurers, married couples with children are considered to be the customers with the lowest accident rate, and their contributions are therefore also low.
In this case, a full-payment insurance with self-employment (with an amount of 300 euros) would be the best option. In case you have received a high credit, an extended insurance policy, which only applies to the third vehicle year, is recommended.
They drive more relaxed overall and have a greater purchasing power that allows them to make a higher contribution payment, Luis Noguera notes.
For pensioners, it is advisable to take out a full-payment insurance with self-employment (with an amount of 150 euros) or an extended insurance policy which only applies to a sufficiently high credit.
Finally, one must note that car insurance is something very important, not only because it protects the driver from possible accident damage, but also because it involves high costs, which require a thorough selection that corresponds to our personal situation.
Celtic Glasgow hopes for the eighth final point in Milan
The FC Milan and Celtic Glasgow will be fighting for the point in San Siro next Tuesday to achieve their respective goals before the final of the Champions League preliminary round. The Italians need the point to get to the top of their group, while the Scottish decide to take part.
The Italian team already has five points and have already confirmed their participation in the fifth round with a decision in Portugal, while the Celtic Glasgow needs another one with nine points to make sure that the FC Shakhtar with six points does not catch up with the Befica Lisbon with four points.
The two games of Group D will take place one week before the end of the sixth round, as the FC Milan will have to take part in the FIFA World Cup in Japan, where he will fight for the first time in the semifinals on the 13th in the finals, which will take place on the 16th.
So this group will be finished in front of all the others and the decision in the Guiseppe Meazza Stadium to the expected result, even if both teams will try to win. The Italians will not want to speculate at home the Celtic Glasgow knows that in the case of a winning group first, they would have a better starting position in the eighth final.
The team of Gordon Strachan might even be able to defeat the FC Shakhtar at a slowdown to qualify. Nevertheless, he should not rely too much on such circumstances, because at nine points of equality the Ukrainians are entitled to participate; they had lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but were able to win the second game (2-0).
Thus, the Milaners will try to avoid the Scots the evening. They hope to achieve for the second time in a row the eighth final of the remodeled Champions League, after they were defeated in the previous season by a goal of Kaka in the season (1-0) and by a zero to zero indistinct on the spin.
While the FC Shakhtar awaits the victory of Rossoneri, the team will have to concentrate on its own game, as both reaching the eighth final and joining the UEFA will depend on its victory and defeat of Celtic Glasgow.
In spite of its lower table position and without the prospect of continuing to take part in the largest European championship, Benfica Lisbon could win third place and thus participate in the UEFA.
20,000 people attend the first concert of the Spice Girls Tour in Vancouver.
The Spice Girls gave the first shot in the Canadian Vancouver in front of 20,000 spectators for their first tour after the release of the band in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) y 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) explained that the mood in the reunited band was excellent just before the start of their concert at the GM Place de Vancouver Stadium.
Around 20,000 people were able to experience the concert in the sold-out stadium, where a video on the history of the band, which had caused terror in the late 1990s, was shown.
The reunion and the world tour overlap with the release of a new album, which includes their biggest hits and two more new songs, headlines and voodoo, and which appears in Spain under the label of EMI.
The five members of the Spice Girls wore golden bracelets that the husband of Posh Spice, English footballer David Beckham, had given them before.
The athlete was among the fans in the audience who made the GM Palace glow, even though the nerves of his wife Victoria had forbidden him in the previous days.
During the preparations for the Show Victoria Beckham was told that the British star didn't get to face our wardrobe once, and that's why I'm really excited about what he's going to think about the performance.
Sporty Spice , whose withdrawal from the group in 1998 was followed by the dissolution of the group two years later due to internal disagreements, expressed her nervousness at a press meeting two hours before the concert.
I was shocked.
I was nervous, but I saw that the attitude of the world public had changed, that the feelings about the Spice Girls had changed.
And that's why I thought why not; so I'm glad to have made this decision, Chisholm said about the separation of the band she had caused nine years ago.
The singer also said that the disputes were resolved and that they were all very happy again.
Nevertheless, many things have changed since the last joint appearance of the Spice Girls in 1998.
First of all, according to a report by the TV station CTV, the group arrived in a special engine by Virgin Airlines in Vancouver.
Upon their arrival at the airport, the band was received by an army of nannys.
The five have seven children together.
After the Vancouver concert, the band will appear next in California, San José (December 4th) and Los Angeles (December 5th and 7th).
In Madrid they will enter the stage on 23 December.
New concerns about natural gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine
A new price dispute is emerging between Ukraine and Russia, increasing the risk that Russian exports of fuel to Western Europe will be affected.
The majority of Russian exports of natural gas to the European Union (EU) are managed by Ukraine and every dispute between the two nations is observed very closely.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow increases the price it has to pay for the natural gas, it will charge higher transit fees from Russia.
An earlier conflict between the two states last year reduced deliveries to the EU countries.
The recent conflict between Kiev and Moscow takes place at a time when the Ukrainian government and the Russian state gas monopoly Gazprom are trying to reach an agreement on how much Ukraine has to pay for Russian natural gas in 2008.
According to Gazprom, Ukraine has to be more calculated as the Group has agreed to pay up to 50% additional for natural gas from neighbouring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say that this could mean that Ukraine has to pay 40% more for Gazprom imports.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit states in talks," said Ukraine's Minister of Economic Affairs Anatoli Kinakh of Reuters News Agency.
"The changing gas prices should undoubtedly be linked to our arguments regarding the amount of transit fees [to Western Europe] on Ukraine."
In the last major natural gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev in January 2006, Gazprom reduced deliveries to Ukraine.
This led to a fall in exports to Western Europe, which drastically increased prices.
Russian gas accounts for one quarter of the European Union's supply.
Russia has the largest gas deposits worldwide, but much of it remains underdeveloped.
The result is that Gazprom complements its own supplies with gas from Turkmenistan and other Central Asian former Soviet nations.
NHS "must control foreign workers"
The Scottish State Health Service must improve the controls of the pre-criminal registers for workers from outside Europe, said a member of the control body.
The recommendation of the chief financial controller Robert Black came after a foreign doctor in Scotland was brought together with the attack on Glasgow Airport in June.
Black also expressed concern that the Scottish State Health Service did not have precise ideas about the number of its foreign employees.
However, his report pointed out that other important controls were carried out correctly in a sample of five health authorities.
The main financial controller investigated personnel recruited outside the countries of the European Economic Area as a result of the attack on Glasgow Airport.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after an off-road car was driven through the doors of the main airport terminal.
He was one of three doctors who appeared in a video transmission in October in Old Bailey and was charged with the suspected car bombing in the UK.
It is expected that the State Health Service will carry out checks in advance of the employment of foreign employees to ensure that they have the necessary qualifications, experience and authorizations to work in the United Kingdom.
Although the health authorities use Disclosure Scotland to check criminal records, the Agency does not have the competence to obtain this information outside the UK.
The main reviewer's report now states, in addition to other recommendations, that the Management Board should adopt guidelines on criminal record collection that help employers in controls in different countries.
"Although we have found evidence of these checks in some personnel documents, they have not been carried out routinely." the report noted.
Black said that the Scottish health authorities would closely follow their pre-employment guidelines, but added: "Our report identifies areas in which the system can be improved to ensure that accurate information is available on the number of foreign health professionals."
BMA Scotland President Dr. Peter Terry said it was "extremely unlikely" that investigations prior to hiring potential NHS employees would identify people who could commit future terrorist attacks.
"The report says that current pre-employment tests of the NHS Scotland are working well and it is not clear what added value the recommendations will provide," he said.
The Scottish health authorities say they currently have 1,161 foreign employees, the vast majority of whom are doctors and nurses.
However, the financial controller warned that the number was likely to be higher, also because the directors had problems identifying those employees who were on leave for an indefinite period.
The investigation continued to show that established control procedures have been largely complied with by the NHS authorities in Ayrshire, Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian.
These include passport, work permit and qualification checks.
the Scottish Government is currently reviewing its policies and guidelines for pre-employment checks for foreign personnel in the NHS.
Nicola Sturgeon, Secretary of Health, said: "It was my concern to carry out this work in the face of the terrorist attack on Glasgow Airport."
She added that the Scottish Government, in conjunction with the health authorities, would take into account the recommendations of the report and would ensure that the best practices in updated guidelines on control investigations would be reflected in the appointment of all employees, including those from abroad, whose publication is planned next month.
Joy Division dominates film awards
Control, the film biography about the late Joy Division singer Ian Curtis has won five prizes at the British Independent Film Festival, among other things for the best film.
Prizes were also awarded to main actor Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse before he was cast for the role of Curtis, to director Anton Corbijn, and side actor Toby Kebbell.
Dame Judi Dench was awarded the best lead actress for the Thriller Notes on a Scandal.
And Bond actor Daniel Craig won the Variety Prize for having brought the British film to the world public.
The prizes were presented at a ceremony at the London Roundhouse.
Control follows Curtis ascent to fame with Joy Division until his suicide in 1980 at 23 years of age.
The black and white film - on whose soundtrack The Killers, David Bowie and New Order can be found - was filmed for only 3 million pounds.
Nevertheless, he has brought two prizes to Dutch photographer Corbijn, best known so far for the iconic cover of the U2 album Joshua Tree - as the best director and the best director debut.
Rock music was the focus of another winner at the ceremony - when Julian Temple's film about the Clash singer Joe Strommer received the prize for the best documentary.
The prize for the best actor went to Viggo Mortensen for his role as the driver of a Russian mob boss in David Cronenberg's London playing thriller Easter Promises.
Ray Winstone, who stands in the reputation of playing hard guys, has picked up the Richard Harris Prize for his outstanding contribution to the British film.
The 50-year-old, whose films include Scum, Nil by Mouth and Sexy Biest, is currently filming the Indiana Jones Continuum The Kingdom of the Chrystal Skull.
Winston said he was proud to receive the prize that was named in honor of Camelot and Harry Potter Stars Harris, who died in 2002.
"There were people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney who opened doors to people like me," he said.
"I was lucky to meet Richard Harris a few times.
He's my type of person, a great actor of his time, I'm really honored."
The independent film prizes, known as Bifas, are selected by a group of filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
Bifa supporters and sponsors include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
208 arrested in Saudi Arabia for a terrorist plot
Saudi Arabia discovered yesterday that it had captured 208 militants because of their belongings to cells that had planned a imminent attack on an oil plant as well as on clerics and security forces.
The state television of the world's largest oil exporter said that one of the cells had planned to smuggle rockets.
Sympathizers of Al-Qaeda have launched a campaign against the monarchy, which has been an ally of the United States since 2003, as a result of the invasion of Iraq.
A cell of eight militants, led by a foreign citizen, planned an attack on an oil plant in the eastern province, according to the television report.
Saudi Arabia has formed a 35,000 man strong fast intrusion force to protect plants after a failed Al Quaida attack on the world's largest oil processing plant in Abqaiq in 2006.
The report, referring to a Ministerial Declaration, says that 18 of the arrested were part of a cell led by a "missile expert" who illegally immigrated to the country.
He reported that the militants had planned to smuggle eight projectiles into the Kingdom.
According to the report, another 22 of the prisoners were planning to kill clerics and security forces.
The government has warned clergymen to do more to stop Saudis who are striving for Iraq to join Al Qaida militias who want to fight the Allied forces and the US-supported Shiite Muslim government, which is considered heretical by the hardliners among the Sunni Saudis.
Al Qaida militias consider many clergymen in Saudi Arabia to be in cooperation with the authorities in support of the policy of the royal family that dominates the government.
The militias - accompanied by calls from Osama bin Laden, the Al Qaida leader born in Saudi Arabia to target it on the pro-Western Saudi government - have reserved for foreign residential areas, government buildings and energy facilities.
"This was a very great effort by the security forces over the last... five months," a spokesperson from the Ministry of the Interior told the state television.
The arrests also involved a "media cell" of 16 from Medina, which aimed to promote "Takfiri thinking" - the ideology of radical Sunni Muslims who support violence against Muslims who are branded as unbelievers and apostates.
Among the arrested were also 32 people who were accused of providing financial support to the militia.
The climate on Venus could reveal a view of the future of the earth
Venus was perhaps a pleasant place to live, scientists said yesterday.
Data from a European spacecraft located on a orbit show that the planet is more like an averted twin of the earth than was previously known.
Venus is the nearest planetary neighbour of the earth.
The two worlds have about the same size and have similar planetary orbits, but the Venus of the Sun is somewhat closer.
Millions of years ago, Venus would have had conditions that were very similar to those on earth and could have been habitable, scientists believe today.
But because of the unbraked carbon dioxide greenhouse effect, the erosion of the atmosphere by solar radiation and a slower rotational rate, Venus took a completely different developmental course.
Today the planet is deprived of water and has a surface temperature that is hot enough to melt lead and is devastated by hurricane-strong winds and lightning storms.
The findings of the Venus Express space probe of the European Space Agency, which examined the plant for one year, provide a sobering look at how the earth could develop in the face of catastrophic climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor of the Physics Department at Oxford University, one of the leaders of the Venus Express Mission, said: "It becomes clear why the climate on Venus is so different from that on Earth, while the planets are quite similar otherwise."
"Our new data enable us to construct a scenario in which Venus began billions of years ago like Earth, possibly with a habitable environment."
"Enriched uranium" confiscated by the police
A kilo of radioactive material, reportedly enriched uranium, was seized yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police officer said that three people were arrested and that the material was being examined.
He did not confirm whether it was enriched uranium, but said it could have been sold for 1 million dollars (480,000 pounds).
All still open
With Romey said he did not consider it worthy of a presidential candidate to be questioned by a snowman.
Nevertheless, the Republican candidate finally declared himself ready for the Presidency to hold a debate on YouTube, record questions on video in normal voters and submit them to the candidate.
None of the questions raised on Wednesday evening, November 28, were as ridiculous as the snowman, who questioned the Democrats about global warming in the YouTube debate of the other party.
But the questions, and the answers, this time reflected exactly the state of the Republican party that is breaking into the elections next year.
It is not known, just like the producers of CNN who supported the debate with the selected YouTube clips to be shown to the upcoming candidates.
However, in the first half of the hour of the debate, the longest one devoted to a single subject, immigration was at the centre of the debate.
The topic is one of the most powerful subjects for Republicans.
The CNN asked a group of undecided voters to operate a dial when they heard things they liked: The TV station noticed tips of approval when the candidates spoke strictly across the borders.
The sharpest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, the national pioneer, and Romney, who moved forward in the decisive surveys in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani tries to shake off the reputation of being yielding to illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
He attacked Romney in accusing the former Governor of Massachusetts of hiring illegal immigrants for work at his house.
The two were particularly vehemently divided as questioning whether one of the candidates would support an "amnesty" (the illegals would give a regular status and the possibility of citizenship).
Minor candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a congressman from Colorado, managed to pick up on this topic.
None of the two men have serious chances at nomination, but they both stay in the race, perhaps because they have earlier and harder than others on the immigration pageant.
At least in the area of immigration, the candidates generally share the same views: tougher borders, intolerance towards illegal migrants.
This issue, together with fears about toxic toys from China or other concerns about the rest of the world, helps Republicans to forget or minimize the differences between liberals and Christian conservatives.
But the debate was clearly problematic when other issues were raised.
Mr Giuliani was asked why he had supported arms restrictions in the past.
John McCain and Romney discussed whether simulated drowning should be considered torture.
One of the questions asked whether the candidates believed every word of the Bible.
This led Giuliani to believe that although the Bible is his favorite book, he may not literally believe the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another questioner asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - contrary to all expectations in the first place in a recent survey in Iowa thanks to his long-standing Christian conservatism - said that the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When he was forced to support them, Jesus laughed at them and said that Jesus was too intelligent to apply for a political office.
The race remains exceptionally wide open.
Huckabee's rise in Iowa coincides with Ron Paul's recent donations and his applause storms in the debate of Wednesday.
These two have been shot out of nowhere, because the party's two wings have not yet been able to agree on one of the more well-known and traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate has united the party from the beginning and convincingly with a victorious message about the size of America and a winnowing on both wings of the party.
This time the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
Pain of the Labour Party
Gordon Brown has discovered another pit to fall in; his way out of it remains the same.
For British scandals this is not particularly slippery.
No noble titles seem to have been sold, no politicians paid Paris hotel bills, no extramarital toes have been sucked.
But the discovery that a wealthy businessman has spent more than 650,000 pounds (1.3 million dollars) for the British ruling Labour Party over four years under the name of other people, and that the party has failed to report this is something that the battled Gordon Brown would have done well.
When, two months ago, the Prime Minister withdrew the call for an election, in a foolish way insulting the British intelligence by claiming that polls had not influenced this decision, there was hope that he would offer a robust, efficient government.
Instead, as Vince Cable, the increasingly keen representative of the Liberal Democrats, expressed it, the once-feared Brown from Stalin to Mr Bean has developed.
The unskillful rescue of Northern Rock, a beaten bank, showed regulatory weakness and poor judgment under fire.
Badly thought-out proposals to amend tax laws have brought business associations against the government.
The loss of personal data by 25 million people by the tax authorities revealed unimaginable administrative fussiness.
A trio of retired generals started an uprising in the upper house from protesting against cuts in military spending: being a minister of the armed forces, they claimed, is a part-time job.
Now there are the various donations of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, Labour's Secretary General (and her former head of fulfillment) has already resigned.
None of this means that Brown is irrevocably on the way to resignation.
Nevertheless, governments can reach a turning point after which they feel it impossible to govern.
Neither do people like nor trust politicians, but they usually hold back their scepticism when a new force takes over the office.
Once it is clear that it is unlikely that a Prime Minister will improve the situation, and he does not even have to be there for long, this delay is over: the public service is starting to leak; the cabinet ministers are starting to chat; the press is looking for bad news; and the government is becoming defensive and aimless.
In a way, Brown's position is particularly difficult because, unlike other political leaders, he cannot claim to be a new broom.
As much as he'd like to deny Tony Blair, he was his lieutenant in charge.
The problems with Northern Rock and the tax jurisdiction documents, for example, are linked to decisions that Brown made as Chancellor of the Ministry of Finance.
And even if it was not directly involved in Blair's misdeeds - as in the long "money for noble titles" examination of political party financing - voters may assume that it was him.
Nevertheless, Brown's situation is not as bad as it looks.
The mistakes are not as terrible as the conservatives describe them.
As with Mr. Bean, no one died or was completely dizzy.
And the antidote, painful as it may be, is to deliver what Brown's naturally Stalinist tendencies have always promised: a reliable, solid and slightly brutal government.
The new opportunity for political donations is a good example.
The Garboeske of Abraham, who compares his donations with his charitable gifts, says he does not want public recognition for his goodwill.
That may be so, but the decision about it did not allow him.
The laws against anonymity for large political contributors are clear and exist for a clear reason: the public has a right to know who can buy access to those who govern the country.
Watt, who says he knew of Abraham's agreement, but not that it is illegal, will of course have to ask himself some questions; just like Jon Mendlesohn, Labour's chief financial operator, who was told about the strange donations in October.
But so far Brown is not involved: there is nothing to suggest that he knew about these confusions, although most of the payments were made after his takeover in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has done half of the work.
He quickly condemned the violation of the laws by his party, but he watered down this determination by grasping a well-known instrument, a committee of inquiry on the subject - to make the measure of a bishop retired and a judge.
In this case, the "teachings to be drawn out" are not very complicated.
If the law was broken, it's one thing for the police.
Apart from that, there are other things Mr Brown has to do, such as finding a permanent chairman for the independent committee on standards in public life, which has been unoccupied for six months, and progressing with a thorough reform of political party financing.
This would require the hardliners of the Labour to cooperate with the conservatives and possibly give up the special financial relationship with the trade unions - bitter pills for a party comrade like Mr Brown.
But he should be aware of some partial facts.
The conservatives now have a clear lead in the opinion polls; they have two years to win back voters; and the only way he can win is through irrefutable justice and solid competence.
Card sharks
Is the credit crisis in America's credit card market?
If blood is in the water, it is only natural that back fins are whirling around excitedly.
Now that America's real estate market is being molested, the robbers are facing the country's credit card market.
Analysts from Goldman Sachs expect credit card losses to reach $99 billion if the risk of infection from underfunded loans spreads to other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of the tension are clearly visible.
There are increases in both outflows and in borrowing rates, which measure the proportion of loans that are not recoverable or are too late for more than 30 days.
HSBC announced last month that it has taken a 1.4 billion dollar fee collection from its US consumer finance, partly due to the weakness of credit cardholders.
It's still too early to panic.
Losses and stitches are still low.
According to Moody's credit rating agency, the third-quarters parity rate of 3.89% was almost a full percentage point below the historical average.
The deterioration in the rates can partly be explained by technical factors.
A change in the US private insolvency laws in 2005 led to an abrupt case of bankruptcy claims, which in turn account for a large part of credit card losses; the number of applications (and thus default fees) would rise again, whether the general conditions for borrowers deteriorate or not.
Industry also reports solid payment rates that show how much of their debts consumers pay off every month
and confidence in credit card-based securities is quite strong, despite the standstill in other corners of structured finance.
Dennis Moroney of the TowerGroup, a research company, expects that the volume of output for 2007 will ultimately be 25% higher than last year.
There are certainly direct infection channels between the real estate credit crisis and the credit card market: it is more likely that consumers will incur credit card debts now that home loans are drying out.
However, card exhibitors look at the cash flow rather than capital values, so falling house prices do not necessarily trigger a change in the borrower's creditworthiness.
You can even be of benefit to card exhibitors.
Incentives for consumers to continue to pay mortgage rates fall if the real estate value is less than the value of the loan; as a result, card debt among the repayment priorities becomes more important.
Card exhibitors can also react much faster and more flexible than lenders to the more stormy conditions by changing interest rates or credit limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risk of a rapid revaluation of assets.
"We won't wake up one day and re-evaluate the loans completely," says Gary Perlin, Capital One's Chief Financial Officer.
Even if a sudden undercover crisis in the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of a sustainable downturn are much more real.
If lower house prices and a credit reduction push America into recession, industry will undoubtedly face a more grim future.
Keep an eye out for these shark fins.
British benches confess guilty in the case of Enron
Three British bankers who were to be tried for their role in the fraudulent system with Enron's former chief financier, Andrew Fastow, changed their application guilty on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew originally pleaded innocently for seven cases of fraud using telecommunications funds for alleged conspiracy with Fastow in a secret financial fraud in 2000 to enrich themselves at the expense of their employer.
The procedure had been initiated on January.
But during a hearing in court before U.S. district judge Ewing Werlein Junior, everyone pleaded for a case of fraud using telecommunications.
The three former leaders of Greenwich NatWest, a unit of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, became known in the UK during two years of extradition.
In the United States, their case is a loose end to an investigation launched after Enron's collapse in 2001.
The allegations originally filed against them in 2002 drew Fastow's attention to the fact that he was the target of a government investigation in connection with the Enron downturn.
The accusation against the bankers - called the "NatWest Three" - claims that they came to Houston in 2000 to evict a fraudulent plot with Fastow and his former top consultant Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of Enron, controlled by Fastow, the architect of countless fraudulent Enron mechanisms that helped to tear the company into bankruptcy.
At the beginning of 2002, the Bank had estimated its participation in the subsidiary to zero, but the three British men knew that it had real value.
A company under Kopper's control acquired the Bank's shares in the subsidiary for $1 million.
The bankers paid Kopper $250,000 for a stake in this company.
According to the charge, Fastow falsely advised Enron that the energy company would pay $20 million in Greenwich NatWest for its shares in the subsidiary.
But in fact, the $20 million went to the British bankers, Fastow and others.
The bankers received 7.3 million dollars, while Fastow, Kopper and others dropped about 12.3 million dollars, according to the charge.
In January 2004, Fastow became guilty in two counts of conspiracy for his role in Enron's breakup.
The British Trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is sentenced to six years in Louisiana Federal Prison.
Kopper is a three-year and one-month sentence in a Texarkana facility.
Each of the three men was on the loose on the basis of a 1 million dollar deposit that made it necessary for them to live in the United States in expectation of the trial.
Enron, once the nation's seventh-largest company, collapsed in bankruptcy in December 2001, after years of accounting tricks could no longer conceal billions of debt or make weaker businesses appear profitable.
The collapse destroyed thousands of jobs, more than 60 billion market values and more than two billion dollars of pension plans.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former chairman Jeffrey Skilling were sentenced last year for their roles in the Enron collapse.
Skilling is punishable for more than 24 years.
Lay's convictions for conspiracy, fraud and other charges were nullified after he died of heart disease last year.
Not at the bottom of Moscow
The price of a Gulfstream G550 aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and enough range to fly nonstop from Moscow to Los Angeles, is at least 54 million dollars.
But this is small money for some of the rich Russians.
"It can accommodate up to 18 passengers," said Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
"But none of you ask for so many seats because it is for a private family or a company president."
Firer was at the Gulfstreamstand last Friday at the Millionaires' Exhibition, a four-day orgy of displayed consumption, which was held in a shackled exhibition center on the outskirts of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury providers had built exhibition stands, hoping to interest new Russians in everything, from mahogany-balled yachts to diamond-coated car grills that would be suitable for 50 cents.
Firer carefully inspected a shiny orange Porsche at the next booth.
"That's a nice car, but it's small money compared to us," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private aircraft."
Heated by an oil boom, the Russian capital seems to be flooded with money like Dallas at his heydays.
"We went through the same phase in the 1890s when some Americans came to gigantic wealth and went to Europe in crowds where they were considered materialistic," said Marshall Goldman, a scientist at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
Like the Saudi Arab overflyers of the 1970s and the Japanese of the 1990s, the Russians appear to be the most visible liberal money publishers in the world.
The most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their share of the gold rush.
Elsewhere in Moscow this week, a conference of the luxury industry Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, the president of LVMH, has attracted to exchange ideas on how to sell high-priced goods on markets such as Russia.
(The conference is organized by The International Herald Tribune, which belongs to the New York Times Company.)
Russia has 53 billionaires, who have a total of 282 billion dollars, according to the Forbes list of the richest people.
In addition, 103,000 Russian millionaires belong to the second class, worth 670 billion dollars, according to a study on the development of private assets in the former Soviet Union, written by economic experts of the Centre for Economic and Financial Research, an expert body here.
(The World Bank says that in 2005 15.8 percent of Russians lived below the minimum of existence.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow - that's why we're all here," said Nicole Marais, a sales and marketing representative of David Morris, a London jeweler.
She had visited the fair for the first time together with the Russian dealer of the brand, the Soho Jewelry Group.
"The women are all exemplaryly cared for, and the men are all worth a fortune."
While walking through the halls on Sunday night in evening clothes, two real estate agents, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, call themselves and their clients millionaires.
"I looked at the cars and I tried to decide between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche," said Ms. Yumatova, who delivered the designer clothes she wore, like a red carpeted veteran with Joan Rivers.
The trade fair seemed primarily to be aimed at the new rich, the type of brand-conscious Russian buyers who would be willing to stand in storage for several hours to visit a sluggish warehouse, which indiscriminately put Cadillac Escalades, platinum pocket knife, Mövenpick ice cream, custom-made billiard tables, apartments in Dubai and Gund Teddy bears next to each other.
The public could buy tickets for 30 euros (44.57 dollars).
"The Russians are interested in learning which brand is the most expensive and best," said Mr. Gijrath, who sat patriotically at a booth by the Dutch porcelain manufacturer Royal Delft in front of a wall-sized imitation of a rembrandt image of hand-painted blue mosaic stones.
"Of course, Russians are more interested in Klimper-Klimper."
In fact, the dealers here say that the Russians with old money (10 to 15 years old according to Russian standards) have already moved from large-scale logos to the kind of sober brand with limited numbers that would not be marketed at a trade show.
Nevertheless, several thousand people, whether millionaires, envoys of millionaires or simply tourists, pushed through the halls every day.
And some of them bought.
On the first night of the show last Thursday, Roman Ershov, the general manager of King Koil beds here, said he had sold two 70,000 dollar mattress sets, made of silk, cashmere and cotton, with sewn gold thread.
Also in the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, a sales manager for A1 Moto, a company that has high-end cars with high-end alarm systems, said that his company sold the glaring orange Porsche for $10,000 to a Russian millionaire.
Until Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, a company that adapts luxury cars to customer wishes, said he had sold three auto-coolers for a Rolls-Royce Phantom, the same paired chain straps, for every $55,000.
He showed a reporter a car tire developed for a Russian casino owner, with spokes he had covered with colored Swarovski crystals, so it looked like a roulette.
The cost: $22,000 for a four-year replacement.
"The Russian millionaire, who wants to have ostrich leather wheels or a picture of his wife's face made of cubic zirconium, will not necessarily ride on these wheels," said Mr. Karapetian.
"He will keep it in his 30- or 40-car garage."
Even though many of his Russian customers are rich, Mr. Karapetian said that the phrase "Russian millionaires" would not express much exclusivity at the moment, given the rise in the local real estate prices.
"If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, they are probably already millionaires, at least on paper, if not in cash," he said.
"There are more of them than you believe."
Those who were not millionaires could at least pretend to be rich at a stand run by Alliance Continental, a Russian asset management company.
The company had set up four red telephone cells according to British model, which were stuffed with mountains of false million dollar bills.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing director, said his employees had printed 500,000 wrong banknotes for the Millionaires' Fair.
Passersby stopped to throw the money piles around, mobile phone photos, while leaning back in the midst of the reserve, having friends cut them off, or just to put in a few million.
"See, in Moscow everyone can feel like a millionaire," said Mr. Karryev.
Concealed operation suspected of fatality in New Jersey
It was the day before the harvest Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston saw through the large glass window of the Just a Little Healthier restaurant here and watched as an ambulance at the white Cape Cod held two doors down on West Scott Avenue.
Soon there was a police car there.
And then there was another one.
"Then I saw the cart of the medical bodyguard coming," said Livingston, a supervisor of the restaurant, on Wednesday.
"That was the point when I knew someone had died."
The authorities learned that the dead Ms. Olga Arroyo, 41, was an assistant to the director of the Newark Police Department.
Now the investigators are trying to determine whether she died from a procedure carried out by an unauthorised cosmetic surgeon who was not identified by the police and who worked in the house on West Scott Avenue 212.
The authorities have not yet determined what caused Mrs. Arroyo's death, and are hoping that toxicological investigations, the results of which could not be available for weeks, will help to clarify a mysterious death that has sent a grief through the lead of the Newark police.
Ms. Arroyo has been an assistant to the police director, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice was well known to many in the department.
"She was loyal, hardworking and stubborn," said Mr. McCarthy about Mrs. Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
"She was my Pitbull.
She protected me."
McCarthy said that Ms. Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer working for the alcohol control commission, leaving two sons, 14 and 11, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, a spokesperson for Union County Attorney Theodore J. Romankow, said that investigators would try to determine whether Arroyo died as a result of an unauthorized, surgical treatment.
"This is one of the possibilities," said Ms. Walsh.
"It's an ongoing investigation."
The authorities said they arrived at the house about 3 o'clock in the afternoon in November.
And they found Mrs. Arroyo on a sofa.
She was declared dead on the spot.
More than a week has passed and the authorities have reported little about their investigation or about the owner of the house, which is listed as Flor Margarita Castro.
Walsh didn't want to tell me if Ms. Castro was questioned by the authorities.
Investigators try to determine whether part of the house was used as a medical practice.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door to Mrs. Castro's house, where a fainted rose tree stands in the narrow courtyard and a Dalmatian calls behind the house.
A blue barrel labeled "Ethyl Vanillin" - used as a substitute for vanilla in food and perfumes - was sitting in the parking lot next to a door leading to the basement.
Two mountain bikes hung from hooks on one side.
McCarthy said that when he first arrived in Newark after spending 25 years with the New York Police Department, Ms. Arroyo was invaluable and helped him to find his way into the provincial and hard political culture in his new city.
"She said, 'You have to pay attention to this or that'," he said.
"She was always here when I got here and she was always here when I left.
It was embarrassing."
Hopes that the central bank will reduce interest rates will lead to an increase in world stock markets
The shares jumped on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday, after market hopes that the central bank will try to calm down the credit markets by further interest reductions, strengthened by gratifying comments from the vice president of the US Central Bank.
The stock markets rose in London, New York and across Europe, after Donald Kahn, number 2 of Ben Bernanke, president of the Central Bank, said that politics had to react "flexibly and pragmatically" to the continuing pressure on financial markets.
In a clear effort to calm turbulent markets, given signs of rising credit tensions, Kohn said that the recent turbulences had "partly reversed some of the improvements in market functions from late September and October".
If the increased turbulence persists, it would increase the possibility of further tightening the financial conditions for consumers and businesses, he said.
The comments were taken by investors as a signal that the central bank is ready to step in and stabilise the credit conditions with new capital injections into the US markets and possible further interest reductions.
The speeches also helped to calm down Wall Street in the face of further bad news from the US economy, now that sales of US real estate reached a new record depth in October.
The consequences of the financial turbulence were underlined by the announcement of Bear Stearns, the Investment Bank, that they would eliminate 650 jobs, or 4 percent of their global employees, in a cost reduction measure to offset severe losses from their lost bets in the US mortgage credit sector.
It is expected that only 20 of these jobs will disappear in London, where the bank employs 1,500 employees.
In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Index jumped by 331 points, or 2.55 percent to close at 13,289.40, while the wider S&P 500 index rose by 2.65 percent.
In London, the FTSE 100 index rose by 165.5 points, or 2.7 percent to close at 6,306.2, adding more than 39 billion pounds to the value of British standard values.
Germany's index Dax rose by 2.6 percent and France's CAC40 rose by 2.3 percent.
Previously, the re-emergence of credit pressure on the markets had been underlined after a significant 4.7% increase in demand for an auction of three-month guarantee funds from the European Central Bank granted to the European commercial banks, the highest rate since April 2001.
The pressure to follow the Bank of England, the US Central Bank and the European Central Bank and to feed additional capital into the money markets in London increased as the three-month "libor" rates of loan between UK banks rose by 6.59 percent to their highest since late September, after a continuous increase since 21 November.
England confronts with decision on the statements of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
Here two dilemmas, each of them almost as difficult as the other.
Who's going to beat number 6 for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, no less relevant in a broader context than the first test against Sri Lanka, who is to make the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the election chairman, is here on call at least under this special title, to help the chief coach Peter Moores and captain Michael Vaughan decide, and because the table of High Morries, the English managing director, gradually fills itself with applications for national electoral offices, if not even for those in part-time.
Whoever doesn't get the sixth bat position will be unhappy, but life is often unfair and sport is without a doubt.
It is never easy to nail exactly what allows a person to reach the tip of his profession, while someone else never gets beyond the lowest rank, sometimes out of lack of luck instead of ability.
It is not only in the cricket, where the selection is difficult, where judgments are necessary that are always subjective in the end.
Is it the right time for Bopara to get up?
Is it fair to Shah if he does?
The same might also be asked in another area, for example, whether John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, both intelligent young managers with good qualifications who know the business well, should be promoted.
Who can say what the right class is for a cricket player, unless he is given the opportunity to swim or go down.
Of course, figures have a major influence on decisions, but so do opportunities.
Within a team, a cricket player has to catch the captain's eye at the right time when he can take a wicket and a racket has to get regular chances in order if he wants to make an impression as a one-day cricket player.
Catching the eyes of the selectors is more complicated.
There were many who in the last season were better than, for example, James Anderson, who is apparently going to play in the first test, even if Stephen Harrison declared himself to be healthy and how the wind is pounding into the nets.
Anderson took 32 first-class Wickets with 33 runs each to earn a position on this tour.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 with the same modest average, but both had their highlights and hope for even more.
Whether Shah or Bopara play at the Asgiriya Stadium can only be a question of opinion.
The choice could determine the careers of both men, or it might make little difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka Gareth Batty played in every test and was successful in the first, with five wickets and 40 useful runs, but it was Paul Collingwood, at that time still struggling to consolidate himself, who made the breakthrough into a significant test cricket player and who, although he scored a double hundred against Australia in Australia, is still perhaps underrated.
It is likely that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores will follow their conservative instincts and gut feelings for Shah's greater experience of Bopara's youthful enthusiasm after a further discussion during today's network meeting at the Asgiriya Stadium.
There are arguments for both.
For Shah, his sparkling and valuable 88 test debut innings in Bombay, 43 first-class hundreds and only six of Bopara, who is seven years younger at 22 years of age, and an excellent balance against turned-on bullets.
But Shah made only ten runs in his two innings in May against West Indies in the test in Lord, his home arena as a player from Middlesex, and this, in addition to his immediate rejection from the voters as Vaughan was healthy in order to take back his position for the next game, seems to have taken the swing out of his stroke, which was still evident in Bombay.
In contrast, the all-rounder from Essex has great joy in life.
He was impressed by nothing in a cricket court and his attitude was brought to the point when he recently skipped a four-wheeled vehicle in an exhibition for England's sponsor Volkswagen.
He suffered minor injuries and probably a shock, but the first thing he did was to pick up his vodafone (of course also sponsored) and call his teammate Alastair Cook, who had observed this from afar, and say with enthusiasm, "Have you seen this?".
Bopara is a much better field player, he cones his mid-tempo with some effect here on the playing fields, which seems to fit him and beats with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right man is one thing to choose the right time for another.
Maybe this is the actual art of selection.
I tend to give Bopara his chance now, which doesn't mean that Shah might not be good enough, if, as the tea set from Ceylon suggests, he's the one who's going to play here this weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and to fight Al-Quaida
The first busloads of Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived yesterday in Baghdad with a stream of displaced persons whose funds or visas had expired, and others who hoped that the city would return to normality.
Some had even come back to fight the rebels they had driven out of their homes.
At Mansour Bus Station, before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus in an official government convoy of a dozen buses, the terminal was operational with refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned in private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria after they had killed many doctors in Baghdad," said Sabah Al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
"I came back today because of what I saw on television and what I read in the newspaper, about what happened in Baghdad, and how it would be safe now."
They say that the Mahdi army has ceased to kill people," he said, with regard to the Shiite militias of militant cleric Moqtada Al-Sadr, who has ordered his powers to be restored at this time.
Gassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shiite teacher from the predominantly Sunni part of Amariyah, returned with his two children because he could not renew his Syrian visa and because the Iraqi regime did not allow him to work.
His Shiite neighbors in Amariyah called him to tell him that a local militia supported by the United States helped to expel Al-Qaeda from her bastion in the west of the capital, and forced him to return.
One of the new arrivals from Jordan was the leader of a Sunni and Shiite tribe who had been driven out of his house in Sleigh in northern Baghdad by a hand grenade attack after he had asked his fellow citizens to fight Al-Qaedas.
He had come back to fight.
"Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they started an anti-Al-Qaeda militia in Sleigh and that they needed my support and that of my boys.
That's why I came back today," said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many told of their being lured by the increasing tranquillity in the capital since the U.S. military increase and the growth of local "groups affected" citizens, who armed and defended their neighborhood in cooperation with the U.S. military.
But more spoke of being forced home by visa problems and decommissioning funds in Damascus, to which over 1.3 million Iraqis have fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, a 51-year-old father three times, expressed the general suspicion among the exiles that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shiite Prime Minister, had asked the Syrian government to impose visa restrictions on refugees in order to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people have probably fled from the sectarian death squadrons in the country.
"We went well until al-Maliki visited Syria and the government forced the Iraqis no longer to give visas to force them to return to Iraq," said the Sunni pensioner.
"I can't trust a government that supports the criminals who burned down my house after I left."
Part of the reason for the decrease in violence is that Sunni were driven out of Shiite residential areas and vice versa, which led to the creation of many places where tensions have left behind.
There are fears that a sudden influx of refugees will rekindle sectarian tensions and conflicts.
Small Saarland, good education
The smallest federal state is a leader in vocational training and even shines with the international orientation of its universities.
Only in one field of education do the Saarland countries have the same deficit as the rest of the country.
"I declared to a non-Saar country for the 50th time yesterday that we are not French" - this slogan posters the smallest federal state for its 50th birthday.
France and Luxembourg play a major role in the education system of the Saarland, which is ranked fifth in the education monitoring of the Institute of German Economy Cologne (IW).
For example, universities already cooperate closely with neighbouring countries from tradition.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
To this day, students can complete their studies here with a double or even triple diploma.
Accordingly, the proportion of foreign students is 15.6 percent.
But also the country children bring the Saarland in above average numbers to the universities - many of them without a degree in high school.
"The vocational education system is being used in Saarland," says Axel Plünnecke, IW's educational expert.
More than every five young people acquire their right to study at a vocational school, so the Saarland is more than seven percentage points above the federal average.
The combined possibilities of vocational and academic training are also relatively wide-ranging.
As measured by the population, the equipment with dual degree programmes is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical training and increasing demand, however, the number of engineering graduates has fallen by one third in recent years.
That is why the Saarland Ministry of Education has now committed the universities to a marketing campaign for engineering subjects.
"After the first Pisa study, we started a number of reforms in general schools," says a spokesperson from the Ministry of Education.
Thus, the government introduced nationwide comparative tests.
In order for the children to start learning earlier, the last Kita year is free of charge - a model that now also copies other federal states.
Whether pupils' performance improves sustainably will only show future comparative studies.
At Pisa in 2003, the proportion of risk students decreased from 29 to 20 percent.
In total, however, the Saarland did not increase as much as other federal states.
Bayern's better off.
And to the detriment of the Saarlanders, foreign language skills are not measured at Pisa - otherwise you could score in this area.
For the language of the neighbours is compulsory in high school - even if the Saarlanders are not French.
Chávez transforms the watches
In Venezuela, the clocks will soon tick differently from the rest of the world.
On 9 December President Hugo Chávez will have the timepieces returned by half an hour in the South American country.
In Spain Chávez now becomes a joke figure.
As the Official Journal of Venezuela announced, according to a new law, clocks on world times are set at minus four and a half hours.
This gives the South American state a time zone that does not exist in any other country in the world.
The U.S. enemy Chávez justified his decision, among other things, that the United States of the world had imposed the division into time zones to full hours.
In addition, Chávez announced the termination of relations with neighbouring Colombia on Wednesday (local time) due to a hostage affair.
The Left Nationalist said that as long as the conservative Alvaro Uribe President of Colombia remained, he would not have relations with the Heads of State or with the Colombian government.
"I cannot do this alone because of my dignity," said Chávez, who is driving forward a constitutional reform on which the citizens of Ellande must vote in a referendum on Sunday.
With the reform he would clearly expand his power in the country.
The reason for the dispute was Uribes' decision to withdraw Chávez's mandate for negotiations with Marxist rebels in Colombia, which involved the release of hostages.
Uribe "sucked Venezuela's face" with his decision, Chávez criticized on Sunday.
In Spain, too, Chávez is in every mouth.
A new mobile phone ringing in the country makes for anxiety: "Por qué no te callas" (why don't you keep your mouth shut) is the sentence that has already downloaded more than half a million people from the Internet.
Spain's King Juan Carlos spoke to him, who was annoyed at the recent Ibero-America Summit by the constant intervocations of the left-wing populist and had crossed his mouth.
Germans threaten 2007 Lohnminus
Despite the strong economic situation, German workers are forecast to lose real wages this year.
Experts called a whole bunch of reasons for their pessimistic prognosis.
According to a calculation by the Hans-Böckler Foundation, employees could actually expect less in the salary account in 2007 than in the previous year.
"This is due to the modest wage development, the increase in VAT and the price shift in food and energy," said Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomics and Economic Research of the "Picture" newspaper.
New burdens could also be imposed on workers in unemployment insurance.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück said the "New Osnabrücker Zeitung", the planned reduction of unemployment insurance to 3.3 percent to the turn of the year is true and reasonable in the current situation.
However, the Federal Employment Agency should not be embarrassed to ask for loans or grants at the federal government, the SPD politician was quoted.
On Tuesday it was announced that the price explosion in food and oil products has driven inflation to the highest level for 13 years.
Overall, prices rose by 3.0 per cent in the year.
Venus is the hellish twin of the earth
Venus, despite its anti-lifelike atmosphere on earth, is more similar to that previously thought: the European space probe "Venus Express" has discovered lightning in the atmosphere and wind whirlwinds on the Poles, as they also occur on earth in winter.
For almost three decades, scientists have suspected that Venus is flashing.
Now the European probe "Venus Express" has provided evidence - it detected electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere: The flashes on Venus shoot at an altitude of about 56 kilometers from cloud to cloud, reports Christopher Russel from the University of California in Los Angeles in the science magazine "Nature".
According to the famous "Ursuppen theory", lightning has created life on earth: thunderstorms are said to have triggered reactions in the ocean that led to the formation of amino acids, the building blocks of life.
Not so on Venus: "If there was ever life there, it must have been in the very early history," explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
Today, there is hardly anything alive on the surface of Venus: the atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on earth, it sometimes has temperatures of 500 degrees.
"Venus may be the devil twin of the earth, but it is a twin," said Russel.
Why the Venus, which is so similar to the Earth in mass and size, has taken on such a completely different development, is the fundamental question of the Esa mission.
The launch of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was a milestone in Venus research, as since the early 1990s no longer had a probe specifically on the way to exploring this planet.
According to the researchers, the latest research results, which are now presented in several "nature" articles, underline not only the uniqueness of Venus within the solar system.
"They also show that the fellowships of our neighboring planet with the earth are greater than initially assumed," the Esa announces.
In addition to the already known whirlwind at the North Pole, the researchers also found a cloud strudel at the South Pole, which rotates much faster.
The phenomenon reminds of air currents on the earthly winter hemisphere, writes a research team around Giuseppe Piccioni from the Italian Istituto di Astrofisica Spatiale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second inner planet of the solar system has almost the same mass as the earth and is almost the same size with a diameter of 12,100 kilometers.
The planet, also known as morning or evening star, orbits around the sun in just under 225 days.
But it turns much slower about itself: a Venus Day takes 243 Earth days.
Although Venus is hardly reminiscent of the Earth with surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar, scientists assume that both planets have developed under very similar conditions.
Both gathered water that remained on earth in oceans but on which Venus was lost into space.
And while carbon dioxide is fixed on the earth in carbonate stones, it makes up most of the atmosphere on Venus.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama
Federal President Köhler demands an end to the party dispute over the reception of the Dalai Lama at the chancellor's office.
Indirectly, he criticized the SPD for their attacks on the chancellor after the September meeting.
Federal President Horst Köhler is concerned about Germany's reputation and has asked the great coalition to end the dispute over the reception of the Dalai Lama.
"We should not present a divided nation to the outside world on this issue," said Köhler to the Handelsblatt.
At the same time, Köhler signaled an understanding of the reception of the Dalai Lama by Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
"Human rights have universal validity for me, even if I respect the diversity of cultures," said Köhler.
Everyone knew that Germany had to maintain sensitive balances in foreign policy, the Federal President stressed, but Merkel took protection from the accusation, she pursued a new Chinese policy.
"The Federal Chancellor has not distanced herself from traditional one-China policy.
China knows that too," said Köhler.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) had indirectly expressed dismay at the reception of the Dalai Lama and had therefore been attacked from the ranks of the Union.
Among other things, Steinmeier had complained about the Union's "window policy" in foreign policy.
After receiving the Dalai Lamas at the chancellor's office, there were severe irritations in the German-Chinese relationship.
The Chinese leadership not only invited the German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but also frozen the so-called strategic dialogue between the foreign ministries of both countries, according to information provided by the SPIEGEL.
China's head of government Wen Jiabao has now called on Chancellor Angela Merkel to admit the Dalai Lamas as a mistake.
China rejects it when European politicians officially receive the religious leaders of the Tibetans, Wen Jiabao confirmed the Chinese position.
The actions and words of the Dalai Lama showed that he was trying to divide Tibet and the other Tibetan region, which includes other present provinces, from China.
Schäuble warns against wrecks as in France
Street battles with the police, shots, burning cars: Wolfgang Schäuble warns against riots as in France.
Everything had to be done to prevent social dissatisfaction in Germany from being unleashed in violence on the streets, the Federal Minister for the Interior demanded.
Barricades burned, Randalierers shot at the police with slag flints: Federal Minister of the Interior Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) in Germany fears a similar development after the severe youth riots in France.
"We need to make sure that we do not build up social explosives and discharge them into violence.
We have to take this seriously," he said to the "New Press" appearing in Hanover.
Not every young person can cope with the rapid change of social reality.
Federal, Länder and municipalities have already worked hard to reduce problems, said Schäuble.
This is not only about the integration of migrants.
"From the integration summit to the Islam conference, this already shows first successes."
However, it is too early for warning.
Schäuble also pointed out that in German suburbs there are no urban and sociological problems as in France.
In the northern suburbs of Paris, young people had given themselves heavy street battles with the police over the past few nights.
Cars and public buildings were also burned in Toulouse.
However, the chairman of the Turkish community in Germany, Kenan Kolat, demanded greater integration efforts by the Federal Government.
In the face of the crash in France, Kolat warned against "imitation effects".
The situation in Germany was not as fragile as in France.
But there is still a need for action.
Kolat pointed out that the unemployment rate among young people with a migrant background under 25 was "over-average".
More training places should be provided in particular.
Kolat stressed: "We must give young people a perspective."
The chairman of the Turkish community, however, added that in Germany, more than in France, "social control in the families takes place".
Moreover, many young people with a migrant background did not want to destroy what their parents built here.
Kolat warned, "But we still have to watch out."
Young people should be given a "fast opportunity to participate in work and training".
Meanwhile, it remained largely quiet during the night in the Paris suburb of Villiers-le-Bel.
Hundreds of police were in use, a helicopter flew over the area with headlights.
The competent authorities reported three arrests as well as a few burning garbage bins and cars.
Since the day before, an offer of about 1000 security forces has provided peace and quiet.
The police would go through as long as it was necessary, Internal Affairs Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie announced after a visit to the suburb.
On the night of Tuesday, about 80 policemen had been injured in riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
In the following eight the riots took over Toulouse.
The wrecks were inflamed by a traffic accident in which two young people had died on Sunday.
The police are not to blame for the death of the young people, after the initial findings of the Procuratorate.
In the Kingdom of Angela Cloud
The chancellor's realism shows that the coalition is at the end of the story - and that nothing can be expected of her.
Which country does this Chancellor actually live in?
After her restless appearance in the general debate of the Bundestag, which was literal and poor in content, one has to say: not here - not in the country which should finally be ruled by her.
Angela Merkel has rejected the allegation that she is too focused on foreign policy with an evilly high rate.
That was provincial, she said, and only showed that she did not want to understand what the critics were about.
In the Bundestag it has clearly documented to everyone how much their accusation is true.
There was neither concrete interest nor any feeling of feeling for the problems in the country.
Instead, Angela Wolke presented herself: an evicted politician who flees into foreign policy and remains in the immediate vicinity.
For example, climate protection: it praises the decisions of Heiligendamm, but does not say how the climate goals are to be achieved here.
At all, the self-loathing - so much in modesty the CDU chief would have failed two years ago.
Now she clings to the flosses that the upswing is coming to the people.
It thus damages her image as a pragmatist who solves problems instead of beautifully addressing the world.
But in the realm of Angela Cloud, domestic political problems are a marginal phenomenon.
Child poverty and the worries of the lowly earners?
She's got a few extras left.
It is significant how often it promises when it comes to child labour.
Three calls need Merkel to bring out a half-way straight set.
It stumbles like on a strange terrain when it becomes concrete.
Attack Division
In the YouTube debate of the Republican presidential candidates, the two favorites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney are making a hard exchange - and now have to fear an outside candidate.
The suspense of the candidates is already revealed on the first topic.
He has made New York a "place of refuge for illegal immigrants", Mitt Romney accuses his opponent Rudy Giuliani.
This one counters with serious accusations: "I would say that his own house was a port of illegality," said Giuliani and accuses the former Governor of Massachusetts of having employed private immigrants without papers.
The candidates are blaming the attack: because the Republican base still has no clear favorite, the eight presidential candidates use the debate on CNN above all to discredit their opponents.
The self-filmed 30-second videos that Internet users have sent via YouTube are hardly more than the key words.
"With this kind of isolationism, we let Hitler come to power," John McCain accuses his opponent Ron Paul, who as the only one in the round demands an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney is also strongly read by the Vietnam veteran when he refuses to condemn the so-called "waterboarding", a method of interrogation in which drowning is simulated as torture.
However, the reactions of the audience in St. Petersburg, Florida, show that the important issues of the campaign are now beyond Iraq's war and torture debates.
Whenever conservative values are priced and future tax increases are rejected, the auditorium has a positive opinion.
This shows once again where the weaknesses of the two favorites lie.
"I was wrong at the time," explains Romney, squeaking and turning down the basics and the television audience to say that he was still one of the abortion advocates in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, comes to the fore when he is asked, in his opinion, about the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf reigns in civil for the first time
One day after his resignation as army chief, the Pakistani ruler Musharraf was sworn as president.
This means eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf was sworn on Thursday for another five-year term of office.
Pakistani television passed the ceremony in the presidential palace of the capital Islamabad live.
Musharraf vowed to observe the Constitution and to act for the good of the nation.
On Wednesday, he had handed over his position as army chief to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani and thus bowed down to international pressure, especially from the United States.
Eight years after his seizure of power in an unbloody military coup, the former general is now ruling for the first time as a civilian head of state.
With his resignation as Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, Musharraf had fulfilled a core demand of the opposition and the West.
Another central demand is an end to the state of emergency imposed by Musharraf on 3 November.
Soon after his defense, Musharraf will, according to Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, lift the state of emergency and thus meet another demand from the West.
The Supreme Court of the country, which Musharraf had occupied with him after the imposition of the state of emergency at the beginning of November, had rejected all opposition to the controversial re-election of the Head of State on 6 October last week.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed in the northern tribal region of North-Waziristan in an attack on a military convoy and four more injured.
According to an army spokesman, the bomb exploded on a street near the border with Afghanistan.
The Fathers of Krautrock Return
Germany's supergroup of the Seventies is musicing again: The three band members of Harmonia once again took up their consoles at a concert in Berlin.
==References====External links==* Official website
Already back then they were much more famous abroad.
The special sensation then occurs in the form of three set men at the evening table.
Everyone has his box in front of him, his cables and, above all, his buttons.
Dieter Moebius thrones in the flowery white shirt at 63 years in the middle.
Left flanked by Michael Rother, 57 years young and owned by laptop and guitar.
On the right, viewed from the auditorium, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73, focuses on the console.
Everyone adds noise, sometimes even a beat.
And sometimes it adds itself accidentally to a traditional piece of music.
This does not seem to disturb the gentlemen themselves.
That the band Harmonia re-musics has caused some excitement among Krautrock lovers.
In which one can reveal here: Targeted demand revealed that the name was perplexed by the collective pop memory, but by no means so sustainable as to miss this band painfully for 32 years.
But why should the Germans not also celebrate his living legends from the seventies?
Especially what is called misleading herb skirt, was always more common in England and America than in their own country.
When the music industry awarded the Echo Prize for Life's Work to the survivors of the Kölner Group Can in 2003, it was seen in the hall in questioning German pop faces.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers also thanked the bands La Düsseldorf and Neu! in the Laudatio, the amazement knew no bounds.
Michael Rother later rocked on stage at the Red Hot Chili Peppers like an old buddy.
The problem of ignorance at home and the transfiguration in the foreigner is one.
The memory is already overwhelmed with harmony, because the trio existed only two years and during this time also developed a much smaller power of effect than was subsequently assigned to them by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had already performed with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the promising name Cluster.
First, they played in the basement under the Berliner Schaubühne.
Afterwards in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons, for a record label maintained by the church.
Rother had briefly helped out at Kraftwerk and then performed a reputation as a guitarist at Neu!, perhaps perhaps the most radical German group at that time.
In 1973, however, Rother followed the cluster musicians in exile to Forst in Weserbergland.
There, in the Old Weserhof, a ruins from the 16th century, they lived as city refugees.
Less ideological than in the municipality of I, where Roedelius was still allowed to plague himself as a nanny.
It's more like a great artist's life.
It is claimed that a whisper of the Harmonia Ottenstein singing club and a name for art were also found in the prison waste.
Some of them held Harmony.
The first album was called "Music of Harmonia" and the following "De Luxe".
Because the music sounded so quiet and modest, the band suffered material distress.
The gathering of rice did not serve the sole purpose of self-finding.
The now released CD "Live 1974" was recorded at a concert in Griessem, in front of a nearly 50-member record scene, as someone thinks they are.
From Rother came the desire to force Harmonia and practice occasionally.
For Roedelius and Moebius an immoral claim.
The band declared its separation in 1975.
Rother landed in the Esoteric-Spherical and secured his existence with albums like "Flaming Hearts".
Cluster was revived in the 1980s and has since been more successful than Harmonia ever was.
The Griessemer live album is due to Herbert Grönemeyer.
Its record company Greenland has set itself the goal of maintaining Krautrock as its original German contribution to living music.
New! was already excavated like Roedelius Solowerk.
The physical resurrection of Harmonia takes place in the Berlin House of World Cultures.
Publicly subsidised, within the framework of the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope is there, the British, Altpunk and author of the manual "Krautrock Sampler".
There's also the Loveparade inventor Dr. Motte.
This would outline the entire range of influences of the herb rock on the following pop music.
Harmonia fills the space of the supergroup.
The sentence of Brian Eno floats with the most extraordinary sounds in the hall: "The only true music, you belong to the future."
There are pictures that show the producer with harmony in the farmer's room.
Legend design serves projections of other black and white photos of our wired devices.
Before that, the three veterans are again concerned with improvisation.
No more by attaching microphones to the organ and to the drums to unleash unheard-of sounds to the instruments via self-contained effects devices.
Today electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three in the Technically In-depth Tuftler.
The choir of the house doesn't change that either.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, sound clouds are coughed and whispered and sung in a beautiful place with an emphase "Aaaaaaaaah!".
Krautrock was always a very English term.
It was never about rock.
The roots were searched for less in the blues than in music colleges (can), technologies (power) or on the run from artistic and social conventions (cluster).
Whoever calls here "'68!" is not quite wrong, and Harmonia is not going to be able to get away with it even now.
Still the most obvious thing is thoroughly considered on stage.
Where does music start and when does it stop?
This can rob you of nerves or give you fleeting moments of great happiness.
Richard Gere is just not cynical enough
"The Hunting Party" and "Murdererische Frieden" are once again dealing with two films of the Balkans war.
But both do not convince.
Either the concepts rely too much on action and baller or they are too touchy.
Richard Gere won't be able to help in "The Hunting Party".
The good news first: While the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, but calculated there, in the dark hinterland of the Bosnia war, the actor Richard Gere has now been found.
We had lost sight of the most beautiful man in the 1980s, because too many nice-interested roles in well-being films for women and too many press conferences on Buddhism gave one a desire to look forward to.
Now Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument, "The Hunting Party - When the Hunter Becomes a Hunter" (why do film titles have to be as long and turbulent as locomotive pricing contracts today?) perhaps.
He provides a wonderful eye-warning presentation: Basically, his war reporter Simon Hunt is what could have been made of Gere if fate and the film industry were not so gracious: a man who has his very best times behind him for a long time, but who has preserved even as a ruinous monument of his decline considerable remnants of the former charm.
But despite this trump, "The Hunting Party" together with the German production "Murdererische Frieden", which also starts this week, only continues the endless series of failed Balkan war films.
With "Murdererische Frieden" one can make a short process: The film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who save a Serbin from Kosovar hectic shooters, which one immediately falls in love with them.
Although it is welcome that not even the Serbs are represented here as the sole root of all evils, the TV flat film loses itself too quickly in Geballer and Action.
There remains a kind of "alarm for Cobra 11" without highway but with war for it.
On the other hand, "The Hunting Party" is an example of why there has never been a really good Balkan war film.
The story of three U.S. war reporters opening up to track down the Serbian war criminal "the fox" might have become a new "Apocalypse Now" with another director and another screenwriter (both in the personal union Richard Shepard) at another time.
Because the stories are very similar: both times small teams go into the forest to accomplish something the military can't do and both times it becomes a journey in madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is that Simon Hunt is not simply allowed to be the descended cynic with heart as he is introduced to us at the beginning.
On top of that, the script still has to make him a romantic affair with a later murdered Muslim Bosnian.
Finally, "The Hunting Party" goes down the stream if the reporters succeed in the past five minutes in the time-lapse process, what NATO, the CIA and all the money hunters in the world did not succeed in five years: catch the war criminal and leave the Muslim Bosnians to a just revenge.
This is so bad that you want to call the International Court of Justice in The Hague for crimes against cinema.
The film has a deeply human concern.
He wants to challenge that Karadzic and Mladic are still running around freely, and he suspects that the Americans and the French (here they should exceptionally agree) are not too intensely pursuing the persecution due to secret political arrangements.
But the good mean and the evil are sometimes so similar that a famous Brecht poem comes to mind.
It says about the wooden mask of an Asian demon on the poet's work table: "I see with compassion the swollen bulls, meaning how strenuous it is to be evil."
Movies such as "The Hunting Party" have exactly such swelling heads, but they indicate how strenuous it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the genre of the Balkan war film.
Recently reported in this newspaper that all of Iraq's films were Hollywood's big flop.
You can add: There has never been a good South Africa movie.
Almost always applies: If a star is drifting around the world's crisis herds or minefields, something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arquette, "Over all borders" with Angelina Jolie or "Blood Diamonds" comes out with Leonardo DiCaprio.
Perhaps all the conflicts are simply too close in time.
After all, it had to pass decades before Hollywood was able to make a good film about the Holocaust with "Schindler's List".
Some films are likely to mature - the Vietnam works "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jacket" that are now classics have not been celebrated in any way as masterpieces at the time.
But perhaps we know today, where every real-time mass murder comes home on two screens, even too much about the world's conflicts.
And that robs the screenwriters of the carelessness it needs to tell good stories.
"His or nothingness" or "The Great dictator" have finally become so good because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not yet know how bad the Nazi regime really was.
Maybe you can't want to be good if you want to make good movies.
Maybe you have to have the sarcasticly distanced artist's view of the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about parallels between his historical novel "Lemprière's Dictionary" and the Balkans war, he replied: "That's just because some things never change.
Large cities will always be terribly dangerous, people will always be murdered in a cruel way and war will always prevail in Yugoslavia."
By Beust reaps criticism for Olympia-Absage
The removal of the mayor from Hamburg's application for Summer Olympics has been a major criticism of politics and economy.
Many want to continue fighting for the games on the water.
But by Beust, realism encourages the assessment of opportunities.
On Wednesday, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, Chief Executive of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, referred to a waiver as "not good for the business location".
No other project has recently developed as much motivation in the city as the Olympic idea.
"Without this goal, the motion of sport policy could not be maintained to the same extent."
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to bury the project but to find a new long-term approach to "an altered time beam".
Mayor Ole von Beust remained on Wednesday with earlier statements that Hamburg's Olympic ambitions were unrealistic at least until 2028.
"Not Hamburg decides on an Olympic application, but the German Olympic Sports League," said Beust WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the decision of the Sports Federation on an application for the 2018 Winter Games, expected for the beginning of December.
"This preference means to us that we will not have any realistic opportunities in the period we have planned until 2028."
Nevertheless, the dream was not dreaming for all time, said Beust.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) regretted the statements made by Beusts.
This gives the impression that Hamburg no longer wants to apply for Olympic Games in the next 25 years.
"It is too early to build a chance by burying the plans already at this time," said HSB President Günter Ploß on Wednesday.
A waiver of the application is also in contradiction to the statement made by the Head of Senate on the occasion of a reception at the General Assembly of the General German University Sports Association.
There by Beust, Hamburg's application for the Universiade 2015 called "not a substitute" for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The University Sports Association had only nominated Hamburg as a candidate city last week.
The SPD Citizenship Group accused the Senate of not using valuable time for housing construction in Hamburg.
"The development of the Small Grassbrook has been delayed by the Senate for years because it has put on the map Olympia and ruled out housing," said SPD members Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD had always demanded integrated planning for Olympia and later residential use for the Little Grassbrook, the CDU had set one-sidedly on the "Event Factor".
The application for the 2012 Summer Olympics in Hamburg had given rise to a great deal of enthusiasm at the time.
Hamburg, however, failed at Leipzig.
That's not Warhol's box.
Those who connect the terms Sweden and wooden box think of Ikea, but not of Andy Warhol.
Isn't that right?
Currently, wooden boxes made in Sweden cast dark shadows on Warhol's catalogue of works.
Most of the twenty-four brollo boxes of "type Stockholm" listed there are forgery.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" had some months ago cast doubt on the authenticity of Andy Warhol's Brillo boxes in 1968, internal research at Moderna Museet in Stockholm has now reached a sobering conclusion: The six "Brillo boxes", which the former museum director Pontus Hultén has given to Moderna Museet in 1995, are copies - and probably the majority of the approximately one hundred other Brillo boxes from the "Type Stockholm", which are in circulation on the international art market.
The prehistory is shattered, a confusing chain of artistic and curatorial productions.
In 1964 Warhol created his first "Brillo-Boxes", painted wooden boxes based on the red-blue-white design of the cardboard box of the "Brillo" soap powder.
An exhibition of his works at the Moderna Museet 1968, with Warhol's consent, produced hundreds of Brillo boxes from cardboard: These were not from Warhol (for cost reasons) but were delivered directly from the Brillo cardboard factory.
It was not about works of art, but about their role models, just exhibition pieces.
At the same time, in 1968, Warhol probably granted permission to produce a few Brillo wooden caskets in Sweden, which were not exhibited in Moderna Museet.
Contemporary witnesses are now talking about about about fifteen crates, which were then properly introduced into the art and auction history as authorized original Andy-Warhol-Brillo boxes called "Type Stockholm".
Some of them have achieved more than $100,000 at auctions.
The problem now is that the legendary museum director Pontus Hultén later falsely claimed that it had been produced and exhibited in Sweden in 1968, which Warhol had then left to him.
In fact, Hultén's 105 crates were only produced in Malmö in 1990 for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
At that time Warhol had been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, Chief Conservator at Moderna Museet, has also examined three of the Swedish private property in addition to the six museum's own Brillo-Boxes, two of which were manufactured in Stockholm in 1968: their press panel was first founded and smeared, then white oil paint was applied with a brush.
The structure of the 1990 copies, on the other hand, reveals that the paint was applied directly to the press panel without a primer roll - and this is not about oil, but about acrylic paint.
"These crates were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol's Brillo-Boxes," says the director of Moderna Museet, Lars Nittve, saying: "If the Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board in New York does not reach a different conclusion, the Moderna Museet will classify the six crates in its collection as copies/exhibition material."
In July, the Authentication Board announced that it would investigate the "heavy accusations" raised in the case of soap powder boxes.
But since then one has covered himself there in inexorable silence.
Rebellious soldiers in Manila give up
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers have given up hiding in a hotel in Manila demanding the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
He could not be responsible for bloodshed, said the leader of Antonio Trillanes, who accused the president of corruption and electoral fraud, reporters in the hotel.
Government-faithful soldiers had previously stormed the hotel under tear gas.
The approximately two dozen soldiers had been hiding in the building for hours.
About half of them went to court on Thursday for a failed coup attempt in 2003 - among them Trillanes.
He used the trial to suddenly settle down with about 30 sympathizers.
The military police who were supposed to guard him had apparently crossed over to him and joined his mutiny.
They entered the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Loyal government troops blocked the district around the main hotel.
The President convened an urgent meeting of the Security Cabinet.
The National Security Advisor Norberto Gonzales condemned the action of the soldiers.
"People have enough," said Trillanes.
"We call on the people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, who previously commanded the elite unit of the Scout Rangers, said that other army units wanted to join the march shortly.
Government critics had called for large demonstrations against the President for Friday.
Their government has been overshadowed by corruption allegations for months.
Manila's financial district was already in 2003 the main scene of attempted mutiny by about 200 military members against Arroyo.
The insurrection failed after almost 24 hours of the army's refusal to join.
Since 1986, there have been at least seven attempts at coup d'état against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.
United Internet becomes major shareholder at Versatel
United Internet has secured a share of more than 20 percent in the telecommunications company Versatel.
The average price per share is EUR 14.46, as the company announced on Wednesday evening.
It now holds 20.05 percent of the share capital.
A takeover had previously been speculated on.
The option was left open to increase the share of Versatel.
With this step, the aim is to further the consolidation of the German DSL market, United Internet announced.
Before that, on Wednesday, there had already been suspicions of a start, after the Berenberg Bank increased its participation in the Düsseldorf network operator by a further 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
The money house thought the shares were only for a third party, it said in the financial market.
On the day before, United Internet had already participated in the Drillisch mobile company with almost 10 percent.
As part of a capital increase, Drillisch has placed 17.4 million new shares in the value of 106.4 million euros.
5.15 million shares of which United Internet has bought for 31.4 million euros.
In addition, the companies started discussions on marketing cooperations for DSL and mobile products.
"We strengthen our partnership," explained a United-Internet spokesperson.
The two companies set up the joint venture MSP to take over the competitor Freenet.
For the time being, the two companies want to be satisfied with a good ten percent share in Freenet and not make use of their right to acquire another 18.49 percent in Freenet, United Internet announced on Thursday.
However, the two companies remained open to all options, in particular to further increase their participation in Freenet AG.
Discussions between the United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership had ended in mid-November.
The persistent and difficult to see poker around Freenet for months is part of the consolidation of the German telecom market.
At the end of the third quarter, Freenet had 2.9 million mobile customers and 1.27 million DSL and full connection customers.
So far, United Internet and Drillisch holding held 6.01 percent of the freenet shares.
Now it has been agreed that Drillisch will bring in another around four percent.
The right to buy the 18.49 percent from the investment company Vatas had already been agreed in August.
