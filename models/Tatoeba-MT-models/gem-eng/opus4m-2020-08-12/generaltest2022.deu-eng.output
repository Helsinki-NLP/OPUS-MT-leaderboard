The goods cost less than 20 euros.
The fee corresponds to 40% of the value of goods....
I'm #PRS_ORG# a major client and so it's not a problem for me.
Just need a number or instruction that I should attach to the package so that it can be tracked by you as a return.
I ordered the #PRS_ORG# for 249€ a few days ago.
Today it costs 179€.
To be honest, I find that very annoying.
Do I have to cancel the order and order again for the better price or is there any other possibility of credit?
In principle, I also think that children should not be allowed to take on a parent role for their little siblings.
However, I think it is also good for big siblings to take care of the little ones in moderation.
Let's take a look, let's help out, let's bring the bottle, etc.
So they learn responsibility, help in the family and are involved.
As long as they can still be enough children, I don't see a problem.
If your K1 is working alone for a short time and it's OK for him, that's good.
You can best judge for yourself whether this is suitable for your children.
It is not the case that he should wrap K2 and accompany him to sleep for hours.
It is probably questionable purely by law.
Perhaps the psychologist's statement comes as well.
Because if something should actually happen like a fire, burglary, earthquake, alien invasion etc., it would actually be too much responsibility for K1, to take care of K2.
Whether this is a risk you want to take is of course your discretion ;)
Please help me find the title of a book again!
I remember reading a crime / thriller a few years ago and I can still remember almost the whole story, but I don't want to think about the title partout any more. Maybe someone here knows...
The story was about fear and treating it.
At the beginning of history, an animal nurse commits suicide by spilling his food and going to his predatory cats.
The case is taken over by a Commissioner who, after a brief investigation of his therapists, is the one running a clinic where he treats anxiety patients.
The Commissioner has a small niece who also has a fear (of fire) and lands with this therapist.
There is more suicide and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is anonymously commissioned to go to the place of suicide and document and put the photos into the internet before each suicide.
In any case, it turns out that this therapist conducts a kind of underground therapy group where the patient is transplanted a chip which is suppressed in the brain a anxiety center and ultimately puts the patients in the most extreme way of their anxiety.
(a woman jumps out of the window another one will drive herself to death)
This fear is called "the fight" in the book.
In the end there is a big showdown in the clinic that had to do with a fire.
That's the rough story I'm pretty sure that the book was written in the original by a French author.
If this story is known to someone or even someone can tell me the title of the book, I would be very happy.
Oh ever, I don't have the password available for Wlan.
I need to contact my husband first.
But that can take time.
What steps do I have to take after that?
Is it also possible to get the price difference refunded ?
Child, 4 j., splitter under the thumbnail
Child, four years old, has over the entire length wood splinter under the thumbnail (outside).
Tried to pull him with a tweezer.
Very hard to grab.
Didn't work out and hurt.
Now the child reacts hysterically when we try.
No more chance.
Tomorrow we'll see the doctor.

The LokSound 5 is the most important member of the LokSound family.
By combining digital decoder and sound module on a circuit board, we reach dimensions of only 30mm x15.5mm and can therefore be installed in almost every locomotive of the track gauges H0 and 0.
LokSound 5 decoders are offered with all common interfaces and always come with an 11x15mm large "sugar cube" speaker and sound capsule kit.
Like all family members, the LokSound5 is a real multi-protocol decoder.
It controls the DCC data format as well as Motorola®, Selectrix® and M4.
In DCC format, 14 to 128 driving stages are as natural as 2- and 4-digit addresses and up to 32 functions.
Thanks to RailComPlus®, the decoders register fully automatically at a suitable digital centre.
It controls all DCC programming modes and RailCom® allows the CV values to be read out on the main track with appropriate control points.
For headquarters that can program only the CVs of 1-255, there exist help registers.
Motorola® users benefit from up to 28 driving stages at 255 addresses.
Three other Motorola® addresses enable the release of 16 functions.
A built-in programming mode also allows reprogramming with the venerable control unit 6021.
The M4 protocol allows automatic registration at mfx®-compatible headquarters.
The LokSound 5 decoder recognizes the Märklin® brake tracks as well as ZIMO® HLU brake commands or the Lenz® ABC system.
It is also possible to brake with DCC brake components or with equal voltage.
In addition, it also stops with a Selectrix® brake diode.
An ABC pendulum automatic allows automatic commuting between two stations.
The LokSound 5 decoder can be used on analogue DC and AC circuits.

Because of Omikron: Johnson wants to advance the booster vaccination
Always new Omikron cases get politics and science in the UK.
Therefore, by the new year, all qualifying adults in England are to receive a vaccination offer.
London - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to make even faster progress with the Corona booster vaccinations in view of the rapid rise in Omicron numbers than previously sought.
Every adult in England should be given the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, provided that at least three months have passed since the second vaccination, Johnson said on Sunday evening in a pre-recorded video message to his countrymen.
So far, the target date was at the end of January.
The UK Government will provide additional support to speed up vaccination campaigns in the regions of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
Faced with the Omicron variant, there is an emergency, which is why vaccination protection needs to be strengthened urgently, said Johnson.
The good news is that the level of protection can be increased with a third dose.
"Let's get some boosters!" said Johnson.
On Sunday, 1239 other Omikron cases were registered in the UK, with the total number increasing to 3137.
Compared to the previous day, this was an increase of 65 percent. dpa
will the full amount be refunded from the purchase price upon collection?
I'm in favour of everyone being introduced to pronouns.
I sent out an application.
Today the invitation came to a conversation by e-mail.
I want to answer the e-mail.
Unfortunately, the name is not "Peter", but rather a somewhat more complicated name.
I googled him and depending on where he/she has a cultural background, it's either a man or a woman.
**I have no idea how to write the email now.
Can someone help me, please?
** I'm a foreigner and I don't want to get over my feet either.
Conclusion: everyone should imagine with pronouns.
Got a total of 5 books on it.
4 of them go.
Only the one thing I bought today doesn't go
Obviously, the chair had an undetectable lack of sales.
How else can such a cushion damage occur after 9 months?
First tried on the #PRS_ORG#.
But this has been working since approx.
14 days no more.
Therefore, I always bought the last books via the website and then read them on the #PRS_ORG#.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# but I wanted to buy 8.
However, there was no more.
Now they are available again and I want you to add 2 chairs to the order and charge me for that.
[CW] The feeling if I can't help.
Content Warning: I will write here a little more detailed about domestic violence.
I just have to write something about the soul.
I (21) come into contact with the victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence more often for professional reasons.
One issue that really sucks at me and unfortunately occurs too often is that many victims do not let themselves be helped or think we could not help them.
I am quite clear that we cannot do everything and it is not perfect.
But there are fewer things in my profession that move me more than if I can do nothing in such situations.
I see the blue spots, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in conversation under four eyes, with the perpetrator far beyond sight and hearing, I can't reach everyone.
I don't know what the reason is, maybe it's fear of revenge, fear of leaving the usual social environment, fear of exorcising the children from this.
What I always want to make clear to everyone is, in part, very close to the tears themselves, all worth living without violence.
I want all women to know that they don't just have to take violence.
Many times I wish I could help at any rate... I know I can't.
But this never makes it easier.
Please, always remember that you are worth living without violence, that is so incredibly important.
"Arcane" on Netflix: What does the series fit for "League of Legends"?
A lot of fantasy, many complicated names, a stunning presentation: "Arcane", the series from the "League of Legends" computer game universe, has recently started on Netflix.
Why are we looking forward to the already announced two seasons?
Basketball-Bundesliga: Derby-Debakel of the MHP Giant Ludwigsburg near the Merlins Crailsheim
At least young Johannes Patrick was abandoned.
Again nothing: For the second time in not even three months the giants lost in Crailsheim - and how!
Before the game, Ludwigsburg's coach John Patrick had said to Hakro Merlin's Crailsheim, "We still have some anger in our stomachs, looking back at the cup defeat at the beginning of October".
But it did not lie down after the game - but increased again in view of the 61:72 (28:38) defeat in the basketball league.
More than the naked result disappointed the way the performance was performed.
In the alternative, a statistic was mentioned that expresses the whole dilemma: the three-piece ratio was just 13 percent, four hits (all by young John Patrick) in saying and writing 31 attempts - still questions?
The answer John Patrick said: "After the victory at Tenerife we were simply not concentrated enough, and did not implement what we have trained."
Namely to move the ball.
His opponent Sebastian Gleim responded quite differently: "To win a great game against Ludwigsburg for the second time," said the happy coach.
"It felt like 10,000 people before."
Only 750 visitors were admitted to the Hohenlohe Arena on Saturday, but they were paid for.
Not least because of BBL topscorer T.J. Shorts, who scored 22 points and directed the game of his team.
"The best gamemaker I've ever trained," Gleim praised.
While in Patrick's team even the service providers like Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed all over the line.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) did the giants prevent a total debacle and came up to eight points after they had already returned 39:59.
In addition to John Patrick, Justin Simon came on twelve points.
Fortunately, much time for Hadern does not remain.
Already on Wednesday (19 o'clock) the giants receive the Skyliners Frankfurt, before then also in Ludwigsburg a maximum of 750 spectators.
We used to have a different email address, but I changed it.
Yeah, I already signed up a few months ago.
Unfortunately, all warranty claims were rejected.
We have informed ourselves again in law and have therefore registered them again.
We originally signed up six months ago.
Always plucked out of the egg: Max Raabe becomes 59
He is able to inspire his audience with new interpretations of beats from the 20s and 30s.
He is currently on the way with the program "Good day, dear happiness" - if he is allowed to appear.
Actually, Max Raabe would have wanted to celebrate his birthday on stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But that's not gonna happen.
The planned concert was held in May 2022 - "on official instructions" to contain the Corona virus.
Other of his appearances planned during the Advent season must first fail as it is called on the singer's website, which is now 59, and his musician (www.palast-orchester.de).
From January on, the artists will then want to re-create their dates, which have already been moved by the pandemic in 2020.
Born on December 12, 1962 in the North Rhine-Westphalian Lünen, Max Raabe has already sung a lot and loves to sing as a youth.
He studied opera singing in Berlin, and in 1986 he founded the Palace Orchestra together with fellow students.
Since then, the baritone has established itself in the style of the comedian harmonists with its repertoire of bats and chansons.
He was awarded many prizes.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached the second place of the charts, just like his success album "For women this is not a problem" (2013).
He made it out of the niche in the mainstream.
Always elegantly dressed, the blond hair firmly combed back and thought of on labels, Max Raabe is no longer able to think away from the current German-speaking music landscape.
With the program "Good day, dear happiness" he has been on tour since 2020. dpa

Federal Minister for Construction Klara Geywitz: No new apartment is created by expropriation
The new Federal Minister for Construction Klara Geywitz (SPD) has opposed the expropriation of large housing groups, as has been called for in a referendum in Berlin.
"With expropriation, not a single new apartment is created, it only changes the ownership structure," Geywitz said in an interview with the "Tagesspiegel" (Sunday).
My goal is to give tenants security that their rent will remain affordable in the next few years.
By the way, a colorful mix of, for example, private landlords, cooperatives or housing companies is the best protection against monopolistic formation.
In Berlin, the coalition of SPDs, Greens and the Left wants to set up an expert committee on how to deal with the outcome of the referendum.
But if the situation does not relax, Geywitz talks with the FDP in the traffic light coalition about further tightening in the rental law did not stop.
The coalition agreement provides for a rental price brake by 2029, a limitation of rental increases in stressed housing markets and an extension of the rental mirror.
I will speak to the Minister of Justice to implement this as soon as possible.
If the rental market still does not relax, "we will talk to the coalition partners about further steps," the SPD politician stressed.

At least 100 deaths from tornadoes in Kentucky
In a devastating storm system, numerous tornadoes have been pulled through the United States.
In Kentucky alone, there may be more than 100 deaths to complain about.
The pictures from there remind us of a war zone.
During the night on Saturday, several tornados in the United States have caused severe devastation and may have claimed up to a hundred deaths.
The storms leave an approximately 320-kilometre-long cutting of the devastation, especially in Kentucky.
His governor Andy Beshear said after a visit to the disaster area, wherever the tornado was blown away, everything was gone.
Houses, shops, government buildings - just gone.
Parts of industrial plants, roofs are in the trees.
It is hard to imagine that this is possible at all.
He calculates in Kentucky alone with up to a hundred dead, the official figures rising hourly.
Hello, I just saw that she sold out showcase #NAME#.
It's a shame.
Is it still being produced?
Or is it completely removed from the assortment?
Is it possible to order this showcase in another country?
Until when do you get in touch?
If the delivery cannot be made to my apartment, I must cancel the order !
I understand that, but can I order the ceiling now and have it delivered to Germany, which is in the shopping cart?
I had returned an article via the contact form or gave up a return and wanted to ask if it would be arrived or processed, as I have not yet received confirmation.
Companies pay vaccine premiums and change advertising claims
While the Federal Government continues to reject the proposals for a vaccination premium, companies in Austria themselves have taken the initiative and are offering their employees money premiums for vaccination.
This means that they are on a line with the social partners ÖGB and the Chamber of Commerce, which today demanded financial incentives for vaccination.
The conversion of advertising logos to vaccination calls - according to German example - is also intended to increase the willingness to use Corona vaccines.
He's changed to a company he's been reading about.
That doesn't make his situation any better than yours.
Wait and drink tea.
It's been a year.
He obviously didn't sew himself to his old spot and was looking for something else.
So can you.
And that he didn't like you at the time: well, no matter.
He didn't like his job either.
There are too many variables.
Please record the cancellation.
That will then be legally relevant.

Aid for the first own campaign
Boron to hell!
I'm just leading the adventure on the Greifenpass for a group of 4 friends and want to lead my heroes seamlessly into a campaign specifically written for the players.
We play DSA 5.
The big bow is made, the bad guys and their motivations are written, the individual files are made up and now I am writing the entrance adventure and I am already at the first encounter about my own feet.
The premise is that the heroes should take a drive with grain from Gratenfels to a small village near Lake Thuran.
This is where the further action is to develop.
A few miles from the village, the hero is supposed to pick up a group of Goblins and draw them into an ambush.
I would like to give the player the opportunity to solve the confrontation in different ways: persuading, acting, threatening, identifying the danger early, whatever the players may be.
Group strength: 8 ordinary goblins, 2 with spears, 6 armed with bows and sabers
In case of noticing, the Goblins wait up the heroes in a hollow path and flank me three left and right bows each armed the vehicle while two with spears stop the drive.
If it comes to battle and the heroes are under, I have two solutions
1. The heroes are all found unconscious and then healed by the son of the village school, a half-elf.
The cart is gone, of course.
2. Should a defeat be inevitable, this half-elf with two of his servants comes in and comes to the aid of the hero in the battle.
The cart's still there, everything's great.
How well do you think Deus ex Machina of Solution 2?
Is the Encounter too much to start the adventure?
The Goblins group will play a decisive role later, so it is not just cannon feed.
EDIT: Wow, I didn't expect so many answers, especially not with so many great suggestions and tips.
I'm sure I'll take care of many of your ideas and now I have more confidence in my narrative.
I reassembled the lamp.
And stuck together again.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
That's why I'd like to send them back anyway.
If you can then let the return slips come, then I can pack the lamp and bring it to #PRS_ORG#.

I am annoyed by Sky Sport F1
Hello dear F1 fans, over the season the quality on the German sky has decreased more and more, so I want to make myself a little air with this post.
First of all, the transmission was cancelled in the middle of the F2 race today in order to start the F1 pre-reporting on time.
Although due to the delayed start and start-up accident of the schedule was far behind the planning, one could still have shown the last (planned) ten minutes as well as the championship decision (!).
It seems, however, that for legal reasons, the F1 enjoys priority and therefore has to restrict itself to everything else, so that Sky DE here probably had no choice.
Nevertheless stupid, since Sky UK has transferred the race to the end.
Nevertheless, a small praise: the commentator Olivier Zwartyes has well accompanied the difficult situation around the serious accident.
Then in the F1 there was once again a rule change with the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, so both did not know that you can change the tires under a red flag.
Although this situation already existed in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, both of them only decided that the tyres should be changed when there were appropriate radio messages on this topic to Hamilton.
At Sky UK and RTL, both commentators knew immediately that there was this possibility of leaving.
I believe that such basic rules should be known simply when commenting on the F1 at a pay-TV station.
It is also not the first mystery rate, which is now possible or required by rules, both simply have constant uncertainties in the subject of rules.
Generally not like with the artificial comment style of Rose, but admit that the taste is the thing.
But I really even like Heiko water from RTL better.
In addition, there are constant aberrations that make both seem simply unprofessional, such as ordering coffee from (as well as unsuspecting) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuHD" by Ralf Schumacher.
Just the latter brings a great deal of unrest into the comment that he apparently does not take it seriously.
Last but not least, advertising simply takes over at Sky, in the run-out, Sky is the only broadcaster that goes into advertising, how to listen to F1TV, because only the German soundtrack has to come out without comment right after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF do that.
These two channels also make less advertising in the trainings than Sky, and this as a free TV broadcaster.
You have to praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, but that alone doesn't make me look beyond the disadvantages.
The rest of Sky Sport F1 is also very poor and full of repetitions.
Overall, Sky is really the worst German-speaking broadcaster that broadcasts the F1.
Uniquely, RTL does a better job in the four races that they are still allowed to pass on, except for advertising.
In any case, the grandiose F1 season makes much less fun than it would be possible with a reasonable transmitter.
I'd be interested in your opinion.
To the here: #PRS_ORG# pendulum lamp, brass and multicolored glass x 1
Hello, I have an article to be delivered last week that is still not delivered.
I've contacted the chat twice and so far nothing.
The First Lady told me that it will be sent on Monday, the second lady told me yesterday that she will check and send an email and she has never answered.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on 12.12.19.
One of these has already had a defect after a relatively short period of time (the fabric has a hole on the front part of the chair).
I'm asking for support.
Fan pumps are ideal for providing an additional aquarium with oxygen.
It is also possible to operate a filter system via airlift.
This series is offered in 3 variants by us.
See the table at the end of the offer.
There you can see the performances in comparison.
If the pumps are strong enough, you can run whole plants with them.
If you own a large aquarium, pumps with 2 or more outputs are suitable for connecting several outlets.
The MK series has one, two or four outputs, depending on the model fan pump, but also offers to set an accent in the aquarium, e.g. with an air curtain (see our shop) or with a decor that transforms the air bubbles into a function.
Here would be a treasure chest, shell or something like that.
The MK series has a special, sound-proofed construction and thus provides low operating noises.
The installation is very simple.
The fan pump is connected to an out currenter or similar by means of an air hose 4/6 mm...and it can start already.
The fan pump should be equal to, or higher than, the water level and be fitted outside.
If the fan pump is lower than the water level, you should put a non-return valve in between.
Simply cut the air hose and put the valve in between.
This would prevent once water running backwards that runs out of the basin through the pump...
If the fan pump is fitted outdoors, you should, like other air pumps, be covered and protected from moisture
The MK series pumps are pure power packs that consume little energy
Even if we specify the processing time with 3 days here in ebay, the packages are packed daily and the packages are picked up here every day.
Everything's going well, it's going very fast.
We just want to prevent a little so that no one is voted on, just because it took a little longer.
It would be so, not everyone has an understanding of all the employees who also work in the freight forwarding sector...Of course, there is no Corona here.
Please do not judge as badly, just because the delivery is delayed, that is solely due to the package services.
Of course, you like to scoff at these services, even if at the moment we say...they've got it damn hard.
This is also very different regionally.
If you are not angry, stay healthy and we all hope that there will be better times again.
how long does it take to order the yellow ones with and without armrests?
Can you order the legs in bright?
Amazon founder Bezo sends astronaut daughter and moderator to space
The daughter of the first American in space, a TV moderator and four other passengers have made a short trip to space.
They were transported on Saturday by the New Shepard rocket system of Blue Origin by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
The takeoff and landing of the approximately ten-minute flight took place in the west of the U.S. state of Texas.
Under brilliant blue sky, Bezos personally received the freshly named astronauts after their return.
"Welcome back," said Bezos, dressed in a blue room suit when he opened the hatch to the capsule.
Among the applause of friends, family members and employees of Blue Origin, the six passengers climbed out and embraced the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they were on their way ten minutes and 13 seconds, reaching a height of 107 kilometres.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of the 1961 Nazi astronaut Alan Shepard (1923-1998), named after the rocket system of Blue Origin, and the 50-year-old TV moderator Michael Strahan were honorary guests of the company who had paid the other four passengers for their tickets: space engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess and his son Cameron.
How much they paid for their tickets, Blue Origin didn't tell them.
Laura Shepard Churchley remembered her father's mission after the short flight.
He had to work hard in his operations and make everything himself.
She just flew along like that, said the 74-year-old with a laugh.
Michael Strahan also expressed himself enthusiastically.
He would like to return to space again, said the moderator.
"New Shepard" flies up to 100 kilometers in height
The rocket system "New Shepard" flies largely automated.
The capsule, separated from the rocket during the flight, reached an altitude of about 100 kilometres above the ground, temporarily with zero gravity, before the reusable object braked off by large parachutes landed again.
The International Aviation Association and many other experts see 100 kilometres above earth as a frontier to space, but there is no binding international regulation.
It was already the third manned all-out of Blue Origin: At the first in July, Amazon founder Bezos was on board himself, along with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old US pilot and an 18-year-old Dutchman.
At the second in October, the 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner, with his role as "Captain Kirk" was world famous in "Star Trek", as well as the former Nasa engineer Chris Boshuizen, the entrepreneur Glen de Vries and the deputy director of Blue Origin, Audrey Powers.
Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of pushing the business of space tourism largely without promoting scientific research interests for the good of mankind and without regard to the climate.
At the push of a button, you can easily choose whether your "Smart Stone" is to shine permanently in a color or play through its entire color repertoire.

Someone who works in biochemistry or studied biochemistry
I am currently studying biochemistry in the first semester and find the subject really quite exciting and also standing in the laboratory does not disturb me (already have the inorganic chemistry internship behind me).
I have of course also been informed about career prospects before my studies, but I also thought that I would definitely like to study and will study until my doctorate.
At the moment, however, I am in doubt, especially as a result of the job prospects.
On the one hand (studycheck etc) one hears over and over again super professional opportunities and the job is totally sought after, on the other hand one hears again and again of unemployed biologists and incredibly poorly paid jobs.
That's why I'd be really interested:
1) As what do you currently work?
2) Are you satisfied with your work/ salary?
3) What did you study/What training did you do?
4) Would you do this again?
Thank you for your answers!
I am really unsure at the moment and I am thinking about maybe quitting my studies in 2022 and making an education as a specialist computer scientist.
If you have experience, they will also be happy to write times :)
Extra stress before holidays & holidays weekends
This topic came up with me last week.
But now I had to use my long weekend to relax.
That's why it's a post.
Not only before major holidays, such as Christmas holidays, there is great stress in our operations.
As it seems, there are also before holidays plus bridge days.
It was the way it was: last week Maria was Ascension, which is called "Ascendance" with us in Switzerland.
On Friday, most people and businesses make a bridge day that is semi-official.
So it was a long four-day weekend in the house last week.
So what happened last week?
Stress everywhere.
Lauter e-mails, which had to get out before the trip, order here order there, everything *unconditional* before the long weekend.
Because... yeah because?
Because "next week" sounds like so much time and that can't be?
Or because people want to do as much serious as they do in a shorter week as they do in a normal one?
Not only was I stressed on Wednesday, but I was also powerfully regenerate.
What's this self-belief about holidays?
What are we having holidays for if we are not allowed to enjoy them properly?!
The stress did not come from above, the colleagues were all quite independent of it.
My question is simple: are we the only ones like this, the Swiss?
Is that our reformed-evangelic way?
Or do you know that in the north?
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in their Thuringian homeland - but has no gifts yet.
"The beautiful thing, even if there should be no snow in Erfurt, then you just drive to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest," said the actress and singer Hit Radio FFH.
She will agree to the feast by baking and crafting with her son.
"I love that," said Catterfeld.
But until the sensory days, she still has a lot to do: "For the first time, I don't have any gifts yet, I have to get started now."
NECTON-Bio supports the smooth running of the mice and the re-forming of the plumage.
NECTON-Bio contains all vital vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements and 200,000 μg of biotin/kg.
NECTON-Bio gives the bird a smooth and shiny plumage.
Most of the damage to the plumage that occurs in birdkeeping is due exclusively to nutritional errors.
Since the plumage consists of a protein-containing substance, a particularly rich and balanced protein nourishment of the bird is a prerequisite for the formation of a perfect spring dress.
For a functioning metabolism, the daily food must contain sufficient vitamins, minerals and trace elements.
Most of the animal losses that occur during the mouse are due to a lack of or unbalanced protein intake and/or insufficient supply of vitamins and minerals.
In the composition of NECTON-Bio, the adverse ratio of amino acids in most plant feed is explicitly taken into account and balanced.
No further vitamin preparation should be administered during use of NECTON-Bio.
NECTON-Bio is cold-water soluble and can be administered easily via drinking water or soft food.
Thank you. I found it.
Sorry, still not working
GDR manual work model Altbau E-Lok E 95 03 DRG/ DR, the locomotive was in use in Silesia and Central Germany, the very rare locomotive probably comes from the conversion proposal of the model railway ME issue 11/1968, used with play tracks and parts see photos, function well, The E 95 series is a heavy freight train electric locomotives of the German Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft (DRG), which has been designed for the traction of heavy coal gannets in the Silesian network, possibly the kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
A locomotive is located in the DB Museum Halle (Saale) and we are able to operate
In 1924, the German Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft had commissioned the AEG to submit proposals for an electric locomotive that could transport 2,200 tonne coal trains and 530 tonne passenger trains at a speed of 45 km/h.
The maximum speed required was 65 km/h.
Thus, in March 1926 the DRG decided on the delivery as a 1'Co+Co1' locomotive with a TAG drive AEG with the delivery of the mechanical part, the Siemens-Schuckertwerke with the electric part.
From December 1927 to June 1928, six locomotives were supplied, which received the E 95 01–06 operating numbers.
All survived the Second World War and then found themselves on the territory of the later GDR.
In 1946 the locomotives entered the Soviet Union as a repair product.
They returned to Germany until November 1952.
In the Reichsbahnsbehörungswerk Dessau, the reworkability of all six locomotives was established.
[4] The three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were upgraded in 1959, with the remaining machines serving as a spare part donor.
First, the E 04, E 44 and E 94, existing in larger quantities, were ideally built.
It was only when the E 94 saw that the number of reprocessing could not be further increased that the E 95 focused on the reprocessing process.
[4]The locomotives were first stationed at the Leipzig-Waren railway station.
They came to the railway station Hall P in 1960.
They were used in their own orbital plan mostly before coal trains from the Geiselt valley towards Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
The complex control of locomotives proved problematic with increasing age.
Thus, it was more often the case that shooters remained stuck in switch shops.
Then the Beimann with hammer and wooden wedge who was constantly driving on this locomotive had to unload the shooter again during the ride.
Damage to the driving engines often occurred and resulted in months of failure at the locomotives.
[5] Since there were enough new construction locomotives at the end of the 1960s and no significant expansion of the electrical operation was planned at that time, the Reichsbahn was able to dispense with old locomotives and most of the splitter types, so that the E 95 was put out of service.
In addition, they found that the German Reichsbahn only wanted to occupy electric locomotives alone, which, due to the difficulties mentioned with the machines and the viewing conditions of the driver's position, would have caused a problem in the train operation.
[5] After the closure of E 95 02 and E 95 03 in mid-69, they were last followed by E 95 01, which was terminated on 5 October 1970.
The proposed new name 255 001 was therefore never used.
Except for the E 95 02, all locomotives were broken down.
The E 95 02 was set up as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10 as a heating system at Halle Central Station.
It took some time for the people in charge of the Reichsbahn to be convinced that the E 95 was worth it as a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the first external refurbishment of the locomotive began with the aim of presenting it to a vehicle show at RAW Dessau.
[5] Since then, she has been part of the Transport Museum Dresden as an inactive museum locomotive.
In 1986, the locomotive was completed internally.
In the DB Museum Halle (Saale), the locomotive museum is supervised.
Since 1995, employees of the traditional Bw Hall P community have been working on the operational reprocessing of the locomotives.
In April 2015, the locomotive was presented for the first time for an exhibition at the Museums-Bw Arnstadt with new interior and exterior painting, with the transformers being checked and five driving engines operational.
-The locomotives were in use on the Silesian Mountain Railway until 1945 and the branching sideways, where they were proven due to their reliable drive and low maintenance effort.
In February 1945, the machines were relocated to Leipzig to form the central German network.
The main use area was initially Silesia
Handicraft model H0 in OVP, function well, it is optical rework on the locomotive in self-work necessary, dusted, with game tracks, odor !!!, very rare handicraft model, very small edition - possibly the kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN
The packaging may have labels and bearing marks.
Yes the F-parts are it
I have received a bed from you.
However, there were problems with a part.
The central beam is held by two feet.. unfortunately these are too narrow and the beam cannot be mounted on the feet.
What do we do now?
I can't build the bed.
The central beam is held by two feet, these are unfortunately produced incorrectly.
The centre beam does not fit into the intended bracket.
So I'm getting a new one.
When will they be sent forth?
No flatness.
These are, according to the assembly instructions, the right ones from the shape, they were just too narrow
But it doesn't matter.
Mainly they fulfil their purpose
With me they are not flat
Could I get these sent?
Hello #NAME#, should I explain the problem to you again?
House fire with two slightly injured and high damage
Two people have been slightly injured by a fire in a residential house in Upper Bavaria.
In addition, an estimated damage was caused in the six-digit euro area, as the police reported on Sunday.
The fire had probably spread from a carport to the adjacent residential house in Kinsau (Landkreis Landsberg am Lech).
Two residents were reported to have been hospitalized on Sunday with mild smoke poisoning.
The exact cause of the fire was not known at first, but the police did not assume a deliberate fire.
The Kripo Fürstenfeldbruck took over the further investigations.
She'll arrive a lot later.
And I have to pay shipping costs again.
To defuse fake news - Biontech CEO publishes vaccine photo
Uğur Şahin published a photo of his first vaccination at the beginning of 2021 on the social network "LinkedIn".
Biontech Chief Uğur Şahin had not yet made a public statement about his vaccination status.
Now the entrepreneur published a photo showing his Corona vaccination.
A friend's illness moved him to do so, told Şahin.
The CEO and co-founder of the Mainz company Biontech, Uğur Şahin, has published a photo showing how he receives a vaccination against the Coronavirus.
In the social media there was misinformation that I was allegedly not vaccinated.
In fact, my wife and I received 3 doses of the Biontech Pfizer vaccine," wrote Şahin on Friday in a contribution on the network "LinkedIn".
"For a few months now, friends have been pressing me to post a photo of me on which I am vaccinated to counter these false rumors."
So far, he has refused because communication should not be about him.
But a call last week changed his mind: "I was deeply saddened when I learned that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life.
He fights against a severe Covid-19 disease and has been hanging on a breathing device for three weeks.
The school friend and his family were not vaccinated, Şahin continued.
He didn't ask for the reasons.
"The most common cause, however, seems to be fear, which is often caused by misinformation and mistrust".
Fear can only be hard to fight with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences.
On the Internet, an interview with the German wave, in which Uğur Şahin says he is not vaccinated.
However, the video was produced in December 2020, as the Deutsche Welle himself made clear.
"I am not currently legally allowed to get the vaccine myself," said Şahin at that time.
There is a prioritisation in Germany in vaccination of the vaccine.
In the meantime, prioritisation has been suspended for a long time - and the Biontech chief has been vaccinated three times according to suitable data.
Fire in a clamping system: Tens of thousands of people without electricity
In several municipalities in North Rhine-Westphalia the light went out on Friday evening: no more electricity and in many cases probably no more heating.
A fire had paralyzed a transducer station.
After a fire with serious damage in a refuelling station, tens of thousands of people in the Rhein-Sieg-Kreis in North Rhine-Westphalia have had to escape without electricity for about 24 hours.
The fire left the lights on Friday evening for 41,000 affected residents in several municipalities.
The supplier Westnetz reported that on Saturday numerous emergency power units had been in operation until the large-scale disturbance could finally be completely remedied in the late evening.
Firefighters and THW helpers provided support in the municipalities.
The authorities offered care facilities in schools and called for neighborhood assistance.
The caregiver thanked the people concerned for their patience and for their help.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought considerable restrictions.
We also thank the affected municipalities, the district, the fire brigade and the THW for their tireless use," said Florian Witt, head of primary technology, in a communication on Saturday evening.
The repair of the damage would still take a few days, as the Westnetz-Monteurs could initially only temporarily put some lines back into operation again, he explained.
A technical defect led to the fire, according to company information.
Electricity Flows Again
According to Westnetz, the fire that broke out on Friday at 7:15 p.m. has severely damaged parts of the 10,000-volt switch station at Neunkirchen-Seelscheid.
Extensive cleaning and repair work is needed there.
At the same time, a connection to a 30,000-volt voltage level had been established.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply is back.
Since Saturday at 6 p.m., over 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth have had electricity again.
Another 20,000 inhabitants of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid had been connected gradually from 21.30 a.m.
Since 23.15 a.m., the last electricity still affected by the failure would also have.
Over 80 technicians from Westnetz and partner companies had been in use.
Following the construction of an emergency power supply for important buildings on Saturday afternoon, the authorities also called for neighbourhood assistance.
"It is now important that citizens take care of older or single people in their neighbourhood and report to local firehouses when help is needed," said Landrat Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
In setting up and operating emergency power units, the focus was on the inhabitants of Altenheimen.
Furthermore, according to public authorities, temporary care facilities were provided in schools for those who could not take care of themselves or the power-dependent medical devices or depend on medical care.
Good afternoon!
Unfortunately, the ceiling is sold out in Germany.
Can I buy them from you and pay them in euros?
It is the daily blanket #PRS_ORG# in blue green.
I hope you also have a nice day and please stay healthy.
But I can't mount the base on the tabletop.
It's Custom #NAME#.
There are 3 versions of this.
We wanted those with table tops diameter of #NUMBER#
we got 155cm diameter.
Today my #PRS_ORG# arrived, but I can't push it together and thus shorten it.
Can you help me with that?
Otherwise, I'd have to send them back because otherwise it's not suitable for the purpose.
I would like to receive a feedback.
Yes, that's really easier!
Then let's do it like that!
Do you send me the return note by e-mail?
repair is now complete.
I had already tried this before the chat.
Before the purchase, however, I had not restarted the E-#PRS_ORG#.
You want me to do this now?
I find such a low credit almost rude.
We do not agree with this.
Nordic combination: Combined Riiber wins
The German Nordic combinators Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmid are on the podium at the World Cup in the Estonian Otepää.
The duo once again had to give way to the outstanding Norwegian Jarl Magnus Riiber, who had already started with great advantage after the ski jumping into the track.
Return of order number #NUMBER#
When will the money be returned to my account?
Yes, we both made s new and use version 4.5...
could be that they have heard of problems more often.
I bought a book directly with my #PRS_ORG#, it seems to be on it too.
So if I want to open it, the message comes, ups!
This document could not be opened.
File is possibly incorrect they report to the customer service.
As far as I can see, it is a #PRS_ORG# epub file.
Can they help me?
Chat connection is gone and now?
I have to work in between!
To make the paint order even and clean, clean the components with some soapy water from dust, grease and fingerprints, rinse them with clear water and dry them.
Before you bring the brush to the model for the first time with a new color, it is recommended to practice 2 to 3 strokes.
You can do this on the later invisible inside of the components or on a yoghurt cup.
The first stroke on the component
Draw the brush evenly stroke next to the stroke.
Light overlap of the colour layers will later ensure a smooth surface.
Avoid quick wiping with the brush.
This creates unrealistic areas.
A model is not a garden fence.
Start with the bright colors.
The dark could otherwise shine through later.
Metal tones and metallic colors come to a close with a separate brush.
Otherwise, if they mix with normal colors, they can lead to unbeautiful metal sleighs.
Let the painted parts dry for a day before you plant them.
Originally true-to-life, the models reach through the decals or decals.
From hallmarks on aircraft to ship names to decorations and car models identifications: The decals give the model the last cut.
Bring the decals in the correct order as long as the components are still well reachable.
An aircraft cockpit can be glued or glued more easily before it is installed into the hull.
Even more important than the right tool such as scissors, tweezers and toothpicks are when glued time, patience and a quiet hand.
Cut out each required decal individually and set it up for you.
Decals are also called water slides because you moisten their back briefly with water until the carrier paper becomes dark through the wet.
Then you push the picture only a small piece of paper and place the piece on the corresponding spot on the model (which you wetted before).
While holding the decal on the model with a tool, pull off the backing paper sideways.
Attention: Always check if the picture is right before you slide it completely off the paper so that it doesn't stick to your finger, crack or even tear.
Intake excess water with a household cloth.
Not suitable for children under 3 years
I can only open a book for a moment as soon as I look for something else then I don't read the book anymore and have to log out and log in and load the book again and look for the place until I read it.
On Saturday, I've already communicated with you.
Do I get this by email?
Also for all 3 packages?
Because the lamp arrived in 3 individual packages with me.
Thank you very much!
I'll buy somewhere else as soon as the money comes back.
But can I get this back without a problem?
Child care at PKV / What is a "insurance case"?
Hello together,
we were in child care for some time, now when it comes to billing with the PKV, it suddenly crosses.
The sequence follows:
We had requested the children's training in advance at the PKV and got the promise over 3 attempts.
The tests were not restricted in any way (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to successful pregnancy and birth and was counted with the PKV.
Some time later we tried to have a second child, and carried out 2 (unsuccessful) attempts, but did not yet calculate them with the PKV.
We applied again for the costs of the passenger car and again received 3 further attempts.
After some further attempts (we carried out more attempts than promised, logically the most expensive with the PKV) we submitted the invoices to the PKV and got the bad surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2+3) the PKV only wants to refund 3 attempts.
The reason: With the pregnancy/birth, the remaining 2 attempts of the first commitment lapse.
The second children's wish was a new insurance case.
According to the General Terms and Conditions, however, "The insurance case begins with the cure, it ends when the need for treatment no longer exists."
The questions to the experts in the round here:
* Who here has the right to refund the passenger car (only 3 attempts) or we (there are 5 attempts to refund)?
* Should the passenger car have told us in the promises that with a birth the further attempts would be lost?
* Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case?
The infertility (caused by closed ovulators) is not cured by the first child.
It would be great if the experts here gave your opinion.
Thank you for your help!
Can you send me the three variants by e-mail and tell me how best to reach them again?
All right.
We're not going to order anything from them anymore.
If they add the sales of me and my friend #NAME# (same address), they obviously lost good customer.
They are welcome to pass this on to their managers.
This is not competitive.
Yesterday the colleague told me that the refund was triggered and now you tell me that I have to return the thing first.
I guess I can't help it if the chest of drawers gets to me.
Please see in the screenshot what the colleague has written
It is clear that the refund has been triggered and I have still not received any refund via #PRS_ORG#
You can tell your manager that they have now lost two regular customers.
My friend has also ordered various furniture for our apartment via his account.
We're not going to do that anymore.
No, the defect only occurred after a few months.
An office chair must withstand normal use.
Otherwise, they can't sell him as an office chair.
Independently, the guarantee of 24 months applies.
No, it's not possible for me to get another kind of packaging.
I will be able to dismantle the cabinet and make it available to the transport company.
Good day, I have a question about your series of #PRS_ORG#
These products are advertised with additional purchased stools, but unfortunately we cannot find them with you.
Can they help?
Theme of the week: The best low budget movies
What is exactly a low-budget film, there is no general definition with exact budget limits.
Wikipedia has the following to say:
>A **low-budget film** or **low-budget movie** is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
On the net you can find plenty of lists of low-budget movies, such as on Letterboxd.com.
Do you know any interesting representatives of this category?
What is it that irritates you?
And what do you not like at all?
I am a very good customer of you, had already 2 apartments fully furnished with your furniture.
Wanted to ask the best price for the grey leather sofa Odelle.
The delivery time has now been extended again, is this now also reliable?
Thank you very much.
With kind greetings
There's no phone number, there's a chat where you have to wait 30min, there's no chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes in the waiting position... I'll give up again soon because it just doesn't work here.
Hello.
"Half victory" against Belarus with high costs for the EU
In conflict with the Belarusian regime, the EU can announce a "half victory" to political expert Raphael Bosong.
The costs, however, were very high and meant massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees to Belarus' border with Poland and Lithuania, said Bosong to the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
Sustainablely, the EU has not solved the confrontation, said the researcher at the Berliner Stiftung Wissenschaft und Politik (SWP).
This state of suspension - Belarus does not contribute very little, but the EU feels like a winner - is probably going on for a while.
The handling of people at the border was not in line with the European Convention on Human Rights, Bosong ruled.
Apparently there is an "increasing normalisation of pushbacks" by individual EU governments.
Since the EU as a whole is not determined to turn against it, it is at the expense of fundamental rights.
At the same time, this development weakens cohesion in the Union.
"It seems that it cannot prevail if a Member State is in the head to do its thing", as is the case with Poland, which does not even allow Frontex to access the border.
In addition, the EU pays a further price for its policy at the border with Belarus, says Bosong: An agreement on asylum policy would be difficult as the line "border protection, border protection, border protection" had been strengthened.
Renewed attempt to cross the border
According to Poland's border guards, migrants have tried again to cross Belarus to Polish territory.
55 migrants were arrested at night on Sunday and returned to the border, said a spokesperson of the authority on Sunday.
The Polish officials had been stoned in the incident near the village of Czeremsza by the migrants.
According to the information, a soldier was caught in the face and had to be medically cared for by a military doctor.
In total, border guards registered 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
Already on Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had overcome the border barriers.
Thousands of people from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan have crossed or tried to cross the border between Belarus and the EU in recent months.
The EU accuses Alexander Lukashenko as the ruler of Minsk of having lured her into the EU with the prospect of entry.
According to press reports, Poland and Lithuania closed border sections.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines bringing migrants and refugees to the country.
In addition, EU Commissioners traveled to people's countries of origin to prevent departures there.
The most effective element of the EU response was the pressure on the airlines," said Bosong.
"This is where the EU has thrown its market power into the balance and demonstrated its determination to operate with harsh bans and extraterritorial sanctions."
Reductions should also take into account domestic policy costs.
The Belarusian society was probably not concerned that the security device would regularly ensnare thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes protests after controversial Formula One finale
According to Mercedes, Max Verstappen reported that he had committed two violations of the rules during the race.
Abu Dhabi - After the controversial formula 1 finale of Abu Dhabi, Mercedes filed an objection.
The silver arrows assume two rule breaks in the last Grand Prix of the year.
A protest refers to a alleged violation of Max Verstappen in the Red Bull in the last safety car phase, when he is said to have overtaken it.
A second objection was raised against the evaluation at the end of the race.
According to Mercedes-View, the protocol was not followed in accordance with the rules.
On the last round, Verstappen had overtaken Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes and had become his first Formula One title.
The maneuver took place shortly after the end of a safety-car phase in which the Dutch had overtaken the moving car in front of him.
I'll check it out.
I'll talk to the bank and report back to you.
thanks for the support
Free admission for members: Europa-Park organises SC-Freiburg-Fantag
The Europa-Park, named for the Europe-Park Stadium of the Sport-Club Freiburg, has invited to the SC Freiburg Fantag.
As the park announces, members and permanent card holders of the Sport Club from Breisgau as well as members of the Fan Community were allowed to visit the Europa Park for free on this day.
In addition, there were vouchers for drinks and sausages.
The roller coasters lit through the jerseys red and white on that day.
Füchsle, Ed Euromaus and many red and white balloons provided the perfect setting," says the park.
The cooperation between the Bundesligist and the leisure park located in Rust, 40 kilometres north of Freiburg, has existed since the early 1990s.
At the first SC Freiburg Fantag in the Europa-Park again showed how well the partnership fits.
Seeing radiant fans who have fun together in the roller coaster confirm this," says Europa-Park owner Jürgen Mack.
Why is this €#NUMBER# and not as original 1699€ ?

Judith Hermann read from her novel "Daheim"
As part of the reading series "LiteraTour Nord", author Judith Hermann read the sold-out Blue Note from her current novel "Daheim" on Friday and also acted as a moderator.
She is divorced, lives in a house on the coast and listens sensitively to the nightly sounds on her doorstep.
I gave up the contact form yesterday to return an article, but I did not receive an email confirmation or anything like that.
My question would be whether my request has been received.
It doesn't have everyone's time for your clumsy chat and incorrectly delivered cheap goods from China.
Your mistake, which you fix and not all from our household.
Contact Mrs #NAME#.
I can't chat with them every day
We had chatted yesterday and agreed that I or Mrs. #NAME# will receive an email with a 60 Euro voucher, a new order of the #PRS_ORG# Nightstand and a return label.
This e-mail didn't come so far.
The package wants to bring it to #PRS_ORG# today.

I'm sorry, but just because he says he's not an anti-Semit doesn't mean anything.
It's like a settler says he has nothing against foreigners.
Your i will not admit it both.
But colleague constantly reproduces some anti-Semitic messages.
If you want to distance yourself then you should just leave it completely.
Yeah, well, then you're just as little serious as your colleague.
Those who seriously question evolution in principle are simply completely lost.
For me, a God has set the whole thing in motion.
But as soon as you're a creationist, you have to believe that the earth is 10,000 years old and that science is just nonsense.
And with that you are a science enemy and not to take any further seriously like collegiate
In order to obtain an optimal field of vision, the lens should be approximated as close to the eye as possible.
The specially designed aplanatically achromatic lens system allows you to use the lens until the edge zone is practically free of damage and color error.
Commonly loops are marked with magnifying indications.
However, this information applies only to precisely defined conditions which rarely meet the conditions of use.
In order to make the most of your magnifying glass, please note the information in the table "Technical data" (see instructions for use in the packaging).
Light reflections arise on the lens surfaces of all optical devices - even in the case of impact loops.
These reflections are significantly reduced by an anti-reflective coating.
If the optimal conditions of use are met - close to the eye - reflections on the lens surfaces are less perceptible.
Further information can be found in the accompanying instructions for use (available in German and English).

Tannensaufselse in Schönwolde: In the municipality of Krembz, women are looking for Christmas trees
Farmer Frank Diers has already experienced such a curious situation when selling teeth.
Once a man should even have driven home without his partner, because both of them could not agree.
Every year he plants over 2,000 pieces.
The 56-year-old has already experienced such a curious situation.
That always makes pre-Christmas time a little funny, he says.
What about the voucher?
Otherwise I am gone as a customer?!
After all, I received a defective delivery and now paid the full price for it.
Then I will also assess this accordingly!
We do not need to discuss the better court here, but there is a certain similarity between the two.
Both consist of meat that is grilled on a rotating spear.
And so they both have their names.
In German, an equivalent might be something like the "threesome", which by far does not sound so delicious.
Problems with fiberglass + Devolo DLan/Magic
We've had a new fiber connection in the house for a few weeks.
Unfortunately, now I have problems building a stable Wifi network.
Previously, I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and I used Devolo DLan, which received 50 Mbit and sent out until a few failures.
The new fiber optic connection sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and the DLan module, which is connected to the FritzBox, also arrives.
However, the other DLan module, which broadcasts the Wifi, no longer has the full 500, but the further I get out of the house with the module, the less arrives (i.e. use a socket located 1, 2, 3, etc. spaces from the other module).
This means that the Internet with the new fiber optic connection is now even slower on the first floor than before (\~45 Mbit).
I also ordered a new Devolo Magic set, which apparently uses a new technology.
This was slightly better than the DLan, but also here there were similar large losses.
Could someone explain to me why with fiber optics so much Internet speed over the power line goes "lost"?
And is LAN really the only solution?
It would be extremely difficult to move in the house LAN cable.
I'm really desperate, which is why I've created an extra account here.
That is why I would be all the more pleased about an answer.
When it's time to change the account
Who would have thought, now would be quiet with the girocotts, looks deceived.
While many banks have used the fall to confirm the increase in fees in the past with all kinds of tricks from their customers, the free amounts for negative interest rates continue to fall.
Deutsche Bank, for example, was considered relatively generous with a limit of 100,000 euros for a long time.
Now she has halved the allowance and even quartered for the daily allowance.
In a first step, the limit was reduced only for customers of the Group's Postbank division - to 50,000 euros for Giro and investment accounts and to 25 000 euros for daily cash accounts.
In the meantime, however, these lower free amounts apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as confirmed by a speaker on request.
Not only for new contracts, but also for "new individual agreements with existing customers".
The Commerzbank had already gone down to a limit of 50,000 euros, which is still valid, as is the case with ING Germany.
The DKB, which is particularly popular with cost-conscious customers, has reduced the free amounts in two stages, initially to 50,000 euros, and now to 25,000 euros.
After all, according to figures from the Verivox website, more than 100 banks now have an amount of 25,000 euros or less.
The Sparda bank Berlin has also arrived at 25,000 euros: however, there is still a legal dispute with the consumer centres, which in the first instance have been given the right to oppose this regulation before the Landgericht Berlin.
It is now being discussed in the banks whether the institutions should possibly make provisions - in the case that even the upper institutions have to declare the negative interest rates in principle inadmissible and many millions have to be paid back to bank clients.

Jennifer Aniston employs a whole beauty army
She's officially at the top of Hollywood now.
But their lives are like a mountain and valley ride.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was elected the most influential woman of the year by the U.S. magazine "The Hollywood Reporter".
For them, who in 2021 made the "Friends" reunion and the continuation of their series "The Morning Show" furious, this success is primarily the result of much discipline and work.
A whole army of assistants, stylists and trainers takes care of their appearance.
After all, says Aniston, she enjoys a chip a day (yes, read correctly: a ONE-TIME chip from the bag).
The fact that you are still flying to the hearts of the female and male fans is actually a miracle.
Maybe because she's just having luck - and still looking for great love.
And removed the baby wish from the list.
Before, she was constantly asked when she would become a mother.
It hurt her.
The people who asked me that have no idea what's going on with me personally, medically, why I can't.
It was really injudicing.
Keep hoping that also make success and fame happy.
Unworthy end of a career: Räikkönen must give up
Kimi Räikkönen's farewell to Formula 1 went even more quietly than I thought.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn took off the gloves and wiped the sweat from his forehead.
That's it.
After a driving error and a slight tire contact, Räikkönen did not even have to stop his Alfa Romeo after half of the race distance at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
It was his 349th and last Grand Prix, the "Iceman" finished his career in the motorsport kingship.
His wife, Minttu, and the two children also traveled to the United Arab Emirates for farewell.
Räikkönen's biggest success was the 2007 World Cup win in Ferrari.
He made 21 Grand Prix wins, started 18 times from the Pole and came 103 times to the podium. dpa
Friedrich gets 60th World Cup victory - Nolte wins in double bob - Sport
The brand of Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 successes is the goal of the Bobpilot.
"I figured this out, I would have to go nine and a half wins per season, then I could make it to Cortina 2026," said the double Olympic winner from BSC Oberbärenburg, who booked two successes in two days at the Winterberg races.
Only on Saturday he resisted the attack of Johannes Lochner by five hundredths, in which he drove from rank three to one.
Then he changed something about the material setting and went out a bigger lead on Sunday with 0.30 seconds.
With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle), he made his debut in front of the British Brad Hall.
The third was the Austrian Benjamin Maier.
"We have taken a greater risk today and have been rewarded," said Friedrich, who also entered his 22nd victory in series.
The Berchtesgadener Johannes Lochner, driving for Stuttgart, came to second place this time in fifth place.
Christoph Hafer of the BC Bad Feilenbach landed in eighth place after fourth place in the first race.
"If I knew what he was doing differently, I would do the same," said Lochner.
Nolte with home victory - podium for Jamanka
Laura Nolte won the third season victory in the second round of the season on her home track.
After only the fourth place in Monobob the day before, she competed for the World Cup victory in the German trio success with Deborah Levi.
Two-bob Olympic champion Mariama Jamanka from BRC Thuringia came second with Germany's fastest Sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
In addition to her Olympic qualification, she booked the first podium in this winter.
The Wiesbadener Kim Kalicki landed in third place with Leonie Fiebig.
For me it was super cool, first podium in the World Cup, I'm superhappy that Mariama takes me along.
I'm super happy with the development.
There is still a lot of potential at the start, but the start times today were okay," said Burghardt, stressing: "It is not just a push, but there is also a lot to do around here."
Jamanka got a little annoyed by the not completely faultless rides, but said, "It's going in the right direction."
I already had the blanket in the shopping cart and could buy it now!!!
What am I supposed to do?
I just didn't get it and therefore I can't redeem it, which is why I finally asked for it.
Through Corona I had quite different problems last year and never time for it.
And now it was said that he was running out of things that really annoyed me.
Look into the chat it was about the Asare seat.
I want to return it and then order again as it is just reduced :)
Why is shipping only started on 16.3.
There was nothing of such a long delivery time on your website
No only when I tap on it comes an extra field with the message
Was taken from your colleague yesterday.
Why is this a problem today?
I also sent you pictures of the incorrectly delivered goods.
But we still want the shelf module, a new undamaged
And don't cancel the entire order.
Just this day, just this week, just until XY...
Hello, great girls and girls and women,
I've got some things I just want to write and maybe the one - or the other one...
I'm 24, have kPTBS, full-time student and dogema - sometimes apart from my dog not screaming or going to kindergarten, he's actually 1 to 1 my child.
My friend (since 6J together) is ill, has got a second degree burn on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy).
Yesterday I visited him because I still have emotional needs and because I want to see and feel him, we have cuddled a lot and it was beautiful.
I helped him to shower (because hand is in the bandage wg burning).
He's cold on top of that and we see less (1-2x week) at the moment, which makes me very happy with my needs for affection and love.
My dog's kid just had stomach pain, I cooked for him, and now he's in his cuddly blanket and he's relaxed a little after I was with the heat lamp and caressed for him.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and she's just gone for a month.
Now there is also housework on us, which of course we split up.
But cooking myself is just a lot of work for me...
My PTBS disease is just fine, I'm well-treated and I'm good at it.
Not good, but I'll be fine, and I'm almost symptom-free.
My university just demands a lot (for me), tomorrow at 15h I have a written test for which I have not done anything yet and the day after tomorrow anatomy hours for which I should at least prepare a little bit.
And next week I have an oral exam on Tuesday, and what comes next is in my calendar and not in my head because there is no more room.
So my week goes like this: Only until the day after tomorrow, then it's weekend.
But after that the whole thing goes on?
It's only until the birthday.
Only until the start of the holiday.
Only until the weekend.
Just until...
And so it continues forever.
I think I'm just so stressed out that I need these spiritual clues because otherwise I'll pack it down.
Somehow I feel guilty and "chaotic," but otherwise I can't...
Is that how you feel?
Honestly, I'm infinitely grateful that I don't have to work.
Really infinitely grateful, I can't put that in words.
I don't know if I'd have survived my kptbs otherwise.
I think that has some to do with women's mental load, and that's why I thought I'd find some suffering friends here...
I definitely wish you a relaxing evening, the week is almost over!
I got my order today unfortunately the whole other color plus surface is scratched and table leg has print.
At the first delivery, the color was exactly like on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!
What can you offer me?
If we change the table now, do I get a different color or how?
The cancellation email was sent on 26.12.#NUMBER#.
Two more times, by the way.
But she was not confirmed.
Sometimes something completely different: I found in school at the time that many religious teachers don't believe in God and it's just another subject for them like math or geography.
For me, it was always a bit strange, perhaps also because I was raised Christian and I always believed in something like that.
How do you do?
Perhaps you can also tell about work and study colleagues with different attitudes.
Basically, I understand the difference between private and professional and it makes sense to separate.
It also gives a curriculum, etc.
But just as strange as having a physics teacher who doesn't believe in the theory of relativity.
What, then, makes one want to teach religion if one does not believe it?
True culture or something?
Hope you're not too private.
Can't it be changed or not?
That's been a long time, then I'd give up.
It's all right, thank you.
I expect feedback in time by the beginning of next week.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Film search Help please
Hello, dear people,
I am looking for a film from my childhood (in 24).
I think it's been a movie for young people.
In the film there are two time axes (or parallel worlds).
On the one hand, modernity (real world).
On the other hand, the past (or the realm of the dead) (not quite sure).
Since I can't describe it any closer in the real world there is a young woman.
And in the realm of the dead a young soldier (a uniform similar to that of the soldiers from the curse of the Caribbean).
For some reason, the paths cross and an action arises.
The Antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who wants to bring the woman into this kingdom in order to live for himself, I mean.
I believe the transition is also the soldier's graveyard.
In the end, I believe both soldiers are fighting each other.
If that's what you're saying, I'm grateful for every answer.
Our little one just slept on his stomach from week one.
Fast forward: still living :D
Relax.
Such a child endures much more than you think.
Make sure everything's right around here, no cussing animals, often go in and look, but don't watch for a minute.
That makes you crazy!
Fresh air in the room.
Good mattress.
No pillows.
Ahso and ours didn't have a sleeping bag, they always had a blanket.
Watch your child when it's asleep.
Is it turning your head aside?
Can it be raised from the belly?
Or is it in front of the face Directly in the mattress?
That's what you can deduce from whether everything's okay.
We all grew up, too, and when my husband came to the world, it was zb gang and would be that the kids were put on their stomachs to sleep.
In addition, we are already "strain customer" with you and have already bought a lot of products
But why do you only offer me EUR 20?
Hello, I wrote with a colleague of yours yesterday and so far no feedback.
It's about my wardrobe that arrived yesterday (order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right drawer does not fit in the closet.
I ask you to contact me as soon as possible.
The cabinet is currently not to be used.
To make it quite clear.
RBTV has promised a lot.
And yes, I know myself, not everything can be kept.
And I had a lot of fun with RBTV.
It's just that the politics of this broadcaster are now under the guise.
Almost every format is sponsored (ok), but then go on a big beggar tour at the same time.
It was said that you were an "independent" Internet sender.
Citation Arno: You don't want to be a running lint column.
What is it now?
A 0815 advertising station trying to bring his BilloMerch to the Elitefan.
And then we have Marah's Do's & Don'ts.
Of course, they apply to everyone except Simon and Etienne.
Of course, they can continue to insult people.
A Krogman who is completely lacking in empathy and at the expense of the action with the exploded rented rooms tries to make ash.
How do you like all this?
Great if you like it, I think it's terrible.
I ask for a call because my supplied wooden table was defective.

Is the battery broken?
Last night my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) was no longer loaded through my power supply.
I bought this new about 5 months ago, so it should still work.
I thought power supply alone would be sufficient for operation.
Incorrect display, the battery is empty and the laptop no longer starts despite inserted power supply.
That's why I've expanded the battery, but here, too, nothing's happening.
Do you have any ideas?
A new battery has been ordered, but why can't I use the laptop in grid mode?
Is something else broken?
Thank you for your help!
I would like to deliver the #PRS_ORG# to the room.
How can I book this?
I am interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.
But I don't know how high the seat is...
Often on tour and still a lot of equipment?
With the Everyday V2 Backpack by Peak Design no problem!
20 litres of capacity also swallow larger photo equipment without any problems that can be safely stowed with the padded FlexFold divider.
And what else you need on everyday items remains well organized and separable from the photo equipment thanks to practical accesses in the individually configurable interior.
With the "Update" of the Everyday Line to version 2 (V2), the series also presents itself in a new look.
The chic, minimalist design has it literally in itself - with the Everyday Backpack series Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpack while still providing quick access to photo equipment in seconds.
This works with two options: once conventionally via the lid flap, which can be closed with the MagLatch locking system, an excellently thought-out solution for effective protection, which has already proven itself at the Messenger Bags.
In this case, there is a metal fastener with matching anchor beams in the front of the backpack.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has thought of various "filling points": there are 4 anchor beams, solidly crushed, into which the closure hook can be hooked.
If the backpack is fully loaded, you just take the top bar, it's rather empty, a deeper one.
The flap closure and hooks are also magnetic.
Thus, the backpack can also be closed reliably without snapping the hook.
The second option also fundamentally distinguishes the Everyday Backpack from other, photo backpacks: In addition to the lid flap, there is a zipper opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the biggest disadvantage of traditional backpacks with access from above - you don't have to moan through the content anymore!
At the same time, this clever detail greatly enhances the everyday suitability of the backpack: for if you take not only your photo equipment, but also everyday items or luggage.
In the Everyday Backpack you can individually configure the interior (more about below) and thus easily store both of them separately - and access them independently through the two side openings.
So you can also pull the backpack from the right in front of the body, for example, to access the camera equipment in the right main compartment, while the everyday things stay safely in the left side of the backpack and do not get in between.
Comfortable, uncomplicated adjustable straps help.
And since the outer shell of the backpack is also completely made of 100% recycled, weather-resistant nylon, the content remains dry even if it is to go to Scotland in autumn.
Unfortunately, I am waiting in vain for the email from their support.
#NAME# gave me an email yesterday out of confirmation for commissioning the
Contact is announced by the freight forwarder to pick up the incorrectly delivered table.
So far, I haven't received a message.
I'm asking for immediate resolution.
I'm already writing with the third support employee, I didn't get any further than the promise that I'll get an email as confirmation.
It is the return of the incorrectly delivered Custom #NAME#
I mean, it's impossible when the cabinet could be delivered again.
To keep him that way is not an option for me...
It's working.
Many thanks for the help

hello, my order number is #NUMBER#.When will the article be delivered?
Order and payment was made on 12.1.21.
I was delivered a completely different lamp than I ordered
Please call me
If you extend the voucher to me, I will give you a larger order, but at least I kept the damaged piece of furniture and did not send it back.
And that last year went on differently than I thought, I couldn't imagine and just couldn't redeem and clarify it in time.
But I have the damage as a customer, and I don't accept that.
Rotary brake discs are designed for the requirements of the dynamic driver, which can be estimated reliability and safety when braking even under difficult conditions.
Rotary brake discs are made of cast and then mechanically worked (drilled and cut).
All tinted discs are produced in short series according to individual technical characteristics, which are specific to certain discs and patterns.
On the basis of the individual technical drawing, a special production program is created which, with the balancing of the disc, is based on the characteristics of the original assembly.
The tuned discs produced in this way ensure high comfort and braking efficiency.
Additional openings created increase the efficiency of the cooling of the disc, while cuttings improve the cleaning of the brake discs and brake pads.
Aesthetic properties of our tinted discs underline the character of each car through attractive and striking appearance.
Coloma is the city where an unexpected event shaped the history of the west coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man at the southern fork of the American River discovered luminous fragments in the water.
Although he tried to keep his discovery secret, the news spread rapidly and triggered the so-called "California Gold Rush" from '49.
Thousands came from near and far and made Coloma one of the fastest growing and thriving cities in the country.
Areas were set up, tents were set up, and Saloons and hotels were created almost overnight.
Everyone wanted their share of the country's wealth.
For many it was called "Coloma or Bust" (Coloma or Bankruptcy)!
In this game you are a pioneer who seeks wealth in the West and wants to make a name for yourself.
You will look for gold, recruit workers, drive horses together and build companies.
You will also have the opportunity to explore the surrounding rivercourses and adjacent areas.
You're not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You have to outsmart your fellow pioneers to avoid ruining the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast strategy game with many ways to win.
You choose your actions simultaneously, you have to create households with your resources and a tableau that "works" for you more and more (so-called "engine building").
The buildings on your Tableau allow you to become more efficient, to get additional actions or to turn rules to your advantage.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge plates, you can develop your individual playing style with fine adjustments.
Coloma plays over a period of three years from 1848 (the year in which the gold was discovered in Coloma) over 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush) until 1850 (the year in which California gained the official statehood).
One year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, players will be secretly and at the same time select a location on the schedule where they can perform actions.
After that, their selection is revealed and they place their pioneers in the appropriate locations.
If a location has most pioneers, it gets a lock!
These disable the half of the location - thereby reducing the possible actions there.
Then the players perform alternating actions, such as winning resources, moving cars, setting up tents, searching rivers, building bridges, opening shops and positioning revolvers.
When all the actions are completed, the pioneers return.
The laureate turns to a new location at the beginning of each round and thus changes the available actions.
This goes on until the praiser has moved five times, so every location has once hidden and the year ends.
There is a shooting in which players must defend Coloma from an attack by angry bandits.
If the players have contributed enough revolvers and the bandits are superior in numbers, they will receive rewards.
However, if they fail, they will receive less rewards or end up in the cemetery.
The game ends after the third shooting, then the final score takes place.
The player with most wins wins!

"Why children are not tyrants" Doku, ARD Mediathek
CW mental violence, sexual abuse, abuse of power
The ARD documentation has appeared in my Twitter timeline today, and I have looked at it immediately.
>The child psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a popular guest in talk shows and gives lectures throughout Europe.
With his book "Why Our Children Become Tyrants" (2008), he triggered a fierce education debate.
Former patient: women and educators are now making serious accusations against him.
Please be careful, the film is hard to bear.
And I am very grateful that many people now think and act differently.
We parents and others responsible must never, never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever

Holetschek: Countries advise on the deletion of the test requirement for triple vaccinations
At their next meeting, the health ministers of the countries want to decide on a nationwide waiver of the obligation to test three-fold vaccines.
"We countries quickly need clarity as to whether and from when the test requirement can be waived for three vaccines," said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), Chairman of the Health Minister Conference, the "Picture on Sunday".
The drop of 2G plus for triple vaccines is "not only medically meaningful, but also provides an additional impfanishment," said Holetschek.
Federal Minister for Health Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has promised that "he will make a proposal for this at the Health Minister Conference on Tuesday." − afp
So I want to send the lamp back.
How do I do that best?
Hello, I find the #PRS_ORG# chair very nice, but I can't see how high the seat is.
Can you help me?
I can't do any more shopping about my #PRS_ORG#.
Display: Ups, an error occurred.
Purchasing is done via the #PRS_ORG# page on the computer.
I updated account data.
What can this be about?
What you describe is called *Awareness*, i.e. sensory perceptions under full anesthesia.
These occur with a frequency of about 1 to 1000.
Most often it comes to hearing sounds/voices, rarer to see images and most rarely to perceive pain.
Relevant to this topic: Imperial cuts are the operations associated with an increased rate of Awareness, since to protect the child until the abstinence a very deep anesthesia is avoided.
Previous episodes of Awareness should be mentioned in an anaesthetic.
Certain anaesthesia procedures such as total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) are associated with a slightly increased risk.
**EDIT: Love everyone, this comment by me describes Awareness correctly, but had** u/Nitemarex **per definition none.
I read her comment wrong.
But the chair is defective.
Unfortunately, the 20€ doesn't help us either.
These are legal warranty claims.
The absolute minimum would be that they take back the defective chair.
In addition to the statutory obligation, this is also standard in the field of eCommerce.
Please check again if they at least take back the defective chair.
We'll sell the second chair in private.
We're losing a lot of money.
I've already sent you an e-mail that you haven't answered.
Again the question.
The order and invoice states that the goods are delivered to a room of my choice.
The freight forwarder is company #NAME#.
I just called there.
They told me that they only delivered at the door of the house - because of #PRS_ORG#.
Is that so?
If so, I must cancel the order as I do not know any person who can carry me the heavy furniture on the first floor.
I'm not going to call?
I had formulated a question
Theatre historian Günther Rühle 97-year-old died
He has been a theatre critic and director.
Later he wrote a monumental theatre story.
Günther Rühle died on Friday at the age of 97.
There is still the new book on the table, fresh in print: "An old man is getting older".
The shocking diarrhea of a slow farewell to the world led by the theatre historian and journalist Günther Rühle until April 2021.
And in the middle of the reading comes the news that the author died.
The last sentence in the book is, "I've testified here to my life's thanks."
There are different types of pallets.
One of the most common are European pallets, standardised wood pallets, which are used mainly as cargo carriers in the European area.
You are certified by the European Palette Association EPAL
According to statistics from Austria, more than ten million pallets were produced in Austria in 2020.
The production value was around EUR 79 million.
How many pallets are imported into Austria each year is not collected
New York gets MLS Championship for the first time
New York City FC won the title in the Major League Soccer for the first time.
After the 1:1 in the regular season against host Portland Timbers, the team from the Eastern Conference decided the final in a 4:2 shoot.
In the finals of the Eastern Conference, New York had won against Philadelphia Union, the team of the German Kai Wagner.
Raw Tips & Tricks
I had here a week ago got many great tips for the perfect gulasch.
That was for Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and buttery!
So thank you again for :)
Now I have come to the taste and want to cook the first time in New Year's Eve.
Tomorrow, I'll set up a cattle fund for that.
Do you have any other tips for me?
Note: I don't have an oven, but only a large pot.
How's it going now?
What about the books or how do I get them back on my #PRS_ORG#?
My English isn't that good anymore, but I'll get it.
IIt is about a refund of €#NUMBER#
I was already informed by e-mail on 18.01. that the refund was made.
But to this day the money has not been received from me.
Would you check it out, please?
Where there are still Christmas fries in the room Lübeck
For many people Gans or ducks belong to the Christmas days such as the fir tree and the gifts.
You haven't got any poultry yet?
We're running out of time.
We'll tell you where you can get another Christmas bread in Lübeck.
The "Drive" of a tube terminal contributes significantly to the heat and fat content of the guitar amplifier sound.
These features are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor circuit.
With the VOLUME, GAIN and MASTER VOLUME controller, you can set the desired level on the one hand and the distortion of your sounds on the other.
In addition, the VT+ series amplifiers offer a unique POWER LEVEL controller that allows you to reduce the sound level without changing anything on the "Gain" and the distortion.
On top of that, it already seemed that with the POWER LEVEL controller you can even float a power reserve when it goes loud.
Thanks to the POWER LEVEL controller, the full potential of the VT+ series can be used in any situation.
The headphone socket can also be used as a line output.
This signal is processed with a box simulation, so that even if you use a headphone or direct shots you get an excellent "acoustic" sound impression.
A CD or MP3 player can be connected to the AUX jack so you can jam to your favorite songs.
A tuner function is also on board - so you don't need a separate tuning device.
If you donate a VFS5 foot button in addition, you can also easily call the sounds by foot, turn on/off the effect blocks and "tap" the speed of the compatible effects.
This is actually essential for the live use.
With its new power packs, VOX is taking another step into the future!
But I saw it in others.
Is it then possible for you to send the lamp back?
Because it hangs too low over a dining table?
So I'd like to send her back.
Can you help me with that?
And the chest of drawers?
Do we get an update on the exact delivery date in the next few weeks?
Hello, they've been sitting on the #PRS_ORG# chairs
If it didn't work out, I'd be happy with a discount or a voucher.
I may find a buyer for the furniture.
Only more than 1,000 euros for goods that I do not need are then a lot.
I have just received my delivery and would like to know if screws were intended as part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# mirror (door) on the intended hook.
This is not a satisfactory answer and the waiting time has not been worth it
Is there a premium customer status with you?
Iran sees progress in negotiations on nuclear agreements
Progress has been made in the negotiations on the revitalisation of the International Atomic Energy Agreement, according to Iranian data.
"Both sides are about to agree on the issues that should be on the agenda," said Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri on Sunday of the news agency Irna.
This was a "positive and important development", as initially there was no agreement even on the issues to be discussed.
The agreement is intended to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Vienna talks to revitalise the agreement had continued after almost one week of interruption.
Negotiations involve negotiators from Iran, Germany, Great Britain, China, France and Russia.
A US delegation is also present in Vienna, but only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia overtakes Saxony - Free State now federal state with highest Corona incidence
Thuringia has replaced Saxony and currently has the highest incidence nationwide.
As the only federal state, the value is above the mark of 1000.
As the only federal state, Thuringia was over the brand of 1000 at the Corona incidence on Sunday.
The Robert Koch Institute reported the seven-day value with 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which had at last always shown the highest incidence nationwide, this value was 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday the incidence in Thuringia had fallen slightly, but had also been above the value of 1000.
In Thuringia, 2242 new infections with the Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 other deaths associated with infection were reported within one day.
200 heavy on Covid-19 Sick people were treated intensively in hospitals on Sunday.
There may be delays in reporting on weekends.
In addition, the health services have been overburdened for weeks and hardly come behind with the recording of new cases.
I understand.
As delivery takes place only early March, it may be possible until then.
I have to print it out and stick it to the package and post it to the post office, right?
here I don't need to click/enter/fill anything else?
That's exactly what I want to avoid. That's why I'm writing to you.
I would like to accept the return at my own expense.
8 euro return fee is a naughtiness in my eyes.
It's time for change
###MBundestag have greeted me, I am u/StratorDE in the Chamber in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
#What's this post for?
If you look at the activity in the past months of MBundestag, you can see one thing: it is not existing.
We have come into a winter star and have extended the summer hole to several months.
#Where's the problem?
Yeah, what was it all about?
For the most part, this should simply be related to the dissatisfaction, how some things have been done here and how we generally stand.
In the last few days, the impression has been growing that many here really still have Bock on MBundestag.
#What we need to change
At this point, the community around the MBundestag is asked who wants to keep it alive.
The start came from u/edizVEVO, who has become aware of this project in the last few days and has found, simply put, a cluster of shards.
After a few writings, several people from the community have found themselves wanting to rebuild the project.
However, I would also like to expressly call on everyone once again to participate, only in this way can this project continue to exist in the future.
We have created a discussion platform in the form of a discord server on which we can exchange views and work out concrete things.
You can join the server via this link.
Objectives:
* How will MBundestag work in the future?
* Which existing orders must be modified / adapted / removed?
* How should we act in the future?
* How are new members to be recruited?
* How do we create a fair electoral system?
I'm pretty sure I've forgotten a lot, but it's not bad, so we have the discord at the end.
If you have a desire and time, come to the discord, work with us and let us decide democratically on the future.
I ordered a lampshade for you to be delivered.
Now I see that the article is too large/clumsy for it and not suitable for my taste.
I have already ordered a different suspension from you.
I put it together and noticed this when I took the soft foam.
Very sad about that.
I hope that this will be returned and I have a full refund.
This is also quite sad, as the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have one more question: the day cover #PRS_ORG#, are there also in oversize, i.e. in 240/240 for example?
#PRS_ORG# must guarantee me that the faulty cabinet is picked up in time.
And I'm asking you to do that now.
I don't have a suitable packaging, but will dismantle the cabinet as far as possible for the collection - they have to clarify with #PRS_ORG# how this can work.
#PRS_ORG# can contact me by phone at any time to arrange a pick-up date.
Is there a instructions for assembly?
How long would I have time to get these or decide to return them?
How do you answer the question why you are vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague I like.
She herself has lived vegetarianly for a while, at the moment it is very rare to eat meat.
I myself used to be a vegetarian for a few years.
To the question of whether I have always wanted to be vegan and vegetarianism was a planned intermediate step, I answered honestly without much thought.
And that I thought for a long time that as a vegetarian, I would support animal welfare, but at some point I reflected and understood that in the end I also support animal torture.
Therefore, my decision to become vegan.
At the moment, I had the impression that misbehaved on her side, then she defended vegetarianism and thought she knew where her flesh came from and was reduced as a vegetarian animal suffering.
Now I wonder if my answer was to 'plomp'?
How do you answer the question?
Have the feeling that as a vegan one is quickly put into a corner and conflicts arise without being put on it.
It greets a harmoniously loving vegan (;
This is clearly not an exception under § 312d BGB.
Your #PRS_ORG# do not exempt you from the legal requirements for remote sales.
I am not picking up my return on the spot at the assigned date.
Since I can't be on site because of a funeral, that can't be changed either.
Can I have an alternative pick-up date?
From the 01.02.#NUMBER# I am constantly back.
Lahnsteiner Wehr equipped for water rescue: 45.000 Euro grant from the country
Recently, the Rhineland-Palatinate Interior Minister Roger Leventz presented to Mayor Peter Labonte a grant of 45.000 euros for the new equipment car Water rescue of the volunteer fire department Lahnstein.
The total cost of the vehicle in use since November 2020 was EUR 135,000.
A good and important investment in security.
I am pleased that the country of Rhineland-Palatinate supports us in this," says Lahnstein's mayor Peter Labonte.
The equipment car is used by the Lahnstein diving staff, one of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Over and under water, they perform tasks in water and ice rescue as well as technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, the boom of hotel shipping on the Rhine and Moselle as well as the further increasing use of the Lahn as a leisure river contribute to this.
I bought myself a book that I could only read 10% and then the problems started.
I can't open the book.
However, I followed their recommendations but have synchronized, removed and the app reloaded has NOT worked.
I am a little frustrated because the whole action has taken me a lot of time and I hope for help now.
Okay, that's it.
I would like to order 3 items from the collection of #PRS_ORG# in June.
Can I enter an appointment in the order process?

First of all, thank you for taking up the whole thing here, I have also spent almost a decade in the state service in a similar activity, we were also arms bearers in the executive, I don't want to go into it any further!
I always find the question of right and left very simple.
In principle, however, it should be said that, of course, the state servant comes from the liberal to conservative spectrum rather than from the revolutionary left, which should be clear to everyone.
That of course also in the special uniform and armor bearers people to the right of conservative magically attract should also be clear to everyone that these people can then of course be difficult to deal with the living reality is of course also clear, because of course you have, in addition to the average white man, meanwhile many Germans with migrant background, women and also homosexuals (and now I do not mean the exaggerated feminine clichés, because these are in the executive rather less than at all but quite normal men and women to whom you do not notice when they don't tell you) and I can and must rely on these people as well, because in doubt they save your life or use it for you.
But these marginal groups also represent even if my experience sounds strange for the first time, because they are proud of Germany and feel less picked up by excessive left-wing politics, even if this policy is supposed to work for them or if it means it needs to be right for them, they simply want to be treated normally.
Back to the right, since, of course, police and armed forces are also a cross section of society, one will also find extreme rights there, but they may openly express their opinion there or even openly forge any state-threatening plans is totally exaggerated and annoys me as well.
Of course, even policemen and soldiers who were often in a foreign operation often start to break down due to negative experiences and even say things that are controversial to politically incorrect.
It also happens that certain right-wing consorts meet who are engaged in a lively exchange of thoughts.
Nevertheless, my opinion is well combated and countered by political education and enlightenment!
Germany is so very internationally entangled and that is also good in my opinion that we could not afford to have real racists and Nazis in our ranks at all!
Yes, what I don't understand, I also ordered the other basket on the German side.
Why should this come from England?
When I ordered, it wasn't sold out.
I ordered already in November.
it was confirmed to me in your confirmation of the order
It's still about my order, which is no longer available.
I've been chatting with #NAME# before.
Alternatively, you could still deliver the other #PRS_ORG# basket for #NUMBER# euro in black to Germany or this basket is also available somewhere in Germany.
I always find you as a partner company.
But at the top of the edge of the wood part are two deep rods filled with something yellow
and on the mirror itself is a small scratch
More orderly through a child?
Hello, me (w32) has been busy one thing for a long time.
I am very disciplined and organized at work, (in self-employed, very little free time), but all my life I get it more bad than right to lead my household permanently clean and orderly.
There are always phases in which everything remains, and then and when it takes me and I clean up and clean up.
But it is actually never so 'that someone could come to visit spontaneously'.
My husband is not (unfortunately) better either, although it disturbs me somewhere but usually loses household simply against work and unhappiness.
The kitchen is still cleaned the most regularly as we like to cook.
Now to my question, did you manage to become more orderly with a child?
We don't have anything yet, but we've been working on it, and this question has been my concern for a long time.
For I have no incentive, it just doesn't bother me as long as there is no visit and for example always fresh clothes and the kitchen can be used.
Do you have a bigger incentive with a child or do you stay sluggish?
Look forward to your answers.

Career in social work - as someone with a self-insecure personality disorder?
I have been training in the field of software development and have been educated for about a year now.
Unfortunately, I notice more and more that this profession is not the right one for me, which is why I have been thinking about re-starting and studying social work for a long time.
The problem: I have a self-insecure (or anxiety-avoiding) personality disorder (ÄVPS).
This means roughly that I have no self-esteem and am accordingly shy.
I have no problem talking to people on a factual level, but I find it very difficult to have relaxed conversations and I have been told more often that I seem improbable (which I think has already improved).
Can I become such a social worker?
I do not want to work as a street worker or in the open youth meeting, but rather in, for example, addiction counselling or family help.
However, I do not know whether the actual working day is really the way I imagine it is, and it is difficult to find something on the Internet.
The ÄVPS already leads to problems in my job (for me, emotional) because it drags me down every time there is something to object to in my code ("even if things are simple again) and it is hard for me to ask more experienced colleagues for help ("I should really know myself how it is going"/"I keep him from working with my stupid questions"/"who really has to think me less mean" etc.).
I'm probably going to have the problems in every profession, but I wanted to mention it in the place.
But did you get the sofa back?
Because there was no confirmation of this either.
I'm waiting for an appointment for pick-up
What do you mean by giving it back?
If I have downloaded a book on the #PRS_ORG#, the message will not be your #PRS_ORG# authoring this book
Are there any problems?
I was in the chat with #PRS_ORG# who asked me if I had received a delivery confirmation for my closet.
The protein (protein) absorbed with the feed divides the bird into the individual protein building materials (amino acids) in its gastrointestinal tract and builds up its own protein substances, which it also needs to form feathers.
The formation of feathers in the nestling and the re-formulation of feathers in the muttering bird are extremely complex processes and for the overall organism of the animal are associated with a particularly high stress.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio must not be administered during breeding as there may otherwise be disturbances in the course of breeding.
Following this curative administration of NECTON-Bio, the daily vitamin supply with NECTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NECTON-MSA (mineral substance preparation) should be resumed.

1 g of NECTON-Bio on 250 ml of water or 100 g of soft food.
It is recommended to prepare as much drinking water/soft food as the bird consumes daily and to change water/feed daily.
A deleted measuring spoon (inline) corresponds to 1 g of NECTON-Bio.
In case of severe plumage damage, the double or triple dose of NEKTON-Bio can be given at the beginning until the approach to re-formulation is visible.
Thereafter, the normal dose is reached until the spring remodelling is complete.
Storage: NECTON-Bio should be stored dry without sun exposure, between 15° and 25°C.
Excuse me, but the chair is sold as an office chair.
How can an office chair be broken after 9 months ?
The warranty claims in Germany are 24 months.
This is really very bad service.
Hello, I sent an e-mail on Monday to inform you that my order has arrived damaged and pictures have been attached.
Did you receive this e-mail?
Statement by a member of the congregation in reply to the Statute
Hello r/LegaladviceGerman,
I have the following problem.
A walnut tree is to be liked on our property.
So the request for a case to the municipality is made.
An employee writes to me that the fall of fruit trees and thus the walnut is not part of the statute.
However, in the statutes, the walnut is explicitly indicated as a protected tree.
Can I now rely on the employee's statement or not?
On the one hand, I have to be able to rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the statutes are clear.
Thank you for your answers.
We understand that.
Then we will use them new packaging for it.
I have not received any message
Well, then I still have a sofo without use.
Could you offer me a discount or a voucher?
What was more expensive?
Yes, I think that's the only question is whether I can pay in euros and have the ceiling delivered to Germany.
Can you check it out?
Eilmeldung: heavy traffic accident at Self
Recently, a serious traffic accident occurred on St. 2179 between Selb-Nord and Plößberg.
As the police press alarm recently announced (14:03 p.m.), a car came into the traffic counter when overtaking it.
There are injured.
Oh, okay.
Well, thank you so much again for being so easy!
Advice and ideas for more careers
For the first time Merry Christmas to you!
My Christmas is, unfortunately, moderately good, because my dear head is just thinking about everything you can think about.
Before I get out here .. in short: I need advice and best of people who know my situation somehow - so of you.
I'm just doing the Ref as a cross-border beginner.
Originally, I studied something else and also worked there in one area (to stay at least a little anonymous, I don't call anything more precise here).
But all of this was too boring for me and I looked for alternatives that could make me more fun.
At some point, I ended up at the Magisterium and was sure that it is - even if the framework conditions are much more inflexible than in my previous profession, but I didn't care.
I have now arrived at the third "I google other job offers".
And it's only been six months.
At the times before, I have always decided to continue and at least stop the Ref, after which I can still turn around.
But right now I'm absolutely done.
I've had so little free time in the last month that I've been completely exhausted.
Now there is a holiday, but there is still a lot of work waiting for me.
Before the Ref I always thought I was stress-resistant, but there was also my weekend and my celebration evening.
That's where I was off duty.
And the stress at work didn't matter in the moments.
Now the family party is too much stress for me.
And then there are these rigid structures that also irritate me.
Basically, it's fun and from the outside, the Ref also runs well in terms of feedback and so on.
But I'm completely exhausted and I wonder how much stress my body can bear before it closes completely - if he doesn't.
I wonder if I would like to have this for the rest of my working life - just when I read some of your contributions here - or if I should not go back to the old area, because where I was valued, I could take my free time if I needed it, and the work was somehow boring, but was adequately paid for it, and together in a team what worked out and not as an individual fighter like this is most of the time.
But then I wonder if I will not have arrived again in the same place in a year as I am now and dissatisfied.
You realize it's all kind of messy, but maybe you have as outside advice or ideas, like I get out of this situation that I'm completely done and start crying at the slightest thought of it.
I'm not going to make decisions that emotionally right now, which probably leads to nothing good.
But perhaps your views will help me to see at least a little light at the end of the tunnel - or to enjoy Christmas, that's enough for me for the first time.
Thank you for reading and apologize for my whimsical undertone.
I hope my situation has at least become a little clear.
Since its introduction in 2001, the VOX Valvetronix series has been constantly evolving, which has led to the combination of advanced modelling technology with the "Valve Reactor" circuit, which perfectly replicates the behaviour of a tube amplifier.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X Amps we present a brand new modeling engine, which is absolutely up-to-date in terms of sound.
Thanks to VET technology (Virtual Element Technology), which is based on the analysis of components and amp circuits, the VTX amplifiers are waiting with an authenticity, which is absolutely impressive.
Of course, these amps also contain the multi-stage Valvetronix tube preamp.
This is partly based on real analog circuits, because they get the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier better than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated circuit, the VTX amplifiers offer a closed housing and a bass reflex system from which the natural resonances only sprang.
With VOX's "Tone Room" software, you can even correct and bend historical facts on the virtual level until the amp and effects sound as you have always imagined.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the VOX Valve reactor technology presented in 2001.
Since then, of course, it has been refined several times in order to meet new added sound requirements, which once again led to a boost in the performance of the VOX Valvetronix series in 2010 - with more dynamics as well as more numerous and significantly improved amplifier models.
From the handy VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series was also designed so that all guitarists will find a maximum sound range here.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amp: they expect a bold sound, a nuanced play of game dynamics and string stroke as well as a prompt speech.
During an in-depth analysis, the VOX engineers discovered that the final stage in particular determines the tube character of an amplifier and developed the VOX Valve reactor technology based on this finding.

The defeat series of Orlando Magic in the NBA stops.
The Wagner brothers can shine - but not enough to win the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points by Franz Wagner and seven counters by his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost at the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday 104:106.
The main compartment is also adaptable: with three individually positioning and foldable Velcros it is tailored to the needs of your photo equipment and is therefore suitable for any type of camera - from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes to full-format mirror reflectors.
What ultimately fits into the backpack depends, of course, on the size of the camera and the lenses.
A possible fitting would be a DSLR camera with a fixed lens, two to three alternating lenses and a plug-in flash.
Larger DSLM cameras like the different models of the Sony a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 leave room for further lenses.
You can also store a lot of accessories.
And whoever has a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E-series) can use the backpack for his equipment and for photos.
Drone drivers also make an optimal choice with the Everyday Backpack 20L, as the backpack offers sufficient space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Volcanic eruption on La Palma: probably the longest in history
In the almost three months since the outbreak, lava flows on the Canary Islands have caused great damage.
Is an end in sight?
With a duration of 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma has been the longest in the famous history of the Spanish Canary Islands since Sunday.
So far, the eruption of the Tehuya volcano in 1585 was 84 days the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa.
There are no reliable data on past outbreaks.
The activity of the still nameless volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has decreased somewhat in recent days, but volcanologists still dared not predict when it could end.
The indicators indicate a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable," said Mariano Hernández Zapata, President of the Island Council, the state TV channel RTVE.
Damage in million heights
In the almost three months since the outbreak began, the more than 1000 degrees hot lava has destroyed almost 2,900 homes and other buildings, as RTVE reported.
Nearly 1,200 hectares were covered by a m thick lava layer.
This corresponds to almost 1700 football fields.
More than 7,000 residents had to be evacuated, the damage is estimated at more than 900 million euros.
Off the coast formed by coldened lava two new landings with a total size of about 50 hectares.
It was particularly affected by the huge banana cultivation, of which about half of the approximately 85,000 inhabitants live directly or indirectly and which was already in crisis before the volcanic eruption.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, other areas severely affected, wrote the newspaper "El País".
Christmas and the Gifts
Christmas is at the door and especially the children will hardly be able to expect the heavenly feast.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree have been associated with the spiritual atmosphere and the shivering tension of something seductive in itself.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that still hold our increasingly divided society together.
It is all the more important to become aware of the Christmas tradition of giving, so that the gesture of giving, which according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss was a peaceful "social contract of natural peoples" that can escape rigid routine and be refilled with life in the context of this tradition.
How Nikolaus became the Christchild
Strictly speaking, it was the Protestants who closely linked the Christmas days with the gift.
Previously, gifts were presented in one way or another on Nikolaustag.
The background of this still popular custom is that Saint Nicholas, as Bishop of Myra, secretly threw three women into her window in one night to save them another life in sin.
From this unconventional kind of gift, the popular custom in Germany was to fill the boots with gifts, especially for the children.
Protestants encountered this custom because they reject mediators between God and man as "holy devotion".
For these reasons, they shall defend themselves against the institution.
Martin Luther made the Christkind out of Nikolaus and thus established a new line of tradition.
The focus of the gift thus shifted to the Christmas Eve.
However, since most Protestants no longer see such detailed questions so closely, it only annoys the least that the custom of Saint Nicholas is similar to Martin's use of Martinssingen and Martin's move is still an integral part of the pre-Christmas period.
Today you will find in boots in front of the door and under the Christmas tree from socks to coveted luxury watches all that the heart desires.
Variety of traditions in Christian countries
Sources show a tradition of giving since the 13th century on the day of Saint Nicholas.
With the Reformation, the day of the gift shifted on Christmas Eve.
In all Christian countries, however, there is a joyful Kuddelmuddle about the question of who is now bringing the gifts to the children.
In Germany, it depends on the region concerned whether the Christkind appears on the Holy Evening or the Santa Claus, who is in principle a kind of Nikolaus, who has been assigned some peculiarities over time.
This includes, for example, his white beard, which has little in common with the rather strict Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his sled, which is pulled by reindeer and the preference of the fireplace to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas remains the central figure at Christmas.
In Spain the Holy Three Kings give the gifts, while in Italy it is the witch Befana who must have shown them the way to the child of Jesus.
In Scandinavia sometimes fables bring gifts, while in Russia it brought some fame to Father Frost.
Here it is not reindeer, but three horses that pull his sled as a troika.
In the Czech Republic, the mother country of the Reformation during the Hussite Wars, the Christkind is responsible for handing over the gifts.

Police are shooting suspected bank robbers near the Royal Palace
Near the Kensington Palace in London, an armed man was shot by the police on Saturday.
The police told me that callers had reported a man who was supposed to have gone to a bank with a gun and a bookmaker's business.
According to the authorities, the man fled in a vehicle that could be stopped by officials a little later.
Shots had been shot and the man had been hit.
He was still declared dead at the crime scene.
The police didn't come from a terrorist background.
Several messages are located in the area around the Kensington Palace.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine and the three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.
Which one?

The decorative lamp fits harmoniously into each bed, garden area or stone garden.
The lamp is simply set up and can be anchored with 2 earthspikes in the ground.
Integrated and powerful 0.4 Watt solar module for optimal charging of the built-in battery.
Lamp duration max. 10 h.
- The robust plastic design can be used in the outdoors all year round.
In the Hollywood spectacle there are usually threatening objects from distant galaxies that glow inwardly colored.
Quite harmless, on the other hand, is »Smart Stone«: The sun alone ensures that this solar light shines in a fascinating way – either in white or coloured light (in six different shades).
The edgeless, amorphous design is deliberately chosen: Like a natural large pebble, this modern light object presents itself by day.
Its organic rounds fit into any natural environment – whether on the edge of the terrace, in the lawn or in the stone bed.
He also does well in the neighborhood of larger pebbles and findlings, where he knows how to claim himself thanks to his size.
You can save yourself a lot of preliminary work: As a solar light, »Smart Stone« does not require any input or batteries.
Set the 'Lightstone' to an arbitrary, sunny place during the day.
Two supplied earth skewers provide a firm hold if necessary.
The matt white plastic shell itself is robust and weatherproof.
His solar module hides »Smart Stone« discreetly in its interior, together with its battery and two LEDs – one for white, the other for coloured light.
The battery is already charging when sunlight falls on the housing.
When dawn breaks in, »Smart Stone« will start to shine automatically; in which color, you decide for yourself: Six attractive colours of light will be your choice – apart from daylight white.
The switch-off will also take place automatically as soon as the battery charging stand has dropped to a specified minimum or it becomes bright again.
As soon as the sun shines again, the charging cycle starts the next day from the front.
I've done that several times, it doesn't work.
Too bad, I would have liked to order further from you, but if the voucher is not charged to me, I will not, in principle, order any more.
If you think otherwise, let me know.
Otherwise, it was the last contact today.
Then please send me the number for the sideboard.

Pill problems
Hello, dear women's people,
I hope I do everything right here, is after a year reddit actually my first post.
To my problem: I started taking the pill again about five years ago, mainly because I had so incredibly bad pain during the period and shit PMS before the period.
Now I would like to leave this behind because I have to take enough medications because of chronic diseases that I can't choose.
My main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but my skin.
At my last two-year break, I had received from 0 to 100 explosive picks and these everywhere.
So far so superficial, but I was quite burdened and I didn't feel comfortable.
In the two years of break, the whole thing never really normalized.
Maybe someone has some tips to avoid this time.
Perfume-free and without candy, my cosmetics are already, but maybe there's something someone can recommend to me.
Unfortunately, the female doctor didn't take me so seriously and the dermatologist is still coming.
Thank you very much to everyone who has read the novel!
Yes, the dear skin is such a thing.
Had pre-bupertary severe neurodermatitis, then a time of rest, then large-area nodules braiding and the acne theme.
I have also tried all kinds of food in the course of Chr. disease and have remained on ner sugar, milk and meat poor mixed food, because otherwise nothing has worked so well.
It may also be good that Hormonell is just the worm in it, but if you have a construction site like me everywhere, you'd rather not go looking for what's still going on.
I already had all her colleague semina o. ä.
Written and now I have lost the conversation and do not know what was answered to my concerns.
I always have to work in between and on the phone and suddenly everything was gone...
What is there to check if the money were there, I would have seen it
Please check my bank details, maybe there was something wrong.
But there's him in general in big

110 kV earth cable is being newly built in 2022
The authorization for the installation of the new high-voltage cable at Tann is legally valid.
The plan-making decision of the government of Lower Bavaria paves the way for construction to begin in 2022.
This was now communicated to the network operator Bayernwerk.
The approximately seven-kilometre-long earth cable will connect the Tann branch in the north of the municipality and the existing 110-kilovolt line between Simbach and parish churches.
The cable is connected near the village of Edermanning at Reut to a mast of the free line.

Ref: Teaching plan (EC)
Hello, ladies and gentlemen,
I have been in the Ref since summer, teaching is fun, but I still have great problems to plan my lessons in the field of earth science time-efficiently.
Unfortunately, my school is technically not well equipped, so in principle I can only use the board, the school book and a OHP as a medium.
In the school I can also only copy b/w for free (which is annoying).
I just need a very long time right now to plan my hours.
For example, we are currently doing the topic of geofactors and I actually have every hour of it.
In principle, the methods always repeat themselves, but on the other hand, I do not want to invest too much time for simple lessons (I also need them for UBs, etc.).
When planning, I always start from the learning goal (what I want to achieve) and then think about how I can build it (usually I create a worksheet with texts from books that my school doesn't have).
We have the book Terra and with most tasks in the book I am rather dissatisfied.
For this reason, the worksheets are also available.
Maybe I can work with an Earth teacher on how to work with the book in a time-efficient way.
I'd really appreciate it.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from the order #NUMBER#.
I have already decided on a new one at #PRS_ORG# but I would like to do the return as soon as possible.
The trade fears about Christmas business because of the 2G-rule.
In most shops, only those who have been vaccinated or healed are allowed.
Trade considers this unnecessary and complains of sales disruptions.
He also has a possible solution.
From the perspective of the German Trade Association (HDE), the 2G rules corrupt the retail sector's important Christmas business.
Businesses with non-daily demand had to complain about revenue cuts, HDE Chief Executive Stefan Genth criticised.
According to a recent survey of HDE among 1100 retailers, more than 70 percent of the companies looked negatively at the remaining days of the year.
Many would have already written off the Christmas business.
"What should actually be the positive climax of the year is now often a hole without soil," said Genth.
Dealers with 2G access restrictions thus lost almost one third of their pre-crisis revenues in the past week.
It runs well only in the food retail as well as in the online sector.
The association called for consequences from the dramatic development.
Purchasing with a mask, distance and hygiene concept is a safe matter, said the chief executive.
"2G when shopping does not take us further in the fight against the pandemic," he stressed.
The current regulations deterred customers and required a high level of personnel use.
He called for the ban to be approved nationwide.
After that, each customer had to be controlled only once on 2G (vaccinated or cured) and would have access to all transactions with the received volume on that day.
In addition, as in the case of the 3G rule (vaccinated, recovered or tested), sampling should be sufficient in the retail trade.
The real estate company Deutsche Euroshop, which specializes in shopping centres, also spoke of a difficult Christmas business.
The frequencies were last without 2G at a good 75 percent of the pre-Corona level, sales at about 90 percent.
These figures will now surely fall in the middle of the so important Christmas business," said CEO Wilhelm Wellner of the "Economic Week".
Due to the high level of personnel and administrative effort, the Centre is trying to find and approve solutions.
This includes the so-called tape solution, in which "visitors can, for example, at a central point in the center once provide their 2G-proofing and then - equipped with a bracelet similar to that in a club hotel - enter all shops undisturbed". dpa
I have recently ordered and delivered the #PRS_ORG#.
The mirror has a scratcher and on the frame is also an error that was attempted with a yellow filler.
That looks bad.
I would like to return the mirror and have already packed it back into the package and glued it.
How do I have to proceed for the return now?
The lamp is designed for dual balance, based on new, flat SMD LEDs with high performance and high color rendering.
A modern microprocessor with exceptional possibilities ensures the setting of the colour temperature and brightness of the lamp.
In addition to the adjustment of brightness, there are two standard colour temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to manually set and store the colour temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K.
Use the current settings in the flash memory.
A special feature of the controller, it is simple and intuitively operable.
The lamp creates a very luminous flux with soft light of high quality, completely flicker-free.
The beam angle of 120 degrees with which you can illuminate large areas at relatively small distances is excellent.
By the way, also in reporter situations in small rooms or short distances.
You can adjust the brightness practically without changing the color temperature.
It is a great tool to work both on the film set or in the studio.
The optional DMX512 controller allows the remote control of the lamp in television studios or when the lamp is mounted at hard-to-reach locations.
At the back of the lamp is the control panel, it consists of buttons and a luminous display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
Furthermore, there is the slot for the NP-F batteries (not included)
User memory The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
To perform the settings of the individual settings on the storage places, simply press and hold one of the memory keys for a longer time.
The memory controller stores the current state of the lamp when it is switched off, so that the known situation is restored when it is switched on - very practical when it comes to studio work, for example, when the camera is set to certain colour temperatures.
Working with battery one of the biggest strengths of the DL3120 functionality is the possibility of operating with cheap NP-F battery.
These are often already in the possession of photographers and cameramen (and women) - so you can use existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check before the set if the batteries have enough power - it is a battery tester equal to the built-in one - for each of the two battery compartments a value in the two display displays (the left battery upper indicator, the right on the lower display).
In addition, it is of course possible to continuously supply the headlamp with electricity via the supplied power supply.
The construction of the headlight is very simple.
For fixing you have a 16mm sleeve as a connection, so you can directly access your photo stand.
The inclination is reliably adjusted by means of fixators on both sides.
It was taken care that the mechanical components are also extremely high-quality and are therefore also designed for longevity and hard use.
In addition, a tilt joint is included in the scope of delivery.
Great is that which is also included in the delivery.
So you can safely transport or store the lamp with all the accessories you might want to buy, without any problems.
Too bad I got that gift and it's too small :(
"Party that we wanted to throw": Frankfurt celebrates a rich comeback against Leverkusen
What a spectacular reaction of Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the last two times in a series of Hessens were supposed to be on their way to the next Bundesliga-Pleite.
But then the SGE turned up, and within a good hour the frustration arose over a well-grown start of the season of the soul and won furios with 5:2. "It is madness what the boys did today", coach Oliver Glasner cheered at DAZN and spoke out a "Pauschal praise, to every single one who was with us."
At first, it looked like a new damper for the Frankfurters who are still in rank nine behind their expectations.
Patrik Schick had led the Leverkusener with 2:0.
What happened then also impressed the SGE trainer.
"The way the players came back and showed a fantastic performance," continues Glasner.
I'm insanely happy with the performance we've shown and, of course, with the result.
Even defender Christopher Lenz, who was able to stand back in the square for the first time since the fourth day of the game and his overcome muscle injury, stressed the morals of his teammates.
"I think our mentality is incredibly great," said the 27-year-old and was looking forward to seeing the result especially for the audience.
That was the party we wanted to throw today.
Glasner now wants to keep the focus on the upcoming tasks, but also looks forward to the staff situation.
It is exceptional that we have all players fit in December that all players are physically in a top constitution.
It is top work in our medical department, but also the players live highly professional.
Now you want to go "step by step and stay modest" and "go through the tasks at this level" by the turn of the year.
The next one is an off-road game at Borussia Mönchengladbach (18.30 a.m., Sky) on Wednesday in the course of the English week.
Grades I get the mail that my package comes back to you due to a mistake on my part.
I tried to call #PRS_ORG# and let it redirect, no chance.
Can it be sent to me directly again or do I have to wait until the money is returned and the order is returned?
I would say that I will not order again because it has already taken a long time.
Have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
Damping for handball women in front of quarterfinals against Spain
After the humiliation against Denmark, Germany's handball women scolded with hanging heads and empty looks from the parquet.
At the conclusion of the World Cup main round, the DHB selection at 16:32 (8:13) paid a hard defeat to 800 spectators in Granollers and now has to face host Spain in the quarter final.
"We were much too anxious and had too much respect for the opponent," said Federal coach Henk Groener.
We must act differently against Spain.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany closed the main round group III with 8:2 points as second behind the Danes (10:0).
I'm sorry we couldn't take the flow.
This was a bad game we have to erase," said Captain Emily Bölk.
In the fight for the move to the semi-finals, a significant increase against the 2019 World Championships will have to come on Tuesday to keep the delicate dream of the first medal alive since 2007.
The best German hostess in the Duell with the three-time Olympic champion Denmark was backroom player Alina Grijseeels with six goals.
"We just weren't there - neither in attack, nor in defense," admits backspace player Xenia Smits, demanding: "We have to look forward quickly."
From front to back not at the height
In contrast to the previous five tournaments, the German team with the pitcher was not on high.
Mistakes and technical faults in the attack and gaps in the defense were responsible for a quick 0:4 rest after seven minutes.
Only Torfrau Dinah Eckerle was immediately at operating temperature and prevented with some parades worse.
The first goal was achieved by the DHB team after 9:30 minutes, when Grijseels successfully completed a quick run-off.
However, the initial inflammation was not expected.
Against the aggressive coverage of the Danes, the German women could hardly stand in the picture - and if so, they mostly failed at the strong Althea Reinhardt in the gate of the Scandinavian women.
Thus the game had run early at 3:10 after 20 minutes, especially since backroom player Mia Zschocke saw red a little later because of a hard foul at her opponent.
However, she is allowed to take part in the quarterfinals again.
It was only in the final phase of the first half that the DHB selection came a little better into play and up to the break at least five goals.
The only quiet hope of a catch-up after the change was already gone after seven minutes at 9:19.
Once again, the Greens were sinning in all areas and made it easy for the well-off opponent, who is one of the medal candidates at the final round.
As a result, the German team was no longer able to achieve an increase in performance and went as a clear loser from the parquet.

Is that what they're doing?
The title is available, I am active as a vaccine in mobile vaccination teams, in which (to date only) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is vaccinated, especially in nursing homes.
As they are ready to go to a large extent soon, it goes on in vaccination centres for me.
I like to answer questions without a time limit to the organizational and human aspects and also medical questions, unless they are related to a personal one (e.g. "I take medicine X, it deals with the vaccination.").
In my field of work, the information for vaccination, indication (Person is entitled to a vaccination according to the Corona vaccination regulations and no reason to speak against) is the medical documentation and, if necessary, the emergency care in case of allergic reactions (I have never happened before).
Vaccination itself is delegable to qualified personnel, e.g. medical professionals.
In vaccination teams, however, we often do not have one, but "only" (for God's sake no lack of appreciation!) pharmaceutical-technical assistants for the vaccine preparation, which, however, cannot carry out vaccinations (must?), so that I also carry out most vaccinations myself there.
Heavy "Huidlerer" question: Amberger knows the solution
What, please, is a "huidler"?
With this dialectic word, sent by an Amberger, the BR TV show "We in Bayern" has caused intense reflection.
However, unlike on many previous days, the term "host mi" was not recommended by the callers in the series this time.
No, it wasn't "man who's nervous."
And no one, "that everything has to go fast."
That, the people heard from the TV hostess, was completely wrong.
On what the man from Amberg announced the solution and thus probably also with many upper pals caused amazement.
"The Skinner," the audience learned, "is a rag with which someone wipes out the oven."
Dialect researcher Antony Rowley, an expert on Bavarian television for years, confirmed this.
With the remark that this is a typical upper- Palatinate term, derived somehow from the more well-known word "Houdern".
What closed an educational gap - probably even for some who have lived in the Amberg area for a long time.
I can't buy books for two weeks.
It always comes up with the following error message after confirmation: opens -someting wont wrong - try again later.
I restarted the #PRS_ORG# gel#PRS_ORG#n, connected to the PC, synchronized and repaired.
Nothing helped.
Tyre choice at the racing bike- really so pan-safe?
This morning I woke up with a lot of enthusiasm because I wanted to train at least a little to prepare for my bike tour next week.
Said, done and I drove my racing bike, which I bought on eBay yesterday.
The first 40km were also really nice - but then what happened in so every city center (this time: Thank you Krefeld!) lurks.
Glass splitter on the track.
Zack, loud whiskers and my rear tires did not want to take part in the rest of the route at all.
Because of the day of the week, I had no real opportunity to get a spare coat and a spare hose, I had to turn back with a half-poor mood and take the first train home.
Wasn't that bad in terms of mood, maybe it's better if I practice the tire change again before the bike tour.
But now I'm faced with a question and I hope you can help me.
Since I have a relatively long distance over several days in front of me, I would be extremely unhappy about this problem more often.
Now it was really not bad, since the old tires from the previous owner (very nice old man, on the day I picked up the bike until 14am had torn off 120km!) and who had also called it suboptimal because he had been riding with them for several years.
But if I think I have to make a tire change after 80-90kms, then I think I'm really bad mood :D
Now I got into a conversation with an older man at the platform who asked me in amazement why I didn't have the Marathon Plus tires; these should be unflatterable.
Now, of course, the whole thing sounds very enticing.
But are these really so uncaputable?
I don't want to spend 40€/ropes now, just to be disappointed.
I also wonder: at the moment I have on the racing bike I think 25x622.
Although there are also (apparently?) the Marathon Plus tires, but the majority is already wider.
Is this a problem?
Or would you generally advise me on a race bike to other tires?
The Schwalbe side seems to be recommending my absolute! Laiewissen rather the Durano DD?
Thank you in advance for the help and greetings!
Car hurls against tree: driver fatally injured
The 53-year-old was on the B57 between Rheinberg and Xanten with his car rallied for unexplained cause against a middle island and then got on the counterroadway, as the police reported.
There was a frontal collision with the vehicle of a 27-year-old.
The 53-year-old's car was then thrown against a tree and the man was trapped in the car.
The 27-year-old and his 23-year-old attendant were seriously injured in the accident and taken to surrounding hospitals.

After the release of our new High End Broadband B 100-6 OHM, it was only a matter of time until our SOLO series would also get new ones.
SOLO 15 is called the new Sprössling and is visually reminiscent of the great models with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, this construction proposal includes a suitably designed foot directly to lift the speaker to the correct hearing position.
This has no influence on acoustics and can therefore be adjusted in the length according to the conditions at home.
In principle, the SOLO 15 is very well suited for people where the maximum volume plays a rather subordinate role, but an exceptionally high level is to be achieved.
A 10 cm speaker is simply not able to produce almost unfiltered such large sound pressure levels.
However, this does not mean that the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, it appears to be remarkably mature and for its size extremely impressive and accurate.
Tonal was tuned to the SOLO 15 with a slight high tone increase.
This is generally common in broadband to optimize the highly increasing bundling of too high frequencies.
The SOLO 15 convinces with a very clear and fine sound.
Lightly rotated outwards, the high-tone range can be reduced and thus the sound image can be made warmer.
Thanks to the dot sound source, the location of the individual components of a music piece in the optimal stereodreieck is sharp and amazingly precise.
The reference suspects extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM provide a fine dynamic that seeks its same.
The SOLO 15 not only complements our SOLO series, but expands it in terms of resolution and accuracy.
As with all of our construction kits, it is recommended to start by thinking about the final appearance of the speaker in order to plan corresponding changes during construction.
For example, if the case is to be veneered, the reduction of the speaker must be adjusted accordingly, as the veneer is again applied to the material.
After all the plates have been cut (e.g. in the construction market), you should first drill an 8 mm hole into the floor plate at the appropriate place in order to be able to run the cable easily there later.
With the help of a top milling machine, the opening of the speaker in the front is followed, so that the B 100-6 OHM can later be used flushly.
On the reverse side, this opening should be provided with a 45° phase to make the opening surface of the speaker chassis as large as possible inside.
The four screw points of the B 100 - 6 OHM receive a break in the phase, as shown in the picture "Detail Phase".
Then you start with the actual structure of the box and place one of the two side walls on a flat surface in front of you.
On these are now glued up the back wall, the lid, the front and the floor.
The three stiffenings should also be used and glued.
The stiffenings themselves may vary in the material strength if needed, for example, if you want to use finished bars from the construction market instead of producing them from 16 mm MDF.
In the next step of the work, the second side is placed.
Then all the plates of the foot, i.e. the two sides, as well as the front.
By means of a suitable hole-circuit saw or a forest drill, the installation of the openings of the bass reflector tube, as well as the connection clamp on the back wall, is facilitated.
Then you use a circular cutter to round all the edges of the actual box.
The top of the base plate can also be rounded.
Afterwards, the base plate is glued firmly with the base of the housing and is additionally bolted with long wooden screws.
It follows the marking and pre-drilling (2,5 mm drill) of the screw points of the speaker chassis and the terminal.
After the case of wood dust has been cleaned (absorbed / blown out), you start laying the cable.
The easiest way to do this is through the 35 mm bass reflex opening in the back wall.
You push the entire and unshortened cable piece by piece through the 8 mm hole in the foot to the terminal opening and leave it there about 30 cm out.
In the upper part of the housing you lead the cable to the speaker opening and let it hang out there too loosely.
The frequency softness is then prepared and used.
The construction plan of the frequency softness, as well as the corresponding connection plan, can be found in the following document: Installation instructions Soft Solo 15.
If the frequency soft is installed and the connection terminal is screwed, the seal of the 8 mm cable opening inside the box, which is not yet completely closed.
Due to the 35 mm bass REFLEX opening and with some skill, you can drop hot adhesives onto the opening and close them.
Through the opening of the B 100 - 6 OHM and with a small lamp you can check the seal accordingly.
Now the damping follows according to description.
Then the B 100 - 6 OHM is connected and bolted with the corresponding screws.
Polarity plays an important role in this, so that the plus line (marked cable) must be soldered at the plus pole of the speaker (larger contact).
Finally, the bass reflector tube is shortened to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the tube) and inserted.
For damping, a mat of damping material is cut into two parts and distributed loosely in the housing.
The opening around the bass reflector channel should be kept free.
Can I give up an order now and have it delivered at the beginning of June?
> Hello to all,
> Finally we can announce that this year we will again host the OSCAST!
> Unfortunately, for well-known reasons, it is not possible to get more than four people to the studio, which has meant a higher planning effort and explains the short-termity of the announcement.
ABER: There will be at least three people per switch so that we will track the Oscars 2021 with at least 7 beans in the stream and hopefully thousands of you!
> We do our best to avoid delay or other problems.
But hey, it's still pandemic – yet we'll give anything to accompany the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
> It will start at about 0:30.
Get some cold drinks, plan a good meal and get ready for a long but very interesting night.
