Biker reacts fast and prevents worse
On Friday evening, a traffic accident occurred on the road between Machtolsheim and Merkelingen, in which a motorcyclist was only slightly injured due to his quick reaction.
Car driver overlooks biker
A 44-year-old driver wanted to take her VW from Merkelingen to the left on Landesstraße 1230 towards Machtolsheim at 9:30 p.m.
In doing so, she overlooked the 24-year-old motorist coming from the direction of Nellingen.
At the collision, hand and foot brake levers fly away
The biker was still trying to avoid the car, but it still ran at the rear of the vehicle.
Due to the striping process, the hand lever and foot brake lever were torn off at the Suzuki and the driver was no longer able to brake off.
At present, he steered his motorcycle in the green traps next to the roadway and let it roll out there without falling.
Biker suffers leg injury
However, the biker suffered an injury from the collision with the car and had to be treated in a clinic.
Mamming: Corona mass infection: 174 harvest helpers infected
After a Corona mass infection on a large vegetable farm in the Lower Bavarian Mamming, almost 500 people are quarantined and are no longer allowed to leave the farm.
A security service supervises the outsourcing.
A total of 174 harvesters were tested positively on the Corona pathogen Sars-CoV-2 during the series examination, as the Landratsamt Dingolfing-Landau announced on Saturday evening.
"Unfortunately, in order to avoid further spread, we need to take this step to protect the population," said Landrat Werner Bumeder (CSU).
Before this, seven employees had already been infected in the plant - this was the reason for the series test.
The plant is a large vegetable farm that grows strawberries, cucumbers, cabbage and red beet - but the cucumbers only for insert glasses.
Mamming is a rural community with over 3,300 inhabitants not far from Dingolfing with its large BMW plant.
Bumeder appealed to the citizens to remain calm: "According to our information, it is a closed circle of people".
In the yard, infected persons were separated from non-infected staff, the site is now surrounded by a fence.
Greens and SPDs shared responsibility with the government.
The two opposition factions accused Prime Minister Markus Söder (CSU) and his cabinet of neglecting the control of the accommodation of seasonal workers.
"This can be bitterly revenged if such local infections occur and regional lockdowns have to be arranged," said Jürgen Mistol, the Parliamentary CEO of the Greens.
The SPD sees this quite similarly: "After the Corona outbreak in the Wiesenhof slaughterhouse in mid-May, we have already called for a special control programme for farms with harvesters," said environmental expert Florian von Brunn.
"From our point of view, the hygiene conditions at the workplace and the housing conditions must be strictly controlled.
This obviously didn't happen."
The eruption had come with an announcement.
Aidenbachstraße underground station: Dangerous dispute: 19-year-old falls to the trackbed after Schubser
In the event of a dispute between two youth groups at the underground station Aidenbachstraße, a 19-year-old fell through a pusher and slipped into the trackbed.
Obersendling - On Friday, there was a dispute between two youth groups at the Aidenbachstraße underground station around 4:15 p.m.
One passerby alerted the police, who came in with several stripes.
According to the first investigations, a Municher (17) pushed a 19-year-old to the ground.
The young man slipped over the platform edge and fell into the track bed.
People from the 17-year-old group helped the feller climb out of the track.
There was no danger from a running track.
As the police reported, there was a further conflict between the two people.
The 17-year-old initially fled the scene of the crime, but his personalities could be determined in retrospect.
He joined his father in the police inspection.
The 17-year-olds are diagnosed for body injury.
Report: Seehofer insists on longer storage of data
Storage of data is currently suspended.
Federal Minister Horst Seehofer, however, calls for an extension of the storage period after a media report.
He wants to strengthen the fight against child abuse.
Federal Minister of the Interior Horst Seehofer (CSU) calls for an extended storage of data after a media report - instead of the planned ten weeks half a year.
As the "Picture on Sunday" reports, Seehofer Justice Minister Christine Lambrecht (SPD) asked in a letter for a rapid change in the law.
Seehofer therefore intends to strengthen the measures against child abuse.
He considers it useful to "make urgently needed adjustments in the law already now", the newspaper quotes from the letter.
Currently, data storage is suspended.
A decision by the ECJ is expected.
However, Seehofer wants the amendments to be applied immediately after a possible positive judgment, the report goes on to say.
A spokesperson of the Ministry of Justice said that it would only be reasonable to consider whether legal adjustments would be necessary if the courts had decided.
In the fight against child abuse and child pornography, Seehofer, together with the country's internal ministers, had already advocated data storage in June.
NBA: Strip club scars for clippers star Lou Williams
Excitement in the NBA!
Lou Williams (33), Los Angeles Clippers' basketball pro, said to have left the tournament quarter in Disney World in Orlando/Florida with permission for a funeral.
In the evening, he attended the Magic City strip club in Atlanta.
Williams, who is said to have admitted to the visit according to ESPN data, is back in Isloation, is tested daily on Covid-19.
His reason for the visit: Chicken Wings.
In February last year, "Sweet Lou", as he is called in the NBA, has already expressed his love for exactly these Wings.
The American wrote: "Magic City and Blue Flame (another strip club in Atlanta, Note d.R.) have the best Wings in the city".
On Sunday, NBA-Insider Shams Charania announced on Twitter that NBA Williams had appointed a ten-day quarantine.
The Clippers-Star thus misses the first two official games after the trial phase.
In Disney World, the NBA wants to play the Corona season.
At present, the best 22 teams with training games are preparing for the final season starting at night on Friday.
Soder expresses itself after mass infection about the Corona location
Munich - Health Minister Melanie Huml (CSU) has already announced a Tessifensive for large farms on Sunday.
The press conference will be seen live on our homepage.
The case in Mamming in Dingolfing-Landau County has frightened authorities and politics.
The large vegetable farm currently employs almost 500 harvesters from several countries, over a third of them infected with the Corona pathogen.
The farm is now quarantined and is sealed with a building fence.
No one should leave the area, food supplies.
The authorities now offer free Corona tests to the over 3300 inhabitants of the municipality.
As the harvesters had little contact with the local population, so far the Landratsamt assumes that the infections have not spread beyond the farm.
"scrupulous bites": Confession of the suspected arsonist of Nantes
"My client has shown himself cooperative," said the newspaper lawyer Quentin Chabert.
The defender added: "He deeply regrets the actions, the confession was a liberation for him".
His mandate was "spoiled by conscience and very much taken away from the extent of destruction".
In the event of a conviction, according to the Procuratorate, the man is under ten years' imprisonment and a fine of 150,000 euros.
The Gothic Cathedral of Saint Peter and Paul in Nantes was badly damaged by a fire on the night of Saturday last week.
The fire broke out at three distant places in the church.
Laboratory investigations hardened the suspicion of arson.
The suspect now detained had already been arrested a few hours after the fire.
But he was released after a day.
The man works as a volunteer for the diocese of Nantes and was responsible for the closure of the cathedral on the eve of the fire.
Since there was no sign of a violent intrusion into the church, he quickly entered the field of view of the investigators.
Discuss the abolition of the 50+1 rule
Former DFB President Reinhard Grindel has recommended that the 50+1 rule be abolished.
"German football should at least discuss conditions and clear rules for investors before the EU Commission creates completed facts," said Grindel of the "Picture on Sunday".
He stressed: "The 50+1 rules do not work for the clubs that can become dangerous at the earliest in Bavaria and Dortmund: see Leipzig or Leverkusen.
In this respect, it is not possible to get around the debate whether it is not necessary to facilitate the involvement of investors by associations that want to break into this Phalanx."
However, he has doubts as to whether the German Football League is prepared to allow majority participations which are prohibited by the 50+1 rules in the Bundesliga.
"It remains a legal risk to move investment fences around the Bundesliga business location in a European internal market," said Grindel.
The former DFB boss sees the danger that "at the end of the day the attempts to achieve a more competitive balance in the Bundesliga only weaken the competitiveness of our top clubs at European level, but not lead to more tension in the championship".
Even an equal distribution of TV money would not have a decisive effect.
"The FC Bayern makes sales of 750 million euros, Borussia Dortmund of 500 million and RB Leipzig of 300 million.
The differences are therefore already immense among the first three clubs alone.
The other 15 clubs have an average household of 130 million," said the 58-year-old.
Looking at the past, Grindel feels betrayed.
"Unfortunately, there have been people who have noticed this mistake and who have gone through the press instead of addressing me," said Grindel about the adoption of an expensive watch that led to his resignation in April 2019.
"I've already been very busy in human terms."
He had received the gift worth about 11,000 euros from a Ukrainian official.
"I have committed a violation of compliance, and it was right to draw the consequences from it," said Grindel.
"With the ominous watch gift, I have dealt completely transparently and arbitrarily.
Many knew about it in the DFB."
He never made a "heel out of the gift," the 58-year-old assured.
"That might be called naive, at least this form of transparency was the complete opposite of corruption."
"Black Lives Matter": Injured and a Dead
The protests against police force in the United States have been intensified by Donald Trump's use of federal police officers in several cities.
On Saturday, there were clashes between demonstrators and policemen in various cities.
Three people were injured in Louisville, and 16 people were arrested in Seattle.

Previously, during protests against racism and police force in Portland, there had been another clash.
The security forces, including federal police officers, used tear gas on Saturday night and violently drove protesters apart.
Hundreds of part-armed demonstrators marched through Louisville in Kentucky on Saturday and demanded that those responsible for the death of Breonna Taylor be held accountable.
The 26-year-old student had been shot at a drug raid in her apartment in Louisville in March.
The purpose of the Razzia was someone else who did not live there at all, and no drugs were found.
On Saturday, when a member of a group who called himself the armed alliance of black Americans took a shot, three people were injured.
According to the station NBC, they were taken to the hospital.
None of them were in danger of life.
The police set up barricades because local demonstrators of a white militia had also formed.
In the end, there was no meeting between the two groups.
In Austin, Texas, a person was shot and killed during a Black Lives Matter demonstration.
The police took a suspect into custody according to their own records.
So far, she has not provided any further information on the circumstances of the action.
Mayor Steve Adler announced, according to the New York Times, that he was, like many in the city, "inconsolable and inconsistant" about what had happened.
In the American metropolis Seattle, demonstrators also met the police on Saturday.
They were in front of a juvenile prison building car in fire, the police used grenades and pepper spray.
According to the "Seattle Times", 16 people were arrested for resistance to police or physical injury.

The fire could be quickly wiped out again.
In Aurora, a suburb of Denver in Colorado, a car drove through a crowd of people demonstrating on a highway.
As the police reported, one of the demonstrators fired a weapon and at least one person was injured taken to the hospital.
In addition, there were also punched in a court window and a fire was laid, as the police reported.
Investigations have been made.
Rakoczy in Bad Kissingen: Historical costumes defy Corona
Although the big sauce was missing in the spa town, visitors and actors enjoyed the Rakoczy flair of the alternative program.
It was unusual for visitors, actors and organizers: The Rakoczy Weekend without Rakoczy Festival.
But: Even if the big party mile was missing in downtown, people's masses and program highlights such as Saale, Rakoczy Ball or parties, many of them were at their expense in the Corona-compliant alternative program.
"I think we have managed to spread Rakoczy-Flair," says spa director Sylvie Thormann.
The guests would have accepted it well.
In principle, you return to the beginnings of the Rakoczy festival, but only the historical were in the focus of the festival.
Pleasure atmosphere
Vesna Konhäuser and her husband have been visiting the Rakoczy-Fest Bad Kissingen for more than 25 years.
So it was this time in the Corona year.
The couple made themselves comfortable at the Luitpold-Casino, observe the historical flaunting and listen to Cuban live music at the playground restaurant.
"I like it so much," says Konhäuser.
She does not miss the masses of people who otherwise belong to Rakoczy.
But you lack the usual program highlights, especially Saale is burning on Friday evening as well as the historic celebration and the final fireworks on Sunday evening.
"That's too bad.
The weather would have been great this year," she says.
Rakoczy Tournament is scheduled to take place again
For the actors of the historical spa guests, the alternative program meant some more work.
For example, Christina Gold, who works in a normal year at the ceremony and can be seen there on the carriage of the Kurgarten café.
This year she was walking on Saturdays and Sundays in costumes in the city.
"This is already more strenuous, otherwise we'll have it easier," she says.
The equestrian club had less to do, even if individual riders were on their way to the park.
"We very much hope that the riding squad will be back next year," says Ulrike Waldhofen, President.
She announced that after several years of break in 2021 a Rakoczy riding tournament would also take place again.
28 Corona Falls in Fuenlabrada, Spain
The Spanish midfielder CF Fuenlabrada is increasingly delving into the crisis because of a Corona eruption.
Since the newcomer from near Madrid had flown to the city of A Coruña on July 20th, despite the first Corona Falls, a deep impact follows the next one.
By Sunday, 28 players or team members had been tested positively, one came to the hospital, as the club announced.
Fuenlabrada from the town of the same name south-west of Madrid has so far had the chance to reach the ascent playoffs.
Now even the decline to the B-group of the Second League threatens.
The game against Deportivo La Coruña last Monday was cancelled at the last moment, the prosecution determined because of a possible crime against public health, the top sports authority CSD is considering the forced descent of the club.
Players and other team members sit in a hotel in quarantine.
"Until the sixth day of quarantine they have not received a fresh towel and no gel," wrote the sports newspaper "AS".
On photos you can see how players would have hung underwear and club clothes in their rooms in the hotel for drying after they had to wash them themselves.
Also, the bed linen had not been changed for five days.
Another problem was food.
Neither was it good nor enough, wrote "AS".
The club management, on the other hand, informed that they were satisfied with the hotel.
The allegation of deliberately endangering public health was rejected by the club's lawyer, Javier Tebas Llanas.
The son of the president of the Spanish Primera Division, Javier Tebas, was not opposed to the Corona rules set up by the Football Association, as reported by the news agency Europa Press and the sports newspaper "Marca".
Before the departure, there were four infected persons until July 19, but all were isolated and did not enter.
All players and team members were tested again immediately prior to the flight to A Coruña on Monday.
When the team was already in A Coruña, five or six other team members of the Corona test were positive.
The game was cancelled 60 minutes before the start, said Tebas Llanas.
Police have to catch horses ripped off at steam bay.
Two animals were on the road.
The police took her back to her owner.
On Sunday morning just before 6 o'clock, a road user announced two free-running horses on the feeder between the mouth of Donnersdorf/Steinsfeld and the Theres motorway connection.
At the time of the arrival of the officials, the horses were already back between the porter and the village of steamach.
After the officials were able to gain the confidence of the horses shortly before steaming, each of them had a rope carried in the wheelcart.
Bike pro Tony Martin: Career continuation imaginable
Time travel specialist Tony Martin thinks about continuing his career.
Frankfurt/Main - The seven-time world-time racing champion Tony Martin can imagine continuing his cycling career.
"I'm just cutting off with the team the framework conditions, how and in what form it could continue," said the 35-year-old of the "Frankfurt General Sunday newspaper".
Martin is currently working with the Dutch team Jumbo-Visma and was considering ending his career after this year before the Corona break.
In the negotiations with his team it was also about the number of race days, he said.
Or other problems that would plague him as a family father, Martin said.
In the past he had risen after a fall, and the first thought had been: "Quickly return to the wheel.
Today, as the father of a little daughter, I think what would be if".
The cyclist admitted that there are some aspects with which he is increasingly difficult to deal with.
"But it was good for me to remember from the time of Corona what I had at cycling and how much fun he was doing to me."
The time-traffic specialist will return to the competition at the Tour de l'Ain (5th to 9th August).

Kovac tests Monaco against Frankfurt
Frankfurt/Main (dpa) - For football coach Niko Kovac there will soon be a reunion with Eintracht Frankfurt with his new club AS Monaco.
The eight-time French champion will be visiting the Hessen, the former Croatian club, on 1 August (18:00).
For the Bundesligist it is the first and only hardening test before replaying in the Europe League against the FC Basel (6 August).
Because of the Coronavirus pandemic, the encounter is conducted without spectators.
"We are especially looking forward to this game.
It is always nice to come to Frankfurt and meet friends," said Kovac.
Sporty is an interesting test, said the 48-year-old.
Before his change to FC Bayern Munich, Kovac had trained the Hessen from 2016 to 2018 and led to victory in the DFB Cup.
"A high-class opponent like Monaco is a good test for us in terms of the game against Basel.
Like all Frankfurters, I look forward to seeing Niko Kovac again," said Eintracht-Trainer Adi Hütter.
The 50-year-old Austrian had entered the succession of the Croat at the Eintracht.
In March the Frankfurters lost the eighth-final match against Basel in their own stadium with 0:3.
Almost 50 new infections: Landkreis Hof near the lockdown

700 dead by monsoon rain in Southeast Asia
Of the severe floods in Southeast Asia, more than 9 million people are affected, especially in Bangladesh, India and Nepal.
Because of the strong monsoon rain, a total of 700 people were killed.
In Bangladesh, the Red Crescent tries to reach the isolated people in boats.
Whole villages are under water.
The farmers have lost their crops.
Panzer horns in National Park die by landslides
In the Kaziranga National Park, several of the 120 Panzers died from landslides.
They are under protection and valid as being at risk of extinction.
This year, the floods are particularly bad, which leads to climate change.
Bangladesh, according to the United Nations, is one of the most affected countries by global warming.
New apartments are empty
In the town of Cox's Bazar in the south of Bangladesh, the state has built apartments for 650 through the floods of displaced persons.
So far, only a few have moved in.
It's hard to bring people to Cox's bazaar.
The enthusiasm also stays in Grenezn.
Those who used to have a house were also so small and like a hut, often do not want to spend their lives in a large housing block.
Many apartments are empty, but should - as the government wants - soon be taken from those who have lost their homes through the floods.

Argentina rejects the counter offer of creditors
The new demands could not be met, the Ministry of Economic Affairs in Buenos Aires announced on Saturday.
"That would not only be irresponsible, but also unfair," said one opinion.
"While 50 percent of children live in poverty in Argentina, we cannot increase the short-term profits of our creditors."
The debt of the second largest economy in South America is no longer sustainable under current conditions.
Therefore, Argentina calls on its private creditors to waive part of their claims of around USD 66 billion (about EUR 59 billion).
If there is no agreement, the country is again threatening the state.
It would be the ninth payment failure in Argentine history.
Most recently, lenders had demanded higher interest rates on government bonds and changes to some contract clauses.
The Argentine government, however, adheres to its last offer and is not prepared for any further concessions.
Argentina is in a severe financial and economic crisis.
The rate of inflation was recently more than 50 percent.
For the current year, experts expect an economic power drop of around ten percent.
At the end of May, Argentina had failed to meet interest receivables of USD 503 million and had therefore fallen into a limited non-payment.
Arrived professionally - not yet private
"It's going super well" - this conclusion draws Dr. Stefanie Kramer after her first days in the Notariat in Eggenfelden.
In the end, everything went very quickly: in the middle of May, Dr. Stefanie Kramer learned that she will take on the successor of Lutz Feller in the Notary Station of Eggenfelden.
Six weeks later, at the beginning of July, the doctorate took up the work, the normal daily business is long on full tours.
"But I still have to arrive privately," she explains in conversation with the Rottal scorer and laughs.
Of course, the short lead time has not been enough to move the food point from Regensburg completely to Eggenfelden, reports the native Dingolfingerin.
She is currently looking for a suitable apartment or a house in the city with her husband, who works as a judge at the district court in Regensburg.
At least her husband was able to apply for a short-term parental leave in order to ensure the care of the two daughters (31⁄2 and 11⁄2 years old).
In order not to have to commute from Regensburg every day, she now also has an overnight opportunity with her parents in Dingolfing, explains the 39-year-old.
Grown up in the neighbouring district, the town of Eggenfelden has of course long been a term for her.
When visiting the local family in the last few months, she said again: "Oggenfelden is a really beautiful small town".
She was all the more pleased that she had made the race in the open competition.
Also in Dr. Stefanie Kramer's career career her home Niederbayern plays a central role: After her Jura degree in Passau, she completed her referendariat time and the 2nd State examination in Regensburg.
After several stations as a notary professor, including Rehau and Hof in Oberfranken, Babenhausen in Unterallgäu and Regensburg - at this time she also "besides" trained the doctorate in labour law - she took up her first position as a notary in Rotthalmünster in the district of Passau in 2012.
In 2016 she moved to Regensburg in her parents' time, and finally she moved to Regensburg.
Since then, she has taken over representation services in various notaries' offices.
When the position in Eggenfelden had been advertised because of Lutz Feller's approaching retirement, she had seen the right time for full professional re-entry, the 39-year-old explains.
Dr. Stefanie Kramer has taken over the team of her predecessor, who will take over the office of the notary in the future - and has just a compliment for the firm's team: "It's going super well!"
The fact that she can rely on recorded processes here makes it easier for her to take care of the upcoming shift of the private food point.
As regards kindergarten and cribs, she has already made contact with a local institution.
And if everything works as desired, she hopes to be able to follow her hobby here soon too - and get to know the most beautiful jogging routes of the rottal.
BVB plans to start the league with a maximum of 15,000 spectators
Dortmund The largest German football stadium in Dortmund will not even be filled to 20 percent at the start of the season in the event of a fan return.
"Due to the distance regulation that must be complied with, we are planning to have 12,000 to 15,000 spectators at the current level," said Borussia Dortmund's Managing Director Carsten Cramer to the "Tagesspiegel".
Usually the arena in the district city at the Bundesliga games takes a little more than 81,000 spectators.
Around four million euros were lost to the BVB per game in the ghost games of the previous season caused by the Corona pandemic.
Cramer, responsible for marketing, digitization and internationalization, hopes that, in addition to the normal public places, some of the approximately 4000 places in the hospitality area can also be opened again: "It is of course a blow to the office if these revenues completely break away".
In view of the continuing Corona crisis, all "advise to take a stable side length for the first time".
"If many companies are not doing well and 6.8 million people are in short work alone in Germany, then the need for entertainment is limited," said Cramer.
The Dortmund Marketing Manager praised the BVB professionals for their salary cut-off to help overcome the crisis: "Of course, the players know that their salary cut has a different effect than if we put 100 people working in Merchandising on short-time work."
Tiny Wonders: Early start to life with a few hundred grams
Harder than a packerl butter, just three tablespoons of blood in his entire body: that was Gabriel when he was born - he weighed exactly 273 grams.
The bub is one of about 400 breakfasts, which are taken care of annually at the Graz Children's Hospital.
A quarter of them weigh less than 1,500 grams, a few - like Gabriel and his brothers Raphael and Michael - are extremely lightweight with not even a kilogram of birth weight.
They are born so small and so early that neither lungs, nor intestines, nor muscles are fully trained.
Your skin is sometimes so tender that they could damage the electrodes of an ECG.
And they are so tiny that they sometimes wear doll clothes and specially made mini-winds for them.
But not so small that they wouldn't be in voice - "and like," Berndt Urlesberger smiles.
"Even if, of course, they don't scream as loudly as big babies."
When the whiteboard becomes a stage
Despite Corona Theater in the classroom: The whiteboard as a stage experienced the 9th classes of the Sankt-Jakobus-Gymnasium in Abtsgmünd just before the start of the holiday.
Actress Julia Sylvester from the theatre of the city of Aalen presented to the students the production "The home dress" - by video.
Afterwards, the students were able to share the play and performance with the actress and director Winfried Tobias via Skype.
The idea for the performance format from the current Corona situation had been born.
Teacher Teresa Nar was pleased about enriching the teaching.
Even if all those involved agreed at the end that the direct encounter in the theatre and stage room would provide additional stimulus, the theatre also sees the potential for contact in the schools.
"If we continue to improve the technical framework, this could be an interesting addition to the gaming business," said director Winfried Tobias.
First round triggered: The TSV 1860 would meet in the DFB Cup on Eintracht Frankfurt
Should the TSV 1860 qualify for the DFB Cup, the lions meet Eintracht Frankfurt in the first round.
This resulted in the release on Sunday.
Munich - Sixty possible opponents in the first round of the DFB Cup are determined.

De Havilland was well known for her role as Melanie Hamilton in the Southern Nepos "Vom Windweht" (1939).
As a child of British parents born in Tokyo, Olivia de Havilland moved to California as a toddler.
The Austrian theatre man Max Reinhardt discovered the 19-year-old in the role of the Hermia of Shakespeare's "Summer Night Dream".
The Warner Brothers film studio immediately took her for seven years under contract and brought her out large on the side of Erol Flynn.
Eight films she shot with the heartbreaker.
In 1946 she won her first Oscar in the lead role of "To Each His Own".
The film ran in Germany under the title "Mother Heart".
Three years later the award came as the best actress in William Wyler's "The Heiress" (The Erbin).
She was also given much recognition as a neurotic eccentric in "The Dark Mirror" and "The Snake Grube".
Daphne du Maurier proposed it in 1952 for the leading role in the filming of her novel "My Cousine Rachel".
The piece became a worldwide success.
With her long-time girlfriend Bette Davis, she played in "Wangenlied für eine Leiche".
The son Benjamin emerged from his marriage to the writer Marcus Goodrich (1946–1953).
In Paris, de Havilland married journalist Pierre Paul Galante and had the daughter Gisèle with him.
This marriage broke up too.
However, rumors about an affair with former British Prime Minister Edward Heath have never been confirmed.
"Road to Timmendorf": Beach volleyball: Thole/Wickler miss finale at Comeback
The second World Championships Julius Thole and Clemens Wicker missed the finals at the beach volleyball tournament "Road to Timmendorf".
At the meeting of the top teams in Düsseldorf, they defeated their national teammates Nils Ehlers and Lars Fluggen with 1:2 (17:21, 21:17, 19:21) in the semifinals.
In September last year, Thole/Wickler played at the World Tour Final in Rome.
In the final game on the Rhine, her victories Ehlers/Flying against the surprise team Lukas Pfretschner and his interim partner Steven van de Velde took a defeat with 0:2 (17:21, 17:21).
In addition to the show tournament, three starting places for the German championships were played in Timmendorfer Strand at the beginning of September: Armin Dollinger/Simon Kulzer, Manuel Harms/Richard Peemüller and Simon Pfretschner/Milan Sievers secured tickets.
Kalbitz-Rauswurf confirmed from AfD - FDP speaks of "Fig leaf"
From the FDP's point of view, Andreas Kalbitz's exclusion from the AfD is only a "fig leaf" and does not change the character of the party.
"The AfD is the parliamentary arm of the extreme right in Germany.
Andreas Kalbitz is only part of the top of the iceberg of the radicals in the AfD," said FDP national politician Benjamin Strasser of the news agency dpa in Berlin.
On Saturday in Stuttgart, after several hours of negotiations, the Bundesschchiedsgericht der AfD confirmed the exclusion of Kalbitz, which was decided by the Federal Board of Directors in May.
Kalbitz is Chairman of the AfD Group in the Brandenburg Landtag.
"If the AfD really wanted to remove right-wing extremists from their party consistently, officials like Björn Höcke and his followers would have been excluded for a long time," said Strasser.
"However, there is no political will for this in the AfD, because right-wing extremism is now part of the party."
Similarly, CSU Secretary General Markus Blume said: "That Andreas Kalbitz is now excluded, says nothing and doesn't change anything," he said the "World on Sunday".
"It speaks rather volumes, how many French supporters still have a right-wing extremist in the middle of the AfD".
Flower expects that the AfD will return to below five percent in future elections.
"The days of the AfD in the parliaments are numbered".
Kalbitz was one of the spokespersons of the officially dissolved "flugels" around the Thuringian AfD-Landes- und Factionsführer Björn Höcke; the constitutional protection classifies the strand as "secured right-wing extremist pursuit".
In May, the party had been thrown out by the AfD Federal Councillor Kalbitz.
As a reason, he stated that Kalbitz had not indicated an earlier membership in the now prohibited right-wing extreme "Home-Faithful German Youth" (HDJ) and the Republicans when he entered the party.
Kalbitz denies membership in HDJ.
The chairman of the left-wing group in the Brandenburg Landtag, Sebastian Walter, also stressed that the decision of the Federal Arbitration Court does not change the character of the AfD: "The wolf has eaten only chalk.
The AfD remains a far right party, whether with or without Kalbitz".
Neither the Federal Party nor the right wing will be weakened by this decision.
"The maneuver of the muten troops is perceptible.
One wants to avoid further observation by constitutional protection and try to get under the radar," Walter said.
"The AfD won't let go of the spirits she called.
There is no change in a waste," commented SPD Secretary General Erik Stohn on the decision in the case of Kalbitz.
"Here the AfD-Landesverband and the faction remained to their right leader to this day".
The legal dispute over the membership of Kalbitz in the AfD will continue.
He announced on Saturday that he would now take civil action against the decision of the Federal Arbitration Court.
North Sea wind farms deliver well 21 percent more electricity
In the first six months of the year 11,51 Terawatt hours of electricity were fed into the grid by the wind turbines on the German North Sea.
That is well 21 percent more than in the same period of the previous year, the network operator Tennet announced in Bayreuth.
Tennet is responsible for the transmission of the North Sea electricity to the mainland and the transmission through the German electricity grid.
The wind turbines on the Baltic Sea, which do not belong to the network area of Tennet, have added another 2.22 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity.
Overall, the wind current from the North and Baltic Seas comes to 13.73 TWh, compared to well 11.64 TWh in the first half of 2019.
The wind yield at sea thus accounts for almost 19 percent of the total wind flow in Germany, which is about four percentage points more than one year ago.
New wind farms provide higher production capacities
The increased contribution of offshore wind energy is due to higher wind conditions due to the fact that new wind farms have joined the grid over the past 12 months.
If the 1270 wind turbines in the North Sea would all run simultaneously with full power, they could generate 6.7 gigawatts of electricity.
The transmission capacity is sufficient; according to Tennet it is 7.1 gigawatt.
By 2030 it will rise to 17 gigawatts in the German North Sea.
"In Germany and the Netherlands, we have so far invested EUR 20 billion in the expansion of offshore network connections," said Tennet Managing Director Tim Meyerjürgens.
In reality, wind farms cannot use their capacity at sea, but can reach about 40 percent.
The previous record day this year is January 2nd, when the North Sea wind farms generated more than six gigawatts of electricity.
On average, North Sea wind turbines produce about 2.5 to 3.0 gigawatts of electricity, which corresponds to three to four nuclear power plants.
Nearly seven million households could be supplied with electricity.
Art "Skirmish" - an exhibition by the Leipzig artist Christian Bold in the gallery of the Gmünder Kunstverein.
It was almost a small anniversary celebration to the 130th.
The Gmünder Kunstverein's birthday: The exhibition opening "Skirmish" with works by the Leipzig artist Christian Bold blew up the usual framework after the Corona break.
Much more art friends than usual followed the dialogue between the artist and the chairman of the Kunstverein, Professor Dr. Klaus Ripper.
The musical equivalent delivered the band "Defenders of the Universe" on the southern Kornhausplatz.
In the north of the gallery, the club "Sandtogether".
Freital: Windbergfest for Corona cancelled
The Windberg Festival does not take place this year.
The city of Freital cancelled the three-day festival planned in September.
In other years, more than 30,000 people had attended this city festival.
"We have certainly not made this decision easy and - knowing how difficult it is for the participants - hoped until the last minute," explained Mayor Uwe Rumberg (partyless).
"But in the end, we are responsible for the health of many thousands of people."
Because if tens of thousands had flocked to the land and the tent, minimum distances, hygiene rules and a contact tracking could not have been complied with in accordance with the current Corona Protection Regulation.
Or the restrictions would have been so strong that not much would have been left of a festival.
In addition, the organisational and monitoring burden would increase disproportionately by several times.
Rumberg was comforted next year.
Then the city of Freital celebrates its 100th anniversary with, among other things, the Winterberg Festival from 7 to 9 May 2021 as well as the day of Saxony from 10 to 12 September 2021.
Dress-up Olympic champion Werth in Achleiten not to beat
Achleiten - The six-time Olympic champion Isabell Werth was the outstanding rider at the dressage tournament in the Austrian Achleiten.
The 51-year-old from Rheinberg won four victories on the weekend.
After winning a Grand Prix for the first time with Holy Gold and Quantaz, she was also in the Grand Prix Special on Sunday and not in the race.
At the 15-year-old Stute Weihegold, Werth made a clear stand against the Austrian Victoria Max-Theurer on Abegglen on Sunday.
The Germans were also in the choir on Saturday on Quantaz, clearly ahead of their 34-year-old student Victoria Max-Theurer.
Werth's winner horse Quantaz belongs to Max-Theurer.
The most successful dressage rider in the world is to establish the ten-year-old stallion in the Grand Prix.
For Quantaz it was the first race ever.
Already at the first tournament in Achleiten three weeks ago, Werth had won all important four tests.
The last of the three international tournaments is planned there for the 14th to 16th of August.
In the future more air traffic controllers in Worms
The Wormser Hochschule goes further into the air: The "DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung" provides a professorship for "Air Traffic Management".
A corresponding contract between the university and the DFS has now been signed in Worms.
The contract was initially concluded for three years and started in 2021.
With the professorship there is the possibility of enabling the start of the study not only in the summer, but also for the winter semester.
This allows twice as many students to be trained as before.
At the same time, capacity is being used evenly in both the university and the DFS Air Safety Academy.
The DFS will advise the university on the establishment and occupation of the professorship.
Since 2019 represented at the university
Since the summer semester of 2019, the first students have been training as pilots at Worms University in Air Traffic Management.
This year already nine students started.
So far, the experiences of the DFS are very positive, the performance of the students is excellent.
The combination of study and pilot training contributes significantly to further increasing the attractiveness of the pilot profession.
"In these times, we don't find the promotion economically easy.
However, we are confident that air transport will recover and grow in the long term.
In order to fulfil our legal mandate in the future, we need highly qualified personnel," says Professor Klaus-Dieter Scheurle, Chairman of the DFS at the time of signing the contract.
"For the DFS, the foundation professorship is a future-proof investment that will provide air traffic controllers with a broad, technical cross-disciplinary knowledge base in the long term.
We therefore continue our good cooperation with the university and at the same time support our attractiveness as an employer".
This also underlines Professor Dr. Jens Hermsdorf, President of Worms University: "The foundation professorship forms an important bridge between science and business.
With it we would like to link to the existing cooperation with the DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung as a practical partner for the dual Bachelor's degree program Air Traffic Management".
At the same time, the trust of the German Air Safety Agency is the motivation and commitment of the University of Worms to further expand their teaching and research competence in the future fields of air transport.
In use for the air traffic controllers of tomorrow, the university with the first foundation professorship for a dual course of study could set very special highlights and innovative priorities for its students.
Dr. Denis Alt, State Secretary at the Ministry of Science, Education and Culture, emphasises: "The Worms University has a unique feature in Rhineland-Palatinate with its focus on air transport.
Today's signature of the cooperation agreement strengthens the profile of the university".
Rescue bolts land on the A 45
About 30 minutes the A 45 motorway was fully closed on Saturday afternoon in the direction of Aschaffenburg, since after a traffic accident the rescue helicopters were in use.
A 76-year-old drove with a Ford around 12.40 a.m. in the Alzenau-Mitte exit in the curve and landed at the guiding board.
Due to the impact, the front airbags were triggered, the driver suffered slight injuries in the face and had to be taken to a hospital for treatment.
The injuries of the 72-year-old passenger were provided by the emergency doctor and the patient flew to a hospital with the rescue helicopter.
At present, however, the police assume that there is no danger to life.
The damaged vehicle, which caused damage of about 2000 euros, had to be towed.
Heil wants to check other industries according to the meat industry
The Corona crisis re-examined the state in parts of the meat industry.
We're about to see a tightening of the law.
But are they right - and will it stay with them?
Federal Labour Minister Hubertus Heil (SPD) wants to review other sectors according to the now planned strict regulations against maladministration in the meat industry.
"We will look at the industry for industry and then take appropriate measures for the respective industry if necessary," said Heil of the German Press Agency in Berlin.
Germany's employer has already warned against restricting works contracts in general.
After the massive Corona outbreak at the meat giant Tönnies in North Rhine-Westphalia, the Federal Cabinet intends to pass a law of salvation on this Wednesday.
Large slaughterhouses should no longer be allowed to use foreign personnel during slaughter, cutting and meat processing.
To this end, the use of works contracts and temporary workers is to be prohibited there.
Employer President Ingo Kramer said to the dpa: "Finger away from a general restriction of employment contracts and employee transfer if you do not want to completely suffocate the economy".
For example, works contracts are mandatory for large areas of the craft industry, construction industry and plant construction as the basis for their value-added to the customer.
"The mistakes of individuals cannot destroy such an important instrument".
Heil assured: "My goal is not to ban works contracts anywhere in the German economy".
Work contracts are useful.
"When an industrial company instructs a craftsman to install a safety system, this is a normal work contract."
The German meat industry considers a ban on works contracts and hire work to be unconstitutional only in its industry.
It would not be possible to explain why, when serving and packing cheese, other labour law would be applicable in the future than for sausage, it is stated in an opinion on the legislative project, as the "New Osnabrücker Zeitung" (Saturday) reports.
Thus, in the event of a ban, the consumer price would increase by 10 to 20 percent per kilo and product.
Many East European workers from contract companies worked in the industry after the results of a test by the NRW Labour Protection Administration, partly 16 hours a day.
Often they had no break.
Wage was retained for protective equipment or rent.
It was also noted that the situation in the accommodation of employees was often miserable.
Heil said that a relatively sharp law had already entered into force for the meat industry in 2017.
But these have been bypassed by "trickful constructions".
"Now it is necessary to clean up thoroughly."
The politician announced: "The Labour Protection Act, which we want to adopt in the Cabinet at the end of July, also includes measures that concern not only the meat industry - for example, higher labour protection test rates or clear criteria for Community accommodation".
The draft presented by dpa includes amendments to the law on the protection of workers' rights in the meat industry as well as to the Labour Protection Act.
Brandenburg's Minister for Consumer Protection Ursula Nonnemacher (Green) considers more intensive controls necessary.
"I would like us to be able to carry out even more controls in many supervisory areas: food controls, animal welfare, everything possible, for example animal transport," said Nonnemacher on Sunday at the RBB broadcast "Brandenburg current".
However, more staff posts are also needed for more controls.
Three dead in the event of a crash of ultralight aircraft in Germany
When an ultralight aircraft crashed into a multifamily house in Wesel in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia, three people died, according to the police.
A child was easily injured.
Two more people had been injured in the accident, said a spokesman for the Wesel Circle Headquarters.
According to the police, a parachute had been found at the site of the accident.
The "Rheinische Post" reported on eyewitnesses that before the crash the plane crashed with a hot air balloon.
The house is a one- or two-family house.
Further details were initially not known.
The evacuation of Frankfurter Opernplatz takes place peacefully
A week after the outbursts in Frankfurt, the vacation of the opera place in the night on Sunday has also passed peacefully.
Last but not least, several dozen people stayed in the square, but left him at 1 o'clock before the start of the curfew.
The police had been in service since the early evening with numerous officials, throughout the city area there was a larger police assignment to see.
For the first time on this weekend from midnight, there was a ban on betting for the opera place, on which there was a week ago a crash.
Policemen had been attacked with bottles out of the crowd of celebrations.
At least five officers were injured after police reports, several police vehicles were damaged.
The night to Saturday was also quiet.
Car Overcomes: Young woman in accident on federal road 83 at Hofgeismar severely injured
In the event of an accident between Schöneberg and Hümme, a 21-year-old suffered serious injuries on Sunday at 1:25 p.m.
She was taken to Kassel Hospital.
With thermal cameras, the fire department was looking for possible passengers.
According to the police on federal road 83, the woman was on her way towards her home town of Hümme when her car came off the highway for an unexplained reason and crossed over several times.
In order to save the casualties, the fire department had to cut the roof of the car free.
Since it was unclear whether anyone was still in the vehicle, the adjacent cornfield was searched from the rotary conductor with a thermal camera.
The Drohnenstaffel from Warburg, which also works with thermal imaging cameras, had also been ordered for the search of persons.
However, the workers found no one between the high maize plants.
The seriously injured person was taken to the Kasseler Klinikum by the rescue car.
Almost 50 firefighters from Hofgeismar, Hümme and Schöneberg were on site.
The Bundesstraße was blocked for two hours due to the accident.
Juventus Turin Masters in Italy
Turin - After a saving goal by Cristiano Ronaldo, the record champion Juventus Turin has secured the Italian championship for the ninth time in a series.
The team around the five-time world footballer perfected the 36th scudetto of the club's history with a 2:0 (1:0) on Sunday evening in the home game against Sampdoria Genoa.
Ronaldo met at 1:0 before the mid-term.
With 83 points, Turin, without the last long wounded ex-national player Sami Khedira, is no longer to be replaced by 1st place two days before the end of the season of the series A.
The table width of Inter Milan is seven points.
Juventus was harmless in spite of optical superiority in the first half, then Ronaldo met after a free kick with the last action.
An addition of Miralem Pjanic used the 35-year-old from the penalty limit directly with a flat shot (45.+7).
Ronaldo was also involved against the more offensive guests on 2:0, after his shot Federico Bernardeschi (67th) dusted off.
This ensured the aimless but decisive success.
The Foulelfmeter shot at the latte in the 89th minute probably only Ronaldo himself with a view to the goal hunter-value.
"It is complicated to stay mentally and physically at ball height for 90 minutes.
The games are strange, and the momentum changes very easily," said Coach Maurizio Sarri after 1:2 at Udinese Calcio on Thursday.
Especially the mental exhaustion of his players was great, said the Juve Coach.
Because of the defeat, the Turiners had not yet been able to make the championship perfect.
Last but not least, Juve had the calming advantage at the top of the table, due to the weakness of the competitors.
Because in the eleven games before the game on Sunday, the Sarri team had only five wins.
It is questionable whether Ronaldo will still be the king of goalkeepers.
For while the Portuguese superstar has reached 31 goals so far, the former Dortmunder Ciro Immobile has already reached 34 goals in his account after his three-pack at the 5:1 (1:1) of Lazio Rome at Hellas Verona - as many as Robert Lewandowski contributed to the title win of FC Bayern.
The current Juve-Profi Gonzalo Higuaín holds the record in Italy.
The Argentinean scored 36 goals for the SSC Naples in the 2015/2016 season.
In August, the "Old Lady" of Italian football awaits the next title chance.
Juventus is in the eighth final of the Champions League, but on August 7 against Olympique Lyon has to make up a 0:1 win game to reach the final tournament in Lisbon.
Real Madrid or Manchester City would be waiting as opponents in the next K.o. round.
Baden-Württemberg: Over 250 illegal car races recorded
Stuttgart - In spite of all the punishments and court rulings that have been threatened, drivers in countless illegal races on the Baden-Württemberg streets continue to give gas: Last year and the first four months of this year, the police in the southwest have already registered more than 250 illegal car races.
Although there are no comparative values for the years before, the rascals are increasing the work of the judicial authorities: in 2018, a total of 155 investigations were conducted between Konstanz and Mannheim, a year later it was already 252 and in the current year until the beginning of June 151.
The race was less about organized events, as the Ministry of the Interior responded to a request from the Landtags-SPD.
In most cases, the drivers would have spontaneously approached each other or they would have taken refuge from the police - this is also indicated as an illegal race.
At the tax were mainly German men aged between 18 and 60.
113 Penalties - 15 times imprisonment
Only in comparatively few cases are the razers caught and also asked to pay: According to the Ministry of the Interior, a total of 113 fines have been imposed since 2018 and 15 prison sentences have been imposed.
However, there is no indication that the number of illegal car races is actually rising.
Rather, other drivers reacted more sensitively than before because of the many tragic accidents and processes of past years and showed more frequently, said a ministerial spokesperson.
The motorway is particularly popular with Rasern 8. Automobile drivers stop the traffic there again and again, in order to make room and use the free route for a race.
Last August a dozen drivers were caught near Kirchheim under Teck, and three months earlier there were even 18 drivers on the A8 at Merkelingen.
A81 is the most popular "Rennstrecke"
On the A81, the police record even more races than on any other federal highway.
With a tempo limit, it is tried to slow down the furrows on the particularly affected section between the narrow and the jitters.
The mostly high-priced and up-to-date sports and luxury bodies often have Swiss distinguishing marks, because drivers deviate to Germany because of the high penalties for driving too fast and racing in the neighboring country.
For the SPD, the speed limit should not be reduced to a few routes: "With a general speed limit of 130 kilometres, we would create this problem on motorways from the body," says Martin Rivoir, the traffic expert of the SPD-Landtagsfaktion.
"The barrier threshold for shaver would be significantly higher if you weren't going to be here and there legally with 200 kilometres of hours and more."
Rivoir says less about education or image campaigns: "Anyone who, in such a way, goes beyond all the rules and not only risks his own life, but also the lives of other road users, is not yet able to do so with reason."
ADAC calls for more police intervention
However, this is not enough for the ADAC: "We believe that rasers cannot be deterred from the tempo limits," says Holger Bach, Head of Transport and Environment at ADAC Württemberg.
It calls for additional and even tougher checks on the routes concerned.
Not uncommonly, the high-tour show of power is becoming more painful and more severe: Since January 2019 and until April 2020, three people have died nationwide in the races, two of them unaccompanied by a nightly crash in Stuttgart's city centre and one in Gerlingen.
There, two young men were reported to have delivered a car race in November.
One of the vehicles came off the road, bumped against a garden wall and remained on the side where the 18-year-old passenger died.
21 more people were injured during the last two years.
Stronger penalties are not necessary, however, according to Minister of Interior Thomas Strobl: "Legislative action is not seen in the paper of the Ministry of the Interior, in order to tighten up the sanctions for illegal motor vehicles.

Further evidence is received by the police.
Ackermann sprints to victory at the final stage at Sibiu Tour
At the final stage of the 10th Sibiu Tour, Radprofi Pascal Ackermann won his second day victory.
The 26-year-old Palatinate of the Bora-hansgrohe team went on the 109-kilometre-long section with start and finish in Hermannstadt in the mass print after winning a stage already on Saturday.
It was the three and four seasons for Ackermann.
In the overall ranking, his Austrian teammate Gregor Mühlberger was successful.
In the morning the 26-year-old had decided to take the mountain-time ride for himself and thus the top in the classification.
Only 104 riders had entered the final stage in the evening.
No less than 18 starters had fallen victim to the time limit in mountain driving.
"I'm really happy to start the new season with a victory," Ackermann explained after his success on Saturday.
"The sprint was really hectic," said the 26-year-old.
300 meters in front of the finish, he simply put on his sprint, "and it also worked perfectly".
In accordance with the rules of the World Federation of UCI, a Corona test was carried out six days before the start of the race for all race participants and their companions.
During the complete tour, drivers and supervisors were separated in isolated hygiene bubbles from the organization team as well as from the media.
Viewers at the start and goal were not allowed.
Headquarters gave instructions for lay resuscitation
Düsseldorf - Tragic accident on Sunday afternoon in Düsseldorf-Garath.
In a multifamily house, a child (4) suddenly lay lifeless in the water while bathing.
According to the fire department, the emergency call arrived just before 1:00 p.m.
"A director immediately gave instructions for lay resuscitation," said a fireman to BILD.
The incoming rescue forces took over the resuscitation measures a little later.
The child in danger of death was transported to the university under resuscitation.
Why it happened is unclear.
The police have routinely initiated investigations into the accident.
The fireman: "We're starting from a tragic accident in the apartment".
Nuremberg: Unapproved Tuning Meeting - Police attack, 700 vehicles and about 1,100 people
Hundreds of cars and temporarily over 1000 people participated in a "tuning meeting" on Saturday night in the parking lot of a furniture house.
The police implemented their announcement to monitor such events more closely.
A big tuning meeting took place on Saturday evening (25 July 2020) in Nuremberg South Town.
Several hundred vehicles were involved.
According to the Central Franconia Police, an increase in the number of vehicles in the area of a large car park in the Ingolstadter Straße was recorded at 10:30 p.m. by the Nuremberg Traffic Police.
The police then carried out a large number of vehicle checks there.
Only recently the police had announced that they would want to step up their action against so-called autoposer.
Illegal Tuning Meeting in Nuremberg: Only a small part from the "Scene"
The officials counted at the top well 700 vehicles and about 1,100 people, the police report.
However, only a small proportion of those present in the "Autoposer" and tuning scene are to be assigned to this.
Apparently, most of the relevant scene followed the police's appeal.
On the basis of the vehicles and persons on site, it is assumed that these were mainly showcasing.
In addition, the vast majority of those present complied with the applicable infection protection provisions, in particular the minimum distance and the wearing of a mouth-nose protection.
The on-the-spot checks were completed at 1:00 p.m.
In total, the officials found in 10 vehicles such structural changes that the operating permit had been lost.
Four of these vehicles had to be secured.
No car racing
There was no illegal car racing.
"The Central Franconian Police Bureau will continue to keep an eye on the events and will continue to carry out increased control measures, including in connection with the emergence of gullibles," it said.
The News5 agency said to Jürgen Schrödinger about the involved towing company: "They have all beautiful rims, we must not scratch them," Schrödinger said.
Special tapes would be used for this.
Even because the cars are wider, the company has to be careful not to cause any damage.
"The young people are supposed to keep their cars intact."
Number of work agency: 900 suspected abuses in short-time work
Berlin - According to its own statement, the Federal Agency for Labour (BA) investigates some 900 suspected cases of abuse of the short-time wage.
"This is extremely little for more than 880,000 companies that have displayed short-time work," said Daniel Terzenbach, Managing Director of the Operational Business of the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung".
When, at the beginning of the Corona crisis, a lot of companies suddenly applied for short-time work, BA had to react quickly.
Usually the test takes up to three weeks.
"So much time was not available to us in this hot phase.
All the more so will we look at the final accounts.
I'm sure there'll be a lot of things to do.
We are not naive and have a long breath".
Evidence of abuse often comes from the employees or trade unions concerned.
In addition, the BA uses analysis software to identify abuse patterns.
According to Terzenbach, the BA is preparing for a possible insolvency in autumn.
"Will there be significantly more insolvency than in the previous year?
The estimates are disassembled, but we are ready for the case and are already training our employees in the employment agencies for processing applications for insolvency funds."
The figures are still unobtrusive, said Terzenbach.
World Heritage in Potsdam: Party in the New Garden Dissolved
Potsdam - On Friday evening, about 40 young people celebrated a party in the New Garden.
The collection was dissolved at 20.48 o'clock by the district drivers of the Prussian Castles and Gardens Foundation (SPSG), the foundation informed on PNN request.
The kids would have left the park.
On Saturday evening some youths would have played in the New Garden Rugby.
The meadow had been cleared by district drivers, said SPSG spokesman Frank Kallensee on Sunday.
Time and again illegal celebrations in the parks
In the parks of the Foundation there are always collections where the rules of distance and hygiene Covid-19 handling are not complied with.
At the end of June there was a celebration with about 300 people in Babelsberg Park, and a week later about 150 people celebrated in the New Garden.
Even without Corona regulation, the parks are closed when darkness breaks down.
Camping on the meadows is prohibited according to parking regulations, there are few exceptions.
The Foundation has been complaining for a long time that visitors would leave more and more waste and destroy protected biotopes.
In Berlin illegal park parties have meanwhile reached a different dimension.
In the Hasenheide district of Neukölln, 5000 people celebrated an illegal techno party in the night to Sunday.
The event was dissolved by the police.
Austria: mass tests after Corona eruption in tourist resort
With hundreds of tests, authorities have responded to a Corona eruption in the popular Upper Austrian tourist town of St. Wolfgang.
The number of confirmed cases increased to 48, as reported by the national authorities in Linz.
More than 100 results stood out in the evening.
Thus, many of the infected young interns are in tourist establishments, but at least one holiday guest has also been positively tested.
Residents, guests and tourists were asked to stay in their accommodations on Saturday evening.
The curfew was set at 23 p.m.
"There are there and there cancellations and cancellations" of bookings, said the head of the Tourist Association Wolfgangsee, Hans Weiser, the dpa.
Guests were also left in advance.
St. Wolfgang is the most important tourist resort in Upper Austria, with more than 400,000 overnight stays last year.
In a normal season, about one third of the guests are German.
On Friday, the first infections had become public.
On Saturday, the head of the district authority, Alois Lanz, defended the behaviour of the interns who had celebrated in several places and could have infected themselves there.
"We all liked to do this in our youth," he said to the radio station Ö1.
However, two bars were closed on Friday to prevent further infections.
The tourism association launched an information campaign to raise awareness of the dangers of Covid-19.
From Saturday, hundreds of employees, holidaymakers and locals were tested.
In addition, all guests who were in St. Wolfgang from July 15 were contacted.
The outbreak evokes memories of the Austrian ski and party resort Ischgl in Tyrol, which was a centre of Corona distribution throughout Europe in the early phase of the pandemic.
In total, more than 1500 people are currently infected with the virus in Austria.
The focus of the new infections is Vienna and Upper Austria.
Premier League: Man United and Chelsea Qualified for Champions League
London (dpa) - The English football record champion Manchester United returns to the Champions League after a year of absence.
On the last day of the Premier League, the Red Devils secured the third table seat with a 2:0 (0:0) success against the direct competitor Leicester City.
The Foxes must now be satisfied with the Europa League, because the FC Chelsea was still passing and qualified as fourth for the king's class.
Aston Villa was able to rejoice in the fight against the descent.
Manchester United was led by Bruno Fernandes (71st minute).
After a red card for Leicester City in the playtime, Jesse Lingard (90.+8) met to the finish.
Chelsea, in the Champions League eighth-final opponent of FC Bayern, won against the Wolverhampton hikers thanks to Mason Mount (45.+1) and Olivier Giroud (45.+4).
"That means a lot to me," said Coach Frank Lampard, who is also against Arsenal in his first season as a Chelsea Coach in the final of the FA Cup.
Tottenham Hotspur also benefited from Chelsea's victory against Wolverhampton, which still passed the Wolves with a lean 1:1 (1:0) at Crystal Palace and started as the sixth in the Europe League.
Aston Villa decided to use the Watford FC and the AFC Bournemouth, but had to shake around the class at West Ham United for a long time.
The late leadership of Jack Grealish (84th) resembled Andrej Jarmolenko (85th) immediately.
The 1:1 (0:0) was enough, however, because Watford lost with 2:3 (1:3) at Arsenal.
The club, which had three trainers in the season, descends after five first-liga years.
Just like Bournemouth, who could no longer save himself by a 3:1 (2:1) at Everton FC.
At the end, there was one point missing.
The FC Liverpool, which has been established as an English champion since the end of June, secured a club record with a 3:1 (1:1) victory at Newcastle United.
99 counters are the highest value Reds have ever achieved in a football season.
Coach Jürgen Klopp just missed the score record in English football with his team.
The best brand holds Manchester City with 100 points in the 2017/18 season.
After the Newcastle leadership in the first minute, Virgil van Dijk (38th), Divock Origi (59th) and Sadio Mané (89th) played the game for Liverpool on Sunday.
"For this wonderful club it was an extraordinary season," said Torschütte van Dijk after the game, "that should encourage us to defend the title.
It's gonna be hard."
In the end, the Premier League bosses should also be satisfied.
Due to the Coronavirus crisis, the football business in England had been interrupted from 13 March to 17 June.
In the meantime, even a premature break or a performance of the rest of the games was discussed on neutral ground.
Finally, however, the season could be finished without special events - but as in Germany without spectators in the stadiums.
Arrests and violence in demonstrations against Netanyahu
The protests in Israel against Head of Government Netanyahus are becoming more and more violent.
There have been violent conflicts at night.
The Israeli police took violent action in Jerusalem on the night of Sunday against participants in a demonstration against the right-wing conservative head of government Benjamin Netanyahu.
Twelve people were arrested for participating in unrest, police spokesperson Micky Rosenfeld announced.
The police, among other things, used water guns to disband the rally.
A total of 6,000 people gathered near Netanyahu's office on Saturday evening, according to media reports.
They protested against unemployment, corruption and Netanyahu's handling of the Corona crisis.
The Protestants beat drums, blew horns, and called Netanyahu to resign.
Participants of an area demonstration supporting Netanyahu had also been arrested, reported the news page "ynet".
People also demonstrated in many other places in Israel, including in front of the private villa of the head of government in the coastal city of Caesarea and in a park in Tel Aviv.
A man was arrested after police reports near Tel Aviv because he was suspected of spraying pepper spray from a driving car on demonstrators on the roadside.
Another man was arrested after a trade fair attack on a protester in the south of the country.
The demonstrator had been slightly injured in the neck.
In Jerusalem and Tel Aviv there have been several demonstrations against Netanyahu.
The demonstrations accompany the corruption process against the head of government.
Last, Netanyahu was also criticized for his handling of the Corona crisis.
Among other things, he is expected to have rapid relaxations and a lack of preparation for a second Corona wave.
The Corona crisis has made the economy of the country difficult.
The unemployment rate was last higher than 20 per cent.
The number of new infections with the Coronavirus in Israel has recently risen to record levels.
Accident at Ahlen (NRW) - Transporter force on car - nine injured - Ruhrgebiet - Bild.de
Ahlen - A driving accident claimed nine light injuries on Saturday afternoon at the B58 at Ahlen.
One car driver was on her way to Beckum with her two children (3, 5).
The police said: "Probably she had suddenly slowed down because she wanted to turn down."
The driver of a Mercedes transporter driving behind her must have seen it too late.
He was powerful on the back of the car.
In the accident, three passengers in the car and six in the transporter were slightly injured.
Several rescue cars took them to an surrounding hospital.
North Korea will lock the border town to Corona suspect
North Korea has so far seen a "lighting success" in its own measures to combat the Corona virus.
Now the country is reporting a suspicion for the first time.
Because of a first official Corona suspicion in the country, North Korea has completely sealed off a major city for fear of a disaster.
Despite the strictest epidemiological defenses in the past six months, "the evil virus could have been introduced into the country," the state media reported.
For the region around the border town of Kaesong, the emergency situation had been imposed.
The Communist leadership called out the highest alarm level.
Should the suspicion be confirmed, it would be the first official case of Sars-CoV-2 infection in the detonated country.
North Korea had so far not registered a single infection according to its own data and described its defenses as "lighting success".
The data were doubted abroad.
According to the reports, the disease symptoms were identified by an "outbreaker" who illegally crossed the military demarcation line between South and North Korea on 19 July.
The person had settled in South Korea three years ago and had now returned across the border.
There was no confirmation at first from South Korea for the border crossing within the four-kilometre-wide and, for the most part, still maimed military buffer zone.
South Korea's military, however, according to reports by the national news agency Yonhap, allowed the possibility of an illegal border crossing to North Korea as high.
Investigations were carried out on some persons.
According to North Korea, on Saturday on suspicion, an urgent meeting of the Workers' Party's political office was convened under the chairmanship of Maj. Jong Un.
The "dangerous situation in Kaesong could trigger a deadly and destructive disaster".
Kim had already ordered on Friday as a preventive measure to "block Kaesong completely and isolate each district and region from others", it continued.
The data subject and all people in Kaesong who had been in contact with her had been quarantined.
The Central Military Commission of the Party is therefore to investigate the "outbreak" as well as the conduct of the responsible military unit and, if necessary, impose severe punishment.
In Kaesong, it is estimated that some 300,000 people live.
Tensions before Council meeting: City-East and noise protection are still before great summer break for discussion
"In addition to environmental issues, the members of the board will also vote on the construction plan for the large-scale project "Zentstadtentwicklung-Ost", says rather casually in the middle of the city press release for the next municipal council meeting on Tuesday, 28 July, at 4.30 p.m. in the Grand Hall of the Congress Centre Pforzheim.
In particular, the upgrading of the eastern city is discussed controversially until the end.
The majority of this is scarce, most recently in individual committees, even negative depending on the presence.
An appeal from the economy (construction, real estate, trade and IT), the project developed by the administration and the municipal council, now not to fail after almost ten years of preparation, criticised project opponent Reinhard Klein as "extra-parliamentary opposition", "inconceivable", "speculation", "disillusionment" and "conscious misstatements".
"Everyone thinks they know better," says Klein, who has been a member of the municipal council for one year as the only representative of the citizens' list Pforzheim.
In fact, after reading the contracts in this position, he was: "I know what I'm talking about."
The exit is cheaper for the city that the Technical Town Hall is, contrary to statements made by the city administration, after grants whose existence Klein is convinced to renovate for 8.5 million euros.
The city will develop quite differently when one predicts in the town hall and on the part of the advocates from the economy.
The City by its own strength and not by an investor: This is its plan B. One day after Klein, the FDP/FW/UB/LED group, which also rejects the project, presented an alternative concept.
It essentially also provides for the renovation of the Technical Town Hall, the opening of the Schloßberg, the rental of the ex-Thal for administrative areas and a smaller urban transformation in the ideal case with local carriers.
Environmental issues play a central role
Environmental issues in particular will play a central role.
For example, the municipal council will vote on the noise action plan.
This includes various measures to protect the Pforzheim population from health-related noise pollution caused by road traffic, including often temporary reductions.
In a press release, the German Transport Club welcomes the widespread introduction of Tempo 30. However, political leaders in the city are not innocent of the need to do so, because they have only contributed to the massive increase in car traffic and thus noise by neglecting scheduled bus services with thinned paces and by little commitment to cycling, according to the VCD.
The municipal council also agrees on the participation of the city of the Pforzheim/Enzkreis Energy and Climate Agency.
It is also on the agenda of accession to the Baden-Württemberg Climate Change Pact, the re-establishment of parental contributions in urban day-care facilities and the application for inclusion in the Federal Smart City Fund.
Citizens are welcome, but need to take care of Corona protection measures.
Tim Zimmermann starts the new season with a lot of delay
With almost half a year delay Tim Zimmermann starts his premiere season at the ADAC GT Masters on July 31st.
Before the league of the super sports cars can start the regular operation, the first test runs started.
For Zimmermann, it was primarily about getting to know his Lamborghini Huracan GT3.
The Corona crisis has long prevented Tim Zimmermann from embarking on his first service in the new Lamborghini Huracan of Grasser Racing.
Under special hygiene conditions, this was now possible.
The 23-year-old Langenargen turned his first laps on the Lausitzring and got used to his premiere in the GT3 car.
"There are a few things that are different from Porsche in the previous season," says Zimmermann.
"With the ABS, for example, you have to go to the curves differently.
But it really has been a lot of fun."
Zimmermann also had fun with Steijn Schothorst, with whom he will share his orange sports car in the GT Masters.
Despite his only 25 years of experience in the GT sport, the Dutch were able to help his new teammate in many things.
"I'm not a beginner in motorsport, but each new series also brings new challenges," says Zimmermann.
"Steijn and I understand us dazzlingly and we also made tremendous progress at the Lausitzring from session to session."
Right there - at the Lausitzring - the GT Masters will also perform its first race.
From July 31st, the 33 super sports cars will race through the Lausitz.
Zimmermann, who is one of 15 series newcomers, knows the route.
In 2015 he was last guest in the Motodrom.
"It worked quickly and I had to get a little used to the track," says Zimmermann, who starts for the Friedrichshafen racing community Count Zeppelin.
"The Lausitzring has many fast passages that you need to meet optimally in order to be fast."
How fast Zimmermann is then really, that turns out in two weeks.
"Of course, the teams play a little poker in the tests," he says.
"In the end, however, we are very satisfied and look forward to the first weekend at the Lausitzring".
The race in Brandenburg will be the start of a densely pressed calendar.
Until the beginning of November, seven races are on.
Presently, the stand is that no spectators will be allowed - but there is a prominent guest.
In mid-August at the Nürburgring, ex-Formel-1 pilot Niko Hülkenberg will take over to the GT-Lenkrad.
British Minister of Transport of Quarantine Decision caught cold
According to the press reports, the British government's decision to quarantine Spain workers after their return for two weeks has caught up with the country's transport minister.
Grant Shapps is therefore currently on holiday in Spain, while his colleagues at home decided the measure on Saturday.
Because of the rising Corona numbers in Spain, the Cabinet in London removed the country from the list of countries from which entry without quarantine is possible.
The new regulation will apply from today, Sunday, with which Shapps will also have to quarantine after his return.
In Austria, the government has also imposed quarantine measures for returnees.
But the rules apply to those who are only on the day of leave, only from Saturday, August 1st, and were not introduced overnight.
By the way, Spain is still regarded in Austria as one of the "safe countries" for which no quarantine is required in Austria.
"Numerous ministers should have known beforehand that there is a possibility of a quarantine for holidaymakers in Spain," said Labour Member Diane Abbot.
"But apparently no one has bothered to tell Grant Shapp's message."
Nearly one month after the end of the Corona emergency in Spain and the expiry of the strict exit barrier, the infection rates in the country are rising again.
Virologists are primarily responsible for nightlife for the further spread.
Spain is one of the most popular holiday countries in the UK.
The British Government currently advises against unnecessary travel to the Spanish mainland, with the exception of the British holidaymakers, particularly popular Canary Islands and Balearic Islands.
So far, more than 272,000 infections with the novel Corona virus and more than 28,000 deaths have been recorded in Spain.
Russia: Marine Day: Putin announces hypersonic weapons for warships
Russian President Vladimir Putin has announced to the day of the Navy in his country an outfit of warships with the most modern hypersonic weapons.
With these unique weapons in the world, the fighting possibilities of the Russian sea forces would be expanded, said Putin on Sunday in St. Petersburg at the Central Marine Parade.
According to Interfax, the Ministry of Defence also informed the Agency of successful tests of the Zirkon hypersonic rocket built for the Marine.
The hypersonic weapons have a multiple of the sound speed of about 343 meters per second.
They are considered weapons of the future.
Underwater tropeo is further built
It was also built on the atomic submerged torpedo Poseidon, it was called.
The planned sea drone is planned to destroy coastal targets.
The President himself, who also sailed a military boat, said that this year alone 40 new ships would be put into service by the individual fleet associations of the largest country on earth.
Russia has such a large coastal area as no other country in the world.
For 300 years, the Navy has protected Russia reliably, said Putin on the day celebrated by sailors nationwide.
Also on many other Russian coastal north, the Sea Forces began the day of the Navy with parades.
In Syria, where Russia is fighting on the side of master Bashar al-Assad, the military demonstrated the strength of Tartus in a weapons show in the Mediterranean port.
Munitions were fired there too.
A video published by the Ministry of Defense featured not only warships, including a submarine, but also fighter helicopters and jets.
Hurricane "Hanna" reaches Texas: Help for Corona Complicated
Washington - This year's first hurricane over the Atlantic has hit land in Texas.
Life-threatening floods, strong winds and heavy rains now threatened parts of the U.S. state, the National Hurricane Center of the U.S. Climate Agency NOAA announced at night on Sunday (local time).
Governor Greg Abbott called out the emergency for many districts.
The Corona Pandemic that grazes in Texas makes the work of the helpers more difficult, said Abbott according to U.S. media.
Evacuated to Caution
"Every hurricane is a huge challenge," said Abbott, according to the newspaper "Houston Chronicle".
Looking at the cyclone in Texas, he added: "This challenge is complicated and is compounded by the fact that it is sweeping through an area that is the most affected area of the state by Covid-19".
According to Johns Hopkins University, some 5,000 people have died in Texas alone as a result of the Corona pandemic.
Abbott called for caution on people who had to leave their homes.
You should not disregard practices "in which we've gotten used to", such as wearing masks, the governor said according to the transmitter CBS.
It was important that all the distances were kept.
Therefore, hotel rooms have also been provided in some places.
In addition, emergency rooms should be tested for Corona.
First, damage had only been reported from the coastal town of Port Mansfield.
Storm Warning Revoked
At wind speeds of up to 150 kilometres per hour, "Hanna" was hit on the island of Padre Island, according to government reports, just off the Texan coast, on land.
The tropical storm had previously been upgraded to the hurricane of the lowest level one.
At first, a storm flood warning had been issued for the coastal section from Port Mansfield to Sargent and later was taken back.
The authorities expected a weakening, while "Hanna" continued to move to the interior of the country and to the northeast of Mexico.
"Douglas" moves to Hawaii
In the Pacific, Hurricane "Douglas" was on its way to Hawaii during the night on Sunday with wind speeds of about 150 kilometres per hour.
However, the Hurricane Center expected it to continue to weaken.
According to the prediction, he is supposed to be on Sunday (local time) near the largest islands of Hawaii - then as a storm just below the hurricane threshold.
This year, after a May prediction, NOAA expected an above-average active hurricane season across the Atlantic.
From June to the end of November up to ten hurricanes were expected, of which up to six could become very strong whirlwinds, the Authority explained.
On average, there are six hurricanes per year across the Atlantic, three of which develop into storms of great strength.
Given the available climate data and the higher water temperature in the Atlantic and the Caribbean, the probability of a normal season was only 30 percent, which was one below average even at ten percent, at the time.
U.S. President Donald Trump wrote on Twitter that his government is closely watching the storms and is in contact with the affected states.
Four Gates Acknowledged: Video assistant "punished" Sassuolo
Sassuolos Filip Djuricic were immediately recognized two goals
Naples - four goals scored, four goals recognized: Sassuolo Calcio experienced a rave black evening at 0:2 (0:1) at the SSC Naples in the Italian football league Series A - and was really mad at the video assistant of the referee.
"A festival not given gates for Sassuolo.
The VAR has never been so hard on a team," commented Corriere dello Sport.
Host Naples had taken the lead through a gate of foreign defender Elseid Hisaj in the 8th minute, in which Filip Djuricic initially cheered for the compensation.
The Video Assistant Reference (VAR) took the hit back because of a remote position.
Five minutes later, Djuricic again shot the ball into the net - once again the VAR attacked.
Also the gates of attackers Francesco Caputo (50th) and Domenico Berardi (61th) took the referee team back after the VAR had been notified.
In the replay time, Allan made the 2:0 finish for Naples and the bitter evening for Sassuolo perfect.
"The VAR is worse for Sassuolo than a radar trap on the street and punishes Sassuolo like no team before.
The new technology ensures records," writes Gazzetta dello Sport.
FC Bayern Munich: Pavard injured
Munich (dpa) - The start to the hot preparatory phase for the Champions League began for Double Winner FC Bayern with a setback.
After a short holiday and a few days of training, Hansi Flick, who recovered "somewhat well", has to think about how he can reconstruct his successful defenses after the injury of world champion Benjamin Pavard.
The Frenchman, who has the third most active minutes behind Captain Manuel Neuer and Middlefield Chief Joshua Kimmich, suffered a band injury at the left foot root and threatens to miss in decisive royal class duels.
In the Munich dirt weather, the legal defender broke down a training game and was driven with a golf card from the square.
How long the unrestricted tribal player has to pause in the fight for the title is open.
A stake in the eighth-final match against the FC Chelsea on August 8 is likely to be difficult, and the 24th-year-old can hope for the final tournament, which will begin in Lisbon on August 12.
The Bayern don't want to stop from the indiscretion of the training on Sunday.
Flick named in his personal triple formula the three attributes he wants to see from his stars on the way to Portugal's capital.
Quality, intensity and concentration are intended to show his victorious title collectors in the 28 days that follow in the ideal case until the end of the King Class game on August 23.
"We have just mastered the duty tasks with championship and trophy.
Now it's time to do the special thing," said Flick.
Until the Munichers can deal with the final tournament and a training camp at the Algarve in the first place, the eighth-final duty is against the FC Chelsea.
After the 3:0 in the play before the Corona break, the Londoners in the home arena should not become the Bayern nightmare again like in the lost "final dahoam" in 2012.
"We have to go through the door first.
We want to win, create good conditions and refuel trust with a good game," demanded Flick.
A vote test will be held on Friday against Olympique Marseille.
With a long speech, Flick had sworn his stars, who had 13 days off after the double, on a unique August.
31 players welcomed him on the Säbener Straße, including the new players around the noble purchase Leroy Sané, who met all new colleagues on the square for the first time after his change from Manchester City.
"Leroy, like all the new ones, has been well inserted," said Flick.
But instead of talking about the new season, when Sané & Co. is no longer allowed to just coach, Flick preferred to talk about the current title project of the German series champion.
After days of individual and small group training, the team will now be trained for the Londoners, who are in the rhythm of the game in contrast to the Flick ensemble.
Afterwards, the Munichers could be faced with a quarter final against the FC Barcelona and Lionel Messi, and in the semifinals, Real Madrid, Manchester City or Juventus Turin are possible opponents.
One way to the finale in Lisbon "is not so easy," stressed the chief coach, who can rely on the services of his new assistant Miroslav Klose in training from Tuesday on.
The WM recorder shooter Klose and Flick know about so many joint tournament preparations, which is particularly important in the 0-to-100-conference.
With his current team the work was "a pleasure," Flick praised.
The "focused on winnings" was an impressive feature of his team.
The tournament with Neuner-Teams was also an ambitious event on Sunday.
All of the performers were present, including the emigrator Thiago and defender David Alaba, whose stay is not secured beyond the royal class season.
Formula 1 needs a special rule to choose its world champion
Since the required number of continents cannot be driven, the FIA must improvise to award the World Cup title.
However, all America races were cancelled.
Racing calendar is getting more and more concrete
The race calendar of the current Formula 1 season continues to take shape.
Three more races were added to the ten confirmed Grand Prix during the week.
In October the Nürburgring in Germany and Portimão in Portugal will be held.
On November 1st, Lewis Hamilton and Co. compete for World Cup points on the Italian traditional race track in Imola.
This means that the 2020 race calendar includes 13 races at the current stage.
"We are pleased that we continue to make great progress in completing our plans for the 2020 season," said Formula One Boss Chase Carey.
A total of 15 to 18 races will be held in the king class of motorsport in this exceptional season.
The Formula 1 will finish its season in Asia.
The final race calendar will be fixed and published in the coming weeks.
According to media reports, performances in Vietnam and Malaysia could take place at the end of November before the already officially announced races in Bahrain and Abu Dhabi in December.
Regulation requires racing on three continents
The rules of Formula 1 require at least races on three continents for the award of the World Cup.
Even if, as currently planned, only two continents are driven, there should be a world champion.
With the help of a special rule, the FIA intends to award the title under "exceptional circumstances" because of the Coronavirus pandemic.
The traditional season start in Australia in March had to be cancelled in the short term due to the start of the Corona crisis.
A return to the continent this year is not a topic.
In addition, Formula 1 will not be a guest in America this year.
Absage encounters criticism in Brazil
Due to the tense Corona situation, the races will not take place in Canada, the USA, Mexico and Brazil.
"We are looking forward to being with them again next season," said Carey.
The American race's rejection was particularly critical in Brazil: "The cancellation did not come as a surprise for us, but we cannot accept the reasons for it," said Tamas Roonyi, promoter of the Grand Prix in São Paulo.
The number of infections in São Paulo is significantly lower than in other regions of Brazil.
Furthermore, the concerns of some teams about not wanting to drive in Brazil would not justify any cancellation.
They were prepared for the security measures required.
Greta Thunberg: Bad look against Donald Trump went around the world
Greta Thunberg spoke about her meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump.
Greta Thunberg was a guest in Stephen Colbert's well-known Latight show by video switch and revealed in the interview what she had in mind when she met Donald Trump.
Klimaatkivistin Greta Thunberg was a guest in a popular US show by video.
Among other things, she told of her struggle against the world’s powerful.
The teenage girl also talked about her famous "bad look" at her encounter with Donald Trump.
New York City - Over the past two years, climate activist Greta Thunberg has drawn attention to herself with her tireless commitment to the Fridays For Future movement.
Now, in a well-known Latency show, she talked about her plans in the future as well as her encounter with US President Donald Trump at the UN Climate Summit last year.
Latent moderator Stephen Colbert greeted 17-year-old Thunberg on Tuesday in your show and conducted a longer interview with the Swedish.
She talked not only about her fight against climate change, but also about her conflict with the world's powerful.
"There are some things that surprised me," she said.
"How far people go to steer the focus away from the climate crisis," she shook.
"Everything from organized hate campaigns to threats, just because a group of children goes on the road" she experienced.
Heads of State and leading politicians who ridicule them in social media or even try to silence them find them "funny" because they show the reactions, "because they have no other answer to it".
It became particularly interesting at the end of the interview when Greta Thunberg was addressed to a well-known scene in which she gave U.S. President Trump a bitter look behind.
At the 2019 UN Climate Summit in New York, for which the actress sailed across the Atlantic, her expressive view was captured by the cameras and since then has been seen by countless people on the Internet.
The short clip produced a GIF, i.e. an animated image, which eventually became one of the most commonly used images for Trump opponents.
But what did the 17-year-old think about the U.S. President at this moment?
To Stephen Colbert's relatively open question, she answered: "To be honest, I don't think that needs any further explanation."
With the ready answer, the experienced satiric Colbert had probably not expected and disappeared laughing from the picture for a short time.
With her "How were you?" speech about the principles of climate protection, she remembered many at the climate conference.
Ex-Dortmunder real estate with three pack for Lazio Rome
Ciro Immobile is now in the race for Europe's Golden Shoe and Bayern's Robert Lewandowski.
The former Dortmunder Ciro Immobile has the best chance of becoming a goalie king in the Italian football championship.
The former BVB professional contributed three hits at the 5:1 (1:1) victory of Lazio Rome at Hellas Verona, including two transformed eleven meters in the replay times of both halves.
Thus, the 30-year-old of the table fourth two season games before the end now has 34 season goals in his account - as many as Robert Lewandowski scored from FC Bayern Munich in the expired Bundesliga season.
In Italy Cristiano Ronaldo follows with 30 goals so far, the Portuguese superstar met with the top rider in the evening still on Sampdoria Genoa.
Fleetwood Mac co-founder Peter Green died
His life was like a roller coaster ride: After a rapid ascent with Fleetwood Mac it went steeply downhill and then slowly uphill again.
Now the Bluesrock guitarist Peter Green died at the age of 73.
Ingenious guitarist, drug junkie, cult fan: The co-founder of Fleetwood Mac, Peter Green, is dead.
He died peacefully in sleep at the age of 73, family members announced in an official statement on Saturday that another statement would be announced for the next days.
Top musicians like Peter Frampton appreciated Green as one of the best blues and rock guitarists.
Mick Fleetwood spoke in an emotional response of a "monumental loss" for all former and current members of the Fleetwood Mac band.
The drummer Fleetwood and guitarist Green had founded the now legendary band in London in 1967, until today his dreamy instrumental hit "Albatross".
The life of the musician ("The End Of The Game", "In The Skies") was like a roller coaster ride.
With Fleetwood Mac, Green experienced a rapid rise - the band celebrated its biggest successes but then without him.
There was a dispute, among other things, because Green wanted to donate all the Group's winnings for charitable purposes.
He began to appear in wide robes and with a large crucifix.
Mental problems should also have played a role.
Green left the band in 1970 three years after it was founded.
It followed a social descent.
The Bluesrock guitarist suffered from drug abuse and schizophrenia, as cinematographers reported.
Green was treated in the psychiatry for a long time.
During most of the 1970s, the musician disappeared from the picture area.
He was supposed to live on the street for a while, worked as a cemetery gardener and spent a while in an Israeli kibbuz.
Green was born in 1946 as the son of a Jewish working family in Bethnal Green, London.
Already in his early years, he was enthusiastic about American blues musicians such as B.B. King and Muddy Waters.
At the age of 11, he learned the first guitar grips.
At the age of 15, the teenager began to play professional guitar and five years later got the chance to stand on stage as a lead guitarist for the instrumental band Peter B's Looners.
==References====External links==* Official website
In the middle of the Blues-Boom, Green founded Fleetwood Mac together with his Bluesbreakers colleagues Mick Fleetwood and John McVie in the summer of 1967.
The song "Albatross" composed by Green gave the group the first number one hit in the winter of 1968/69 and catapulted it to the top of the British music scene.
But the rapid rise soon showed his shadows: Green did not withstand the media clutter, his experiments with the drug LSD became ever more extreme.
He later commented on the life between music and addiction in an interview: "The worst thing that happened to me in life is the drugs - the best thing was to land a number one hit".
At the end of the decade, Green was surprisingly successful in 1979 with a religiously inspired album.
Fleetwood Mac now swims without him in new formation on a wave of success.
Her album "Rumours" was released in 1977 and sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Despite several small solo successes, Green did not achieve a major comeback until he re-started with a group of friends in 1996.
The British Daily Telegraph then spoke of a rock star returning to Earth.
Green released some albums with the Peter Green Splinter Group until the band broke up in 2004.
For music experts he was already a blues legend in his lifetime - and with his gentle sound one of the most influential guitarists in recent decades.
