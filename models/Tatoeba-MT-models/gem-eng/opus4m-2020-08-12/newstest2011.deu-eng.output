What should she do, the ČSSD? The Czech Social Democrats in Prague know neither Voldemort nor the "Konditorei".
The new councillors of the capital from the ranks of the ČSSD will obviously have to overcome certain language barriers in order to be able to understand their old-new colleagues from the ODS in the Prague Council and in the City Council at all.
The Aktuálně.cz newspaper has once "knocked" members of the new council from the ČSSD, as they dominate the notorious snake that has become a citizen in recent years, in which today's coalition partners in Prague were on the row.
The codified vocabulary, introduced by Prague's political elite in the run-up era by Mayor Pavel Bém, is derived from some of the best-known actors, situations and causae.
Surprisingly, it turned out that the new councils in relation to which these new terms fall somewhat into the dark.
At least they say that.
"Who's Voldemort?"
"I don't know."
"I am rather a newcomer in Prague's politics," replied Lukaš Kaucký, the new Councillor for Culture, to the test of the "paten vocabulary".
But also the Councillor Karel Březina - a political veteran - reacted in a similar way.
For example, on the term "Golfloch".
"This is the only expression of those you present to me here that I use over and over again."
"Otherwise, I don't like snakes much."
From the vocabulary published by Aktuálně.cz in June of this year before the election congress of the ODS, the editorial team picked out six terms, especially those that are notoriously connected to the Prague Magistrate.
The Social Democrats should define the terms "voldemort", "largest Prague golf hole", "go to the pastry", "Stiennacken", "confidence of the capital" and "bleach".
Although three Prague councillors agreed to the test, the fourth - Antonín Weinert, the future head of the Prague school system - promised his first participation in the conversation, but did not even take the listener off.
The fifth Councillor, Petr Dolínek, rejected the test from the outset.
"I don't care about these things, and how the civil democrats talk to each other, I don't judge them."
"For me, it is important how we understand ourselves in our programmes," he countered.
As already indicated, in the above headline, Lukáš Kaucký allegedly would not have realized that the talk of the influential entrepreneur and friend of the former mayor Bém, Roman Janoušek, is.
The term "voldemort" says nothing at all and the only term he correctly coined during the test was "the largest Prague golf hole".
"This is the Blanka tunnel," says Kaucký, adding to safety: "But I know that from the newspaper."
And funny: "I guess I'll have to take a language course."
The "Golfloch" is then correctly identified not only by Matador Karel Březina, but also by the Environment Councillor Lukáš Plachý as a tunnel Blanka.
But both Social Democrats also know who the term Voldemort stands for and Lukáš Plachý even suspects where this figure is to be found and what it means to "go to the pastry".
"I think that means going to some Prague gastronomy business," is Plachý pretty close to the puzzle solution when you know that this is the headquarters of Janoušek's companies.
In agreement with Březina, however, he claims to have drawn this knowledge from the newspaper rather than being his own vocabulary.
According to the test participants, there seems to be no similar natural snake among the Social Democrats.
"I also asked my colleagues, but obviously there is no such thing with us."
"We call ourselves by name, sometimes we also use shorts or nicknames," says the chairman of Prague ČSSD Petr Hulínský - called by his party comrades salopp "Hulda".
"In school I was called Bříza (Birke), but I don't know if my colleagues also call me that," Karel Březina tells us his nickname.
Deník Aktuálně.cz has tried the name and see - it works.
Counselor Weinert is friendly to the party comrades of the "Grappy" or less friendly of the "Old", the representative Miroslav Poche, who drew attention to himself before the elections by making arrangements at the party sponsorship, is called by some colleagues "Igráček" (known Czech Lego figure).
So nicknames are the only ones that allow the Social Democrats to use internal language.
Hulínský does not seem to like it when he is called "Hulda", but Deník Aktuálně.cz registered another nickname of the Prague president.
His nickname "Doctor of Rubber Knives Rights" is said to be connected to the fact that Petr Hulínský has acquired his title Doctor Juris at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The government wants to stop the torture of witches and published a brochure
Women who are stamped as witches in Burkina Faso usually have some common social characteristics.
They belong more to the older generation, they find no work - for example for health reasons, they are unemployed and have no children.
If one of these women becomes a witch, it is strictly isolated so that it cannot become dangerous to the rest of the village.
"Men are quite rarely affected by this fate."
"Young and healthy women, too, are spared because they help in the work and give birth to children," says a sister-in-law, describing the situation in the capital of the West African state of Burkina Faso in a special home of more than one hundred women who have been expelled from their communities.
The local government now decided to take action against this abnormal "social measure".
And for this reason published a brochure to stop the "Witch Persecution".
But this thing has a hook.
"More than 70 percent of all adults in Burkina Faso cannot read," the newspaper "the Standard" pointed to the dilemma of written enlightenment.
The witchcraft is also going on and on in other African countries.
In Ghana, the neighboring country of Burkina Faso, 27-year-old Ammy Hemmahová was tortured by three women and two men to death - they poured them over with gasoline and just lit them.
Among other things, the server BBC reported on this incident.
The perpetrators, however, claimed that the matter had only been a meeting of unfortunate circumstances.
According to their version, oil was ignited, which was used for ritual anointing.
And that is, after the group tried to "repel an evil spirit" from the woman.
The isolation of witches supports people here without regard for their education.
"The standard" quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso: "Fressers of human souls are a danger earlier than today," he said.
While the government in Burkina Faso is at least trying to defuse the witch hunt, last year the President of Gambian has been quite involved.
"President Yahya Jammeh, after the death of his aunt, set off a monstrous witch hunt, because they allegedly had a share in their deaths and would now try to kill the president by black magic."
"To this end, he called Shamane from nearby Guinea for help, who, accompanied by policemen, soldiers and the President's bodyguard, deliberately kidnapped women and men from Gambian villages and brought them to the President's farm in Kanilai," said Amnesty International in her report.
On the farm, the incised people were forced to drink an absud of plants with hallucinogenic effects, but also caused intestinal and kidney problems.
Two of the arrested people did not survive the stay at the farm.
Only because of the international pressure were the nearly a thousand prisoners released again.
A tenant of Bakala: He heats in the oven - nevertheless pays higher rent
An elderly man who is under his care leaves the client center of the company RPG Byty of the "Kohlebaron" Zdeněk Bakala, the largest private owner of rental apartments in the Czech Republic.
Under the arm a folder with three new leases to three apartments: for his own and the apartments of his daughters and his son, who is currently in prison.
All three were increased in the context of the so-called "deregulation" precisely the rent.
Instead of 3500 crowns of monthly rental, the son is scheduled next year for a 2-room apartment with kitchen of the second category 4100 crowns.
"And there isn't even running hot water in the apartment and you have to heat it in a simple coal furnace," he taps with his finger on the son's new lease contract, to which he has a mandate.
"But what - I signed," he explains half voted and half resigned.
The BytyOKD.cz Association, which called the new rental conditions "inappropriate and immoral", advises tenants not to sign the new contracts and to wait until December 7 when it intends to publish a guide on how to proceed with such contracts.
But the man's just waving off.
"One says this, the other says this," he makes a dark face.
The region of Ostrava thus becomes a large "deregulation laboratory".
After New Year, this deregulation is ahead of most rental apartments in the Czech Republic, whose tenants do not yet pay marketable rent.
Aktuálně.cz therefore decided to visit this "laboratory" personally.
The RPG Warehouse in Havířov is one of four in the Ostrava region and already nine in the morning on this Tuesday.
Right next to the door are the bodyguards of a security agency and a caller to her.
"Miete 2011", a special touchscreen button will light up.
Short tipped and the device spits out a license.
We barely deciphered the number "157" and it is already beeping on the large display at the ceiling of the waiting room.
Half a second later, you're in line.
Some time later, an older couple enter the waiting room to ask for the rent, but the storm in the waiting room apparently does not apply to the new rent.
Most people are here to solve the usual problems - repair applications, insurance issues and the like.
From mid-November, in the region of Ostrava, the envelopes with the new leases will float most tenants of the total of 44.000 apartments of the portfolio of the RPG into the mailboxes.
The RPG Byty proposes a rental increase of about 15 to 38 percent in the letters.
The special switch for the new rentals in the client center has been open since 18 November.
"The action runs a little over a week, that is, it's only the beginning," the ladies behind the switch reply after a moment of hesitation when the "Client" appears as a journalist.
The deregulation and Bakala's former mining homes are a fragile topic.
Prior to the elections, the Parliamentary Vice-President Lubomír Zaorálek of ČSSD had taken up this topic quite loudly, no wonder that today the newspapers are full of it.
"Twenty years I want a new floor from them."
"They couldn't even change their toilet glasses," the man mentioned at the outset made himself air.
Up to now, according to the employees, pensioners are mainly on the switch to convince themselves that they will actually receive the promised rental discount, which promises them RPG if they sign the special offer in time.
In order to benefit from a half-reduced rent in February, the other tenants will also come, who will sign the new lease until 15 December.
Until now, "deregulation switch" in Havířov is anything but overburdened by demand.
"From yesterday's 360 clients, only about 40 to 50 of the rent in 2011 were due here," the circuit staff estimate.
RPG offers individual rental agreements on its websites, as well as wall boards where it appears necessary.
However, if the parties to the lease do not agree on the new lease, they will be determined by an independent court.
"This should not be a threat, but should be understood as information about the only possible and completely legitimate legal approach," explains RPG on its websites.
"No one goes to court here," says one of RPG Byty's employees, and a man on the street in front of the client center gives her at least part of the right.
"I have 13,000 (crones) pensions, of which 5,000 remain for food, where should I take the money for a court dispute," he says.
Then the employee becomes insecure.
"Look at this."
"Mr. Zaorálek tells them about the media, they should not sign and so the people are still waiting," she recalls.
The regulated rental ends in most of the Czech Republic to New Year 2011, and according to RPG Byty, the rental increase is an economic necessity.
"The existing level of rents is not even sufficient for the maintenance of the housing fund," said Pavel Klimeš, the director of the housing portfolio of the company RPG Byty and - especially the neglect of the housing fund criticised by the tenants - is, in the opinion of the homeowners, the main reason for the rent increase.
While RPG was able to invest four billion in the dwellings in the years between 2005 and 2010 from the rents taken, it is expected to be 5.2 billion in the four years from 2011 to 2014.
On the large-format LCD display on the ceiling opposite the upholstery armchairs in the waiting room of Havířov, a few red-lighting information appear over and over again.
"The 2011 rental increases by 15% and less concern 31,200 apartments, that is, more than 90% of RPG apartments."
"This always means a maximum of 7.50 CZK per square meter and month", is read on the LCD monitor.
Only for 400 apartments from the portfolio of RPG, rent increases by 38 percent.
"In these cases, it is about increasing extremely low rental prices of 19.66 CZK per square metre," argues RPG.
For 2600 apartments, the rent will remain at the same level next year.
RPG Byty promises that the deregulation does not drive rents up sharply, but gradually takes place within four and eight years.
What is more - the company imposes a further obligation: All revenues from the rental increase (see diagram) the company wants to get back into the homes, especially in heat savings - into new windows and into heat insulation.
But - priority should be given to those people who sign the agreements on the increase in rent.
The architects saw - there is also a kindergarten in the office
The Avriopoint office building in Brno is the new headquarters of the company Arch.Design.
But who would expect a mini kindergarten here, with everything that belongs to it: colorful walls, creative furniture, a lot of toys and even a mini playground on the outdoor terrace.
This kindergarten has been available to the staff of Arch.Design since last year.
The design and architecture office Arch.Design, whose studios come from a number of well-known Brno buildings, calculated from the first designs for the new building Avriopoint with the premises for its company mini-kindergarten.
Wisely, because most of his 90 employees are in the Babyboom Age and the company is committed to the projectors returning to their workplaces as soon as possible.
Together with the opportunity to work shorter, the Kindergarten is another bonus that Arch.Design has to offer its employees in the concept of its social programme.
The construction engineers have the ease to put their demanding job and child care under a hat.
The Mini Kindergarten is an original idea of the staff of Arch.Design and with the support of the management they managed to win funding from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs for their project.
The Operational Programme for Human Resources and Employment Policy is financed by the European Social Fund and by the State budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to this financing (subsidies of CZK 2, 8 million) the necessary facilities and equipment could be obtained and for the duration of 2 years qualified staff and operations were provided.
After the exploitation of the funding (2 years), the company Arch.Design is obliged to continue to operate the Minikindergarten for 3 additional years at its own expense.
The preparation of this project took place for a whole year, with the company Economy Rating providing active assistance in the processing of applications.
The children take care of fully qualified staff - a nurse and a kindergarten teacher, the kindergarten can visit children without age restrictions, although most of them are over three years old.
And since this is a mini kindergarten, only 5 children can be present at the same time, but the day over several children will change.
The kindergarten is flexible to the needs of the parents, the children of all employees have the same rights with regard to the use of the kindergarten - without regard to the corporate hierarchy and their respective position.
Although it is individual education and care, the programme content in the Mini Kindergarten is nevertheless comparable to the framework programme of pre-school education.
The children not only play here, especially they are given excellent lessons - from basic insights to preschool lessons, they also learn English.
The classroom is not only equipped with toys and creative games, but also with a computer that is available to the children.
What is more - the presence of young children in the company contributes to a friendly and positive company environment.
Parents can at any time take a look at the children and thus the stress is avoided when the children are picked up from a far away kindergarten.
Parents therefore use their working time more productively.
No wonder there are also natural and loyal employers-employees-relations here.
Arch.Design thus joined the Czech companies, which offer significant benefits when recruiting new employees, who are family-friendly and through such programs strengthen their personal marketing.
A bone house still fascinates after 100 years. Look at Gaudi’s interiors
The roof faces like the back of a prehistoric lizard, the stairs like the spine of a dinosaur and the balconies are torn fish mules.
This is the Casa Batlló of the Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona.
From the local inhabitants the house was nicknamed "Knochenhaus" with its organic forms.
Organic shapes, wild colors, the unusual use of stone, tile splits and mosaics, the facades reminiscent of sheds and ubiquitous soft lines, all these are typical features of Antonio Gaudi's Art Nouveau style.
The facade of the house plays with dreamy lines, tender colors and textures that remind of nature and beings.
Only when you look at it more closely can you see that everything is dominated by geometry, rhythm and thoughtful order.
During the night, the whole facade still seems plastic, more dramatic and the special lighting enhances the shine of the colors.
The same swinging lines and devoured shapes also dominate the interior of the house.
Wave-shaped wood copies the window frames, rails, decorative elements of doors, even guck holes and bars.
The house Batlló in the Eixample district on the lively shopping street Passeig de Grácia No. 43 was built by the rebuilding of a house dating back to 1877, which architect Emilio Sala Cortese performed.
The reconstruction took two years and was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrialist Josep Batlló, originally existed on the demolition of the old and the construction of a completely new building, but ultimately he agreed to Gaudí's idea of an unusual and also cheaper conversion.
However, Antoni Gaudí did not design the house Casa Batlló alone.
He worked with the architect Josep Maria Jujol.
The decorations for the representative apartment of the real estate owner and the use of mosaics on the facade were his idea.
However, numerous other artists and sculptors also cooperated in the design of the facade.
The joint work on the designs for Casa Batlló was the beginning of a fruitful cooperation between Jujola and Gaudí.
Jujol also participated in the construction of Gaudí's house Casa Milá in the Park Güell, where there are also other works by Antoni Gaudí.
Shortly after his completion, the house was given the nickname "Knochenhaus" by the local inhabitants of its organic forms.
Others, in turn, called it the special window opening mechanism because of the "walking house".
It is also said that at the top of the building is the sword of St. George, the Patron of Catalonia.
But other sculptural elements also symbolize hidden religious motifs.
Gaudí designed a unique central heating system for the time being with ventilation channels and typical fireplaces.
Something bizarre is already motivating her 45-degree slope.
In his work, Gaudí consistently ignored all the building regulations of the time and was by no means deceived by them.
Before the start of construction, he obtained from the city the corresponding building permit, but the information he provided on the planned reconstruction was so vague that two years later the city fathers were so horrified at the completion that they demanded remedy.
The Councillors also supported, among other things, the fact that construction with its pillars even intervened in the public sidewalk.
However, changes were no longer made, quite the contrary - only fifteen days after the call for the district to do so, Josep Batlló filed an application for permission to rent the two highest floors of the house - and it was given to him promptly.
The owner himself moved into the lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor there was a social shop, on the third floor there were the bedrooms and private rooms of the apartment.
The ground floor was leased to a jewelry store.
The entire six-storey building runs through a staircase up to the roof terrace.
All right angles and straight lines were removed and replaced by curved and curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with a modern concept for the interconnection of rooms.
The social part can be completely connected by opening the salon doors and thus a larger society could easily chat without having to refrain from some intimacy in more confidential conversations.
The house received a rather unusual roof and two more floors, thanks to Gaudí's conversion, apart from a new facade.
Gaudí's play with the light as well as the blue and white glazed tiles with which the courtyard is dressed and the light courts is impressive.
The play of these two colors gives all floors of the house a maximum of light.
He simply made use of the principle that white reflects the light better than dark colors that absorb the sunlight on the contrary.
The Casa Batlló house, which was included in the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2005, can be visited by anyone today.
On the first floor the most spacious and magnificent apartment is made available to the public.
The owners of the house only decided in the year on this step and this on the occasion of the 150th birthday of the famous Creator.
When it was found that this was a fairly profitable business, the visits were maintained, and they were extended to other common and attic rooms, including the roof terrace.
However, the price for visiting the building monument is not a paparazzi, it is 16.50 euros, students, pensioners, groups and owners of tourist visas receive a 20% discount.
This amount exceeds the admission prices to other Gaudí buildings in the city.
Anyone who wants to get to know the real atmosphere of the house with its dragon towers should try to make friends with one of the home dwellers and visit him at home.
The right mattress and the right bed rust? Women have other wishes than men
Not the best bed frame, but the quality of the lying area - so mattress and rust make up the good bed.
However, they must be harmoniously supplemented in order to meet the needs of the specific user.
Many things play a role in the selection - the weight, the size, the state of health and, last but not least, the sex of the sleeper.
Equally important is the interior in which mattress and rust have to be placed.
Typical example?
In a weekend house where not regularly heated, latex mattresses are not well suited, as they need much longer to "be warm".
In addition, they are much heavier than usual polyurethane mattresses.
And - they should be used regularly.
Because if they do not have enough venting ducts in the core and are still on a fixed plate, moisture is straining: It is therefore not excluded that it forms under their mold.
Of course, the choice also plays a role in what you are used to.
Those who have been abroad for a long time, where very high mattresses with soft layer are common, will be able to get used to a low mattress with hard surface.
"Because all the hockey players who have come back from the NHL complained to me that they can't sleep right here."
"For their worn shoulders, heels and hips they simply need a soft layer of Visco foam (Memory Foam - a shape memory polymer)."
"I recommend these, among other things, sugar-sick people who suffer from a nervous system disorder, so that they can receive the "information" from the joints and the skin poorly," says Sylva Hadamcziková, who specializes in upholstery furniture.
That's why I got these mattresses with Visco foam (Memory Foam) from many hockey players years ago, but also from other customers.
"Today this is no longer a problem, because such mattresses offer, among other things, the manufacturer Tempur, the Italian company Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer Tropico."
And you don't necessarily have to be a famous hockey player to appreciate the benefits of the Visco foam.
This "miracle" actually works quite simply.
The foam optimizes its hardness and shape in accordance with the absorbed heat, in other words, it is really smearing at the warm body.
Nowhere is it pressed, at night you don't roll around like after a heavy fight.
You just sleep much better.
The viscoelastic foam also offers protection against decubitus (wound fire).
When choosing the mattress size you should still add the length of the soles of the feet to the height of the body, i.e. approx. 21 to 34 cm.
A man like a woman who is 180 cm tall needs a bed of 210 to 220 cm long.
Each of the sleepers should have at least 90 cm of lying width available, i.e. 180 cm together.
For single beds, for example for singles, 120 to 140 cm are fitted.
The comfort half and also for possible visitors.
Otherwise, the following rule applies to the ideal width of the bed: "If you are lying on the back, there should be enough space for the slightly angled arms," advises Ing. Helena Prokopová, the padded master of upholstery and interior decorators, who has been devoting himself for years to the problem of healthy sleep and ergonomics of furniture and is also presenting this topic to specialist schools.
With a double bed, everyone needs their own rust and mattress, but be careful when shopping so that the mattresses are also the same height.
Otherwise there is nothing left but to mount the rust at different heights and this is far from possible with each bed frame.
Foam mattresses should be at least 14 cm high, mattresses with spring skeleton 15 cm high, of which at least three centimetres should fall on the shape layer and the fine upholstery.
"With your hand or when sitting down, you must not feel the feathers at all," warns Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a special rust type.
Entirely upholstered beds with mattress and matting as well as matted siam twins have nothing to look for in the bedroom.
These mattresses cannot be ventilated and the cover cannot be washed, which is already going on and giving today.
And as one loses between 0.2 and 0.75 litres of sweat in a single night, it is clear that after five to seven years the mattress slowly becomes a huge (and clogged sieve).
This is also why professionals reject advertising slogans, which promise a lifetime of up to 25 years, even lifelong warranty for mattresses.
Every thing has to do with her if and but.
And therefore a practical advice from the dealers: in mattresses of 120 or 140 cm width, you should not shy away the hygiene of the washable, removable covers, yet it is advisable to use a mattress protector that you can easily pull off and wash.
Even if mattress covers are usually made with a round zipper today, so that after opening you get two halves (essentially important for washing and washing machine size!), the manipulation with larger mattresses, especially performed alone, often like the unequal struggle between David and Goliath.
Do they have a solid plate in bed instead of a rust?
Get out of there!
Or at most for a bed for unloved guests and for a single night.
Even so, they should prefer to use the plate with ventilation holes (unless there are any in it) and mattresses with spring skeleton and 15 cm minimum height with so-called pocket spring cores and fine upholstery.
Polyurethane mattresses do not belong on such a substrate.
Latex or sandwich mattresses are suitable for non-adjustable lattice toasts with 14 to 18 spring bars (lamles) (possibly also combinations of latex and coconuts), always pay for rust with a larger number of lattice bars, i.e. from 28 and more spring bars, with Lordose support in the lumbar spine area and the possibility to regulate the lattice hardness.
There are no mattresses with spring skeleton on adjustable lamella torso, as they do not react to the ergonomic adjustment.
In addition to adjusting the rigidity of the spring bars, special flexible shoulder modules are also required.
This is a special fixation of the spring bars, which allows the spring bars to be pressed in or even angled so that they allow for the pointual indentation of the shoulder of the sleeper.
Especially for men with wide shoulders an important thing.
There are even mattress manufacturers who have started to use soft zones for the shoulder area in "men's mattresses".
It is also thought of the ladies - they are given these soft zones in the hip area.
For most demanding customers, point-elastic wing spring systems (Lattoflex) or rust with point-elastic contact pads with so-called multitorsion suspension are intended.
The pressure is distributed over several points, thus reducing the voltage.
But - if you use a bad (too big and full) pillow for the right mattress and real rust, most benefits are lost again.
Here too a rule of thumb: the head cushion should support the head, its tips should only reach up to the shoulders so that the shoulder muscles can relax.
Ideally, therefore, a 50 x 60 cm pillow appears, as the Scandinavians like it.
In the side position the head cushion (together with the shoulder relief zone in the rust or soft zone in the mattress) should balance the shoulder height.
Our modern mattresses have something in common with the former (filled with hay) straw bags.
Modern manufacturers use more and more natural materials or at least their blends.
The new magic word "Bio" is also used in mattresses.
Instead of petroleum raw materials, natural oils are increasingly used in the production of polyurethane foams, such as castor oil and soya oil.
Soy is probably used by all known manufacturers.
"Bio is called by mattresses, which make up their core of materials of pure natural origin," explains Petr Vašíček from Tropico Plus.
Natural materials are also used in the manufacture of mattress covers - one of the first was Aloe Vera.
But you can also enjoy microcapsules that spread fresh forest or lavender dust when you sleep.
Here, too, there is a difference between man and woman.
While in men a "cooling" plant extract is used from birch leaves so that the mattress cover can absorb the heat and cool the body, the references for women have "warming" effect.
Extracts from red paprikaschoten stimulate blood circulation, so the weaker sex becomes pleasantly warm while sleeping.
What about today's favorites?
Mattresses made of cold foam (he has larger pores with destroyed cell structure and is therefore more breathable than commercial polyurethane and much more flexible).
The combination of the different stiffness (hardness) of cold foams and visco foams creates multiple zone mattresses that know exactly where the head, hip and heel are located.
For a high-quality mattress, however, you have to tap 7000 crowns and more.
However, health mattresses are usually subject to lower VAT as they are considered medical devices.
Gumotex was the first Czech company to gain this advantage.
You see, saving on the mattress and on the rust isn't that easy.
Occasionally there are special offers from manufacturers and dealers who offer two mattresses at the price of one.
Thus, the Magniflex brand offers the mattress Duofreeze with visco foam memory for 11,990 CZK.
You get the second one for free.
It was the material Tempur that introduced the era of viscoelastic foams with open cell structure and high density at almost cosmic speed.
No wonder they were developed for NASA, because the astronauts are exposed to enormous overburdens at the start.
Tempur becomes soft with heat, in cool environment it strengthens again.
This is how it adapts perfectly to the human body and distributes the body pressure in an optimal way.
It is therefore not only ideal for preventing pressure fire, but generally increases sleep comfort.
Viscoelastic foams are used not only for mattresses, but also for other health products, such as special foot pads to facilitate the legs and vessels.
For example, local manufacturers use the foams Eucatherm C, Twinsaver or similar products.
More and more parents want human monitoring devices to control the kids
The fear of their own children grows and so more and more parents are considering monitoring them via GPS.
The system that was originally invented for the detection of cars can be found just as well in people, which would also be helpful in such cases, as recently as the nine-year-old Anička Janatková disappeared.
The device is currently about the size of a cigarette box but soon it may not be bigger than a wristwatch.
Many people have put the case of the disappeared Anička in fear and terror, so they look for ways and means to better protect their children.
Also for the price of harming their privacy.
"We try to tell everyone that this is not about spying, but about an effective means of reducing the likelihood of tragedy," says Petr Pilin of Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of GPS tracking devices on the Czech market.
"I admit that in individual cases there may be abuse of such devices, for example if you put someone in your pocket without him knowing about it, but we have not yet had such a case."
"Most customers really buy it for security reasons," Pilin adds.
In his opinion, however, the child should always know what purpose the "box" serves and how to use it in an emergency.
However, children's psychologist Dana Bočková points out that if a child doesn't like to wear such a thing, it just gets rid of him.
"Very small children also show great creativity when it comes to deliberately losing certain things if they don't want to be controlled."
"Even the cell phones awakened great expectations at first among the parents, but they can be turned off just as easily as these new monitoring devices," says Ms. Bočková.
In their opinion, it is also disputed whether such an institution actually helps in the event of an attack.
"In the case of planned kidnappings, the kidnapper practically always checks whether the child has any electronics with which it could be located."
"Today it's the phone."
"If such surveillance devices could be used more widely, they would also be looking for them, as their sale would certainly be accompanied by massive advertising."
"In these cases, the criminals of the police are always one step ahead," says the psychologist.
However, it admits that similar devices can be very helpful in a sudden attack by a pedophile.
According to Roberta Čech of RC Monitoring, which offers tracking services both for automobiles and for people, the existence of such a device can also help if it is destroyed immediately after the attack.
"The device can be adjusted in such a way that it reports the respective position at certain intervals."
"Even if it were destroyed immediately, at least the last position of the data subject is available."
"In the case of more expensive devices, even a tiltometer is integrated, that is, if you fall down and remain motionless, the device immediately sends a warning stating the position," says Mr. Čech.
In his opinion, similar services could also perform intelligent mobile phones with navigation, one only needs to record a special software.
The problem with the current locating devices is that they are either devices in iron box sizes similar to trailers or smaller mobile phones.
There is always such a danger of losing them.
According to Mr. Pilin of Macro Weil, devices that look like normal digital watches are being tested in the present.
"This has the advantage that the possible attacker does not have to recognize that it is a surveillance or tracking device.
"Or he only notices after a certain time what gives the police a lead in time," he adds.
No matter what direction the development is in - to bracelets or trailers, the same technology is always used as in the vehicle location.
So for the combination of location function using the GPS system (just like with the navi in the car) and the function of a mobile phone that reports the current position.
The army has so many ignition cords that you could wrap all of the Czech Republic you keep but only two years
The Czech army has purchased 445 kilometers of ignition cords, which are lit with bursts.
In the previous year, the Ministry of Defence had already delivered 224 kilometres of coal wire to the army camps.
It is reassuring to know that the armed forces have provided for 225 years.
The problem is only the durability of the ignition cords - two but not more than four years.
The army bought the ignition cords from the stock company STV Group, i.e. for lipstick 40 million crowns.
In his explanatory statement for the purchase of this huge amount of ignition cord, the General Staff MF DNES replied that the soldiers would consume the 60 kilometers of ignition line each year.
According to the research of military pyrotechnics, which MF DNES addressed, it emerges from this statement that every year the entire army would have to undergo an extremely intensive pyrotechnic training - from all generals and officers of the Army Command, to secretaries and cleaning women.
Minister of Defence Alexandr Vondra and Army General Vlastimil Picek not excluded.
This is the only way to justify the considerable annual consumption of sixty kilometres of ignition cords.
By the way, this length corresponds to 25,000 detonations.
But so too would these army stocks last more than ten years.
But if the old rule of experts still applies that every new professional soldier is fully enough to train two metres of ignition cord, then the army has created a calming supply for the 225 years already mentioned - even in view of the increased need for pioneer and special units.
Soldiers of the Rapid Response Brigade recently complained to the Minister of Defense Vondra that they had almost no more cartridges for hand firearms, so that shooting exercises of the missing means were severely restricted.
Not to mention underpants.
"I don't understand why they buy such a lot of ignition cords from us."
But that is ultimately their decision, they will already know what they need."
"For us, the army is a good customer to whom we as dealers would like to come in for the most part," says the sales manager of STV Group Jan Děcký.
Jan Pejšek, spokesperson of the Ministry of Defence, founded the purchase of a hundred kilometers of ignition line with the fact that the army had covered itself with this "muniment" for at least ten years.
However, Jan Děcký of the STV Group only speaks of a four-year duration of the ignition cords and police and army pyrotechnics of only two years.
"In the event of perfect storage, the four years mentioned may be possible," admits one of them, who wants to remain nameless in order not to be accused of criticism of the army as a soldier.
At the end of the period of use, any ammunition must be thoroughly tested whether it is still reliable and does not endanger the lives of the soldiers.
However, these tests are not for nothing, but cost more money.
Another argument put forward by the Ministry of Defence is the quantity discount for the 445-kilometer ignition cord.
"They cost us sixty percent less than last year's delivery of 244 kilometers," says Spokesman Pejšek, informing us of the position of buyers of the Ministry of Defence.
For comparison only: The annual consumption of pyrotechnics by the police, the ammo from the Second World War or the Soviet Brotherhood Army, has been barely over 1,500 metres for a few years.
And the police always order only such quantities of ammunition that they can consume before the end of the period of use.
Because of the safety of the pyrotechnics, the possibility of flexible purchases of more modern and therefore also reliable ignition cords is left open.
The Ministry of Defence has huge problems in the liquidation of tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the times of the Warsaw Treaty, when the two hundred thousand-man Czechoslovak people's army prepared for their campaign to the Rhine.
According to the Pyrotechnics who spoke to MF DNES, the Czech armed forces expect in a few years the same problem when liquidating hundreds of kilometers of old ignition cords that they have bought so "favourably".
To this day, I find the contacts I have won thanks to the competition.
Lukáš Pytloun has helped to sell the franchise of his hotel, the winning place in the "Small Businesses of the Year" competition.
Lukáš Pytloun was the winner of the last year of the "Small Entrepreneur of the Year" competition from Liberec.
The story of his success is like a film scene.
Lukáš Pytloun was happy to travel.
Only abroad did he realize that in Liberec there is no good accommodation at reasonable prices.
From the savings of his holiday work abroad and with the help of a bank credit he created a buildable house with five apartments.
Considering that he was a university student at the time in the sixth semester, this was certainly a courageous undertaking.
"The price-quality ratio at the time annoyed me and so I tried to do something about it," says Lukáš Pytloun.
He rented the first reconstructed apartment to foreign workers.
He immediately invested the entire profit back into the house, which he then converted step by step to the pension with 54 beds.
Since then, in just seven years of entrepreneurial activity in Liberec, he has been able to open four guest houses, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of over 300 beds of all types of accommodation.
The most comfortable of them was until recently the four-star hotel "Pytloun Design Hotel".
This year another first-class hotel was added.
"We have just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tisé, which we have sold our franchise concept and other interested parties have already signed up for the Pytloun hotels franchise," says entrepreneur number one of last year.
"A large share of this license sale for operating hotels had just won in the competition "Entrepreneurs of the Year", Mr. Pytloun admits.
The victory brought him greater fame, yes popularity in Liberec and its surroundings.
"The people recognized me on the road, often they even congratulated me afterwards and I have to say that it did really well," he recalls.
I really recommend that everyone who wants to create something should take part in this competition.
You don't have to win the same, every sighting is good.
He says that to this day he draws benefit from the contacts and acquaintances to which otherwise it would not have come at all.
"With some people I've met thanks to the competition, I'm still having regular business relationships."
In his opinion, the fame associated with the success is also a bit on each of his employees.
And there he is to the seventy.
"I note with them greater loyalty and pride that they are part of something that will be given general recognition."
I really don't see this just as a personal success, no, that's the result of the good work of all of us."
"My name is just a little in the foreground," says Lukaš Pytloun modestly.
I wish my successors a quieter year than we had in Farmet
Victory euphoria was quickly replaced by the consequences of the crisis.
Thanks to his goal, Farmet has the worst behind him.
The award for the first place of the competition Vodafone Company of the year last year was awarded to Karel Ž
At the time, the jury appreciated the efforts he made in the small tool building in Česká Skalice to stamp a company out of the ground, making hundreds of millions of sales.
"I can say that this appreciation not only encouraged myself, but also all my employees and strengthened our self-confidence in the fight with the competition," says the previous year's winner.
At the beginning of the company history of Farmet, the effort was made to do something useful.
And when the state offered his father Karel Žъárský as compensation for the property confiscated by the Communists a small workshop for rent, he did not hesitate long, had his career in the company in which he had been employed until then, and founded his own company for the production of plastic tubs with a few of his father's comrades.
Shortly thereafter, they began to focus on vegetable oil presses.
Within 18 years they have risen to the largest manufacturer of automatic presses throughout Central Europe.
But only through the success of the competition mentioned and its medialization has it also entered the consciousness of non-professional public.
"Not only do our customers now perceive the Farmet brand much more intensively, but our foreign partners also began to appreciate the fact that they have been able to work with a company that has achieved the greatest possible success in their country," says Karel Ž
Last year, however, Farmet was not only a symbol of victory euphoria.
The assessment was based on the company’s economic results in 2008 and part of 2009.
And precisely 2009 was the most difficult year for the sale of tool construction products.
The crisis, which at that time shook even less citizens, but above all companies, reached its peak - many companies were forced to stop their investment projects and restrict the purchase of new facilities and technologies.
"Of course, we could not escape this situation."
"Sales fell by 40 percent, we had to limit production and even take on redundancies," explains Karel Ž
A viable company sometimes also needs to take such unpopular measures.
But it succeeded in getting the situation under control and keeping the company in the black numbers, even with less profits than before the crisis.
In one case, the company was not willing to cancel the investment in research and development.
"From the grant we built a research and training centre, we strengthened our presentation at international fairs and won major prizes at domestic exhibitions," says Ž
Everything shows that we have overcome the crisis.
Sales are growing again and with them is also the number of new employees.
"I wish the new winner a lot of joy in victory - but in a calmer atmosphere," says Karel Ž
An opinion poll that cleans up nonsense rules
The opinion poll on the "absoluteness of the year" is for the fourth time part of the entrepreneurship competition.
Some crazy rules have already managed to get out of the world.
To the dubious winner of the next year of the opinion poll "Absoluteness of the Year" advanced the obligation to create documents on authorities available online.
Thus, more than a third of less than four thousand voting entrepreneurs decided.
For example, the social security administration required a paper extract from the trade register, even if the official could have obtained it by two mouse clicks.
Thanks to the opinion poll, this is now changing.
"In the future, the Czech Social Security Administration will no longer require extracts from the Commercial Register in the case of checks on social security contributions," said the spokesperson of ČSSZ Jana Buraňová.
The purpose and purpose of the opinion poll "Absoluteness of the Year" is to examine all the rules and regulations, to meet the entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic and to remove the senseless.
This year, for the fourth time, it is part of an entrepreneurial competition organised by the German Economic Newspaper (HN) and is enjoying growing popularity in the public.
If the three thousand people participated in the vote last year, it was already four thousand this year.
No wonder, because there are still a lot of legal obligations that only serve to hinder business activity.
"For example, with regard to the number of income tax forms, we take a leading position in the world," says Karel Havlíček of the association of small and medium-sized enterprises and traders in the Czech Republic.
Simplification of entrepreneurial activity has been the declared goal of all governments in recent years.
Compared to the world, however, the situation in the Czech Republic has hardly improved.
According to World Bank data, the Czech Republic ranks 74th in terms of business conditions, with an 8th place lower than the previous year.
The competition absurdity of the year was announced for the first time in the year and takes place every year according to the same scenario.
Anyone can report administrative and bureaucratic nonsense from April to the end of September.
To register, the website is www.firmaroku.cz. Afterwards, the organiser of the competition selects seven candidates for the "anti-prize" and has the public vote on the Internet on the websites www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
It defeats the absurdity that most voices get.
For this year's opinion poll, more than a hundred, more precisely 105, have been declared meaningless regulations and regulations.
The tips come not only from entrepreneurs but also from professional associations and journalists.
Among the nominated "finalists" of the competition are, for example, provisions that maintenance vehicles for motorways and highways have to pay tolls or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two toilets have to present every two years.
The list of this year's "Seven" is published on the sides of the competition.
The call for competition at the Prague Wenceslas Square at the beginning of November is part of a happening in which people of political and public life regularly participate.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodová, the director of the association of small or medium-sized enterprises and traders of the Czech Republic, and Petr Kužel, the president of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic, were at the highlight of the competition with the party.
"Where the state throws the entrepreneurs a little between the legs, there can be no real economic upturn, so my goal is to remove at least thirty paragraphs every year that make business more difficult for entrepreneurs today," said Martin Kocourek, the Minister for Industry and Trade.
The efforts to create foolish orders from the world are effective.
In 2007, the majority of the people disturbed the businessmen's obligation to report three days in advance to the commercial officer at the location of their permanent establishment the intention to travel with an exhibition stand to an exhibition or Kirmes.
This duty has been lifted by means of a amendment to the Commercial Law.
The obligation that was given the second largest number of votes in 2007 - the obligation to report missions of employees up to 30 days to the Employment Office - was abolished by the law on them so-called "Green Card".
And - all good things are three:
For the absurdity of 2009, the regulation imposed on physiotherapists to have a mirror, a refrigerator and two personal scales in the room.
This regulation was somewhat mitigated by the Ministry of Health this year - the refrigerator requirement fell away.
A new category honors socially responsible companies
Evaluation criteria are humanitarian, environmental, educational or sporting projects
A novelty in this year's fifth year of the competition of the business magazine (HN) is the category "Responsible Company of the Year 2010".
The basic idea of this competition is to promote rational and fair undertakings.
"We want to support companies that are aware of the consequences of your business activity on the environment and support socially responsible initiatives," says Patrik Bartholdy, regional manager of the mobile company Vodafon, who is the promoter and guarantor of this competition, as well as the competition "Rebell of the Year".
For this year's first year of this special subcategory of the main competition Vodafon Company of the year, companies for which success is not the only long-term goal have signed up.
The story of each of them is extremely inspiring and fine enough fabric for an independent article.
Although they differ diametrically in the subject matter of their activities, their efforts nevertheless have a common denominator - support and consideration.
This is about disabled people, for example, because of personal problems or the health of their own employees.
Among the fourteen finalists from all over the Czech Republic, for example, the Prague software company Et Netera also appeared, which promotes the creation of non-formal sports teams among its employees, who then participate in numerous tournaments in various sports.
Another example of a responsible company from the Pardubice region is the company Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main sponsor of a foundation fund for disabled children for 17 years.
A paper factory from Poděbrady also takes good care of its health-impaired employees, who make up 70 percent of their workforce, for which they were honoured with the title "Responsible Company of the Region of Central Bohemia" and in the competition Vodafone Company of the Year took third place in this region.
In the Olomouc region, the accounting company MiRyz Soft won the victory, which among other things introduced a running and also reduced working time to an average of 35 hours per week, without a relative wage reduction.
The jury also honoured the fact that the company buys mainly from Czech manufacturers, supports citizens' initiatives in their environment and works according to environmentally friendly principles.
"We strive to recycle as much as possible in order to minimise the impact of our business activities and administration on the environment," explains her managing director Miluše Ryznarová.
The responsible IT company Enlogit from the region of Ústí nad Labem is again based on the health of its employees and therefore it has acquired all the notebooks ergonomic armchairs and keyboards, as well as promoting home work for its employees and using cartering services offered by a home-protected workshop in company operations.
"In addition, we support the Foundation "People in Distress", which provides concrete help to the local Roma community," says Ondřej Suchý, the company's representative.
Last but not least, the activity of the cleaning company "Praní a čištění" from the region of Karlovy Vary is worth mentioning, which contributes its employees in the form of extra bonuses to their pension insurance.
"We provide our employees with contributions to food, to the way of work, to increase their qualifications and to holidays," says Josef Strapáč from the construction company Czasch from Bruntál, the winner in the Moravian-Silesian region.
To the category Responsible Company of the year all district finalists of the competition Vodafon Company of the year were automatically registered, who answered the questions of the questionnaire attached to the application and sent it to the organizer by 15 August at the latest.
Incorrect or incomplete answers in the questionnaire were excluded from the evaluation by the organiser.
"If the representatives of the competing companies left the questions unanswered, they were excluded from the competition "Responsible Company of the Year", but in the main competition Vodafone Company of the Year they were therefore not disqualified."
"A separate application only to this competition is not possible because it is only a subcategory of the main competition company of the year," explains Karel Goldman from the organising agency Bison & Rose.
Pilsner Bodenfonds - Arrests of the police in a public tender
In the building of the Soil Fund in Pilsen, the anti-corruption police conducted arrests in the last few days.
The local media entrepreneur and real estate dealer Luboš G. was taken off by the detectives in handcuffs.
It allegedly tried to manipulate a recent public competition for the settlement of refund claims in such a way that the land offered in the competition fell to a specific interested party.
He was supposed to have paid Luboš G. half a million for it.
"At this point, I can only confirm that the police are persecuting a person in a public competition because of the crime of fraudulent practices," said Antonie Zelená, head of the Pilsner Public Prosecutor's Office of the Právo newspaper, who could not give them further details with regard to the ongoing investigations.
24 hours later, the 46-year-old entrepreneur was released by the police.
In what way he could manipulate public competition, one can only speculate about it in view of the scarce official information.
The spokesperson of the Lubomír Černá Land Fund pointed out the question raised by Právo that the police had actually arrested in the Pilsner branch of the Land Fund and this during a public competition.
"It was about a client and not about one of our employees," she said.
According to public competition, Ms Černá had the correct title "Request for the supply of land transfer rights under the Land Act" and would take place in cases where several applicants showed interest in the land offered.
"These persons offer, in the context of the invitation, a higher value of their refund entitlements to be settled through the transfer than the declared value of the land."
"According to the claims offered, the order of the potential buyers is determined, and the Land Fund then transfers the land to the person with the highest offer," explains the spokesperson of the Fund.
Luboš G. was obviously at the disposal of information as to who had signed up to the invitation and since he himself was a legitimate person, since he had bought a number of refund claims, he offered to a property interest that he withdraw from the competition.
Obviously against a fat settlement.
That would also be a sufficient explanation of why he had such a large sum of money in his arrest.
Luboš G. had too good contacts with Pilsner Bodenfonds in the past.
He also played a role in the causa of the former head of the Václav Sankota Land Fund, which was prosecuted by criminal law because he spent land in replacement refunds for which site decisions had already been made on construction projects.
At that time, for example, Luboš G. from the Land Fund also acquired land intended for the construction of public roads, more precisely, in the place where the construction of the access magistrate to the Borské pole commercial area was planned.
Later, he exchanged this very favorable with the Magistrate for a house directly in the historic centre of the city, which far exceeded the value of the properties.
At the time, the town hall had to give little attention to the difficult heart of the town to avoid jeopardizing the construction project by blocking the properties.
Households' housing costs rise by several hundred per month
From January onwards, households will have to expect not only higher costs for all types of energy, but also higher water and wastewater charges and rents for district heating and in some places.
As of January, families will have to draw several hundred crowns more out of the wallet each month than before.
Electricity becomes up to 4.6 percent more expensive, gas by 2 percent and more, in some cities you will have to pay up to a tenth more for water deliveries and in some places also cost the district heating deliveries.
The electricity price alone costs several hundred crowns more each year.
Power prices were reduced by all main suppliers, so debt is the clear promotion of electricity generation from renewable sources, especially from photovoltaic plants.
Gas is only moderately more expensive, but this is precisely so when people have to heat the most and have the highest consumption.
Here, too, there are several hundred crowns more to be expected per year.
While electricity and gas are becoming more expensive throughout the Czech Republic, the prices for district heating vary from city to city.
In particular, larger places plan price increases.
For example, households in Pardubice and Hradec Králové will have to pay up to 50 crowns per month from January onwards for district heating, and more than 1000 crowns per year for families in Liberec.
In turn, the inhabitants of Prague are facing 9 percent higher water and wastewater charges and this in case the city increases infrastructure rent.
If the rent does not change, it is only 6.8 percent.
However, the price in Prague remains one of the lowest compared to the whole of the Czech Republic.
In northern Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and wastewater charges are expected to rise by 7.4 percent.
Enormous rental price increases can be expected, for example, in 140,000 rental apartments, where the so-called rental regulation lapses from January onwards.
For example, the housing company CPI Byty, which owns 2500 apartments in Ústí nad Labem, plans to increase rents by one hundred percent from January onwards.
If you do not agree with this increase in rent, the company wants to have a judicial interest.
The regulated rentals, which are still paid in nearly 300,000 homes today, are expected to increase by more than 10 percent next year.
Czech kids get drunk with Fernet and rum beer is out - it just seems too slow
Fernet, Rum and Vodka, by the way, also a good whisky that was stolen by the father from the bar.
These are the drinks that require the most frequent emergency treatment of under fifteen Czech teenagers who are drunk.
No exception are children who have to sleep their cat repeatedly in the hospital.
This is reflected in the experience of doctors who face similar cases in the admission of the children's wards of clinics.
"Beer or wine are completely out of fashion because it just takes too long to get drunk."
"Today's trend is clearly hard alcohol," said Právo Luděk Pelikán, head of the Children's Department in the Central Bohemian Hospital Hořovice.
"Whisky, if the father manages to evade a bottle from the bar, and if not, then at least Fernet or Vodka.
"Wodka has the advantage of mixing it with juice, so he doesn't smell so strong," explains the chief physician.
The speaker of Motol Eva Jurinová's Faculty Hospital agrees with him.
"Most often it's about Fernet or Rum."
"This is today's alcohol trend, especially in primary schools."
"Individually, it was also about Slibowitz, which you take with you from home," said Ms. Jurinová.
According to chief physician Pelikán, thirteen or fourteen-year-old drinkers are no exception in hospital admissions.
In front of the hospital in Hořovice, at which he has been working since this year, he worked for ten years in the paediatric ward of the hospital Motol, where the rescue cars delivered drunken students from near and far.
"A girl had to be hospitalized four times."
"She began her career at the age of 12 when she was first handed in with 3.5 per millilitres of alcohol in the blood and in combination with "extase", the doctor described a particularly serious case.
"She was in the exhibition grounds in Holešovice at some dance party."
"The interesting thing was that it didn't seem strange to her mother that her daughter didn't come home for 48 hours," says the chief physician.
Especially the lack of interest of parents or their incredible tolerance when instigating with their own offspring is considered one of the main causes of the growing alcoholism of children.
According to experts, a real dependence in the true sense of the word is not about children.
"Alcoholism is a long-standing chronic dependence on alcohol and all related phenomena, and this is not the case with these children."
For those who drink alcohol repeatedly, a negative family-social background is usually characteristic," explains chief physician Pelikán.
According to Motol Hospital, Ms. Jurinová, by mid-November, about forty drunk children were assigned to the local Children's and Youth Medicine Department.
However, only the cases of heavy alcohol poisoning that necessitated hospitalisation are included in the statistics.
Drunk children brought home after outpatient treatment by their parents or, where appropriate, by the police are not registered.
In addition to the cases where children drink only one bottle of schnapps in the school bench, Mr Pelikán believes that there are three seasonal amplitudes to which 100% is dependent: Walpurgisnacht, New Year's Eve and the end of the school year.
"The latter for two reasons - either because of grief over the bad testimony or because of the joy of the holiday."
"On Walpurgisnacht I have also experienced seven drunk children at once in the recording," says Dr. Pelikán.
A drunk child who spends the night under medical supervision is paradoxically better off than a child who only has to fight with an unpleasant cat the next day.
The headaches in the morning, which are caused by dehydration and by the lack of glucose, can be distributed in the hospital with a fluid-giving infusion of glucose and nutrients that are missing from the organism.
"They are clearly better at it, because after the "glorious" experience in the evening, they wake up with a good mood without hurting anything."
"They are just a little confused about where they are," admits Dr. Pelikán, sometimes ruining the patient's good mood by adding to them the cost of treatment.
Because the transportation by the rescue car and the night in an emergency bed come well and gladly on a few tens of thousands of crowns.
"In and out, I used this as a means of education when I calculated directly the children at the visit, what cost their drunkenness and that it can happen that they have to work all vacations over to earn the money for one such fete," added Dr. Pelikán.
In his opinion, however, the health insurance funds do not resort to recourse procedures to demand the necessary costs from parents to cure the drunken children.
Two training aircraft L-159 for the first time in a foreign hand - in Spain
Two light fighter aircraft L-159 out of a total of five, which the Czech Ministry of Defence has exchanged for the Casa C-295M transport aircraft, flew to the Spanish city of Seville on Tuesday, where the Spanish aircraft manufacturer Casa - EADS settles.
This is the first time that this type of machine is owned by a foreign army.
They have been seen abroad only during maneuvers or airshows.
This is the flightable two-seater version L-159T1, operated by the Czech army.
The remaining three aircraft are one-seater L-159.
These are currently preserved in the Aero Vodochody, the broker of this business - the company Omnipol - took over it last week.
Jan Pejšek, the spokesman of the Ministry of Defence, is not yet known when she physically expands the aircraft from Vodochody.
In turn, the L-159 single-seat fighter aircraft were isolated from long-haul aircraft, without any further deposits and investments by the Ministry's department.
"The double-seater L-159T1 were exchanged in the current state and appearance," said Pejšek of Právo newspaper.
He added that the army would not have to survive without two-seat fighter aircraft, as the Ministry of Defence signed a 200-million agreement on the conversion of four redundant L-159 to a two-seat version in May 2009 with Aero Vodochody.
A new plane took over the army in July, the second one wants to take over until the end of this year.
According to Pejšek, EADS has committed itself to deploying fighter aircraft into the equipment of one of the NATO countries.
"The Treaty clearly states that EADS is the customer of aircraft L-159 and that it is to be used to train pilots from NATO countries.
"It is therefore the customer's business in which way he realizes the matter," Pejšek pointed out.
The Economic Newspaper (HN) had previously reported that the Spanish government had no interest in the L-159.
The trade of five L-159 against a transport aircraft Casa and the purchase of other aircraft for 3.5 billion kronor was approved last year by the government of Mirek Topolánek.
At the time, the Ministry of Defence had not tendered for the purchase, but addressed EADS directly.
The Defence Office of that time argued that this exchange would support the future export of L-159 abroad.
The Czech army bought Aero 72 machines, of which it only used 24, the rest wanted to sell them.
By the way, the purchase of Casa's aircraft should also have a legal follow-up.
The European Commission sued the Czech Ministry of Defence at the European Court of Justice.
The army has already taken over three Casa aircraft, the last one is scheduled to land at Kbely Airport within fourteen days.
A longer index finger than a ring finger means a lower risk of cancer
Men whose index finger is longer than the ring finger are obviously at lower risk of developing prostate cancer.
This is the surprising result of a study published on Wednesday by the British Journal of Cancer.
This should be related to the mirror of the male hormone testosterone.
"Our results show that the relative length of the fingers can serve as a simple test for the risk of prostate cancer, and in particular in men up to sixty," said the co-author of the study, Ros Eeles, professor at the Cancer Research Institute at the University of Warwick.
The finger could help to determine which men should necessarily undergo a prostate cancer test, especially if genetic risks or other risk factors are present, such as family health stress, added Mrs Eeles.
During the period 1994-2009, she and her colleagues in Britain persecuted more than 1500 patients with prostate cancer, but also 3,000 healthy men.
With more than half of the participants in the study, the index finger of the right hand was shorter than the ring finger.
For these men, the probability of prostate cancer was the same as for 19 percent of the men whose ring and index fingers were the same.
However, in men whose index finger was longer than the ring finger, this risk decreased by 33 percent, in men up to sixty even by 87 percent.
The ratio of the length of the two fingers mentioned, which already form at prenatal age, clearly reflects the different levels of sex hormones that the child was exposed to in the uterus.
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer index finger.
Previous research has shown that testosterone is accelerating the growth of prostate cancer.
Václav Pačes, a leading Czech geneticist and former chairman of the Academy of Sciences, said ČTK that this study was readily known to him, yet he did not consider the relationship between the finger length and the cancer risk to be "exposed".
Czech Republic in snow - D1 and D5 are locked
Just like most of Europe, the Czech Republic is also under a snow cover on Thursday morning.
On the roads and footpaths lies mostly snow-ridden, the winter servants were in many places all night on the axis.
The D5 motorway between km 89 and 90 towards Rozvadov is blocked due to some accidents of trucks and cars and also the D1 near Brno in the direction of Prague.
This is what Novinky.CZ said to the dispatcher of the Central Auto-Moto Club (ÚAMK).
In km 91 a truck crashed, in km 93 two trucks collided, in this accident there are injured.
A few cars are also located in the road tomb.
There are also problems with km 185 of the D1 motorway towards Prague.
Here too, two trucks have collapsed.
The drivers should drive right behind Brno at km 190 or over Brno and drive up to Kývalka at km 182.
There are miles of traffic jams.
An accident has also occurred on the D11 and that immediately at the entrance to Prague.
In Prague itself lies a several centimetres thick snow cover and the thermometer shows minus seven degrees Celsius.
Car columns form, for example, in the Prosek district, also the street Štěrboholská is completely blocked.
The safest means of transport is definitely the metro.
The trams run with delays, for example on the line between Karlsplatz and Friedensplatz.
At eight o'clock in the morning, the Prague crisis team meets.
There are also problems with the railways and the airport.
The Czech state railway had to cancel seven fast trains due to snow.
For example, there are problems on the Prague - Kralupy route or also Prague - Beroun.
Travelers should be informed about the current situation.
The airport Ruzyně has been closed from Wednesday 11 a.m. until 5 a.m.
Most streets in South Moravia are only accessible with increased caution.
In order to Vyškov three side roads are completely unpassable, in the area of Brno snowfalls form and in the area of Blansko one is forced to use snow milling on some higher roads.
One of the most affected areas is Výškov.
There three streets are still completely blocked: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and also Šaratice - Milešovice.
Here, too, you will have to use snow milling to clear the snow.
When they become re-driving, it is not possible to estimate up to now.
In the Hodonín region, caution is required in the field of white carpathians.
On the roads, which can only be scattered with inert sprays for nature conservation reasons, lies a snow cover up to five centimeters thick, ČTK pointed out.
In the Czech Republic, snow fell from two to ten centimetres, mostly in northern Bohemia - sometimes up to 18 centimetres.
In the Moravian-Silesian region up to 15 centimeters of new snow fell.
In the Czech Republic, however, it stops snowing slowly.
American soldiers have a new "intelligent weapon".
The American troops have used a new "intelligent" weapon in Afghanistan for the first time, known only under its code name XM-25.
The generals hope that this new automatic weapon will influence the conflict with the Taliban there and shift the relationship of power to their advantage.
The new weapon is something like a super-exact cannon.
Their projectiles are guided to the target by laser with a safety level of only a few metres.
The special calibre 25 mm bulkheads, designed for this rifle and containing highly explosive explosives, work practically like small grenades.
The bulkheads can be programmed so that they can explode not only at the impact on the target, but at any point in their ballistic trajectory.
That means you can use them against an enemy hiding behind an obstacle - a wall or a trench.
From above it is usually not protected, so the murderous steel splinter rain from above can easily put it out of battle.
According to Richard Audet, who took part in the development of the XM-25, the new combat rifle is the first infantry weapon that makes use of "intelligent" technologies.
"The soldier basically does this: he targets the target and sends out a laser beam that determines the distance, he gains an exact point of vision after which he corrects the angle of increase, then he only needs to print.
"Let's say you measured 543 meters."
"When you press, the gun charges and shoots the shot to the distance of 543 meters plus minus one, two or three meters.
400 jobs are shifted
The Fujitsu Group is moving its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July next year, 400 employees will move their workplace from the existing office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
The Japanese company Fujitsu moves its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the industry giant specialized in computers and their maintenance announced on Wednesday, in July next year 400 women and men will move their workplace from the previous office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to the Astro Park, which is a large office complex on Lyoner Strasse in the Frankfurt district of Niederrad.
A spokesperson from Fujitsu explained that in the medium term, a further 100 additional jobs of the group should be located there, which had so far been distributed to the region.
The rental offer had been extremely attractive, as well as the large offices in Astro Park would be better suited to the staff's working methods.
Also in Bad Homburg Fujitsu had only been tenants.
The responsible managing director Bernd Wagner said, "With Frankfurt-Niederrad we have found a central location with excellent infrastructure".
The excellent connection to the airport is particularly important for a global company such as Fujitsu.
The recent move of an important company within the region brought joy to the winners and disappointment to the losers yesterday.
Frankfurter Wirtschaftsdezernent Markus Frank (CDU) said that once again a "global player" had been won.
This is a "great location confession".
Fujitsu fits to the city that the settlement is an important impulse for low-wheeling.
The Bad Homburg Mayor Michael Korwisi (The Greens) regretted Fujitsu's decision.
The city had been informed early by the management of the intention.
"We have of course offered our help to the company," Korwisi said.
However, the friendly contacts could not have changed the difficulties of the computer manufacturer with the landlord of the property at Marienbader Platz.
In the end, economic reasons would have led to the conclusion.
Now it's about preventing a long emptiness in such a prominent place.
"I hope the owner and landlord of the building will show themselves cooperative."
The house used by Fujitsu at the Town Hall Square and the neighbouring "Small Vertical" were among the most controversial construction projects in the spa city with the other buildings at Marienbader Platz ten years ago.
As a joint project of the city and a private project developer, a new city hall was created between the railway station and the town hall, which caused criticism both because of the massive construction of the previously partly used parking spaces and the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the investment consulting and rating company Feri, the software manufacturer for travel distribution systems, started Amadeus, and the computer manufacturer Fujitsu, who was still connected to Siemens.
The buildings used by Fujitsu were acquired in 2006 by the Frankfurter Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Group together with the Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund and sold one year later to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
The Fujitsu conuzers in Tokyo are the third-largest IT provider in the world.
For example, it provides companies with computers and servers and also provides the necessary service.
The Rhein-Main branch is one of the largest in Germany, but much more employees are Fujitsu in Munich.
From Bad Homburg, the subsidiary Fujitsu Technology Solutions in Frankfurt-Niederrad is to be Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
For this purpose, 7000 square meters were rented in the Astro Park office building.
In the twenty-year-old complex - the name plays on its star-shaped floor plan - the Central Association of Electrical Engineering and Electronics has its seat.
Amazon locks server - threats against Assange
Wikileaks are increasingly in distress.
The Internet service provider Amazon has banned the disclosure platform from its servers.
This may be due to political pressure after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomats.
Wikileaks founder Assange allegedly stops in England.
The Wikileaks unveiling platform is increasingly under fire in the United States.
The Internet activists lost access to their previous American server and are now looking for an Internet home in Europe.
The prominent American Senator Joe Lieberman called on other countries and companies to boycott Wikileaks.
And Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is on Interpol's arrest warrants, is supposed to stay in the UK after a newspaper report.
"Wikileaks displaced by Amazon servers."
"Free speech in the country of the Free", the disclosure activists informed Twitter via the short news service on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before that, the Internet company Amazon had banned Wikileaks documents from its servers.
The Internet activists had resorted to the Amazon Web Service (AWS) when publishing the secret diplomatic detachments in order to manage the high access numbers to the documents.
On Twitter, Wikileaks continued: "Excellent - our dollars are now spent to employ people in Europe."
If Amazon had such a problem with freedom of speech, "they should stop selling books."
Amazon had stopped the use of its servers by Wikileaks after employees of Senator Joe Lieberman had engaged in research, the TV station CNN reported under appeal to Lieberman's office.
The chairman of the Senate Committee on Home Protection threatened Amazon with a boycott, reported the British Guardian.
"I would have liked Amazon to take this measure earlier in view of the previous publications of classified information by Wikileaks," said the Senator.
At the same time, Lieberman called for the platform to be prevented from using servers in other countries.
"Wikileaks' illegal, monstrous and reckless action puts our national security at risk and endangers life around the globe," said a report by the Partyless Senator.
"No responsible company - whether American or foreign - should help Wikileaks in his efforts to spread stolen material."
Wikileaks founder Assange, who is sought for rape by the Swedish authorities, is on Interpol's arrest list.
According to a report by the London newspaper "The Independent", the 39-year-old Australian is in Britain, the exact place known as Scotland Yard.
The Internet activist has always called the investigations in Sweden an intrigue of his opponents.
Wikileaks spokesperson Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London that there were threats.
"There were even calls after Julian Assange's murder."
Assange therefore rightly feared for his safety, said Hrafnsson.
The Wikileaks founder will therefore remain hidden.
Hrafnsson apparently responded to statements from North America.
In America, the former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, had demanded that the responsible for the Wikileaks disclosures be charged and executed for treason.
In Canada, an adviser from Head of Government Stephen Harper - obviously ironic - said on television that Assange should be "killed" and Obama could "use a drone".
The White House and Assange were now in the midst of an exchange of battles.
The speaker of American President Barack Obama, Robert Gibbs, called it "stupid and absurd" that Assange had demanded the resignation of Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton if she is responsible for recently announced espionage requests to diplomats.
"I'm not quite sure why we take care of the opinion of a guy with a website," says Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than its website."
The American government is now testing the protection of its databases.
The White House was informed of the appointment of the Deputy Director of the Centre for Anti-Terrorism Measures, Russell Travers.
Travers was responsible for developing "necessary structural reforms" which, after the publication of the message reports by Wikileaks, had become necessary.
The White House also wants to see how the entire government is exchanging information and protecting it.
The U.S. government also announced its intention to ensure the safety of dissidents and activists, should they be put at risk by the Wikileaks publication.
"We've done everything we can to get in touch with them," said Foreign Secretary Philip Crowley.
"We are ready to protect them if necessary."
The Ice University
At the "Gelato University" at Bologna, ice conditors are prepared for better seasons.
The three-day basic course for future gelatieri has the largest inbound and visitors from all over the world.
Where does the whole ice come from?
From the Gelatier and the Gelataio.
The gelatier, in German somewhat old-fashioned of the ice conditor, produces the cream according to all the rules of Italian icemaker art.
With a spatula, the Gelataio removes the ice cream from the fridge, strokes it into the waffle and then sells it.
To know this, you don't have to drive to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But anyone who wants to know more about ice does not get past the "Gelato University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The Ice University has set up the manufacturer of ice machines in 2003 to ensure that the ice cream from its machines meets the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The three-day basic course for future gelatieri has the largest inbound and visitors from all over the world.
But there are also several days special courses around chocolate ice cream and internships in the on-site ice cream parlour.
Some dream of a new career in the Midlife crisis, while others just venture to the smooth ice of their vague longings.
This time it is 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents - from Brazil to Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, art teacher from California, loves the slow food movement and wants to offer a European quality product in the country of the industrial Ice Cream.
Anke from Berlin is a business consultant and wants to do something of her own after years in a nervous job.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening an ice shelf in Cairo.
A man from Malta and one from Brazil wants to improve the quality of the ice cream in their bars - and the Canadian housewife Julia comes because their children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro Gelatie Luciano Ferrari first explains to the participants the ideal properties of the perfect ice cream.
It is not only good taste but also silky smoothness and good consistency.
Luciano does not forget, however, the little cream of the national and even southern superstructure in his training: "Italian gelato is simply the best - and then there is a lot of romance."
The first step to manufacture seems quite simple.
Luciano rolls the basic ingredients milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large mixer that heats everything to 85 degrees with an electronic program and then cools immediately to four degrees.
Then he turns up a cock on the machine, and out comes a pasteurized white base cream, basis for all milk ice cream varieties.
Immediately, the lecturer is overwhelmed with questions: Can you make ice cream only with natural fabrics without a stabilizer?
How can you let your own desire for experimentation run free?
Luciano warns against being led astray by the zeitgeist.
Those who speak of ice cream "only from natural ingredients" may still have used stabilizers - mostly a natural product, such as guar gum from the guar bean.
Of course you can make ice even without a stabilizer, only then it must be sold within one day, otherwise it will sink into itself, and the customer bites on loud ice pellets.
Certain variations at the base mass are permitted.
It's more exciting with the aromas.
For the taste in the ice, Maestro Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients that you buy in the fruit department or in the sweets of the supermarket.
There are also powders and pastes.
"The suppliers will all try to turn you into dozens of aromatized additives."
"But you should just experiment."
Either with fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruits.
Or just at the ice cream from the white base mass, which becomes yellow cream with eggs and with cocoa powder as the basis for all kinds of chocolate seductions.
Now the students are allowed to join the ice machines.
Luciano lets them produce four different kinds of vanilla, chocolate, mocha and hazelnut ice - with or without eggs in the base mass, with more or less vanilla aroma or other natural additives.
The same experiment also involves the fruit ice varieties.
More flavors, more fruit puree - this is not necessarily better.
Hazelnut ice cream doesn't necessarily taste more nutty when it contains more hazelnuts.
The most popular Kiwi ice makes the working group that uses more fruit, less water and a little less stabilizer.
First, a balanced mixture correctly highlights the taste of a gelato, says Luciano.
Icemaking is a calculation task: If peach purée is used with a lot of sugar, the sugar content must be reduced in the basic recipe.
An extra portion of sugar is required for lemon ice.
Luciano draws out a device by which he determines the sugar content of the fruit varieties (winners thus measure the oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately, tables facilitate calculation.
Making ice no longer requires as much physical use as before.
Not only does the device for the automatic production of the base mass help.
There is also a device in which the finished ice mix is simultaneously beaten creamy and cooled at minus temperatures.
Despite all automation, small boilers do not fail.
The Brazilian Gustavo and his colleagues from top to bottom are struggling with fruit purée, when the overdimensional bar mixer becomes out of control.
"In every course," says Maestro Luciano, "it's just a matter of time before such a thing happens."
On-board tell-tales
The European Food Authority, EFSA, was subversive of the industry experimenting with gene plants.
This allegation is now formulated by the expert group Testbiotech, which is an independent institute for the impact assessment of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we have documented it well," said Testbiotech CEO Christoph Then on Wednesday in Munich.
The head of the EFSA expert group on genetically modified plants, Harry Kuiper, and another EFSA expert have been under contract for years at the Ilsi lobbyist association.
It is paid by corporations like Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper has been a major contributor to the EFSA testing rules for gene plants and is thus in a clear conflict of interest, criticises them.
The EFSA regulations are word by word with the Ilsi position papers and thus bear the handwriting of the industry, which is actually to be controlled by the authority in the Italian Parma.
This is the second time that Testbiotech has had a conflict of interest.
For example, a high-level EFSA manager was recently free of constraints or transition periods to the Swiss agricultural group Syngenta - and thus changed the pages.
The Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk (MDR) has also recently revealed human resources links between controlling EU authorities and industrial lobby, which has made the Federal Environment Agency and EU parliamentarians deaf.
However, the EFSA cannot recognise any conflict of interest.
All serious data, including those of industry, are used as long as they are of high technical quality, says an opinion.
Experts working for EFSA are not required to have any contacts with industry.
But you'd have to reveal them.
Kuiper admits his work to the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the United States.
This is known as a neutral forum for experts from science, industry and politics, including the risk assessment for biotechnology without lobbying.
In the matter, independent experts such as then criticise the fact that genetically modified plants are currently authorised without any feeding attempt in animals and the reaction of gene plants to environmental influences is not tested.
"We want to know what, for example, genetically modified maize does on the field," says Dan.
Current practice is to test only isolated proteins, but not the whole gene plant, which does not produce reliable results.
"If you don't look for the risks, how do you find them?" then they charge.
Angelika Hilbeck sees it that way.
The scientist has been researching genetic engineering since 1994 and is currently working at the Technische Hochschule Zürich.
As in the USA, industry is increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists in Europe.
Therefore, there are hardly any researchers who were not involved with companies.
Critical studies for companies would usually not be published.
"Industry controls safety research," says Hilbeck.
The trail of the stones
Uli Gsell has also worried about some, a total of about 400 kilos.
On Monday evening he stood form Stuttgart station, the tuba on his back.
It was demo.
It's snowing.
The story is known: In September, the excavators arrived and had begun to break off a large piece of the northern wing.
The Stuttgart world was no longer the same: tens of thousands of people demonstrated against S21, the billion-dollar lowering of the station.
When the construction stopped, most of the wing was in ruins.
Broken into 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a soft coarse stone, built between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in East Fildern, 43 years old.
He's secured some of the debris.
"These stones are relics."
"You can't go away."
He swears, "A cheap and poor stone, simple and earthy."
When he sacked one, he smelled after cigarette fever.
He doesn't know what he's going to do with the fragments yet.
Stones have time.
Uli Gsell, too.
The trail of the Stuttgart stones leads to a forest near Tübingen on a former ammunition depot of the French army, where Manuel Rongen built his stone empire.
The 44-year-old deals with old stones.
He bought all those who came to Stuttgart at the crash.
"It would be a shame if they were ground to gravel or disappeared in the landfill," he says in his office, a wooden pavement that was once a watchman's house.
He was insulted and threatened when he was told in the newspapers in September that he had bought the rest of the north wing from the break-up contractor.
But he talked to the S-21 opponents for days.
And he told them that he couldn't do anything for the demolition.
And if it happened, then it would be the most reasonable thing if the stones were to be used again.
About 200 S-21 opponents then took along one of the average 80 kilos of quadrons, unit price 6.50 to 14 euros.
As a reminder, some but also in the hope of being able to return him in a reconstruction.
500 tons had bought Rongen, 25 large truckloads.
About half of it is still stored in the forest, the rest is sold long ago.
Garden owners, landscape gardeners, house builders.
They had come from everywhere and dragged away what luggage and trailers could carry.
The Stuttgart stones of the instigation have long since turned into "mäuerle" or into boundaries of herb beds.
"Actually, this stone is nothing special," says Rongen.
"Wouldn't be the political component."
He gets into his off-road car, takes a tour through his 20-hectare empire.
He studied and graduated from law, later from biology, then became interested in computers and eventually became a stone dealer.
And stone lovers.
40,000 tons of bricks stored here.
From all over Germany, he keeps his treasures together.
He says he's the biggest old stone dealer in the Republic.
He's braked.
There are artificially carved sandstones in the snow.
"They once belonged to the Dresden Marienbrücke", he says.
Elbsandstone, yellow, warm, it's swarming.
"My favorite stone."
It goes up the path through the forest.
He shows on a pile: red sandstone, formerly part of the Karlsruhe station.
And on.
"Beautiful Travertine."
The quads once belonged to the Neckarstadion in Stuttgart.
Throughout the snow stones and stories, Cannstatter Travertine from the Stuttgart Police Bureau, red granite from the Cathedral of Sankt Blasien, Tuff from the Heilbronn Hospital.
What work, what effort, what sweat.
When Rongen remembers how the stones were previously cut by hand and moved with simple bottle pulls and ox carts, he becomes quite awesome.
"It would be a scandal if you were to step up."
He didn't get rich, he didn't get rich at all.
But 14 people are employed by the stone dealer today, as well as having settled up in the forest of Steinmetze, a sculptor, a forge, a glass blower and a gardener.
"We work hard, but it is satisfying," says the recycler.
Soon he'll have to go to Cologne.
There are also stones to save.
Talented Fight for High Potentials
There's a big crowd on the buffet.
16 students insist on salmon rolls, tomato soup and sweets.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the Autobauer Volkswagen have invited the mechanical engineering and design students to a workshop.
Together with VW developers, they will be able to learn about the car of the future in some way - and by the way, they will meet Volkswagen.
In the competition for the smartest minds, many companies are now engaged in the close-up fight and, like VW, rely on cooperation with the universities.
Their mission: to recruit the most gifted graduates as early as possible in the auditoriums before they come to the labour market and are recruited by others.
And because the universities do not publish statements on the performance of their students, they try to see and bind the exceptional talents in practical projects.
On the second day of the workshop at TU Braunschweig, the car group advertises the talents.
A young lady from the personnel department distributes ballpoint pens, rubber bears and folders with VW logo.
She tells the hopeful young talent of internship programs and student jobs and shows them ways to the group.
Nico Selle from TU Braunschweig manages the project with VW.
He sees the advantages for both sides: "The students come into contact with the industry and gain experience."
"VW can at the same time get to know students, look at interesting candidates and think about who would qualify as employees."
Such cooperations, according to Selle, are not unusual.
New is that the students are being so offensively hurled around.
"Otherwise, the focus was on the professional project," says Selle.
The fight for the freshly graduated will probably be even harder.
In many sectors, companies can no longer choose their employees from a large number of applicants.
Instead, they must praise themselves and especially bale for highly skilled workers.
Especially graduates from the engineering disciplines are in an excellent negotiating position.
According to the Association of German Engineers VDI, over 40,000 engineers remained unoccupied in October.
And the so-called engineering gap will grow even larger according to VDI forecasts.
For KPMG's auditing and consulting company, Roman Dykta is going on the talent hunt.
He organizes elaborate recruitment events such as the KPMG Race, a kind of modern carpentry hunt where participants have to find their way through GPS coordinates.
Eight promising students want to send the company across the US next year.
By the way, participants can look at KPMG facilities and get to know the company.
Who is allowed to join, decides in two selection rounds in advance.
Only the crème de la crème of the many applicants flies to the USA.
When the high potentials at the universities are hopped and stabbed, the guns are getting bigger and bigger, according to Dykta.
"We want to get out of the crowd with the race."
"Only a simple sailing trip was too little for us."
For talent hunter Dykta, the bill seems to be on the table.
"We are still in contact with all participants of a similar action last year."
"Some are just about to graduate and want to apply soon," he says.
In addition to the direct bumping on the campus, small and medium-sized companies are also classically on the pirsch at professional fairs.
"We are trying to reach graduates at trade fairs."
"Somewhere on the Intersolar," reports Sitha Stübe, head of staff at Solarworld solar technology manufacturer.
The Bonner company employs about 1500 people in Germany.
Dust knows about the youngster's problem.
Currently, 35 jobs are advertised on the company website.
"It's just very difficult to occupy vacant positions."
"It takes a lot of time and money," she says.
Another way is to contact the university professors.
Solarworld cooperates with various universities, such as the University of Freiberg.
"The professors give evidence that you can do internships with us or write your diploma thesis."
Expensive promotions are not popular with solar specialists.
For this the company tries to advertise with other advantages for itself: personal atmosphere, flat hierarchies and light communication.
"This often cannot be offered by a large group," says staff manager Stübe.
Money does not play the leading role in the search for a job for a long time.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good climbing opportunities are other crucial factors.
At a study by the Great Place to Work Institute, Solarworld took 55th place among the 100 best employers in Germany.
The Institute creates an annual best list of German employers.
To this end, it questions employees how satisfied they are with their work and their job environment and looks at the framework conditions for employees.
Staff manager Stübe also hopes for positive points for the job seekers from the placement.
"I think applicants are looking especially for external evaluations about a potential employer," she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler from the German Employers Branding Academy advises companies who want to build up a good reputation as an employer with a long-term strategy.
He advises his customers to become more authentic.
And that, according to warriors, means, above all, internal measures.
"The best way to make yourself attractive as an employer is through your own employees," he says.
In industry jargon, the internal employer branding, i.e. employer branding within his own workforce, is called.
"Happy employees are the best ambassadors."
If you treat your people well and identify them with the company, they would advertise for their employer on their own with friends and acquaintances.
"It's like a game with gangs," says Kriegler.
Obama stops oil drilling
On the coast of the U.S. state of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico, there will be no new oil drilling in the coming years.
A corresponding ban has been passed by the government in Washington - and thus finally revoked its previous plans.
Also on the Atlantic coast, new drilling remains prohibited for the time being.
This was announced by Minister of Interior Ken Salazar on Wednesday.
The trigger for the strict ban, which should apply for at least the next five years, is the explosion of the deepwater horizon drilling platform in April.
Prior to the accident that cost eleven workers their lives and led to the greatest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama had signaled his willingness to allow new drilling in the eastern Gulf of Mexico on pressure from the opposition and industry.
The supporters want to reduce the US's dependence on oil supplies from abroad.
Those who bear the responsibility for the devastating oil plague in the Gulf are not yet fully resolved.
At the heart of the criticism is the British energy group BP, which is confronted with billions of demands.
A commission of inquiry on Obama's behalf will present its findings during December.
In October, Interior Minister Ken Salazar lifted the drilling stop after the explosion.
Subsequently, various oil groups had immediately submitted applications for new drilling projects.
With tighter controls and stricter safety regulations, Obama and Salazar want to rule out another disaster.
At present, the competent control authority, which was in the process of being corrupted following numerous accusations of corruption, is being fundamentally reformed.
In parallel, Obama announced closing lucrative tax loopholes for oil and gas companies.
Industry now publicly warns that the amount of funding in the Gulf would be significantly lower by stricter regulation than before.
"The government's plans are the biggest brake on the growth of the oil and gas industry," says a recent industry survey by the consultant BDO - even before the drilling ban of Wednesday.
The American Energy Alliance also complains about the uncertainty in the industry: "No one knows exactly what will change with regulation."
Investment in new support projects would be postponed until further notice - at the expense of growth.
Ogoniland is burned down
The water in the rivers is oily brown, it smells like at the gas station: billions of litres of oil spilled out have destroyed nature in Nigerian Ogoniland.
People live from theft, corruption and illegal oil cooking.
Celestine Akpobari means well.
"Don't worry," the eco-activist reassures the journalists: "You will still have enough oil sludge in front of the lens today."
The 37-year-old Nigerian has tried to photograph a boy wading up to the chest in the water with the slings surrounding him: In the rainbow-coloured water gloss, the scene seems almost pretty.
The fact that brown crude oil swads float under the surface is not to be seen.
She used to pick up shrimp here, says Esther Badom on the banks of the Bodo Jetty River.
Meanwhile, the sluggish flowing waters were completely dead.
Five years ago, from a brushed pipeline, bulk of crude oil poured into the huge wetlands.
Fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo now have to row for six hours to get into fishy waters: The Ogoniland, located in the heart of the Niger delta, is considered one of the worst ruined regions in the world.
On the journey through the mangrove swamps that have been traversed by rivers, the whole extent of the destruction becomes obvious.
Instead of light water, the motorboat blows up brown broth, who dips his hand into the water, pulls oily fingers out.
The roots of the mangrove trees rake like black liquorice poles from the ground, sadly leaving single palm trees to be found hanging their weeds.
Bird swarms, as they are otherwise common in wetlands, are sought in vain: As soon as the outboarder silences, the former paradise, smelling like a gas station, spreads spooky tranquillity.
"What's happening here is ecological warfare," says Celestine Akpobari darkly: "We live in constant danger to health."
The comparison of war is appropriate.
The Ogoni settlement area is a battlefield that has been fighting for decades: the first explorers from Europe came here more than 60 years ago, here in the 1980s with the later executed writer Ken Saro-Wiwa organized the first resistance, where the Shell Group had to stop production in 1993 because it became too dangerous for its oil workers.
Even today, the company has refused to return to Ogoniland: while more than two million barrels of black gold are pumped daily from the entire delta region by the triple size of Switzerland with more than 5000 wells and 7000 kilometres of pipelines, the oil fields in Ogoniland are broken, too unstable for the company.
Every couple of hundred meters of steel stands like bizarre sculptures from the water: "Christian Trees" are called the heads of drill holes much too tenderly.
They are up to 50 years old, most corroded to the mark.
Time and again such a drill head breaks apart, says Akpobari, then a constant stream of crude oil flows into the water.
According to expert estimates, more than two billion litres have been poured into the Delta ecosystem in 50 years: year after year, the amount of oil they used in the disaster of the super tanker "Exxon Valdez" in front of Alaska 21 years ago - one of the largest environmental disasters in the history of mankind.
Those who are responsible for the ongoing Eco-GAU will argue about this.
While the shell group Sabotage and the organized oil theft account for more than 90 percent of the pollution, environmentalists see bursting drilling heads and leaky pipelines as the main cause.
Shell imposes much lower safety standards in Nigeria than usual in the world, the U.S. scientist Richard Steiner proposed to the Group in 2008: The rate of defects on the lines alone is "by a multiple higher than elsewhere".
In a place that looks like an abandoned, oil-smelled workshop under the open sky, the mangroves show up: they are split naked and lubricated to the neck.
Under one of the many barrels that are partly connected to pipes, partly randomly scattered on the site, a fire is flickering: an illegal small refinery.
In the barrel, the crude oil is heated over the fire for several hours, explains Michael, head of the group.
First, gasoline penetrates through the pipes into the tap, later dripping out at the end of the kerosene line and finally diesel.
Michael and four employees produce up to four barrels of diesel of 300 litres a day: "This brings us 34,000 naira" - about 22 dollars.
The delta residents use the chronic fuel shortage in the largest petroleum state of Black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
The ridiculously low diesel price of almost 40 Euro cents per litre can still be undercut by the illegal cookers: they get their raw material for free.
It comes from "bunkers" who tap the pipeline network across Ogoniland: According to experts in the whole Niger Delta, at least 16 million litres of crude oil are lost every day.
However, only a disappearing small part of the provisional intermediate raw material is illegally refined: the lion's share fills organized criminal networks, including politicians and high-level military, in tankers and embroider them on the world market.
The debate as to whether the environmental disaster is more likely to be due to the movements of the population or to the lax production method, the activist Akpobari considers it purely academic.
"If the oil companies were not perceived as invaders and if they had not so thoroughly destroyed the fishermen's livelihood, there would be neither sabotage nor theft nor illegal refining."
Meanwhile, the Ogoni's relationship with Shell, above all, had been so destroyed that only a deduction from the group would be in question: "Perhaps other nationalities like the Chinese appear to be better."
Michael gets nervous.
"It's high time you disappeared," says the muscular oil man.
"Every minute the soldiers can come."
If the illegal oil refiners are caught by the special unit of the armed forces, they are not under arrest, but are likely to have a painful lubrication.
The soldiers who come mainly from the north of the country, like all Nigerians, also want to benefit from the raw material.
"This damn thing has brought our country to the dog in every way," says Akpobari.
Detectors Discover Dangerous Construction Errors in A380 Engines
The A380 seems to have a major security problem.
Investigators have discovered a possible construction defect in the investigation of a forced landing machine that could lead to a "catastrophe engine failure".
Qantas Airline now wants to sue the engine manufacturer.
The passengers of the emergency landing Qantas-Airbus at the beginning of November seemed to have known much more luck than before: The Australian Air Safety Authority has found a major safety problem in the engines of some A380 machines in its investigations - and is now warning of a possible construction fault.
The potential defect would have serious consequences: In the case of an oil hose connection, it could cause fatigue cracks and leaks, it was stated in an opinion published on this Thursday by the authority of ATSB.
This could have led to "a catastrophic engine failure".
Rolls-Royce engines were affected in 20 aircraft of the A380 series.
Below is the Qantas-Airbus, which had to land in Singapore on November 4.
The Australian airline has now taken legal action against the British turbine manufacturer.
She filed a complaint with an Australian federal court in Sydney that allowed him to take further legal action against the company.
Qantas Chief Alan Joyce said his airline would demand damages for the incident at the beginning of November.
During the fire of the engine parts had dissolved and damaged the wings.
Rolls-Royce made an oil fire as a cause of the damage.
After the incident, up to 40 engines need to be replaced worldwide.
The Australian investigators announced that they would carry out further safety tests on the superjumbos equipped with the engines concerned.
The safety recommendation was the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, said ATSB spokesperson Martin Dolan.
The safety problem was considered to be sufficiently important to inform all concerned.
After the emergency landing of the Qantas machine, the airline had kept its A380 fleet on the ground for weeks.
Singapore Airlines left about three of its eleven A380 temporarily on the ground.
Lufthansa replaced the engine with an A380 as a precautionary measure.
The double-story flyer is the largest passenger aircraft in the world.
Landwide snowfall triggers traffic chaos
Germany in white: almost overnight snow fell throughout the country.
On many roads chaos prevails, trains and flights fall.
At least three people were killed in car accidents.
The winter frosts Germany: At icy temperatures almost the whole Republic is snowed on Thursday at night - which leads to traffic chaos in many places.
In the north and in the east there are partly 15 centimeters thick snow blankets.
On several highways and many roads, traffic is severely restricted.
On the A7 near Flensburg the winter service was in permanent use, but was not finished with the constantly reviving snow.
In addition, violent evils swept over the Baltic Sea coast.
The Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Office (BSH) is expecting storm floods at 1.2 metres above the normal level on the Baltic Sea coast of Schleswig-Holstein from the morning.
In Saxony, snowfalls on the highways and federal roads caused considerable problems.
According to the Meteomedia Weather Center, alarm level was violet in Saxon Switzerland - the highest level at all.
Some 30 centimeters of new snow fell there, fresh and strong winds caused damage.
There were several trucks and cars in the night.
Also in Saxony-Anhalt, the police authorities reported major disturbances on the streets.
On the A2 snow and wind led to rising traffic and congestion.
In Thuringia the A4 and A9 were affected by the snowfalls.
According to Deutsche Bahn, significant disturbances occur in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and the north of Bavaria.
Snow on the tracks, fallen trees on the rails or destroyed overhead lines and paths are the main problems.
In Saxony the long distance traffic from Leipzig to Nuremberg had to be stopped.
In Thuringia Saalfeld, an ICE had to stop its journey to Munich.
The 165 passengers were supplied by firefighters and rescue workers with wool blankets, food and drinks on the train.
Snow winds swept over the streets.
At large German airports, the snow winds lead to numerous flight failures.
Some cancellations have already been reported in Munich, according to a spokesperson of the Flight Information Centre.
According to a Fraport spokesperson in Frankfurt am Main, 40 flights have already been cancelled.
Winter duty is in permanent use.
Although there are only a few stranded passengers at the airport, there are still almost 400 field beds available for them.
On many roads accidents occurred on Wednesday evening.
In the evening, a truck driver was killed in a collision with a train on a railway crossing in East Holstein.
The driver was slightly injured.
A similar accident occurred in the vicinity of Nuremberg due to snow-covered roads: Here too, a truck was detected on a railway crossing because the vehicle was stuck.
The driver died.
On the train four passengers were injured - the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was therefore blocked until the morning hours.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died after crossing the road with her car at Aschaffenburg.
But the meteorologists have a good news: Although the snow will still be loose and powdery and therefore start to swirl up with light waves.
But the wind will weaken.
Only the Baltic Sea is hit by rapid and stormy winds.
However, it remains very cold - locally up to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for its twin towers
Deutsche Bank wants to separate itself from its landmarks: According to a newspaper report, the Money House is looking for buyers for the two office towers at its Frankfurt headquarters.
Up to 500 million euros could be added to the property.
The Deutsche Bank has just made its headquarters pretty: the twin towers in the Frankfurt bank district have been modernised; the bankers have now been allowed to return to their old workplace.
But now the financial group seems to want to recover the cost of the renovation - and is looking for a buyer for the two high houses, as the "Financial Times Germany" writes under appeal to a speaker.
Reasons for the proposed sale were not mentioned by the speaker.
"We always check whether it makes more sense to own or sell real estate and then to rent it back," he said.
Germany's largest credit institution thus returns its headquarters after a short period of time.
The bank had only taken over the double towers in mid-2007 for EUR 272 million from the investors of a home-owned fund and then refurbished heavily.
The energy conversion absorbed the data after about 200 million euros.
A sale would probably bring a lot of money to the bank.
According to industry experts, the newspaper estimates the value of the towers now renamed "Greentowers" to be around 500 million euros.
Whether the buildings are once again sold to a bank fund or to an independent investor is still open, the speaker said.
Thousands of mourners for dead mates
More than 10,000 people have thought in New Zealand of the spilled miners who were declared dead after several explosions in a mine.
The bodies still could not be saved because the security situation in the accident shaft is still precarious.
Almost two weeks ago, a violent explosion occurred in the Pike River Mine near the city of Greymouth.
29 miners aged between 17 and 62 were shed underground.
A probe had been dropped into the accident shaft, but had not discovered any trace of survivors.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and subsequent explosions, no rescue forces could descend for safety reasons.
After the second violent detonation, the authorities and experts assumed that there was no longer any chance of survival for the buddy.
The bodies could not be saved so far.
Now relatives and friends remembered the dead with a commemorative celebration.
Ten thousand people had gathered at radiant sunshine in Greymouth on the New Zealand South Island.
They've been silent for two minutes.
In honor of the spilled miners, 29 tables were placed, with helmets, lamps and the names of the fellows on display.
Pictures and personal items, including clothing and surfboards, also found their place here.
In front of the country's government buildings, the flags blew half-mast.
New Zealand had hoped that the miners would come back to the surface "from the depths of the earth", said New Zealand Prime Minister John Key to the participants of the commemorative celebration.
"But they never came home."
He could not conclude with the death of his son as long as he had not seen his body, said Lawrence Drew, whose son Zen was spilled into the pit.
In addition to the Prime Minister and members of the victims, several foreign diplomats attended the commemorative celebration.
During the first explosion on 19 November, British and South African miners had also been spilled.
Rescue workers began to extinguish a fire inside the coal mine on the South Island of New Zealand.
Once the explosive gases have been displaced, it will begin to cool down the glowing temperatures inside the mine, said police president Gary Knowles to journalists.
To hell, warrior!
Does Splatter Fit to the Art Cinema?
The director Nicolas Winding Refn is reviving old genre boundaries with his champion epic "Walhalla Rising".
Which audience might the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn have thought of when he shot "Walhalla Rising"?
A captured Viking warrior with only one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) frees himself from his tormentors and, with almost superhuman forces, turns his opponents in a row - sounds ideal for young male spectators looking for bloody action, precisely because our hero likes to use harsh killing methods and rips his enemies from the living body when he has a bad mood.
On the other hand, Einauge says, as he is actually called, the whole film does not say a word, and the other characters can at most be snatched at one or two sentences or a few painful death cries.
Otherwise, it will be silent and swallowed up in the creepy, beautiful hill landscape of Scotland, which offers the backdrop to the Viking world of about a thousand years ago.
Ideal for adult cinemas with interest in existentialism and very quiet camera rides.
It's nice if a movie has multiple target groups, but it's a shame if they're mutually exclusive.
Director Winding Refn has been considered a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino since his wild and styled drug dealer trilogy "Pusher", but he refuses to make his works accessible to the Arthouse with a little more humor to the mainstream or a little less brutality.
Most art cinema friends are likely to be deterred from the squirting brain mass and intestines.
The action fans die of boredom at the latest when, for freely interpretable reasons, a single eye with a force of violent Christian missionaries breaks up to Jerusalem by ship and an eternity is trapped in flutes and mists before the team apparently arrives in America and continues to remain silent.
No wonder "Walhalla Rising" in Germany has not found a cinema rental and has now only been released on DVD.
This is a pity especially because of the magnificent pictures, but also because behind the pretentious to blood-staining facade a sometimes exciting piece of cinema is hidden, which deserves some attention.
In this film it's not about dialogues or a strict action, it's all about the atmosphere, a filmed fever chamber.
And from this there is no escape for the spectator.
Refn hardly gives him a moment of relaxation and ties him to the throat with his icy images and the dark trance-like soundtrack, but above all with the unfathomable hatred that strikes him from the hearts of the characters.
Only a little blond boy who is faithful to the one eye keeps himself such a thing as innocence, all the others are driven by anger.
Most of the one-eyed hero whose motives are never explained, but who eventually becomes a warrior out of hell for enemies and temporary allies, possibly the ambassador of the Devil himself.
It means corruption, but perhaps only for those who are already corrupt.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious film that can be hated and admired to anger, excitement and amazement.
An experience.
Enigmatic Earthworks
The IAEA Atomic Energy Agency has new indications of a secret nuclear programme in Syria.
However, the country refuses to take a position on this - it still allows for controls.
Towards midnight on September 5th, 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighter aircraft attack a mysterious, cube-shaped building in Syria.
It is located on the shore of the Euphrates; the nearest larger city, 30 kilometers away, is Dair as-Saur.
Its name appears in documents of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) when it comes to the reactor that Syria allegedly built with the help of North Korea in the square, hidden in a valley that runs off the stream.
According to a letter from the CIA at the end of April 2008, the reactor commonly used under the name of the nearby village of el-Kibar would have been well suited to produce plutonium - from which nuclear weapons could be built.
For other purposes, the technology from the 1950s is hardly suitable.
The CIA presented a video presentation with unexplained satellite images.
By computer animation, she was blinded to where what components of the reactor were supposed to have been before destruction, which was a reduced copy of the North Korean model from the Yongbyon nuclear center.
She also presented photos showing the building from nearby or even the interior.
The reactor had just been commissioned, it was said, but had not yet been equipped with fuel rods.
Today, more than three years after the bombardment, is hardly more known than then, and the puzzles have become rather larger over time.
Former U.S. President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that the CIA was quite sure before the attack that Syria was building a reactor in el-Kibar, but hardly saw any evidence that there was "an active nuclear program" in the country.
Some secret servants in Europe prefer to be more cautious and speak only of a "suspected reactor", even if they consider the CIA presentation to be "plausible".
They lack hard evidence, as do the IAEA.
Asked how safe he was to have a reactor in front of him, a high UN diplomat answered only lapidar in the summer, which IAEA had "sufficient material to ask questions".
The Syrians, though quickly aside, planned the site in a thorough manner, to scour the alleged "unused military building".
Nevertheless, in June 2008, an IAEA team of former chief inspector Olli Heinonen in el-Kibar found traces of uranium produced by humans.
In addition, the IAEA received satellite images of commercial operators from time directly after the attack, which is likely to be more significant than those presented by the CIA.
However, these recordings cannot be obtained on the market because the unknown client - perhaps Israel - has bought them exclusively.
Therefore, the IAEA cannot independently verify its authenticity.
Syria has always claimed to have never run a secret nuclear program or built a reactor.
The uranium comes from the Israeli weapons, Damascus explained.
However, this was unlikely to be rejected by the IAEA after analysis of the particles.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss it - as well as satellite images.
In addition, it refuses the controllers a second inspection in el-Kibar and access to the debris of the bombed building.
But Israel too is silent about iron.
"We will never comment on this," recently confirmed the official position of Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, who is in office at the time of the attack.
Since June 2008, the investigation of the case has failed and "is increasingly developing into a serious credibility problem for the authority", as a high Western diplomat admits at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna - finally, there is a serious violation of the nuclear barrier treaty in the area over which the IAEA is monitoring.
As a key to progress in enlightenment, the IAEA apparently sees three other facilities that are to be "in functional connection" with the supposed reactor - and unlike this one still exists.
So far, the inspectors have not revealed which plants are involved, what function they have or what they appear to be suspicious.
According to information from the Süddeutsche Zeitung, they are referred to internally by the IAEA as Marj as Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, in turn derived from nearby cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) has identified these places and has located a building complex at Masyaf on satellite images, which is most likely one of the suspicious objects.
It may be located in or directly next to a military base - precisely on this ground, Syria of the IAEA refuses access to the three places.
In Vienna it is said that the Syrians feared a fishing expedition - that the IAEA would be sent by the US to spy out military facilities.
Because the nuclear detectors had become aware of the facilities through a tip of the U.S. secret services.
The IAEA has indications, including satellite photos, that between the three places and the square on the Euphrates material was transported back and forth.
A high Western diplomat in Vienna said that at least one of the facilities could be "related to fuel production".
But there are "no indications of sensitive activities", i.e. uranium enrichment or reprocessing; processes necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The reactor type is operated with uranium, which is not enriched.
But where the uranium should have come from and where the plutonium should be separated from it for the bomb, there are at least plausible assumptions on these central issues.
It is also unclear whether debris that could contain valuable traces was stored in the three places.
As if the hundreds of truckloads had disappeared from the ground, no one wants information about where the debris has remained.
The salt mine al-Tibni, located only a few kilometres from el-Kibar on the other side of the Euphrates, which Syria has examined for its suitability as a storage facility for radioactive waste in 1998, is considered unlikely to be the IAEA.
Former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley recently linked her to the reactor in an analysis of satellite images for the renowned magazine Jane's Intelligence Review.
However, photographs from the orbit show that Syria carried out earthworks in the three suspicious places and removed large containers after the IAEA had requested access.
This may be a coincidence, but it has hardly helped to clear the suspicion.
In addition, it is said in diplomatic circles that the IAEA has spent several months developing a plan for inspections there that should allow Syria to keep any military secrets - only the effort shows the great interest of the inspectors.
However, Damascus also overturned this proposal.
Had Western diplomats in Vienna settled a year ago that the reactor was destroyed, therefore the matter had no high urgency, Glyn Davies, for example, has been putting into play so-called special inspections for a few months, one of the sharpest means the Viennese nuclear authority has to enforce controls.
IAEA Chief Yukiya Amano, who would have to propose these inspections, has already spoken of "an option for which I am open in the future", but he is still hesitant.
There is a high risk in this way: on the one hand, it requires a majority in the Board of Governors of the IAEA, and on the other hand, some of the 35 countries represented there are anything but anxious for an escalation.
On the other hand, how a diplomat gives thought to: "What if they find nothing in the end?"
Love in Times of War
Since Angelina Jolie started working on her still nameless directorial debut in the summer, there is trouble.
The script itself has written it, a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a Serbian man.
You don't know much more about it - but that's enough for trouble.
The rumor, the woman, a Muslim, persists in love with her Serbian rapist during the Yugoslavia war.
Bosnian women's associations have immediately protested, and a few short-term film days planned in Sarajevo have been transferred to Hungary.
Meanwhile, the film in Hungary has been shot and in post-production, but it is still being protested in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic from the organization of female war victims wrote about the UN refugee aid agency UNHCR to Jolie and demanded a meeting with the actress, has now reported a Bosnian newspaper - Jolie herself is an ambassador of the UN refugee aid agency.
It is not diplomatic - it has already offered women a meeting in Hungary weeks ago, but they refused.
The meeting had to take place in Bosnia, says Hasecic.
Love stories in rape camps did not exist, and Jolie's attitude towards the victims betrayed her enough about the script.
According to the UN Refugee Aid Agency, her organization has recommended that Jolie be released as an ambassador, reports the Guardian.
But what exactly did Jolie write for scenes?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, who got to read her script, has after some time and time granted a filming permit for Sarajevo - it is not quite clear why Jolie did not come then anyway.
The young author himself argues that she does not pursue political intentions with her film, has worked hard in the conflict with Yugoslavia, wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and give a voice to all sides involved.
However, the content remains vague.
A second synopsis of the film in the web is curated, which then sounds quite different: the lovers knew each other before the outbreak of war and met again when they, a Bosnian Muslim, were dragged into a Serbian camp where he worked as a guard.
What sounds very different than the variant "sacrifice of rape falls into torture".
That Jolie's film actually starts before the war - so much is certain.
The pressure on them, said Jolie, is "unfair and is based on misinformation".
Now you can only get the hackers of Hollywood peace: by putting the screenplay, like so many before, into the net illegally.
Nothing like getting out of here.
This evening, it finally runs around for the Irish again.
No sign of grief.
For this, the home team dominates its guests from Sweden, Finland and the USA too much.
The fans cheered for joy with loud music, they stamped with their feet.
The Bailey pub in southern Cork trembles because players throw table tennis balls over a three-meter distance in beer cups - and meet.
"Beerpong" is called the bizarre spectacle, to win there is 500 Euro victory prize plus tickets to Las Vegas for the beer pong World Championships in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet guy; this shrill drinking game and the restraining computer scientist, that doesn't really match.
And yet the 26-year-old is trying to be entertained in distracting himself from the boring question of what the future will bring.
His plan does not include game fun in Las Vegas, he will conduct application interviews in New Zealand in January.
"I have a hunch," he says.
"It's so far away from home, and I still don't have a job there."
After all, his girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland - "she had a jerk, tock her wish job as an event manager, perhaps a good sign," says the young man and laughs.
Because of bad prospects at home, two of Tanner's three siblings have already sought their happiness abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now has a position as IT consultant in London.
The boys go: As with the tanners, it looks on the island in many families.
100 000 Irish will probably leave the country in the near future, say experts from the ESRI Economic and Social Research Institute in Dublin.
By 2015 they will even expect 200,000 immigrants.
For the small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants a severe loss.
If forecasts are confirmed, there is a wave of emigration comparable to that suffered by Ireland in the 1980s.
After a decade of the upswing that brought great prosperity to the Irish people, Tristesse is spreading again.
The economic crisis is particularly worrying about the young, well-trained Irish, for whom it has only been uphill so far.
Job loss and social decline seemed absurd in the boom years.
Everyone was used, there was money in abundance.
In the meantime, however, three out of ten women and men under thirty are unemployed.
In the Irish Times there are a lot of letters from readers of young immigrants who complain: "Everything goes down the stream in Ireland."
"There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers - but who can, goes away and our country loses a whole generation."
"The last one will turn off the light, please."
Jura-Studient Leanne Caulfield, President of the Irish Student Union, is looking forward to a gloomy future, because the government is only doing eye wipes and young people no longer have any prospects for the future.
"They reduce minimum wages, but they do not have a strategy for creating new jobs," says the 20-year-old.
She observes her fellow students hanging from an unpaid internship to the next.
Her greatest concern, she says, is to have to emigrate in four years.
"This thought is sad and depressing."
In doing so, men like Stephen McLarnon are trying to occupy the subject positively.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo", a trade fair that provides a round-the-clock service on the subject of working abroad.
"For newcomers, working abroad is a great opportunity to take the first steps on the career ladder," says the manager.
On his website show photos of surfers in Australia and snowboarders in Canada.
The message is clear: working abroad is not a galley service, but also brings freedom and fun.
As it feels to build something else, Seán O'Donovan has known for half a year.
Because there was nothing left to do for the 29-year-old engineer in Ireland, he is now working with 15 Irish colleagues on construction in Germany.
In Gelsenkirchen, they're pulling up a fashion house.
In January we continue to Hanover or Berlin, the next project.
His home now sees O'Donovan only rarely, because he makes extra layers to pay off the credit for his house at home.
"The situation is a bit crazy," he says, as he steps over the threshold of his house for the first time after a long time.
"I make money in Germany for a house in Ireland where I am almost never again."
He laughs a bit and goes through cooled rooms.
The small house stands in a fine residential area with well-kept courtyards, in the entrances parking large, expensive cars.
Together with a sister, O'Donovan bought the house for 380,000 euros for four years ago - 100 percent of the money.
"There were crazy times, there was simple money without many questions," he says.
Is he afraid it might go wrong with the loan?
O'Donovan thinks for a while, pours hot tea, and says, "I don't have children that I have to feed and I'm young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start new."
The construction engineer doesn't like the pain he hears a lot at the moment.
"No one has to starve - our situation is by far not as dramatic as in previous times here on the island," he says.
"Work a while abroad, that's not the worst thing that can happen - maybe this makes us feel like Irish."
He laughs and then tells of his father who went to England in the last major economic crisis.
"After seven years he was back and life continued in Ireland, quite simply."
Cian Tanner likes this idea.
Leave the future open and just look at how things are going with life elsewhere.
A few years of work in London, he has already been behind him, and why should it not be good for him and his girlfriend in New Zealand?
But there is one thing that worries him these days: the celebration of his 27th birthday in Dublin on Friday.
He's afraid it might end up in a good-bye party.
"Just not too many emotions," he says and drinks a large sip of his beer.
"Good luck, that sounds scary."
"Let's call it a walkaway party, quite loose, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games."
The Democrat Routine
The democracy movement in Latin America is becoming stronger, as is the support of private companies.
Crime is a bigger problem than unemployment.
In many parts of the region, the influence of Brazil is greater than that of the United States.
The Latinobarómetro survey, conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively in The Economist, came to this conclusion.
This survey has been conducted regularly since 1995 and shows the change of opinion in this region.
Two facts are particularly evident in this year's September and October survey.
First, the good mood in Latin America
and, secondly, the growing interest in democracy and its most important institutions.
In many countries on the South American Pacific coast, the democratic movement has increased strongly (see Table 1).
In Peru, for example, where the economy has grown by about 6% annually since 2002, the number of democracy supporters rose from 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
This trend can also be seen in Mexico, where the economy has recovered since the sharp collapse last year.
But only half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the most populous countries in the region, are convinced democrats, which reduces the regional average (see Chart 2).
About 44% of respondents said that they are satisfied with the democratic practice of their country. These are as many as last year, but 25% more than in 2001 (Graph 3).
About 34% trust the Congress of their country and 45% trust their government. Both values correspond to those of last year, but show a marked increase compared to 2003 (17% and 24%).
A decade ago, Latin America's economic crises undermined its efforts to increase democracy.
This continued during the global economic crisis, possibly because the countries of Latin America experienced only a short recession and recovered quickly.
In addition, the poor were caught up in a stronger social network.
(According to reports from the UN Economic Commission for Latin America this week, the poverty rate in Latin America rose only slightly in 2009 and fell again by 32% this year.)
However, there are strong mood differences from country to country (see Diagram 4).
Brazil's strong economy and the popularity of outgoing President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva are reflected in a widespread sense of progress.
In Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more noticeable and violent crimes have increased, this is less the case.
Only for the second time since the start of the survey do many respondents in Latin America see a greater problem in crime in their country than in unemployment (see Chart 5).
About 31% say that either they themselves or a family member were victims of a crime last year. However, compared to 38% last year, the values have fallen and thus reach the lowest level since 1995.
The increase in economic performance is reflected in the increased support for the private and market economy: around 71% of respondents across the region indicated that the private economy is indispensable for development, in 2007 it was 56% (see Chart 6).
Approximately 58% said that only the market economy can bring progress to their country, compared to 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of the respondents in Venezuela have maintained this view (and 80% are for a private economy), although their left president, Hugo Chávez, has nationalized many private companies.
According to 19% of respondents (18% last year), Brazil has the highest weight in the region, followed by the United States (9%, unchanged since last year) and Venezuela (9% compared to 11% last year).
On the other hand, the respondents in Mexico and most Central America see the most influential country in the United States, taking over this role in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua from Venezuela.
An Emotional Relax
No one had expected the elections to be perfect in Haiti on November 28.
But the facts far exceeded the fears of the electoral helpers who rushed to help the besieged country.
Overcrowded polls, multiple votes, ballots in Rinenstein, ruined polls and intimidation were only part of the problem.
Election rooms opened with hours of delay.
Many Haitians, many of whom had become homeless by the January earthquake, were wandering around in search of an option.
Some finally gave up completely.
A dozen presidential candidates, including some suspected top riders, demanded the abolition of election results due to alleged fraud.
There were some violent protests throughout the country.
Nevertheless, Edmond Mulet, head of the United Nations Mission in Haiti, called the election "as pretty good in many respects".
According to a cautious statement by observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community, "these irregularities, however serious they may be, do not necessarily invalidate the process."
In other words, the show goes on.
The electoral authority, allegedly obliged to unpopular outgoing President René Préval and his candidate, Jude Célestin, will announce the preliminary results on 7 December.
The expected pick is scheduled for January.
There is still hope in the election.
The two leading opposition candidates, the rap musician Michel Martyly and the former First Lady Mirlande Manigat, have withdrawn their initial appeal for invalidity.
If Jude Célestin, who finds little or no agreement with the voters, declares the electoral hearing the winner of the election, this could lead to problems.
Due to the cholera epidemic and the fact that more than 1 million of the earthquake victims are still living in tents, a small turnout was feared.
On election day, many Haitians were prevented from voting by a lack of organisation.
Shortly before the start of the election, about 250,000 ID cards were not yet issued.
There's a lot at stake.
The donor countries regard a legitimate, recognized government as an important step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
The Haitians themselves are of the same opinion.
Secretly in the middle
In the weeks following the sudden death of your husband, Argentina’s President, Cristina Fernández, experienced a wave of sympathy that pushed her popularity rate up by 20 points to over 50%. This is the highest value since her election in 2007.
However, whether you help this to be a re-election next year depends on whether Cristina Fernández is more compromising than her late husband, her predecessor and political partner Néstor Kirchner.
The signs of this are not clear.
Néstor Kirchner, who also guided economic policy after his wife's election, often drew up budgets that did not fully take account of tax revenue, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the President's couple to spend the extra revenue on their own discretion.
On paper, the Fernández government lost the majority in Congress last year.
But the opposition is divided and Kirchner's death after a heart attack on October 27 led to further destruction.
Some regime critics from the ranks of the ruling peronists stood behind Cristina Fernández.
However, after chaotic meetings (in which one parliamentarian slapped another in the face and others accused the government of bribery), Congress failed to approve the 2011 budget.
"I will not discuss this," said the President.
The 2010 budget now also applies to the next year, which means that the President has even more opportunity to spend money on his own discretion.
The economy is running hot: it is likely to grow by up to 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is now 11.1%, but numerous private estimates - and wage demands of the trade unions - drive the figure to almost 30%.
Kirchner, who took over the office in 2003, when Argentina was shaken by economic crises, declared growth and poverty reduction its main objectives, not the reduction in inflation.
He refused to cooperate with the IMF, harassed the private sector, and cleaned the National Institute of Statistics and Census INDEC, which was the result of official inflation statistics.
Can Fernández take a more moderate course now?
She called on the private sector and the trade union leaders to talk.
According to official statements, wage increases will be limited to 18% next year.
The high world market prices for Argentina's agricultural products have given the economy a strong boost.
Inflation, however, undermined growth by a large devaluation in 2002.
For this reason, Cristina Fernández may wish to join the rest of the world financially again in Argentina.
At the beginning of this year, the government reached an agreement with securities holders who had refused the country's previous re-indebtedness in 2001.
Now, Fernández seems to be pushing for an agreement with the investors from the Paris Club that she owes about $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners had always rejected a review by the IMF, as elsewhere.
But last month, Minister of Economic Affairs Amado Boudou announced that the fund will provide "technical support" for the creation of a new national consumer price index, which would appear to be the first step towards cleaning up the INDEC.
It is not known whether Fernández will be politically active after the end of his term of office even without the support of her husband.
If so, it needs the support of the middle class, which has largely enough of Kirchnerism.
When the Argentines return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy brought to her will be lost.
If she wants to win another election, she has to decide whether to silence and silence many of her husband's political decisions.
Weak applause for China
Taiwan's voters are slowly approaching a closer link to the mainland.
What does Taiwan think of his big brother beyond the straits of the sea?
On November 27, more than 7.5 million voters were elected, which is 70% of all voters, to elect mayors and city councillors in the five districts. This is considered to be a broad rating of President Ma Ying-jeou.
Through the establishment of groundbreaking business relations, including a partial free trade agreement, Ma herself is a symbol of relations with the mainland. His policy has changed the relationship with the Chinese mother country for the first time since 1949.
Ma passed the test, but only barely.
Although his Kuomintang party (KMT) represents three of the five mayors, she did not receive a majority of votes.
Instead, the Democratic Progress Party (DPP), which supports Taiwan's greater independence, received almost 50% of the votes that KMT received 45%.
In a presidential election, this would have meant problems for Ma.
Since his election two years ago, the proportion of his party's votes has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP even moved into the city hall together with the KMT.
During the election, there were common incidents in Taiwan such as truck convoys with crashmakers, flag-swimming mass moves and only poorly dressed dancers.
There was even the mandatory, mysterious attempted murder.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan and honorary chairman of the KMT, gave a speech on a KMT candidate on the eve of the election,
When a man shot in his face out of the crowd, Lien was wounded, and a stranger was killed.
Bizarre referees are not clear whether the shooter wanted to kill Lien or settle a dispute with the candidate.
Regardless of this, the attack, according to Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the DPP, has affected the election and has brought the DPP into a bad light, which has resulted in more voices from the KMT.
China may have been the biggest winner of the campaign.
Remarkably, relations with the mainland were not discussed.
Instead, the candidates debated plans for social housing and job creation.
The Taiwanese love their actual independence and reject China's military threat.
For this reason, the KMT does not like to put its relations with the government in Beijing in the foreground.
But this time the DPP also avoided to excite the anti-Chinese feelings too much.
She responded to the new awareness that Taiwan's economy cannot survive without China.
Ma, for its part, wishes to confirm that the majority of Taiwanese people are in favour of China's policy.
The Beijing Government will continue to pursue its strategy of attracting Taiwan back to the Community with economic incentives.
China immediately sent a negotiator to Taipei to prepare a summit on investment security and medical cooperation.
Certainly it also wants political integration, but the most important thing first.
It would rather wait until after the 2012 presidential elections.
The DPP has now reinvented itself.
Two years ago she was severely weakened: the former party leader Chen Shui-bian was in prison for corruption.
During his presidency from 2000 to 2008, he stood for absolute independence.
But under Tais Regentship, a new generation of moderate politicians developed and the DPP fought for the voices of the professionals and the youth.
Tsai, as a presidential candidate for the DPP, was very much in agreement, such as Su Tseng-chang under Chen.
Her party is now doing everything in its power to show that she too is able to develop close relations with Beijing.
Tsai plans an idea forging as a point of contact between the DPP and China. However, this presupposes non-judgmental discussions.
Tsai publicly stated that their party offered a "reliable alternative" to a speedy rapprochement with China.
Chen seems very upset about this change.
From his cell he explained that the candidates of the DPP had done better to insist on Taiwan's independence.
He even urged Pragmatist Su to abandon the presidential candidate.
Even without Chen's involvement, the DPP makes it difficult to choose its potential candidates.
The KMT will have to undergo its own self-analysis.
But values are bad, despite rapid economic growth; the KMT candidates wanted to run their election campaign without him.
The main reasons for his unpopularity seem to be unemployment and the ever-increasing scruples between the poor and the rich.
According to a KMT spokesman, he will reshape his cabinet as well as the local facilities.
The strong appearance of the DPP suggests that Taiwan only has limited support for rapprochement.
At the same time, most Taiwanese people see economic cooperation with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, "there is already no return".
Grammy nominations: The jazz singer Esperanza Spalding was surprisingly awarded in the category Newcomer of the year
When you appear at the request of a president, people will notice.
President Obama himself asked Esperanza Spalding to perform at the 2009 Nobel Prize ceremony. Now the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer was nominated for this year's Grammy in the Newcomer category of the year.
In view of the fact that Spalding has already been a celebrated star in the jazz scene since her album "Esperanza" in 2008, the nomination appears a little unusual. However, it complies with the Grammy rules, according to which an artist may have released at most three albums prior to the release of the album with which he became known to the general public.
Their ambitious 2010 album, "Chamber Music Society", is certainly a step forward. And with its vibrant voice and a good feeling for pop, funk and Latin music, Spalding can be compared calmly with Norah Jones in 2003, whose great success comes next in 2003 as a jazz interpreter in this category of nomination Spalding.
In addition, the album "History" of the Vijay Iyer Trios was nominated in the category Instrumental albums. This favorite of the critics experienced a huge success.
Iyer's competitors include "Moody 4B" by experienced saxophonist James Moody and "Positootly" by keyboard player John Beasley.
Trombone Shorty, a wild favourite from New Orleans and a frequent guest in HBO's "Treme", was awarded in the category Contemporary Jazz, in which otherwise albums by Stanley Clarke, John McLoughlin and Jeff Lorber can be found.
The Secret Societ of the Wild Steampunk Musician Darcy James Argue received well-deserved attention in the category of large group. He thus opposes the Billy Child's Emsemble with his chamber jazz and the adventurous Dave Holland and his octett, whose life ablum "Pathways" is a good example for a bassist as a democratic band leader.
Grammy nominations: Michael Daughterty, Steve Mackey lead in the classic categories
The classic nominations for the 53rd Grammy Award contain a colorful mix of musicians and composers from all over the world.
The list of Michael Dougherty's "Deux Ex Machine" for piano and orchestra with five voices, and Steve Mackey's "Dreamhouse", an eclectic orchestral work, with three voices.
Among the nominees with connections to South California, the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt with his symphony No. 4 "Los Angeles". This piece was commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra and premiered in 2009 at Walt Disney Concert Hall.
The composer Avner Dorman, based in L.A., was also nominated for his mandolin concert.
Classical nominations are divided into 13 categories, from orchestra, opera, choir to solo recordings.
In the category of classic producers, five artists were nominated this year - Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Among the nominated classical albums are Bruckner's Symphony No. 3 and 4 by the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty's "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" played by the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey's "Dreamhouse" by the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati" performed by various artists; and Verdi's "Requiem" by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chor.
In the opera category, mountains were nominated "Lulu vom Orchester des Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasses "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" by Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariahos "L'Amour de Loin" by the German Symphony Orchestra Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin's "The Enchanted Wanderer" by the orchestra and choir of the Mariinsky Theatre; and Arthur Sullivan's "Ivanhoe" by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
As composers, Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machine", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatamente Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer" were nominated for a Grammy.
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 was premiered and recorded at the Disney Hall by the L.A. Philharmonics under the direction of Esa-Pekka Salonen on January 4th.
The 30-minute piece is entitled "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the former oil magnate Mikhail Chodorkowski, who is in prison in Russia.
Dorman's "Mondolin Concerto" received a nomination in the Instrumentalsolo category with orchestra.
The composer from L.A. stated that he wrote the 15-minute piece specifically for the mandolin artist Avi Avital, who performed the concert with the New York Metropolis Ensemble.
"I used sounds from the Middle East and numerous North African sounds and rhythms," said Dorman in a telephone interview.
Conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the orchestra performance category for recording Strawinski's works with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under his leadership.
As instrumental soloists, pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin, organist Paul Jacobs, violinist Julia Fischer and harpinist Sarah Schuster Ericsson were nominated.
This year, only women were nominated as vocal soloists, including Anne Sofie von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Dichtx and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the category Classic Crossover, the Soprano Jessye Norman was nominated for her recording "Roots - My Life, My Song".
Mosque in Temecula wins approval from the Planning Committee
The construction of a mosque in Temecula found the unanimous commitment of the local planning committee after a five-hour, often hot public hearing.
Critics accused the project of promoting both terrorism and traffic congestion.
However, according to a statement from the Commission of Wednesday evening, the new religious centre is in line with local regulations and will become an aesthetic eye-catcher.
"The project is supported by many good people - by Christians, Jews, Bahais, and many others," said Hadi Nael, Chairman of the Islamic Center of Temecula Valley on Thursday morning.
"As an American, it makes me proud."
"It shows that justice reigns."
"There are only a few opponents," he added.
"They're just very loud."
"In this valley, wonderful people live."
The meeting began at 18:00 and the discussions for and against the construction of the center lasted almost until midnight, with the voices on both sides being fairly evenly distributed according to the press enterprise.
The debate was continued on the newspaper's website.
"There is no more America," said a comment.
"It's another planet of monkeys, and the Statue of Liberty is dead in the sand."
"America is over."
Planned Islamic centers have also led to protests in other parts of the country, e.g. near Ground Zero, the scene of the terrorist attacks on New York City on September 11, 2001.
In the Temecula Valley, Imam called Mahmoud Harmush for nonviolence.
His parish with about 135 families has been living peacefully in Riverside County for years. But they wanted a bigger and better place than the camp they rented together with a water filter plant manufacturer.
The new, about 2,300 m2 mosque in the Mediterranean style should have two minarettes and be about 13m tall.
It is to be built on the approximately 17,500 m2 plot on Nicolas Road near the Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still object to the project at the City Council.
Arsenic-resistant microbes could enable new forms of life on Earth or elsewhere
The discovery of a foreign bacterial species that can live on arsenic, among other things, opens up new opportunities for new forms of life on earth and elsewhere.
Although scientists discovered this unusual bacterium here on earth, it is, in their view, a sign that a life is possible even without the elements considered to be necessary to live.
"This organism has two possibilities."
"He needs to grow either phosphorus or arsenic."
"This makes it something very special, although it is almost a kind of 'foreign' life-form," said Paul C.W. Davies of Arizona State University and co-author of the report, which is published on Thursday in the online edition of Science magazine.
So far, six main elements have been considered vital - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulphur.
But as the scientists found out, the bacterium in the California Mono Lake grows even further if it replaces phosphorus with arsenic.
"You wonder what else is possible," said the co-author of the report Ariel D. Anbar from Arizona State University.
The discovery is an important step in the search for extraterrestrial life, as scientists must recognize life and its forms, so Anbar.
The study deals with microbes found on earth.
The announcement of a press conference, in which no details of the discovery were published, gave rise to widespread speculation on the Internet that the report could act on the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
This is not the case.
The discovery "shows that in other planetary systems organisms can initiate biochemical processes with the help of other elements and that the 'standard elements', which we believe are absolutely vital, are not necessarily specified," said Charles Cockell, Professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute of the Open University of Milton Keynes in the United Kingdom.
Coccel was not part of the research team.
"This work is a novel because it shows that in basic biochemical processes and structures one element can be replaced by another," Cockell added.
This discovery was not accidental.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon from NASA's Astrobiological Institute, which led the study, chose the Mono Lake because of its high arsenic content.
Since arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar, they assumed that microbes, which are both exposed, may be able to replace one element by the other.
"The toxicity of the arsenic is mainly based on the fact that it behaves chemically similar to phosphorus."
"This makes it difficult for organisms to distinguish one element from another."
"But the difference is so great that arsenic works differently than phosphorus. It gets into our biochemical system, where it almost all lubricates," explains Anbar.
The researchers exposed the bacterium GFAJ-1 to an increasing arsenic concentration. It adapted and grew.
Although the microbe grows better in phosphorus, but that it can also survive in arsenic shows that an arsenic-based form of life can occur naturally, either on earth or on another planet or moon, on which arsenic occurs more frequently.
According to Jamie S. Foster, professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, the idea that phosphorus can be replaced by arsenic is not new. But so far there has been no working example.
Arsen was more common in the early years of the earth, she says, so science has assumed that early forms of life used it.
"This gives reason to believe that life may have developed differently than in the early age of the earth," says Forster, who was not a member of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research work was supported by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Health Authorities.
Other stolen dogs found in Compton
According to the Los Angeles County Sheriff of Thursday, the remaining two of the four dogs stolen from a Bellflower motel were found.
The four exhibition dogs - two Akitas and two Pembroke Welsh Corgis - disappeared on Tuesday, when unknown people stole the 2006 Chevrolet Express-Van, where the animals were housed in front of a Bellflower Motel 6 at night, according to the government statements.
Two of the dogs were discovered on Wednesday afternoon, and the last two on Wednesday evening, Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
"The good news is: the dogs are well on," says Whitmore.
"They're in good shape."
"They were returned to their rightful owners."
Whitmore did not make any precise information about the location of the dogs yet about the circumstances that led to their discovery.
"The investigation is still ongoing."
"We don't want to say that anymore," explains Whitmore.
"We're tracking some leads."
The dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were not available for information on Thursday.
They received their two dogs on Wednesday afternoon in a district animal shelter in Downey.
Representatives of the sheriff found the vans and the two dogs in different locations in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a 3-year-old male, and Didi, a 10-month-old female - were unharmed according to the official statement.
But Corgis Bunny and Peter, who wanted to introduce Rickard and Peek this week on behalf of their Japanese owners at the competition, were missing until Wednesday evening.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were on this weekend because of the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship in Long Beach in the city because Trace was to take part in the competition.
As Peek of the Times announced on Wednesday, the other dogs should participate in other competitions on the days before the AKC/Eukanuba show.
South California is a stop on the almost one-month tour of the couple from dog show to dog show.
On Monday evening, Peek and Rickard checked in at the motel.
They often stay in motels and park their vans in front of their room windows.
They took three more dogs - a boxer boy, a Parson Russell Terrier and a Brittany - into their motel room.
The thick-covered Akitas and Corgis stayed in the van because it was cooler there.
They left the window wide open so that the dogs had fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported their car stolen at 6:00 on Tuesday.
Peek promised a finder wage to anyone who could give a clue to the Corgis. Microchips were implanted for identification to the animals.
On Thursday, it was not yet clear whether a finder's salary was being paid.
The lion roars again after judicial approval of the MGM restructuring
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, MGM finally got green light for a new start.
On Thursday, a New York bankruptcy judge officiated the "preparation" globe plan to cancel the $5 billion debt and pave the way for new films and television shows for the 86-year-old entertainment company.
According to the statements of Thursday, the plan meets the requirements of the US bankruptcy law, so that the restart of MGM under the direction of Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, the founders of Spyglas Entertainment, is no longer in the way. Barber and Birnbaum will be the main manager of the somewhat leaked studio.
The number of employees is reduced from over 400 to about 320.
For MGM, Chapter 11 does not actually enter into force until JPMorgan Chase has completed a planned $500 million bond to finance the new MGM productions.
At the moment, a consortium of the investment bank, which itself brings in $75 million, heads the company. The financing is due to stand by mid-December.
The restructuring of the studio began in May 2009 with the commission to the investment bank Moelis & Co, the management who fought with interest payments of $300 million per year to help solve their financial problems.
In August, Managing Director Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO of Enron and restructuring expert, who became known for his work at Krispy Kreme Dougnuts.
Moelis & Cooper's efforts to solve MGM's financial problems and pay out more than 140 students from the studio lasted longer than expected.
After months of discussions, the parties decided at the end of 2009 to offer the company for purchase.
But the auction attracted only a few bidders and no one wanted to pay the $2 billion demanded by the creditors.
In the spring of this year everything started from the beginning when the MGM team started the restructuring plan, which was finally signed by the creditors at the end of October after months of debates and internal disputes.
If MGM has officially survived the bankruptcy in the next few weeks, Moelis and Cooper will receive a bonus of several million dollars for their work.
The share for Moelis & Co., which has already received $1.2 million, is $9.5 million.
Cooper, who was paid monthly $375,000 for the management of the company, receives a "success bonus" of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum are planning to resume production at MGM. This year, the studio only released one film and created an annual plan with seven or eight films to come to the cinemas at the beginning of 2012.
They also plan two films after "The Little Hobbit" in co-production with Warner Bros.
The studio needs a separate bond from $265 million to $275 million for its financial share of these two films, which are to be created under the direction of Peter Jackson.
The investor Carl Icahn, who financed about 18% of the MGM loan, tried to merge the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, whose largest shareholder he is.
However, the last negotiations between the two companies did not lead to any results.
Tech Toys keeps your gift budget in balance
This year’s favorite among the gifts is the iPad, possibly followed by a Microsoft Kinect video console. Both players can crack a considerable hole in your gift budget.
An iPad costs as much as five BMX wheels for $99, while the price for a Kinect game is about 10 classic jump ropes or about 48 cans of Play-Doh.
But you can spare your gift budget.
Recently, I was looking for three electronic toys under $80, three national toy dealers - a whale mart, a Toys "R" Us and a BJ's Wholesale Club.
I immediately realized that Moore's law had come into force. This year, the technology toys are more powerful and cost slightly less than last year.
And although less new toys with their own website appear, there is a wider range of the most famous of these types, Webkinz and Club Penguin.
There are more and more button cells-powered toys on the market, and many contain rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(If not otherwise specified, all prices of Toys "R" Us.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, for children from 3 years of age) are plush characters, as big as sea pigs who sing a note when pressed on their belly.
Press once corresponds to a note, by pressing several times you can play a song.
Several sing-a-ma-jigs sing in harmony.
Warning: Once you start with the push, you can't stop.
For a combination of sand and dance, the Dance Star Mickey (fisher price $60, for children from 2) is the best choice.
Based on the Elmo Live technology developed last year, the animatronic doll offers interplays like 'Simon says', and thanks to its innovative hinged feet with wheel-blocking, it dominates the Moon walk.
Children who tested the device use Mickey as a dance teacher. However, their parents complain about the lack of volume control.
If you are a child of the '80s, remember Alphie, one of the first computerized learning toys.
Now he's back (Hasbro/Playschool, $40, for children from 3), with a whole bunch of questionnaires that can make a drive a lesson, with a betterwiss with auto correction function as a teacher.
If you don't want to trust your child's smartphone, here are three independent alternatives.
MobiGo by VTech ($60 for children from 3 to 8) is the cheapest and most user-friendly solution, equipped with a qwerty keyboard. However, the games included on it are not as instructive as those on Leapster Explorer ($70, for children from 3 to 12), which, according to Leapfrog’s first major revision of the Leapster series, is equipped with a new, brighter screen.
None of the versions are compatible with older cassettes.
iXL from Fisher-Price ($90 for children from 3 to 7) uses a system similar to iTunes for games and eBooks, and thanks to the SD card drive, family photos can also be viewed on it.
Finally, there is Scrabble Flash ($30 from Hasbro, for children from 8). The five blocks are no larger than a string box and have their own LED screen.
The game is about putting the blocks together into words before the time runs out. It is great for an improvised spell competition.
More and more toys have a kind of online connection.
When you go to the toy shops alone, Webkinz and Club Penguin are the most important ones.
To give your child an online animal in the Club Penguin, for example, you can buy a Disney Club Penguin 2' Mix 'N Match Figure Pack ($5 for children from 6 to 12) that contains a coin with a secret code.
When you enter the code online, your child will receive enough credits for two more parts at the Penguin Store Club.
These can be roller skates or a puffy stuffed animal.
The latest head cell-powered microrobot, Hexbug Nano ($10 for children from 5) is no larger than the head of your toothbrush.
The beetle moves quickly to 12 vibrating silicone legs in any direction.
It's fun to send him through a maze of claws.
And he's holding out a lot.
Ours fell from the kitchen table and even survived some time in the mouth of our dog.
Police operations in China are getting softer
As a training officer, Tang Shenbin stepped over a city square, checked his nervous subordinates and gave orders with military authority and subdued voice.
He wanted his female members of the Chengguan - China's robust guards of the urban order, feared and despised for their arbitrary razzies and their hang on violence - to impress the spectators.
"Just stand!"
"Look straight!"
"Show them," he whispered to them, "how pretty girls are!"
Four girls, hardly growing up as a teenager, with white gloves and identical olive green jackets and pants stood tight.
Four pairs of black pumps stood in straight line.
Four neat hats sat perfectly on the hair held with blue-white striped loops.
"For me, they look on average," says Mr. Tang.
"Models are pretty."
Several governments have already tried to polish the image of China's city inspectors.
In one city, all new applicants must have a university degree.
The province of Guangdong introduced a bright blue uniform instead of the greyish greens.
Wuhan in Central China replaced violence with low-stars: according to reports in 2009, 50 officials circled an improperly installed snack car and stared at the operator until he packed up after half an hour and left the place.
Xindu, a district of Chengdu with 680,000 inhabitants, wants to fundamentally change the image.
Since 2003, 13 women have been strengthening the urban police lanes. They have been selected specifically because of their appearance, good character and their youth.
They're supposed to give the gross police a softer, feminine aspect.
But unfortunately, Scarlett Johansson would hardly succeed in improving the poor image that the Chinese have of these City Commands.
That's right, the critics say.
Unlike the police, these officials may enforce urban laws only by means of fines or other administrative penalties.
However, Chinese media routinely show a different picture.
In January 2008, officials in Hubei Province beat a spectator to death when he filmed her with his cell phone as they put down a protest against a garbage dump.
Last year, a training manual of Beijing officials was stolen and published on the Internet, describing how criminals can be beaten without bloodshed.
This year a Shanghai watermelon dealer suffered from a handful of five officials brain injuries.
A violent video game that can be downloaded from the Internet shows trained officials in China in an attack on street traffickers.
"Chengguan scares the government," stated the national newspaper China Daily last year, after further controversy about the tactics.
The newspaper demanded a "real thorough cleaning".
Skeptics consider the current approach to be clearly inadequate.
When the district was looking for eight female recruits by display in October, an editorial in Beijing Evening News asked whether women should have real tasks or only serve as optical distractions.
Probably both.
According to the job report, women aged 18 to 22 were sought with good figure and "harmonic facial features".
They should be above average - over 1.5m or 5 feet, 2 1/2 inches.
The employment relationship ends with the age of 26.
According to the officials, the activity for women over 25 is too strenuous.
"The most important thing is her image," stated an uninvited district official at the Rednet.com government website.
"Whether the candidates get the job depends first on their external appearance, such as size, weight, facial features, etc."
Then come temperament and "inner qualities".
"Women chengguan are like flower vases," he said, adding, "but beyond that they have other duties."
Zheng Lihua, Deputy Head of the District City Council, does not wish to concur with this description,
but admitted that in China sizes in job advertisements for both sexes are not uncommon.
The same applies to even facial features.
Whether this is like good looks is controversial in China.
But people with disabilities or physical disorders do not have to apply.
"Unfortunately, we can't use lambs or humpbacks here," says Mr. Zheng.
"Your image wouldn't be good."
Liu Yi, who patrols on the Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22, has apple pies and a well-shaped mouth.
She didn't feel like a sexist, so much importance is placed on her appearance.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asks with ironic glance.
Your colleague with the dimples, 21-year-old Xu Yang, commented, "We have the task of representing the image of the city."
According to their information, they do not regret the short-term attitude, as they have more ambitious career plans than simply scare traders through the streets to prevent them from doing business.
Every morning, the strip deals with about twelve street traffickers who try to sell as many sandwiches and tofu dishes as possible on foot or on the bike before they are hunted off.
"Mr. Wang, please get out of here."
"We have told you so many times!" explains Ms. Xu to a dealer who had fled on foot and had temporarily left his pasta kitchen attached to a bicycle cart.
According to the officials, the activity is rather monotonous than strenuous.
"It's almost every day the same," explains Huang Jing, 20 who is studying distribution in leisure time.
"Everything routine."
One reason for this is that the female officials must not confiscate the goods of the merchants, such as their male colleagues.
They can only threaten criminals to report them to their male superiors.
This is to protect them from public adversities to which officials in China are often exposed.
This year, hundreds of Kunming's inhabitants, the capital of Yunnan Province, ransacked after the rumor that Chengguan officials had killed a dealer.
More than a dozen policemen and Chenguan officers were injured in the night incident, 14 government vehicles were thrown down or set on fire.
So far, Xindu has been spared such violence.
But unrest is not to be ruled out.
Only two blocks away from the quiet Baonguang Square, where the female officials patrolled this morning, over 50 people gathered at a street corner.
Officials had confiscated a motorcycle which was repaired in contravention of the rules on the sidewalk instead of in a workshop.
The owner shouted Zeter and Mordio.
After 15 minutes of hesitancy, the officials made their way to their vehicles with a gruesome face and continued with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator of the male strip, remained behind, turning his white nameplate to remain anonymous.
Like her colleagues, the coordinators - men over 40 - play a purely supportive role.
But they were not trained to present a clean image.
"Sometimes we take verbal action."
"Sometimes but also physically," explains Mr. Li soberly.

Prosecutor won't sue Senator Ensign.
Senator John Ensign was acquitted by the accusations made against him after his affair with a former electoral assistant and his attempt to provide her husband with lobbying, the senator's lawyers announced on Wednesday.
This decision ended the most serious legal charge against Senator Ensign, Republican from Nevada. Until the scandal, which provided headlines nationwide and put a damper on his career, he was considered a possible presidential candidate of the Republicans for 2012.
As Senator Ensign's office announced, he was "very pleased" about the verdict after the one-year investigation.
However, the Senate Ethics Committee could still impose a disciplinary penalty.
According to Ensign's lawyers, they were informed by the Ministry of Justice that the investigations against Senator Ensign had been stopped and that there were no further allegations in this matter.
The Ministry of Justice did not want to comment on the case.
The verdict was a surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Ministry of Justice. In your opinion, there was sufficient evidence that Ensign had disregarded the lobbying ban.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents that were first published in the New York Times in October 2009 gave rise to the suspicion that Ensign Douglas Hampton, one of his election helpers, helped to buy lucrative orders to keep his mouth shut about an affair with Hampton's wife Cynthia.
Cynthia Hampton worked as treasurer during an election campaign for Ensign.
Ensign contacted some political friends to get Hampton to work. According to the documents and interrogations, he took over for them after Hampton’s lobbying position.
As Hampton was recently on Ensign's election team, he was not allowed to do lobbying for his former employer or the entire Senate for a year.
According to Ethics experts, the unusual agreement between Ensign and Hampton, who were close friends before the affair, violates the so-called ban on the door-to-door lobby.
According to the published evidence, "it seems to be all about an agreement and the violation of the turn-door states," says Stanley Brand, a Washington attorney who specializes in defending clients in government.
While the Ministry of Justice officially refused to disclose the reasons for the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other Ethikanwälter said that the Ministry seemed very cautious in taking political accusations after a variety of defeats that were followed with great interest by the media, including the decision last year to drop the charge against the former Senator Ted Stevens for misconduct on the part of the prosecutor.
Public prosecutors "are obviously terrible," said Melanie Sloan, president of the Association "Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington" (an organization whose aim is to combat corruption in the U.S. parliamentary and government circles), a group of lawyers who brought various charges against Mr. Ensign to trial.
"This means, in principle, that senior government officials can now assume that the laws do not apply to them," she added.
Paul Coggins, Chief Defender of Mr. Ensign, said in an interview that on Monday he received a phone call from a prosecutor and another day in which he was informed that the ministry would not bring any complaints against his clients.
Mr. Ensign's defenseman had cooperated with the prosecutors to convince them that, as his office repeated in a statement on Wednesday, the senator had "acted in accordance with the law".
Mr. Coggins refused to explain more precisely the legal arguments he had made to the prosecutors.
"I'm not well enough to go into the details of the conversation between the Ministry of Justice and me. Only so much is said: We believe that we have made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Electoral Commission decided to terminate the investigation for a separate lawsuit by the Ethics Group, after which a payment of $96,000 from Mr. Ensign's parents to the Hamptons had violated the Federal Electoral Act.
The Electoral Commission said that there had not been enough evidence that the money had been something other than a gift.
NV Energy, a large company in Nevada that long supported the senator, was one of the companies in which Mr. Hampton found work thanks to the help of Mr. Ensign lobbyists.
An e-mail from December 2008 shows that after Mr. Hampton's release as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensing's Chief of Staff, John Lopez, had an interview with Mr. Hampton, in which he informed him that he was "knocking" at the Ministry of the Interior for one thing.
Mr. Ensign was also meeting with Mr. Hampton and another customer from Nevada, Allegiant Air, for lunch and asked the Minister of Transport to arrange a meeting on behalf of the airline after he had stopped Mr. Hampton for lobbying.
Mr. Ensign apologized to his constituents and gave up his position in the Senate, where he had ranked fourth in the rank of Republicans.
After he hadn't noticed for many months, Mr. Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he was aiming for a third term in the Senate.
In the announcement that Mr. Ensign is no longer the target of police investigation, his press spokesperson, Jennifer Cooper, said the Senator hopes that the Ethics Commission will very quickly follow the example of the Ministry of Justice and stop its investigations.
"Senator Ensign is looking forward to continuing his hard work in the service of the people in Nevada," she said.
Cheshire's vocation draws attention to Twitter
Half a dozen of them took off in the riots in the courtroom.
In minutes, they sent their reports about cruel testimony on Twitter.
At the end, the defense said, there were more than 140,000 Twitter messages about the rape trial and children chained to beds in a house that went up in flames.
On Thursday, Steven J. Hayes, who was accused of killing three members of a family from Cheshire, Connecticut, will find an official end when the judge's verdict on the death sentence of the jury falls.
However, Mr. Haye's lawyers have already filed applications with the court which explain the reasons for an appeal and which the courts will employ for years.
One of the most provocative reasons is that due to the intensive reporting on the process - including the extensive use of Twitter by average reporters - it has come to a "circus atmosphere" and a so widespread, immediate penetration of stirrer details, so that the jury has been unduly influenced by public disillusionment.
This opposition could lead the appeal courts to consider whether the new technologies would require new rules in the courtroom.
"As I have experienced during this process, I believe that it is really a danger if the entry of new technologies into the courtroom affects the right of each individual to a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullman, Mr. Hayes Chief Defender.
The presiding judge, Jon C. Blue of the Supreme Court last week, rejected the applications by decision briefly and succinctly when he said that the new media would be "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury had been driven by passion.
But that certainly was not the last word in this matter.
For decades, court appeals have found that reporting on famous and notorious cases raises doubts about the fairness of a trial.
In his historic decision of 1966, the Supreme Court of the United States reversed the judgment against Dr. Sam Sheppard, an osteopath from Cleveland, who allegedly killed his wife, and stated in his decision that there had been a "carnival atmosphere in the courtroom" because of the new media.
Some people believe that the TV series and the feature film "On the Run" are based on this crime.
Some lawyers say that court appeals, which Mr. Haye's convictions look at half a century later, could follow the argument that new rules have become necessary to regulate the channels of communication from the courtroom, which were still unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard's fall.
"There is a good reason to be concerned about the influence of the new media in processes that are being persecuted by a broad public," said John J. Donohue III, Professor at Stanford Law School, who investigated the death penalty in Connecticut. According to his report, it is arbitrarily imposed.
Professor Donohue said that some appetizers might be fascinated by the idea that limiting immediate communication from the courtroom could make the trials fairer.
The Twitter issue is just one of many who explain the lawyers of Mr. Hayes to discuss for years and thus delay a conviction.
The defenders also claim, for example, that Mr. Hayes may have already been prejudiced when Judge Blue did not allow them to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them cruel crime photos during the selection of jurors.
Some of the jurors have said that photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48 years old, and their tutor, Hayley, 17 years old, and Michaela, 11 years old, would have filled them with disgust.
The defenders say that they would also question the constitutionality of the death penalty constitution, arguing that the judge wrongly exchanged a jury who had been a critic of the prosecution, and that he had put undue pressure on the verdict when he had made the unusual decision to release the jury over the weekend.
The jurors were not isolated.
However, their arguments about the influence of detailed reporting on the process may attract the greatest interest.
In an appeal they filed last month, they found that the case had dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed by the candidates during the election campaign for the office of governor and for the American Senate.
They argued that the new media had continuously rekindled the flames of emotions over the case.
"This kind of day-to-day crowding of media pipsers, cameras and reporters outside the courtroom," the lawyers wrote, "you haven't experienced before in New Haven and perhaps even nationwide."
Their focus on Twitter reporting is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists said that the claim that these direct news is more eloquent than reports that are being reported more slowly is an anti-technic view that makes reporting on future processes less difficult.
However, some lawyers said that the appeal courts were often confronted with the argument that social and technical changes needed adaptation by the courts.
Mr. Hayer's lawyers are reinforcing this claim.
In her opposition, she referred to the decision of the Supreme Court of 1966, in which Dr. Sheppard's conviction was lifted on the basis of the reporting and made it clear that the New Media require new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "represents Sheppard against Maxwell of the 21st century."
Can courtesy connect the separation?
After a campaign of abusive words and negativity, little courtesy broke out in Washington this week.
Is it the omen of a real two-party cooperation or a moment of illusion before returning quickly to the struggle of the parties in the capital?
The meeting on Tuesday between President Obama and the summit leaders did not bring about a breakthrough in the major issues to be addressed during the so-called "lame duck session", the meeting at the end of a period of government in which no more decisions are taken.
After all that one hears, it was not a polite discussion between two different sides nor a consideration of their shared responsibility to govern, but rather an empty episode of a party collecting points.
The President's public meeting on Wednesday was also civilised, despite the political differences that continue to exist between the members.
It seems clear that a close interaction over a period of months creates mutual respect that obscures the ideological divide that continues to separate the members.
This is hardly enough to claim that it was a new era of cooperation.
Both sides are now in a test phase - in which one of the other signs of cooperation and compromise is called for, while one tries to weigh the limits of public opinion and the patience of the voters after a renewed party warfare.
Therefore, the meeting on Tuesday itself and its assessment by the participants were limited to a minimum of claims or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too great and too deep to expect a rapid change in the atmosphere that prevailed over the past two years.
Whether it's about taxes, donations, health or servitude, the two sides are miles apart.
Last but not least, Washington's November election was mild for at least a short time.
"No question, the tone has changed," said Pete Wehner, an official representative of the Bush government who is now working for the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
"This is inevitable after elections.
Elections bring about partial passions that die again.
And that's good."
On some issues, especially those on the agenda of the "lame duck session", Republicans and Democrats hardly have a choice but to find a solution."
Bush's tax cuts end at the end of the year, and no one supports that.
Both sides want to find a way to get some or all, whether temporary or permanent.
Similarly, a compromise is to be expected on the increase in unemployment benefits, although only because the Republicans cannot afford to believe that the favored tax cuts for the rich, while they refuse to support unemployed workers.
After the meeting on Tuesday in the White House, optimism has increased that one can agree on these issues during the "lame duck session" and at the same time also ratify the New START contract.
However, William Glaston of the Brooking Insitution warns that successful cooperation on urgent issues of the lame Duck session" does not have to lead to permanent cooperation of the parties when the new 112th Congress is convened in January.
Instead, he says, a phase of non-conformity is more likely, perhaps even indispensable.
"After the things that have to be done have been done, this short-term psychology will be confronted," he said.
Wehner is also sceptical - and this scepticism is shared by many - the courtesy leads to true cooperation.
"I see a lot of what's happening from today to 2012, as a forerunner, or shadow boxing, for the main event of 2012," he said.
The reasons for this have much to do with the presentation of the new Republican majority in the White House and with the tea party voters who were useful in their education.
However concerned the Republican leaders may also be that they are poker too high, they know that they must try to keep their promises to reduce government spending and put health reform out of action.
These party lines are already evident in the initial responses to the Commission's recommendations, which include tax reform and the raising of some taxes, as well as the raising of retirement age and the reduction of government expenditure.
The Vice-Presidents Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken over one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and, in their own opinion, have insisted so much on putting the deficit issue on the public agenda that they can no longer be ignored.
But they need 14 of the 18 votes within the Commission to make their plan an official recommendation and they are fighting a lot to get even close to this number.
The largest resistance is found in the elected representatives of the board, as in financial matters, at least today, there is little room for manoeuvre or little sympathy for compromise.
Galston predicts two phases in the fight between the White House and the Republicans in Congress.
The first battle will take place next year in the form of party clashes when Republican Obama challenges with regard to the state budget, the taxes and the health system, then followed by a phase of major two-party cooperation.
What will lead to this change?
Public opinion.
It is proven that, despite the partiality of the current election, the majority of Americans still wish that the two parties work together.
If confrontation leads to a dead end, as it happened in 1995, then both parties must pay careful attention to the public response.
Whoever is sentenced to loss will have to change course and seek compromise.
This may indeed be an optimistic view.
Partyality and polarization are greater today than in the mid-1990s, and they seem to be a greater ideological divide between Obama and the Congress Republicans than they were at the time between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans.
At the same time, the activists of both parties see 2010 as a mere foreplay for a far more far-reaching election in 2012.
In this way, the courtesy shown this week may be welcomed by many Americans.
But on both sides it will take much more effort to find a common denominator on the issues that still separate the two.
Cracked U.S. document portrays Moscow as a port of corruption
The control of the city lies in the hands of the "Kleptocratic" and it passes on to the Kremlin part of the bribery and the protective fee it collects. Thus, in February the American Embassy in Russia reported in a memo.
Both the police and the State Security Service are extorting high levels of protection so that they can keep their expensive standard of living in Moscow, it is said.
They collect money not only from legitimate business but also from organized criminal gangs.
Each layer of bureaucracy - what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called "vertical of authority" - takes its share of the money that the leader goes up.
The memo, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was published on Tuesday by WikiLeaks on his homepage.
The memo is based on sources whose names have been edited.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still Moscow's mayor, and it accuses him of corruption.
He was fired in October by President Dmitry Medvedev, but there is hardly any evidence that he had been cleaned up in the meantime.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a well-known construction company, have repeatedly turned down accusations of corruption for years, and he has won numerous slanderous charges against such accusations.
In September, he told a Russian television station when he was asked for a documentary that suggested that he was corrupt: "It's crazy, it's dirty, it's dirty."
> An incredibly large number of Russians believe that their society is corrupt.
But it is unusual that, as happened in the Ambassador's report, individuals are mentioned, and it is unheard of that being done by a diplomat of a foreign country.
"The direct link between Moscow's government and crime has led some to call them "disturbed" and to conclude that the government acts like a kleptokrat rather than a government," says the memo.
"Criminal elements enjoy a "kryshna" (a term from the world of criminals / the Mafia, which literally means "roof" or protection), which extends through the police, the State Security (FSB), the Service Supervisory Authority (MVD) and the Public Prosecutor's Office as well as through the entire Moscow government bureaucracy.
Experts have discovered a three-layer structure within the criminal world of Moscow.
"Luzhkov is at the top."
"FSB, MVD and the militia are on the second level."
"Recently, the ordinary criminals and the criminal inspectors follow at the lowest level."
"This is an incompetent system in which criminal groups close a gap in some areas because the city does not offer any help."
The report goes on to say that the FSB collects money from the largest companies and that the police arrests small businessmen.
A source, it is said, "declared that Moscow's business owner understands that it is best to get the protection from the MVD and FSB (and not from organized crime) because they have not only more weapons, resources and power than the criminals, but also because they are protected by the law."
"For this reason, the protection from criminal gangs is no longer as much in demand as before."
The memo notes that while collecting the funds is comprehensive, the protection itself is very modest none; even those who pay are sometimes arrested.
Those who do not pay find their business very quickly closed - due to one or the other pretext.
Medvedev has spoken several times about combating corruption, but at the same time has noted that he has made little progress.
The memo of the message contains descriptions of men who go to the Kremlin with suitcases that were probably full of money.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev must rely on the bureaucrats," said Georgy Satarov, director of Indem, a Moscow expert commission, recently in an interview.
"But he's part of this bureaucracy."
"It is not part of the political class because a political class no longer exists in Russia."
Without politicians, without opposition, without separation of powers, he says, corruption is inevitable.
Indem estimates that corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year.
The country ranked number 154 in a recent study on the global perception of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International (countries are listed as "the least corrupt" to "the most corrupt").
The revelation of the memo of the American Embassy, which took place after the Moscow time of late evening, will certainly trigger failures within the Russian government, although, since Luzhkov can be accused of the mistakes of Moscow, it may also be an opportunity for the Kremlin to claim that one solves the problems.
In an interview with Larry King for CNN, Putin claimed that the WikiLeaks documents could be a forgery and responded furiously to the revelation that American diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth is that our interaction is an important factor in internal policy in this country," he said.
"But to be honest, we would not have expected this to happen with such arrogance, with such pressure and in such an unethical way, you know."
Khmer Rouge veterans forced to confront the past
In a poorly lit, concrete classroom with dirty and flaky walls, the director of the Anlong Veng High School reminds the man who built it of the later Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok.
"Everybody here loves Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader and he took care of his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42 years old.
Because of his brutality during the Khmer Rouge rule known as "the butcher", the commander remains popular in this remote former Khmer Rouge-Hochburg in northwest Cambodia, where he built hospitals and bridges, developed the infrastructure and where thousands of former soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the surrender of Khmer Rouge to the government, long-standing supporters are challenged in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local Truth and Reconciliation Forum allowed the victims to have a public confrontation with the people who once supported the regime.
In June, the government distributed a school book that tells the history of Khmer Rouge for the first time to children of former soldiers.
And in July, for the first time, a U.N. and Cambodia Community Tribunal sentenced a former member of the Khmer Rouge when it sentenced the former head of the notorious Tuol Slang Chamber of Torture, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, to 35 years in prison.
With each of these developments the fear grew among Khmer Rouge veterans Alnlong Vengs, making their efforts for reconciliation and reintegration more difficult in Cambodian society.
"There is still rejection and fear in the former Khmer Rouge, but they have no power to do anything," said Chhang Youk, Head of the Documentation Center of Cambodia, an independent organization that is investigating the regime.
"For them, life under Khmer Rouge was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"It divides families itself."
During the Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or died of disease, overwork, or hunger.
When the Vietnamese invaded and the Pol Pot-Ied government crashed in 1979, the remnants of the regime and its military fled to the border of Cambodia to Thailand.
Here they spread unrest until December 1998, when the last movement surrendered.
When Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the guerrilla war from their base in the west of the mountains and jungle of Cambodia, Ta Mok moved to Anlong Veng for the next generation.
But in the mid-1990s, when a UN peace agreement in 1993 led to the country's first democratic elections, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to overrun to government, leading to the capitulations of Ieng Sary 1996 and Nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan 1998.
Pol Pot died in 1998 of a natural death, and Ta Mok, who had not surrendered, was arrested in 1999 by government forces at the Dangrek Mountains.
He died in 2006 in Phnom Penh prison, where he was waiting for his trial.
When their patrons no longer protected them, most former Khmer Rouge fighters fled to the crushing poverty of rural Cambodia and many kept the movement in nostalgic memory.
Even though a few elitist officials of the Khmer Rouge kept their local government posts because they laid down their weapons, the simple soldiers remained poor, uneducated peasants.
"These people have benefited very little from the capitulation," said Sok Leang from the Centre for Justice and Reconciliation, which holds public forums throughout Cambodia, also in Anlong Veng.
"They are anchored in the utopian agrarian ideology of the regime."
"They grew up without any professional knowledge."
Sor Lim, 55 years old, who had joined the Rhmer Rouge in 1974, fought in the jungle to get to Veng before he settled down in 1998 to lead a life as a poor rice farmer.
"Life under Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
"Ta Mok has given everyone something to eat."
"But now life is hard because we have to take care of ourselves."
The current Khmer Rouge Tribunal has also raised concerns here.
At the beginning of next year, the court will try to bring Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife and Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister, to justice.
The order of the court is to condemn the old leaders and those who are primarily responsible for the atrocities, but it is not said whether it will pursue further acts beyond these four cases.
This has contributed little to alleviating the fears in Anlong Veng.
Current media speculations have focused on In Chaem, 64 years old, who had been the district chief in Manteay Meanchey province during the Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she had told the documentation center of Cambodia that she had led the construction of the trapeang thma dam, a project where thousands of forced workers probably died.
On a hot evening in the Chaem from work on the fields came back to her wooden house on a dirty road outside Anlong Veng.
When the sun cast long shadows on the withered grass, the Chaem refused to discuss their past with the Khmer Rouge.
If the court were to charge them, she would refuse to go, she said.
"Cambodia lives in peace and stability," she said.
"If there were no more persecutions, here would be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who fled Khmer Rouge in 1878, has also repeatedly warned that the situation would become uncertain, the court would charge more suspects, although experts and historians discuss this.
"Cambodia has to dig a hole and bury the past," he said.
But the confrontation with the past is what Cambodia needs to do to be able to move forward, said Chhang Youk of the Documentation Center.
"Reconciliation with the Khmer times means bringing together the broken pieces," he said.
"It is our duty to put together these broken parts so that we can understand everything."
The centre created the first school book approved by the government on the Khmer Rouge, the 75-page "History of Democratic Cambodia".
It distributed the book in June in Anlong Veng as an annex to the history book for the High School of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four pages on the Khmer Rouge.
How often in Cambodia the young people in Anlong Veng know little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city's links to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19 years old, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said that the new school book helps students understand an important part of their history.
But his parents responded sceptically when he brought the book home to read it.
"My family rejects many parts of the book and the court," he said.
"They are suspicious because they are not sure how many people are judged by the court."
Such resistance makes the reconciliation process complex and complicated, said Sok Leang.
But the public forums, the school book and the court are gradually gaining influence," he said.
The Khmer Rouge still has a powerful attraction here.
At the top of the Dangrek mountains, a path covered with a rusty sheet roof leads to a rectangle of black soot covered by shrubs overgrown with plastic waste.
Pol Pot's body was burned here after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31 years old, a mobile salesman on the streetside, said she didn't know much about the man who had been burned here.
"But he has a strong spirit and many people here go to him to pray," she said.
It was nuom Sothea's birthday and later on the day she wanted to go to Pol Pot's last resting place, where she will put a bush of ripe bananas - hoping that he will bring her luck.
Belarus agrees not to collect any more weapons-capable uranium
In a surprising victory for President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear material worldwide, the Belarus Government announced on Wednesday that it will no longer collect highly enriched uranium, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was announced in a joint statement following a meeting of Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton with Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov in an additional article of the Security Summit.
The U.S. government had for years tried to convince Belarus not to collect highly enriched uranium and seemed to have reached a barrier last spring.
But official of the U.S. government told the Washington Post that over the past two months, two secret agreements have been reached with Belarus to remove 187 pounds of weapons-capable uranium from a Belarusian research institute.
This prepared the stage for the agreement on Wednesday to remove the rest of the material - according to an official employee who remains anonymous due to the sensitivity of the topic, about 500 pounds.
The agreement appears to be one of the most important results of Obama's "Nuclear Security Summit of 47 Nations" of April, which Belarus had ruled out.
And it was obviously good enough to secure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the next summit in 2012.
"I was really excited about the fact that they wanted a seat in the nuclear safety summit (from 2012)."
"This proves to me that it works," said Ken Luongo, president of the Global Security Partnership, a group to promote nuclear safety.
Clinton called the agreement "a very important, important step" by Belarus.
Obama promised in April 2009 in Prague to secure all nuclear materials within four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries to release their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be the seventh.
A dozen countries did so under the government of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama's nuclear safety summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko declared that the nation will never give up its uranium.
"How to preserve highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilos, which is basic weapon capable, and less enriched uranium," Lukashenko said at that time.
"This is our raw material... we won't make any dirty bombs from it and we won't sell it to anyone."
"We use it exclusively for research purposes, that's all."
However, Belarus approached the United States a few months ago when it showed interest in the meeting of an agreement.
The first call to remove Uranium Belarus in October was particularly complicated because the material was lightly irradiated, say official.
It was loaded into a special train that more than 1,300 miles to a Russian factory for storage and disposal for, say Official.
The second round was decided on Monday and was conducted by plane according to the officials.
The U.S. government pays $14 million for these efforts, while a large part of the money flows into Belarusian research with poorly enriched uranium, which cannot be used for nuclear weapons.
"This was extremely carefully coordinated and coordinated in order to build confidence", which led to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, a representative of the Ministry of Energy, who is working on global hazard reduction.
The James Martin Center for Non-repayable Studies estimates that Belarus had at least 88 pounds of weapons-bearing uranium this year and hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus intends to dissolve its camp by 2012.
Relations between Belarus and the United States were tense for years, mainly because of Lukashenko's harsh disregard for human rights.
But the statement of Wednesday suggests a possible approach.
"Welcomeing the progress of these global security issues, the United States of America and Belarus announce that increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a key issue in improving bilateral relations and is essential to the progress of the country and its citizens," she explains.
No objections from the Spanish government to CIA flights
The Spanish government had no objection to the CIA flights with Taliban and Al-Qaeda prisoners across Spanish territory to Guantánamo, as indicated by a telegram of the U.S. Ambassador in Madrid.
This reflects the documents revealed by Wikileaks and forwarded to the daily newspaper "El País" (by cable). It is added that the former Deputy Head of Government María Teresa Fernández de la Vega called for the Spanish Government to be informed "to demonstrate that foreign aircraft flying over Spain are being properly monitored."
In June 2006, following the publication of a report by the Council of Europe accusing aid of human rights abuses in a dozen countries, including Spain, the former North American ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega spoke.
The Deputy Head of Government admitted that the Council's report had "hit Zapatero in the off-road" and reaffirmed that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
"De la Vega underlined that Spain had no objections to the intelligence flights over Spanish territory."
"They just want to be informed", not to be "unpreparedly surprised", reports Aguirre via cable.
The former Minister of Foreign Affairs, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, also pointed out to the ambassador that the Spanish government "did not want to pay much attention to this matter, although the government had little influence as it was in the hands of the judges."
The prosecutor Vicente González, for his part, gave the message in January 2007 to understand that he would not block the judicial initiative to request the declassification of the documents of the Spanish Intelligence Centre (CNI) and the Minister of Defense on the CIA flights.
"These reports do not contain any stressful or sensitive information," said the ambassador after a conversation with the prosecutor.
Nevertheless, the US was more concerned about the "seeming coordination between the Spanish prosecutor and the German prosecutors" than with the declassified information of the CNI and the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to handle governments discreetly," laments Aguirre.
At a lunch in March 2007, in which the Ambassador of the United States and the Spanish Interior Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba took part, the latter commented that "although the Spanish judges were madly concerned about their independence and were doing what they considered appropriate," he had instructed his employees to "avoid inflating rhetorical comments in order to let the tension go."
The Ambassador also expressed his concern about the PP's approach to this matter.
"Despite its generally pro-American attitude, our experience teaches us that the PP will not doubt that the government of Zapatero will have tolerated or deliberately ignored the actions of the United States, which could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even if these revelations could have a negative effect on the government of the United States."
The child killer confessed that she complained on the Internet about the "happiness" of motherhood.
The young woman spoke of the child when he was already dead and she had a blog: "Terror in a Galician way"
Monanica Juanatey Fernández is on the Internet "Muki".
Under this nickname, which she recites from a small, she keeps in touch with a cousin and at least one friend. Both come from Noia, a village in the province of La Coruña, where she was born.
The communications are from 2008.
To understand this, one must know her love life, which the daily ABC reconstructs on the basis of witness testimony from their family members.
The 30-year-old Galician woman entered into a relationship with Iván Túñez, an industrialist.
She lasted a year.
Shortly after she lost her relationship, it became known that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was from him, but his ex-husband never let him perform a DNA analysis.
Shortly thereafter, she entered into a different relationship.
The chosen one was Alberto, a young man from Lousame, a neighboring community.
She lived with him for a long time.
Cesar lived with them.
When the young woman went to the Balearic Islands to look around on the labour market, the little girl stayed with her partner, who even accompanied her to Palma for a week.
But from the content of their news it can be concluded that their love relationship broke and they separated.
In March 2008 she is alone on Menorca and writes: "Alberto is very peculiar and angry because I came here to work."
"When I told him that, he liked it, but now he realizes of course what it means to be alone with the boy all day long and not to be free, to do and to let what he wants."
Later she mentions a message she just received on her phone: "I want you to come back this month or send me an address to which I can send you the boy."
She complains, "If he doesn't like me leaving the boy with my mother, I'll pick him up when I get back."
In May she says of returning to her village: "This week I go there, but I will only stay there until the 19th because I have to imagine working on the 20th if I don't want to lose them."
She explains that she will take her firstborn with her if everything goes well.
"He will be with the one he must be with, that is, with me. Never in life will I leave him with anyone but my mother", a questionable intention when considering their bad relationship.
In July there is another mail.
When she writes this, it is assumed that the boy who came to the island on the 1st of the month and was allegedly murdered on the 10th is dead.
"On the one hand, César is satisfied, on the other hand, not satisfied."
"On the one hand he is with me and the place likes him a bit, but on the other hand he has to go to school every day."
She's talking about a move to Mallorca.
"There he (the boy) will attend a summer course, so I have less expenses for the nanny."
On the 17th: memories and complaints.
"A giant kiss by César who asks me when you're coming."
"Alberto says he sent me some videos on the e-mail. See, if he wants to, he finds me, that kind of shit."
On the 30th one more: "The boy is fine. He goes to a summer course to learn Catalan."
From Víctor, her current partner, there is one: "He shoots money at me."
On the Internet, in anime and mangablogs, there are messages from her.
She even had her own blog in MySpace, which is now locked up, and in which she called herself "Muki, the jailer."
"Terror a la gallega (title)".
The last man who lived with her, a sworn hunter, explains that he has a conscience bite because he feels guilty.
He can't believe everything happened because she didn't tell him that she was a single mother.
Monanica was transferred from the centre of detention in Menorca to the province prison of Palma yesterday.
The defence attorney, Carlos Maceda, said that she could not recall the course of the matter, "and she had no intention of harming the little one."
Before, however, she had confessed to drowning Cesar in the bathtub and storing his body in a suitcase.
Defense and prosecution requested a psychiatric opinion.
Partido Popular won 4 seats in Congress and PSC lost 9
With the results of 28 November, PP could play a decisive role in the cities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona
After the significant increase in votes and MEPs in the last regional elections, the PP is already focusing its attention on the parliamentary elections - preferably or not - because its expectations are more than positive, because the number of votes that this party reaches in these elections is usually twice as high as those in the elections in Catalonia.
For example, the Catalan People's Party received 610,473 votes in the 2008 parliamentary elections, while this number was only 316,222 in the 2006 regional elections.
On the last Sunday, the PPC won 384,091 votes.
If this rising trend - the result of the redirection of the PSC's voting share and the binding of the PP's electorate - were to continue, PP's analysts predict that the PPC could rise from 8 to 12 congressmen, while CiU 4 (she now has 10) would also win and the PSC would lose at least 9 MEPs (of 25).
These calculations demonstrate the fundamental importance of Catalonia for PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the People's Party, the ERC would lose a Member - currently has three - while the ICV could hold or win one.
However, if the electoral calendar is to be maintained, the next date will fall with the municipal elections in May 2011. Even then the People’s Party (PP) can be the tongue on the scale to put an end to socialist domination, namely in four provincial capitals and by its majority in the Barcelona City Council, one of the city governments with the largest budget: EUR 661 million for 2011.
Both the nationalists and the People's Party agree that the PSC will lose the cities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the socialists neither reach a majority nor resort to their traditional allies (ERC and ICV).
After the Republican debacle, it is not out of the question that this party will lose its representation in the Barcelona Municipal Council, in which it would have to win 5% of the votes.
The PP, on the other hand, recorded an increase in its share of votes in the four provincial capitals and could become a decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced to be able to play the leading role in Tarragona's turn, where they ruled in front of the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros, together with the PP.
En Lérida lies the PP only 500 votes behind the PSC. The mayor, Àngel Ros, maintains good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during the last election campaign they met several times.
Also in other important places, such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus, the People's Party was able to see a significant increase.
PP is currently represented in 34 city administrations in Catalonia and strives to establish lists in as many places as possible.
The Catalan cell gave Al Qaida thousands of passports
In addition to the seven arrests in Barcelona, there were three more in Thailand
The seven police officers of the Barcelona Police Department and the Nigerians formed the jihadist cell controlled by Thailand, the different Al Qaida groups, including the "Movement to Liberation of Tamil Eelam" (LTTE) and "Laschkar e-Taiba" (Let) - the latter was the author of the assassination in Bombay, which in 2008 demanded 106 dead - provided passports.
The Spanish Minister of the Interior attaches great importance to these investigations, which go so far as to ensure that the "operation Kampai" was "weakened" by Al Qaeda's counterfeiting apparatus worldwide and "so that they can act".
The researchers assume that in the two years in which the cell was active in Catalonia, thousands of passports were sent to Thailand, where they were falsified and then sent to the groups of which the criminal galaxy Al Qaida is composed, so that their "combatants" could unpunishedly cross the borders of European and other Western countries.
The found cell is not the only one of the jihadist networks active in Europe, which is why, apart from the Thai investigative bodies, other European police units have contributed to the investigation. It cannot be excluded that there will be similar attacks in the EU over the next few days like those carried out last Tuesday in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were arrested) another was carried out in Thailand, where Pakistani Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt were arrested as well as Thailandi Sirikanlaya Kijbumring.
They had led from Bangkok the cell located in Spain and other European countries.
In particular, the Catalan network - some of which had been destroyed in 2009 - stole passports according to the rules of the so-called "International Islamic Front".
This means that the documents were issued on the names of men aged 25 to 45 and had to be valid for several years; they were not allowed to show visa stamps.
Investigations show that until now no links have been established between the arrests in Catalonia and the attack in Bombay, although the author of this attack was "Laschkar e-Taiba", one of the recipient groups of the passports stolen in Spain and subsequently forged in Thailand.
Nevertheless, it should be recalled that a few days before the attack by Catalonia, several thousand dollars had been sent to a money transfer company that was "invested" in the purchase of prepaid cards for mobile phones, which were later used by the members of the "command" that brought an end to the lives of 106 people.
The police confiscated extensive documentation.
PP requests Mas to postpone the tax agreement
The chairman of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, took the opportunity yesterday to present his terms of service as Prime Minister of the Generalitat, not different from those already presented during the campaign, and to sum up with the priority of economic recovery and the absence of regionalist independence adventures, such as a financial compensation agreement that the regionalist leader wishes to propose at the height of his mandate.
The chairman of the Catalan People's Party certainly turned to Artur Mas, who gave her the 18 MPs she had won last Sunday - a number that is more than sufficient to feel indispensable, for the candidate of the CiU bourgeois-regionalist party is required to have at least one of the opposition parties present in the vote at the beginning of his term of office.
The future alliances that regionalists want to enter into in the next parliamentary elections in Congress depend on a possible duck with the PP. However, the talks that Mas is currently having with the other party leaders revolve around Catalonia.
As far as the party presidents of the PPC are concerned, the PPC demands that, in support of the entry into office, "all discourses relating to the sovereignty and independence of Catalonia" and an agreement on financial compensation between the State and the Autonomous Region, similar to that in the Basque Country, and which the party leader of CiU even wishes to submit to a referendum, be appointed at the back.
Both political leaders are in common that they want to make the structured political apparatus of the regional administration slimmer and abolish the inheritance and gift tax.
The details of the negotiations on the entry of Mas concern the PPC Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who announced a hard opposition - and Joan Herrera (ICV). Today he will meet with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The nursing home confirms that the deaths are not due to "missing measures"
The owners of the Old Home in Olot do not exclude that their caregiver killed over eleven older people
Yesterday, the people in charge of the old care home La Caritat in Olot (Gerona) gave a press conference in which they found out what damage the criminal acts of Joan Vila Dilmés - the nurse who had killed at least eleven old people for whom he was responsible during his work - had done to the institution.
The head of the nursing home, Joan Sala, joined his lawyer, Joan Cañada, in court and announced, "La Caritat wants to accuse the person responsible (of the deaths), but "the law and our liability force us to accept the trial and the civil liability."
The institution must not only accept a social loss of prestige because it had not determined the criminal acts of the caregiver in time, but now also pay a high sum of compensation, calculated by the legal representatives of the family members of the victims.
Joan Vila Dilmé confessed that the first crime dates back to August 2009 and that he has murdered ever since.
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the nursing home - because he suspected that no doctor had personally examined the deceased, but that the formalities were handled by telephone because of their age and diseases.
The leader of La Caritat rejected this point roundly and stated that "definitive measures could not have been the cause of the incidents at any time."
La Caritat's lawyer added that "there were no indications in the dispute of negligent acts of a person other than the accused."
The already baptized as a "Death Angel" confessed 11 murders before yesterday and stated that the first crime was committed on August 29, 2009 and that one and a half months later he murdered the second old lady.
In this case, he killed an overdose of insulin, unlike the first one in which he had given a mixture of various tranquilizers.
The director of La Caritat said that access to the drugs was difficult to control.
The injection of insulin and the sedative cocktail were used by the caregiver in six of nine crimes committed to relieve the patients of their suffering.
But the results of the laboratory investigations will show whether Vila is lying and actually chose a less cruel death for his first victims or whether he burned them out from inside by giving them bleaching liquor, as he confessed to have done to three women, whom he murdered between October 12 and 17.
In La Caritat, there is no belief in the statements of the caretaker, not even in the number of alleged murders that could be more than that. This attitude is justified by the fact that Vila had made very different statements in court and that it makes no sense to change his course after eight successful murders suddenly.
They say that they made themselves available for this reason and to clarify the scope of these incidents to the judiciary.
European Central Bank (ECB) threat shields
Investors responded sharply yesterday to the threat posed by the ECB President Trichet, who warned that "the markets should not underestimate our ability to react."
The euro-periphery countries' risk supplements have increased dramatically and the shares of European banks have increased by more than 5%.
However, we should not underestimate the possibility that the ECB may be fooled and that the euro has hardly added to points that cause concern.
Yesterday's events are typical of an illiquid market which, to the extent that it collapses, recovers, however, as a result of the closure of short and highly speculative positions.
The institutional investor will not lose his fear for a long time.
Today a month ago, the European Central Bank asked us to reverse our liquidity measures, after which the ECB will have to withdraw for the fourth time in two years tomorrow, and probably several times in the future.
The Bundesbank called for the termination of the plan to purchase sovereign debt, as these were ineffective, as well as the abolition of all exceptional temporary liquidity measures. Only one week of permanent access should be maintained.
Following the Irish crisis, we expect the current liquidity measures to be extended "at least until March" and quarterly calls for tenders with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity until at least June.
We also expect the bond purchase program to continue and give a strong signal.
If the created expectations are not met, the excellent reaction of the markets will be thrown back from yesterday and if we insist on taking back our liquidity measures, only God can help us!
As at the ECB meeting in May, when the Bank confirmed that it would not consider buying sovereign debt and then collapse the markets, this story could be repeated tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and perseverant.
In May she showed her teeth and on Wednesday she said that she had already bought a lot, causing a new collapse of the market.
Yesterday, the auction of one-year-old titles in Portugal was quite weak.
Government asset management spent only 500 million to 5.28%, compared with 750 million to 4.81% in the previous auction.
Nevertheless, interest rates in Portugal fell by 30 basis points throughout the curve, reflecting a change in perception of the markets in the words of Trichets.
In Ireland, the debt hole figures were published by Allied and Bank of Ireland.
The sum is estimated at about 10 000 million in the short term and possible another 15 000.
Although Ireland has completely lost its credibility after it failed to recognise the problem of stress tests in July, the figures in the rescue plan are acceptable and help to reduce uncertainty.
However, the government will have to obtain parliamentary approval for its new budget next Tuesday, and as it still does not have sufficient support, Ireland remains a source of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has presented her discourse on the summits of Heads of State and Government on 14 December. There, political unity is needed to show that we play the same score together.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the other countries the ninth symphony of Beethoven.
The President of the Spanish Government presented yesterday the action plan to be adopted by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous regions such as financial institutions, government deficit reduction, liberalisation, privatisation and job creation measures. Measures that sound in the ears of investors such as Vivaldis Four Seasons.
The double effect of Zapatero and Trichet explains why the Spanish stock exchange increased by 4.5 percent, twice as much as the rest of the European stock exchanges.
Compared to February, the reaction of the government and the Spanish central bank was quick and convincing, and we benefit from the surprise effect.
Today there is a major auction of a three-year government bond that will benefit from the Trichet effect. That is why we are relying on a strong demand that will eliminate all doubts about our re-indebtedness.
For Spain, applying for an aid plan would be a self-sacrifice.
We would get liquidity that we do not need. The Treasury has 40 billion euros available, three times as much as in March. The interest rates are extremely expensive and access to the markets would be closed indefinitely.
Nevertheless, our strategy should be consistent with the motto of Caesar's wife: "Now it counts not only being, but also the light."
Only courage, we can do that!
The chairman of the board of directors of Eulen shall, at the request of his children, contest the meeting of the shareholders of Vega Sicilia.
The storm in the open conflict of the Álvarez family, owners of the Eulen and El Enebro societies, does not fade away.
David Álvarez, founder of the company gurppe, will challenge the shareholders' meeting of El Enebro, which will take place at the request of five of his seven children on the 16th, as he considers them "absolutely void". His children will try to obtain a majority to control the administrative bodies of the company - owner of the winery Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Álvarez and his children Jesús David and María José prepare the legal measures for a new judicial chapter in their dispute over the control of one part of the group.
The founder of the largest holding company for business services does not seem to be willing to give up the control of El Enebro’s organs in his dispute.
He was expelled from the Board of Directors by five of his seven children, who were appointed as members of the Board of Directors at the Shareholders' Meeting on 18 January of this year, which has already been registered in the Commercial Register.
The shareholders' meeting of El Enebro, convened for the 16th time by the judge of the Madrid Commercial Court, has triggered a new thunderstorm in the bosom of the Álvarez family.
Calling the judge to convene the assembly is the only legal way to ensure the convening of the assembly.
The last strategy of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta y Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is designed by David Álvarez as a "desperate means of the applicants - his five children - in order to make the meeting of 18 January declared null and void by means of legal intimidation, fraudulent acts and abuse of justice" as official speakers state.
This argument is the basis for the opposition of the assembly in retrospect, in order to declare it "absolutely void".
The same protagonists, who hide in discreet silence, tried unsuccessfully in June to convene a congregation on a judicial basis.
At El Enebro - asset company and holder of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, along with other assets - David Álvarez's seven children control 100 percent of the capital.
In contrast, according to family protocols, the founder of the service group claims the right to use more than 51% of the capital.
This is the actual background of the matter on which the judge has to decide in the hearing to deal with the appeal, for which no date has yet been set.
Red Bull wins in the F1 with a secret weapon from Siemens
The cars are improved with a real-time software.
Since Red Bull entered the world of Formula 1, its history in this exquisite universe of speed has been marked by surprises and successes.
At first, no one paid attention to the rookie and despite his steeply rising career during the last season, at the final spurt last November, all put on the victory of the Ferraris of Fernando Alonso.
Without wanting to reduce the skills of the German pilot and world champion Sebastian Vettel or the power of Renault's engine, the "secret weapon", which the Multi Siemens Red Bull put in the hands, and thus created a winning team, has become a legend.
In fact, it is a powerful software for simulating processes that the German company launched in 2007 for purposes that are not related to car racing.
This software program, known as PLM, was used for the development of assembly chains in factories around the world, energy plants and high-precision instruments.
A true reproduction or simulation of a product or process is intended before it is actually built in order to avoid errors and unnecessary costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of the cameras of Canon, the planes of Sukhoi and the most famous commercial vehicles of Nissan.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of the Siemens industry department, explains that using this software in Formula 1 - Factory Red Bull "in a few hours, almost in real time" can design and implement the changes and improvements found on the race and in the tests.
Russwurm argues that in 1992 ten technicians worked in the racing stations on average, which could introduce no more than three or four improvements in one season.
Red Bull's team employs 180 highly qualified young people today. They carry out analyses and all kinds of changes to the racing car with high-performance computer systems.
The Siemens Manager stated that the PLM software was able to analyse and improve all components of the Red Bull racing cars, except the engine for which Renault alone is responsible.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are being changed.
The changes can be transferred to reality from the virtual reality of the simulator within less than 24 hours thanks to advanced production facilities and high-tech autoclaves.
The only limit set by this crazy technical perfectionism is the 40 million dollars that a Formula 1 team can spend for its races in one season.
Red Bull has built its high-tech factory for the development and production of its racing cars in a place 50 kilometers from London.
These are two buildings in which visits - especially by journalists - are strongly restricted.
Everything that happens there is Top Secret.
The crew includes 580 people, including the two pilots, the world champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
But Red Bull's true Formula 1 hero is undoubtedly the newest world champion Sebastian Vetell.
Behind the enormous technological resources that energy drink manufacturers place in the services of their participation in the racetracks are other protagonists, whose support is invaluable and their reputation is zero.
The head of technology at the plant, Steve Nevey, stressed that five years ago it was possible to say that progress in the field of R&D contributed 50 percent to the victory for racing cars and that the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today the share values have changed, and the technology represents 85 percent of the success, while the contribution of the pilots is estimated to be 15 percent.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel and Webber can never be replaced by EDV, because they are "unpredictable gladiators".
HP will open its own stores with local distributors in two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) opened his first exclusive store in collaboration with his partner Ront Reyes in Barcelona yesterday.
It is the first of twenty-store sales network with 80 to 100 square metres each, which the Multi intends to open in Spain over the next two years.
The company agrees this initiative with the existing 16 multi-brand sales areas, such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The deputy chairman of HP España, Helena Herrero, mentioned the converted store at Gran Vía in Barcelona, property of Pont Reyes, with which HP has been working for thirty years.
The North American Group intends to set up 200 sales outlets in Europe by 2010, including 20 branches in Spain.
The first were inaugurated last week in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia). Barcelona is the third business.
Mr.era did not want to reveal the upcoming openings, but did not exclude that Madrid could be the next destination.
The vice-chairman, who is also head of HP Personal Systems, assured that the philosophy for opening the store is always the same. It is based on a local distributor with experience and industry knowledge.
The North American group advises on this and takes over the exclusive shop equipment (with interactive products to touch). In Europe, all shops will look the same.
HP is also responsible for the training of the shop staff.
Helena Herrero said that it was not a franchise system and pointed out that the exclusive sales outlet network was intended to "optimize customer service and advice for small and micro-enterprises when purchasing and afterwards, and even the packaging."
The Barcelona store has a pioneer pilot program that solves the technical problems of HP devices with warranty.
An online service establishes a connection to the technical centre in Maastricht (Holland).
"This way we can solve problems in ten minutes that sometimes take up to two days."
"This system has been developed especially for small and micro enterprises as well as private customers, because large companies already have their service contracts for technical customer service," said Helena Herroro yesterday.
Sabadell wants to steal his rivals in three years
The managing director of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, is more optimistic than other managers. He believes that 2001 will be a tough year for the banks, but initially rejects a new liquidity crisis and prophesies the end of the debt war.
Nevertheless, it foresees a fall in interest rates which banks are trying to offset with increases in fees and loan prices.
Sabadell expects to capture one million private customers in three years - a subject that still exists.
Sabadell has found the way to make use of the next three years, and thus to survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The Bank will introduce a new three-year roadmap in 2011.
The aim is not only to survive without taking advantage of the public aid from the FROB, but also to increase the market share of one million private customers - 700 000 if you subtract the customers who will lose the bank - that is the big challenge facing this bank, because so far it has paid more attention to its business customers than its private customers.
This year it has received 250 000 private customers and 50 000 companies.
Their market share for private customers is 3.5 percent, while business customers account for more than 10 percent.
Another principle of the 2011-2013 business plan is the increase in productivity, i.e. austerity, cost reduction. The challenges facing the bank will be presented together with the annual financial report.
Only a few banks dare to set and publish targets in these difficult times, as the financial crisis has confused all the banks' plans worldwide.
Sabadell will conclude its Optima roadmap this year, which was initially designed for three years, but as a result of the market situation it was extended by one financial year.
The customers who will leave the savings banks are the main goal of the bank.
At a breakfast organized by APIE, Guardiola stressed, 2011 would be a "difficult" year "with great reach".
The manager assumes that Spain would only be "slow" out of the crisis.
In addition, it would be "very difficult" to create "work" in two or three years - fundamental to the survival of the banks.
Even if it assumes that the war on liabilities - which penalises the interest margins - will fall, the risk supplements that banks and savings banks will have to pay for their issues to obtain liquidity, as compensation for diminishing profit margins, will already be shifted to the price of loans.
"The topics of liquidity and financing are structural in nature and they will exert pressure on the loans."
"We didn't turn the tap away, but the interest differentials are very high," admitted Guardiola.
Banesto already issued the order to its branch network on Thursday to limit the granting of long-term loans and to increase interest differentials (see Cinco Días of 22 and 27 November).
The manager also agreed that the banks were currently pursuing the state of "increase fees", but "within a competitive framework".
Sabadell's roadmap is based on organic growth, even if, as always, the group does not exclude corporate business.
Not for nothing, he assures that in Spain "larger companies are necessary."
"In the coming year everything will change," he assures.
He stressed that the need for capital is currently "enormous" and did not rule out some Spanish financial institutions falling into red numbers.
He believes that the FROB could replace the money market with capitulation increases.
After confirming that Sabadell could also survive a temporary closure of the markets, he undermines the argument of some bankers who are already predicting a new liquidity crisis.
He stressed that nothing could be put into circulation, but unlike the events in June, short-term funding could be obtained through repo transactions and thus the crisis could be halted.
CECA excludes a second wave of mergers of savings banks
The Director-General of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, rejected yesterday the possibility of a wave of mergers of savings banks and stressed the speed with which the industry was restructured.
When the Spanish savings banks' concentration process began, several savings banks did not exist on it at the first phase. They kept up the second round.
On the other hand, the Spanish savings bank association (CECA) director-general, José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured that this second round would not take place.
"I believe that most of the mergers have been completed. The inclusion of Cajasol in the Banca Cívica group cannot be considered as a second round, but rather as adaptations."
"Most of it is completed. It may be that we have thirteen or fourteen instead of seventeen, but all important processes are already completed. They have been controlled by Banco de España, who has strongly supported all processes."
At a breakfast organised by the Association of Managing Directors and Managers of Aragon (ADEA), Olavarrieta explained that the concentration process "has been carried out as quickly as possible and that we must be satisfied with the timely course, which was established in earlier times, not now, within the framework of the business plans with Banco de España", he stressed.
"The transition from 45 savings banks with an average of 28 000 million assets to 17 with 75 500 million each is a historically incomparable process. The number of financial institutions has been reduced by 62 percent and they are now much larger, with which we have fulfilled the Basel agreement," he stressed.
Olavarrieta stated that "there were a number of unanswered opinions about the slowness of the process that revealed unhappiness and insensibility" because "Banco de España urges us to finish by the end of the year."
The Director-General of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured yesterday that Spain had one of the most rigorous financing systems in Europe and "perhaps" the whole world and added that those who doubted it would do so "without deeper knowledge".
The manager noted that in the current economic cycle, we need to "no worries" about the situation of financial institutions and savings banks that have undergone a "very important" concentration process that will be carried out "as quickly as possible".
He also recalled that the Spanish banks had passed the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July.
Zapatero and the red line of Germany
Berlin has opted for the maintenance of the euro, but at the same time has set conditions for the whole of the European Union.
The tensions in the markets have triggered a double response from the government.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has presented new adaptation measures, starting with tax reductions for small and medium-sized enterprises, the regulation of temporary work companies or the abolition of the EUR 426 support for unemployed people who do not receive unemployment benefit, until the privatisation of 49 per cent of AENA, the management of Barajas and El Prat airports and 30 per cent of the state lottery.
On the other hand, the Deputy Head of Government, Elena Salgado, with the help of former President Felipe González, supports the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel as responsible for the current crisis.
How are these processes to be understood?
It should be anticipated that Merkel's position is not an error in her public relations work.
On the contrary, it is a new round in the difficult process of redefining the euro.
Germany takes on a fundamentally new perspective on the design of our future, which conflicts with the maintenance of the traditions of a large part of its partners.
In view of the resistance in Europe, three possible ways out of the crisis are beginning to speculate in Germany.
The first: a strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the south would have to leave the euro area.
The second: The reintroduction of the German Mark - although it currently sounds more like Science Fiction - is supported by a majority of the public opinion, about 50 percent of the population.
The third: a redesign of the euro according to German proposals. This means: more macro-economic control; strict budgetary management; punishment of countries that violate the rules; possibly the suspension of payments by some countries and the extension of the costs of potential adjustment measures to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has stood out for some time. Therefore, there are no excuses now.
First in 2009, both the IMF and the European Commission created incentives for deficits and the German government withdrew from the constitutional reform to prevent this from 2016.
This was the first sign of dissociation between what Germany considered necessary (strict tax plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France.
The second sign was the Central European country, when Merkel painfully postponed the decision to rescue Greece.
But the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, both public and public, was absolutely against a rescue from Greece.
Finally, in the last few days of October, Merkel has come out again with a clear position, calling for a reform of the European Union's agreements to enable a country to be rescued while at the same time obliging private lenders to bear some of the costs.
This position was interpreted as anti-European, as it pushed forward the Irish crisis and all the following.
But her proposal, albeit slightly sweetened, has been accepted, and in the coming months we will be participating in the reform of the European Union, which will allow for these measures from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that does not intend to exceed it.
It says to everyone that, even though unpopular measures must be taken now, the old functioning of the euro will no longer exist from this date.
2013 will be the year of birth of a new currency area in which the countries which are opposed will be severely punished, forced to declare themselves insolvent and, in this case, the private sector will have to bear some of the costs.
Germany shows us that we need to take a tough growth rate, with high savings and investment rates, moderation of consumption, improvement of productivity and competitiveness, and positive external balances.
The other alternative, which is based on debt and construction with huge holes in the balance of payments, as suggested by Spain in boom times, will simply not be accepted.
The offer is clear.
And we would do badly not to understand it.
It is not just a matter of reducing the government deficit to three percent by 2013.
The demands are much harder.
And the worst thing we could do under these conditions is cheat on ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will pass into more tranquility.
And that we will take advantage of the opportunities offered to us by spring 2013.
It seems that Zapatero understood this as well, and his double announcement (the promised reforms after the meeting with the big companies last Saturday and the announcement of new measures from yesterday) indicates that despite the criticism of Merkel the hypothesis of creating order in their own house has prepared their way.
But the red line drawn by Germany is there, and it doesn't look like something would change.
Among the possibilities considered is that we should not exclude the euro area packed with few serious countries.
In this case, Germany could still tell us that it warned us.
Sports and regulatory environment
Tricks like those of Alonso and Ramos in the game against the Ajax show ingenuity, but not the will to avoid a penalty.
The exclusion allegedly raised by two players of the Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the game of 23 November against the Ajax in the Champions League resulted in a lot of ink being poured on whether or not it was an unportable act and whether or not both players should be punished by the UEFA.
As is generally known, the two players lost time a few minutes before playing (their team had already clearly won) and played several fouls so that the referee showed them the second yellow card.
In this way, and since Real Madrid would lead its group, the two players will comply with the required penalty at the next match against the Auxerre and thus enter the next game stage without cards.
Finally, the UEFA Disciplinary Committee punished the club's coach, José Mourinho, with two games and the players involved with different amounts of money.
The provocation of a yellow card under such or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is more often found in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos - the unwritten but in this sport - rules.
Part of the debate on the case presented is that a team of the Real Madrid Football Club (who in his anthems pretended to be noble and honoured, and on other occasions punished his players for similar incidents) played the leading role in this, and on the dramatization by Mourinho, who added an episode more to his long history as a theatrical and provocative technician.
In any case, the debate is about whether or not it does not explicitly prohibit the conduct of the statutes from contradicting the principles of sport, that is, whether these actions constitute a circumvention of the rules. In fact, this approach adheres to the statutes of sport, but seems to be circumventing its sense.
On this matter, the damage caused to the sports spirit should be investigated.
The sports spirit defends the physical integrity of the opponents, an aspect that was not compromised by these actions, because it was not an aggressive game.
Another aspect of a clean game is to avoid the opposing players from taking unfair advantage of the opposing team. Nor did that happen.
The paradox of the action of the players of Real Madrid is that it does not correspond to what we usually understand by misappropriation or circumvention of rules, because the circumvention of the rule was not done secretly to avoid a penalty, but it should be as conspicuous as possible so that it is punished by the referee.
The players waited and gladly assumed the penalty.
Another question is what kind of advantage did the offenders draw from the intentional fouls.
Here it should be stressed that the rival was not brought into a more unfavourable position or gained benefits for the game played, because the obvious result of this action was that the own team had to continue playing with fewer players.
It is also not a useful strategy for the next game, because the club then does not have these players.
The advantage obviously is that players will start the next game phase of the Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation in a future game.
But it’s a long-term, up to a certain degree, unknown advantage, since the team could eventually also leave. In addition, the players get a penalty with this procedure and move into the second card cycle, in which they leave with a card less than in the first cycle due to card accumulation.
It is therefore not so clear whether this is really an advantage.
Finally, such practices are not directed against the spirit of sport, which also includes strategic decisions in order to derive the greatest benefit from the rules.
In this case, the players did not want to circumvent sanctions (that would actually be a clear case of circumvention of rules), they preferred to choose when to submit to them.
They made a strategic decision without evading a punishment or fleeing it.
Although the border between the inventive step and the regulatory environment is blurred, I believe that this is a clear case of inventive step.
I have the impression that the polemics came about as a result of two factors: because it was about two self-exclusions and because of the type of provoked rule transmission.
The damage caused by these actions to the principles of sport is less ethical than rather aesthetic.
Offer offensive for customer catch for group Christmas dinner in Barcelona
This year the dictatorship of the calendar drops an avalanche of reservations to the days 16 and 17 December.
The celebrations paid by employees themselves are spreading. They do not want to spend more than 20 to 30 euros.
Like the Turrón and the Christmas lottery, there are also group dinners in the pre-Christmas season that lead to Barcelona’s catering and leisure industry. But as a result of the economic crisis, they trigger a price offensive to capture also the customer segment, which represents the great mass: almost everyone wants to spend between 20 and 30 euros for lunch or dinner, confirm the entrepreneurs and associations interviewed.
To make accounting a little more complicated, the calendar (silvester falls on a Friday) has dropped all orders into the week of December 13, with the result of an avalanche of dinner reservations to two top players (the 16th and 17th) and almost no orders in the week before.
Since 2008, when bad times began, many companies have stopped the group dinners for household reasons.
In order not to have to abandon this tradition, many workers pay them out of their own pockets.
Whatever the economic situation, low prices are required, the president of the Barcelona restaurant ngremium, Gaietà Farràs, confirms.
The representative of the umbrella association does not dare to predict what the holidays will look like this month.
"People think about it ten times before they book."
"They like to go out, but they pay close attention to the prices," he emphasizes.
The business will go well with those who "offer quality at good prices with a good service", he adds, and calls us to remember that customers save in times of crisis, which is why prices of 25 euros are most in demand.
In a survey in various centrally located restaurants, it turns out that the evening of December 17th, the providers lead to the collapse.
The Soteras Group says that the demand for this Friday with the intention of spending less than 30 euros would boom. The group has adapted its menus with complete offers between 25 and 35 euros to the economic situation.
At another leading group, Andilana, which has 16 restaurants in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of the calendar has led to preferred reservations, even from the beginning of November.
"We have made it impossible to maintain the previous year's prices with menus for every taste from 19.95 to 30 euros," he explains.
At AN Grup, who manages El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 locals, you will not lose optimism after the second quarter of the year when the revenue has blossomed again and good, though focused on a few days for the Christmas business.
Sources of the group emphasise that the 18th will also be an overactive day with groups of friends celebrating Christmas.
To the six group menus, a Christmas menu was added for 30 Euro or more than a price hit. You have the impression that customers are willing to spend 10 percent more than in the previous year and want more details in return, such as Cava.
Also in some companies you see green sprouts sprouting, which is why the employees are invited again. This gives the impression that the group meals are in recovery again.
The Vice-President, Enric Gomà, trusted to see the end of the tunnel (with associations such as the Bar, Restaurant and Leisure Association of Barcelona), and noted that the reservations are quite "living" overall, although the customers "beat out a maximum".
The fun of the celebration, however, did not go down, no matter who pays.
Pakistan's nuclear programme is causing great concern in the USA
Islamabad produces nuclear weapons "faster than any other country".
Disclosures by Wikileaks confirm relations between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the North American Embassy in Pakistan and the U.S. State Department, revealed by the Wikileaks website, confirms the enormous concern of the Pakistani nuclear program Washington.
On the margins of the clarifying and juicy details that the documents on the content of the talks and the thinking of the accredited North American diplomats in Islamabad reveal that the cooperation between the two countries in terms of nuclear security is not strengthened but, on the contrary, "decreases" and that the unstable Asian country produces more atomic weapons "at a faster rate than any other country".
In particular, the peculiarity of the Pakistani nuclear program - that the weapons are not assembled, but their individual parts are stored in order to make their destruction more difficult in a possible attack - prepare Washington sleepless nights.
The Ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, lists the following risks in a report before the visit of the former head of the National Security Council, James Jones: "The proximity of some nuclear facilities to the Taliban-attacked area, the probable distribution of nuclear material and the vulnerability of the transport of nuclear material".
The large number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and rocket programs is no longer considered to be excessive and careful by the United States, but also by Russia.
"Pakistan needs to employ strictly believing personnel to monitor nuclear installations; due to the low level of education and culture, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who are involved in nuclear or missile programmes," said expert Yuri Korolev of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs in a meeting with his North American counterparts.
New on the documentation revealed by Julian Assange's Internet portal is that the cooperation between the US and Pakistan is declining in terms of nuclear proliferation and the increased speed at which Pakistan produces nuclear weapons.
In May, an office of the message describing communication with Pakistan as "frustrating" explains: "There is often no transparency; we do not receive any answers to assistance or they are rejected."
In another communication, Peter Lavoy, State Intelligence Officer for South Asia, confirms that "despite the economic disaster in Pakistan, nuclear weapons are produced as quickly as no other country."
Ambassador Patterson asks Washington during a visit by the chief army leader, General Ashfaq Kayani, to "clarify" the responsible person that "Pakistan's army has ceased its silent support of terrorist groups."
On the hunt for Wikileaks boss
Obama appoints a high level of responsibility for the fight against terrorism to prevent new revelations.
Interpol issued a red warning to persecute and invent Assange.
Everything related to Wikileaks and its founder, Jullian Assange, forms a complicated labyrinth in which the facts can only be easily clarified.
Yesterday Interpol issued a "red warning" for Assange's "invention and persecution".
However, this is not a traditional order for arrest.
Besides, it's not new, it's from November 20th.
It also has nothing to do with the last disclosure of over four million diplomatic documents from the United States, but with the accusations of sexual abuse that the Australian has to make in Sweden.
Furthermore, the lawyer of the founder of Wikileaks, Mark Stephens, assures "the police would know where and how to contact Mr. Assange."
On the 20th, the International Police Authority, based in Lyon, France, issued the order at the request of Sweden, but until yesterday, after the Swedish authorities had obtained the authority, it was not announced.
The 188 Interpol countries are obliged to identify Assange and find out "to arrest and deliver him for the time being."
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red warning, many member states, according to the organisation's statements, consider the red warning as a release for arrest - which must be carried out by the national police - especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case with Sweden and England, where Assange is likely to remain.
Assange's attorney, who yesterday published a letter informing them that the 39-year-old founder of Wikileaks is ready to answer the Swedish authorities' questions via videoconferencing.
They also recall that Assange requested to leave Sweden and was compared with the legendary Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, Security Chief of Stalin, who received the corresponding approval.
"This is like a hunt, not like a legal persecution," is charged in the letter.
While the world is looking for him - and his mother from Australia is charging her son's innocence - Assange is staying in an unknown place, but not silently.
On Monday he gave an interview to the head of Time magazine via Skype from an indefinite place. During the conversation he requested the resignation of the State Secretary, Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be proved that she was responsible for the appointment of North American diplomats to spy on the UN and thus violated international agreements signed by the United States, she would have to resign," he said.
His opinion was condemned yesterday by the White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs, who called the request for resignation "stupid and absurd."
"I'm not sure why we should value the opinion of a type with a website," he told the transmitter CNN.
Obama himself has commissioned a high level of responsibility for the fight against terrorism, Rusell Travers, to prevent new document revelations.
The President Barack Obama's attempt to pay less attention to Assange is contrary to the views expressed by conservative politicians and commentators these days.
Congressman Peter King, who will be chairing the National Security Committee of the House of Representatives from January, has asked the State Department to investigate the possibility of adding Wikileaks to the list of terrorist organisations, "to confiscate their funds and to pursue anyone who supports them or makes a contribution."
Tom Flanagan, adviser to Canadian President Stephen Harper, had gone even further, and he had to revoke his statement that Assange had to be "killed".
"Obama would have to turn him into a target and use an unmanned plane or something."
Those who did not apologize were Mike Huckabee, Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate.
"Whoever let information slip through in the government, he is guilty of betrayal, and everything that is not execution is too mild a punishment," he told the broadcaster Fox.
Puigcercós is looking with an eye wink for the Carod Middle East peace in the ERC
The Republican leader allows the party to hold a secret vote on its continued existence in the office.
Huguet proposes a more pluralist government and the end of the assembly principle.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found a recipe to get out of the directionless ERC for the tenth time in the ranks after the loss of 11 MEPs and half of the voters.
The party president is aware that his resignation threat is not enough for the next-hand party leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira. But he also knows that the influence of this sector is as weakened today as its mentor himself and will not give him the same head fracture as other former currents.
Therefore, the leader of Esquerra tries to win the new critics with an eye wink, which would secure his position up to the next municipal elections.
Yesterday, it was announced that the more than 200 Regional Council members of the ERC could make a secret statement about his stay in office.
With ballots, not with a raised hand.
If the carodists wanted to miss a sentence on the president, they could do so without having to fear reprisals.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid both the impression of division and that of submission among his person.
In several interviews he confirmed that he would feel at home with half of the votes plus one not confirmed, and he added without mentioning percentages, a result "in Bulgarian style" would not be good either.
The Carod neighbors demand more from the president than only the party to make his office available. An insufficient gesture as Puigcercós controls the supreme organ of the congresses.
However, since they do not have a sufficient majority to force withdrawals, they will agree with the Management Board a plan of action from now until May.
To this end, they expect to be able to take part in the preparation of the strategic reorientation document, which will be submitted to the Council for vote on the 18th day of the year.
Their intention is to pay for Puigcercós. In return, he is to promise to present to Congress in autumn 2011, what the party leader already considers to be a fact.
The party president of the ERC believes that the "polyphony" damages stability and he strives once and for all to enable the organization to wash their dirty laundry behind closed doors.
In this sense, the article that the current Conseller Josep Huguet signed in his blog is symptomatic.
Given that Puigcercós is an ideologist, the owner of Innovació considered it to be a fact that the party chairman was supported "in exchange for various goals".
He counted five, two of which are in the foreground.
First, the board's "restructuring" so that this represents at least 90 percent of party members, that is, the inclusion of new faces from Carod's environment.
The second could be the big news.
Huguet suggests that the ERC should finally give up the general assembly principle as a way of functioning.
He is thus fighting for a reform of the statutes, which will enable the congresses to hold with elected delegates.
Puigcercós's team, who fought for it at the last two congresses, is obsessed with the termination of the general assembly model - an exception in the Spanish party system.
In fact, at the 2008 session, the party leadership was instructed to review the general assembly principle at a congress to deal with the reform of the statutes.
This date is still pending, as the internal rest of the past few years was not advisable to approach this matter.
Now, without the critical sector being on the verge, the time could have come to reopen this matter and to close it forever.

China maintains its targets for reducing greenhouse gases
At COP16, China’s representative stated that his country has made enormous efforts to reduce carbon footprints and would maintain its offer to reduce 40 to 45 percent of its greenhouse gases by 2020.
China keeps its offer to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, assures Su Wei, the representative of this country at COP16.
At his first public appearance at the 16th UN Climate Change Summit (COP16), Su Wei assured that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce the carbon footprint and to convert its industry.
He explained that in the last four years his country has invested 245 million dollars to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
On the other hand, he stated that China would not change its objectives but would work together with the international community on this matter.
He stated that the Chinese climate change strategy is divided into four aspects: dialogue, capacity building, institution building and support for pilot programmes.
He said that progress had been made in all aspects, including the adoption of a new energy law last year, which included the objectives of reducing emissions of gases.
On the other hand, he stressed that in China the authorities of the States had cooperated with those of the central state and the municipalities in order to achieve the goals of energy saving, efficient use of energy and reduction of emissions.
In addition, he explained that several multiannual plans have already been launched or concluded, both those funded by the Chinese government and those who received funds from other countries.
For example, he referred to the programme for the effective use of energy introduced in the last five years, which had received investment from the United Nations (UNO), the government and private hands.
He also explained that there is a project on the provincial level on climate change, another on the exchange of traditional light bulbs by energy-saving light bulbs and another on mitigation and adaptation.
Martin Krol, scientific government adviser on climate change in that country, confirmed that China's efforts were far greater than would be expected in general.
He pointed out that per capita greenhouse gas emissions in China are six tonnes per person, while in the United States it is 100 tonnes. China is responsible for a nine percent total contribution to environmental pollution.
Similarly, it makes unprecedented progress in the field of energy use. Energy efficiency has been increased by 20 percent in the last five years and is expected to do so by 2020, he said.
Legal exclusion Espinos: César Nava
The national leader of the PAN stated that the former Panist party president had the right to address the National Order Commission and to demand what the right granted him.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the exclusion of Manuel Espino Barriento had been legal and that the former party president of the PAN had the right to contact the National Order Commission and to ask for the right to do so.
In an interview held before Gabino Cué Monteagudos's appeal as governor of the state, he stated that Espino's exclusion was a decision taken at local level.
"It is an independent decision of the Order Commission in Sonora."
"Mr Espino has the right to contact the Comisión de Orden del Consejo Nacional in his case so that a decision may be taken by a competent body," he added.
On the other hand, he stated that it was not time to think about 2012 and that an alliance with the presidential candidate had never sat at the negotiating table.
Nava Vázquez was convinced that Acción Nacional was strengthened by the internal vote on the next 4th and 5th of December, when his successor was elected.
"This (an alliance in 2012) is a topic that was never on the negotiating table, at least not so far. It was a proposal for the municipal election, it was successful and fulfilled its purpose," he explained.
The Panist leader explained that the PAN looks back on 71 years of dialogue, so "does not frighten us from internal competition; on the contrary, "we enjoy it and it strengthens us," he commented.
He said that the Council would no doubt elect the best chairman or chairman, who would need Acción Nacional for the next three years. Therefore, he would hand over the staff "to those whom the Council would decide."
"I am quite unconcerned and open. I would be proud to assign each of the five to the office of party chairman."
He predicted that the party's boom in the last elections of July 4 would be reflected in the next elections, although "it is not time to think about 2012."
"Now it's about supporting Governor Gabino Cué in his task."
In this context, he stressed that the three governments that emerged from alliances between Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa would carry the flag and be observed throughout the country. Therefore, "many hopes and longings are put in them and I am sure that Gabino is at the level of requirements."
When he was questioned about the PRI's criticism of President Felipe Calderón for his discourse in the framework of his four-year government, César Nava called on the PRI's supporters to reflect on the six-year period of former Presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI believes that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calderón, they should start defending them, they should finally get out of the closet," he reaffirmed.
He believes that the owner of the federal government could express such expressions as those he could make in his discourse in the Auditorio Nacional, because in this country there would be no oral ban and even less censorship.
Obama advocates the law for undocumented students in Twitter
"If you are in favour of the adoption of the Dream Act - the law, then call your senators and press for the adoption of this law," the president of the United States tweeted on the popular social network.
President Barack Obama today supported nationwide mobilization to support the Dream Act - Law on Legalization of Undocumented Students with a message on his personal blog on the social network Twitter.
"If you're in favour of the adoption of the Dream Act Act, then call your senators and press for the adoption of this law," Obama tweeted.
His brief statement contains a cyber link to a more extensive document that calls on the public to come into contact with their senators, as the vote of the law is imminent.
"With your voice we're waiting for, the time has come to listen to you," he emphasizes.
The message was spread after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block all votes for each law except for the extension of tax reductions from the times of Bush and the financing of the government.
Such a blockade, announced on a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote of the Dream Act - law and other projects such as the ratification of the new START agreement with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Commenting on the blockade of Republicans under the Dream Act Act and other projects, President Robert Gibbs said he trusted that once the tax theme was resolved, a timetable could be drawn up for the other projects.
"I think we still have a lot of time..."
"We all agree that the tax matter must be settled by the end of the year..."
"I believe that we can make an agreement on this at any time and then we can plan the course of the rest," he said.
The chairman of the democratic majority in the Senate, Harry Reid, announced on Tuesday that "he would request the vote at the end of the debate" so that the Dream Act - law that would allow the initiative to legalise undocumented students to be voted in the Senate from next Thursday, although the next week would be more likely.
The version of the Dream Act, or the law of the American dream, would legalize about 800,000 young people who immigrated to the United States when they were not yet sixteen years old, while living in that country for the last five years and were enrolled in a higher education institution or army.
But the defenders of the law need sixty votes to adopt the initiative, which is why they depend on the voices of a handful of Republicans. Currently, the organisations of the advocates of this project organize an intense influence on the adoption of the law.
The Democrats, the majority of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, one of them, Senator Ben Nelson from Nebraska, said he would vote against it and only one Republican, Richard Lugar from Indiana, announced his support of the law.
That is why the defenders of the Dream Act must get several Republicans on their side if other democrats are to decide to turn their backs on the initiative.
Most of the Republicans that have been recruited include Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as Senator George Lemieux from Florida, who took over the mandate of Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who in the past supported the Dream Act are Orrin Hatch from Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson from Texas, but they explained that they no longer support it on another occasion.
Another Republican who had voted in favour of the law, John McCain, has not yet established his position.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, the analysts agree that the Dream Act in the Senate faces the biggest obstacles.
Put your finger in the wound with literature
The second round of 'De Lust an der Sprach' was a walk in which the participants made themselves strong for the story
"I understand this with the sex in the language, but... The finger in the wound? What is expected of me?" asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela, who was to open the second round of 'Los places de la lengua', a cycle that celebrated Spanish-speaking literature and used the subtitle of her question on this occasion (at another event, the Round Table was dedicated to sex in the language, she explained).
The finger in the wound... "brings us into trouble," the Argentinean writer sighed at the audience, composed mainly of young people gathered at the International Book Fair in Guadalajara (FIL) to attend this round table, moderated by Marisol Shultz, in which Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero attended.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text she dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio, and then identified the Shultz as a great narrative. Luisa tells in the first person and is the protagonist who is looking to learn what a "wound" is, and goes from doctor to doctor, of whom she does not receive an answer, but guidance for the guide of her story.
She leaves the pathologists convinced: "Perseverance is not my strength, maybe that's my wound."
Finally, after a frustrating rapprochement with the traumatologists who took their breath in the middle of the passage, and who explain to her that wound is not a scientific term, the psychoanalyst reveals the secret: "The wound is really the open one, the symbolic scar."
The main character of the narrative sighs eased and concludes that she "only learned from the wound that it is really open and does not exist". But she is convinced that the desire for the language and its traps mix.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also presented an adorable narrative, which he called 'the praise of invention', and in which the finger in the wound is not mentioned, but discovered.
With allusions to magical realism, he tells of a famous magician who touched the clouds, brought back far-traveled men, or restored the virtue lost by a girl. The story made a turnaround and reported about America, the great novel it did not miss from the beginning to its own chroniclers, and he quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who criticizes the abundance of the stories told by the conquerors.
"Cervantes, who invited us all (the writers), mocked the fake witnesses who appeared in the stories as true, but in other ways the story of America would never have been told - with imagination that even got rid of the feeling of shame."
However, he emphasizes, "it is the crazies and liars who imagine things the best," and where reality and lies approach one another, where one no longer knows which side the narrative belongs to, where fictional literature reaches the summit.
He actually calls it the 'Tradition Cervantes'.
"From him we have inherited to be what is told."
When Mayra Montero was on the row, the writer commented and praised the variety of interpretations to which the FIL's invitation to the Round Table 'The Finger in the Wound' had contributed.
The Cuban and Puerto Rican woman devoted her contribution to the great wound of social violence that affects her country - like all of Latin America - as a result of the fight for drug trafficking.
"I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a silent, not deliberately planned commitment," she explained after stressing that literature is communication and commitment that builds up between the author and the readers as in a "chemical reaction".
In the evening, the Spanish poet Luis García Montero decided, whose contribution was also "the finger of the committed writer in the writer's wound".
He noted that in a fast-paced world the intellectual habits and the control of the consciousness run out on dogmatism, and will forget "that behind every confirmation there is a small no and behind every denial a small yes."
"In order to be in possession of our thoughts and reality, we must nuance: And nuances often mean putting our fingers into the wound and harassing those who feel much more comfortable when they think in the form of caricatures, in black and white, in prefabricated ideas without nuances, and also harass the powerful who prefer to divide the world into black and white, he noticed and invited to rediscover a sense of writing.
Romano fights for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three defeats in finals, he has experienced Aufs and Abs in his career, but three times he played decisive games.
In the duel between Santos Laguna and Monterrey at the end of the game, there are also two different styles, set by their respective trainers, and their opposite encounters are reflected in the results.
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three defeats in finals, he has experienced ups and downs in his career, but he has had crucial games three times, and so far he has kept well, which is why this opportunity is of very special importance to him.
The Argentinian has played with the medal for the second champion, he has stayed one step behind the winners and surprisingly he has played consecutive finals with the same team.
The santist strategist reached the first final game as a coach at the 'Torneo Apertura 2002', when del Morelia had the reins in his hand with which he experienced a big defeat against Toluca with 4-2; later, at the 'Clausura 2003' he reached the decisive duel, which he also lost with 3-1 against Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna on the 'Torneo Bicentenario 2010' in which they played against Los Diablos, Rubén had to put a setback again, as the game ended with 2-2 against Los Choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but at the 11 meter he came forward with 3-1 and got two ways to plug in his title, but finally three of his players missed the eleven steps and the game turned to a 4-3.
Rubén had already lost two endgames with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his great rival. Therefore, he does not want to be persecuted again by the misfortune and free himself from the evil spell in order to be able to celebrate a title for the first time, although he affirms that the most important thing for him is the game itself.
"I want to be a champion, I don't want to break statistics, that's for a club, for my affection that I surrender, and that's why the title will come to me, but what happened before is the most important thing," said the taxman when asked about the lost endgames.
The last final game has remained strong in his memory, he assured him that he learned a lot from it: "The only lesson we can draw from it is that until the referee does not blow the end, we cannot celebrate, we are prepared on the line, the players too, because the last time we were already prepared to leave with two eleven meters, and I believe that this is a lesson until the game is finished, there is no occasion to celebrate."
Knowing that this series could be decided by 11 meter shots doesn't bother him, because he trusts his players: "You never want to arrive at the 11 meter shot, you want to finish in the regular play time, but sometimes there is no alternative and you have to be prepared for it, in the previous tour we were prepared, but unfortunately fate prepared us a bad game, sometimes due to nervousness or the fierce desire to hold the title already in hand, that left us something for this final game, and we hope that this time it won't come to that."
It is in Romanso's power not to be just second champion and to taste for the first time the fame that the titles bring.
The US amends the rules for obtaining a visa
Before consulting the service providers, persons must present themselves to the visa application service before they have been consulted, which means that waiting times will be reduced.
As of 10 January 2011, the procedures for applying for a visa in the United States Embassy and in the consulates will change.
In the new procedure, most applicants have to present themselves to the visa application services (ASC, initial letters in English) prior to their consultation in the consulate.
The staff of the ASC shall record the biometric data of the applicant, which shall be reviewed by the Consulate prior to the discussion.
The new procedure has certain advantages for the aspirants, including:
The total cost of processing the visa is reduced, as it is no longer necessary to pay separately the appointment agreement, the processing of the visa application and the transport service with which the document is delivered.
The applicant shall make only one payment covering the three services.
The current price remains unchanged: the counterpart to 140 dollars for a tourist visa, 150 dollars for visas with application (including visas for temporary workers) and 390 dollars for hands and investors.
Those who only want to extend their visas do not have to have a conversation in the consulate, they only have to imagine at the nearest ASC where they will present their documents and their fingerprints.
Since the biometric data are collected in the ASC, the applicants who need a second date for the consultation in the consulate remain there for less time than before.
Those who apply for the visa in the consulates of Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo no longer have to pay the service surcharge of $26.
Additional information on the new visa application procedure can be found on the following website: http://mexico.usembassy.gov/boletines/sp101201_Visas-FAQs.html
NASA announces the discovery of extraterrestrial life
The North American Space Agency called a press conference to present tomorrow a find that will affect the search for living beings in space.
The United States National Aeronautics and Space Agency (NASA) announces tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery that could confirm the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The Fund will be presented tomorrow at a press conference at NASA's headquarters in Washington by experts in astrobiology. This is a science that examines the origin, development, distribution and future of life in the universe.
At the launch of the press conference, NASA assured that it would present "a supervisory fund for the search for extraterrestrial life", which led to speculation among experts from other countries.
The discovery could prove the theory that it can exist in hostile environments that were previously considered uninhabitable, human-like creatures. It was the hypothesis that they could turn into intelligent beings - as humans do - if their living conditions improved.
It seems to be a microbe found at the base of the Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California. It lives there in an environment that was thought to be too toxic for all conceivable life forms, since the lake is highly arsenic-containing.
In some way, the microbial uses the arsenic as a survival resource. Taking into account this ability, the chances increase that there may be similar lives on other planets that do not have our protective atmosphere.
When these organisms metabolize the arsenic, according to astrobiologists, it has been shown that "the actual form of life gives a different form of life, a second form of life that differs from that known to us."
Tomorrow, Thursday, at the press conference, the Space Agency will announce the actual reach of its findings.
The conference is attended by the geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who investigates the possibility of life on Mars, and the biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who studies the Titan (the greatest moon of Saturn) on the question of whether its chemical composition is similar to that of the earth.
Gesta PRD, PT, Convergencia and Patrón form an opposition block
With the reform of the organ law on Congress the two-party system would be introduced, they complain.
The 60th legislative period had just begun, and an opposition block, led by the members of the PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo, had already been installed. The four questioned the following: the entry of the 'two-party system' into the chamber.
Before the beginning of the inaugural session in the 60th legislative period, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo of the PRD and Patrón Montalvo weathered the reform of the organ law, as this would exclude them.
With this reform, they repeated, a two-party system would be introduced, because now it would be two people, the same number as parties that controlled Congress.
These four MPs, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of the PRD, were the only ones who voted against the Bureau in its capacity as vice-chairman, led by the Panist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca.
Corvera Quevedo stated that the parties PRI and PAN had institutionally introduced their political stance with these reforms.
He explained that in the next few days they would speak to the representatives of PAN and PRI to change the scheme, and that if they did not have the political will, they would be unjust again by both parties, which would put an end to the opposition coalition.
"To this point I come (the opposition coalition), that is what I see, because we are excluded from all decisions that do not even take into account the opinion of the others."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia explained that there were similarities with PRD, PT and Patrón and that therefore a pluralist group would be formed.
It cannot be permitted, he continued that after being monopolistic, Congress should now be "duopolistic".
"It is not the spirit of the reform of the law that an eternal two-party system should prevail in Congress."
"In the beginning, this group starts with five MEPs and they talk to other colleagues so that they can become more," said the Convergencia member.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT led in allusion to PAN and PRI that the Congress had now turned into a 'beef' for two.
"Before it was just one party, now they split up."
Patrón Montalvo asked to respect the Members and to give them their place at the negotiating tables.
"The five who are currently seen as being divided into different groups have decided to unite to take our place at the negotiating table, because because of the reform that has been carried out and agreed upon by the others, we have stayed outside and we do not agree with this reform."
200 000 peso more for "the supplier"
The city administration of Mazatlán pays another check to the controversial owner of the company for electrical materials.
Another check over just over 200 000 peso in favor of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palace was issued by the city council.
Thus, the sum paid to the owner of the company for electrical material in the second half of the year amounts to 1 200 000 pesos.
According to the page for more transparency of the city administration, this cheque, issued on an amount of 200.144,56 peso, was issued with the number 9258447 last November for the purpose of "billing open invoices".
The treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had already sent in advance that more money would go from the community to these suppliers. She is observed by the Auditoría Superior del Estado because she sells at excessive prices.
What has not been mentioned is the total amount that is still owed to her and, as a result, the number of cheques that are still being issued in favour of Camacho Palazuelos.
"Nothing was bought from her, it just pays the debts, just like the other suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last checks "appeared" in the last quarter of the year: September 24, October 15, October 19, October 29, and this last of November 16.
Although the suppliers have not yet been published in the Official Journal, as is required by law if a company is questioned by the ASE in order to avoid other administrations applying for their services, the treasurer assured that their services would not be used again.
After the newspaper Noroeste had published on 25 July the examination of the cheques issued by the city administration to its suppliers, it was announced before that, from March 2008 to 9 July 2010, during the three-year term of office of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez had paid the municipality over 10 million pesos with 42 cheques to Camacho Palazuelos.
It also took place with Jumapam, where they collected cheques worth over 3 million peso.
Tourist places need to be improved
Tourist companies regret the accident of foreign tourists due to the poor condition of Glorieta Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlán.
After the fall of a foreign tourist into the invasion of Glorieta Sánchez Taboada, the tourism industry of Mazatlán asked the authorities to pay particular attention to the areas that are in poor condition and to throw a bad picture on the port city.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, President of the Zona Dorada Trade Union, recalled that at different times it was required to maintain the destination and turn the bad conditions that tourists find into new employment opportunities or routes.
He said that the poor condition of the roads and paths had had a negative effect, as the tourists came to snuff and saw the disorder, and then they would turn their backs on the nearby shops.
"The politicians don't know what it means to have to close a company one day and they don't worry about how much money you lose, because otherwise they wouldn't be doing the construction in this way slowly and unplannedly."
Hotel owner José Ramón Manguat Sánchez said that the fall of the tourist would have drawn attention to the lack of prevention and the lack of maintenance work on the part of the city.
"The community must assume its responsibilities and avoid such a thing happening again. How should it do this? Well, by preventive maintenance instead of improving everything afterwards," he explained.
"We are longing to have a clean city, because not only because it is a tourist area, it needs to be maintained, even our residents have a right to a clean habitat. The city administration needs to change its strategy to keep the city in good condition."
"There are other places that also look unkempt and unfinished," he said, "for example el Escudo y el Venadito von Mazatlán."
"Today we need more than just advertising to attract tourists. A good product needs to be offered, a city that keeps its beaches and streets clean, and the tourist attractions constantly on fire," he added.
"These arrangements have not been given enough attention and these kinds of incidents merely reveal what is obvious to all: maintenance is urgently needed."
Raúl Llera Martínez, Vice-Secretary of Promoción Turística, expressed the importance of saving the tourist places of Mazatlán, because they would not be used properly and caused a bad picture to arise.
He mentioned a number of places that would have to be brought to the fore with the city. To make the city clean, orderly and attractive for tourism should be priority.
"Unfortunately, Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural sites that need to be cleaned and cleaned in order to make them attractive to tourism and to provide them with the inventory we advertise for this destination.
IP calls for Congress results
Mr Dávalos, Chairman of the CCE, proposed that MEPs should take on the great responsibility of setting a model for a better Sinaloa, which faces many challenges.
The Mazatlán business sector calls for a worthy parliament, free from agreements between the parties and the government, because Sinaloa is upset and faces major problems.
Yesterday the 60th Parliament was inaugurated. It consists of seven political forces, 19 members of the PRI, 13 of PAN, three of Partido Nueva Alianza, two of PRD, one of PT, one of Convergencia and one of PHEM. That makes a total of 40 representatives.
The new members of the State Congress are expected to do a clean job, feel committed to society and the different social groups who depend on responsible parliamentary work, and not repeat the same patterns of partyism and paternalism.
Eduardo Dávalos, Chairman of the CCE Business Coordination Council, proposed that the new MEPs should take on the great responsibility of setting a model for a better Sinaloa, which faces many challenges.
"We hope that Members will really exercise their right to act freely from agreements between the parties, because it is common practice for them to make agreements with which they represent their own interests, thus transforming themselves into carnival komplers of the rulers and leaders of the parliamentary groups."
He said that they should demonstrate their commitment to building the necessary bridges to support the current government.
"We take care that they carry out a trustworthy work and, above all, work for society and its groups, because it was the people of Sinaloa who expressed their confidence in them in the last elections."
José Ramón Manguat Sánchez, Chairman of the Tres Islas Hotel Association, believes that one of the major challenges facing the 40 representatives of the people is the drive and joint work for the economic growth of the state, since today the economic situation is extremely complicated.
"The most important thing is that they stimulate economic growth, create investment incentives and infrastructure measures, which will in any way promote job creation."
With regard to the tourism sector, he called on the new MEPs to give the necessary status to the Ministry of Tourism in the state budget.
"I have understood that it is the Ministry with the second least means. This is incompatible with an important economic activity that brings foreign exchange and investment to the country and is in direct competition with the agro-industry."
Tourism projects must be allocated funds, state security must be supported and the alcohol law, which has not been recast in previous legislative periods, must be brought up to date.
Seeking Holy King
The children of the Coronado Valenzuela family long for dolls, cars, bicycles and other toys.
For the parents, it will be difficult to meet these wishes on the next three-kinged day, because the household is no longer made up of twelve people and no less than a goat.
Nevertheless, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan and Miguel do not give up the hope that Melchior, Caspar and Balthasar will give them the toys and garments they so long for.
The family lives in a modest house in the settlement of Salvador Allende. They live by hand in their mouths, because the father has no fixed work.
"Sometimes hard times are said because my husband doesn't have a job, but we sell mandarins and potatoes... In the afternoon, I'm already going with the goers to sell on the street," said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
The four-year-old Adelaida would like a doll or a bicycle, while her three-year-old sister Isabel wants a Barbie doll.
Ten-year-old José Alfredo has wanted to have a 'monster car' for some time now and for his eight-month-old brother Jesús, Cayetana proposes clothes for one-year-olds.
"(José Alfredo) told me, 'I would like this monster so much,' but I answered him, 'let's wait, boy, because it was very expensive', remembering Cayetana sadly.
For older children who were in school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
Eleven-year-old María Guadalupe has the size 12; ten-year-old Isaías has the size 10, during eight-year-old Miguel size 8.
The 14-year-old José Juan lacks tennis shoes. A couple of sizes 5 1/2 or 6 would be very helpful.
If you would like to help realize the dreams of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family, you can take part in the campaign 'Holy King Is Wanted' by donating a toy or cash in the reception hall of the Noroeste newspaper.
14 suspected drug dealers arrested
On Wednesday, around ten house searches were carried out in the Estrie administrative region in connection with the destruction of a cannabis production and sales network.
Fourteen people were arrested and will face various charges.
The house searches took place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, where the main sites of drug production were supposed to have served.
"Approximately 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of hashish, cash and equipment that served the production have been confiscated," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesman for the Quebec Security Police.
All in all, eleven men and three women were arrested, two of whom came from Sherbrooke, who are considered to be the main wiredriver of the drug ring.
The arrested persons are said to have appeared in Sherbrooke hours after their arrest in front of the court building.
They could, among other things, be accused of the production of cannabis, its property for sale, the plot and the service of crime.
These house searches had taken place as a result of a lengthy investigation, which took place over a year.
"The information received from the public has enabled us to carry out these arrests," said M. Ruel.
Around 70 police officers from the Estrien Regional Investigation Unit of the Quebec Security Police, the Sherbrooke Police Department and the Memphrémagog Police Authority had participated in this police operation.
Secret immigration could be pursued easily
The draft law of the Conservatives, which according to the government is intended to deal with the problem of ships loaded with secret immigrants, is expected to be stamped in after the three opposition parties announced on Wednesday that they cannot support the proposal.
"I strongly oppose this Charter."
"I am holding with a party that has put bonds on your feet," said Michael Ignatieff, head of the Liberals, after the weekly Caucus session in front of the assembled MEPs.
The Liberals claimed that the draft law, which allows each person identified as a vessel intended for the transport of illegal immigrants to be detained for up to one year, violates the Canadian Constitution of Law and Freedom as proposed.
Gilles Duceppe, head of Bloc Québécois, also indicated that he could not support the draft law, since he opposed the wrong target group.
"We are against it and it seems that all opposition parties are against it, so we will wait for what the government is doing," said M. Duceppe.
Criticism regarding the immigration question of Olivia Chow, NDP, has turned the critics away from the hand who are demanding that their party not behaved steadfastly enough towards the secret immigrants.
"The Neo-Democrats agree to take action against the blind passengers, and this is precisely what we are trying to enforce by means of another draft law, the C-35," said Chow.
We therefore do not support the Conservatives' draft law because he is looking for the blame for the refugees and holds children captive for at least one year," said Chow.
Minister of Immigration Jason Kenney accused the opposition parties of playing with politics and ignoring the Canadian's will.
"The Canadians strongly inform the MPs that they do not tolerate this kind of secret immigration, these criminal processes that concern Canada and that treat the country as a footstool."
"You expect Canada to take tough action," said Minister Kenney's reaction.
"The government has not announced any vote of confidence in its draft law that could have led the country to elections that the government would have rejected.
However, a Conservative has said to the agency QMI that the government would call for a vote so that any opposing member can immediately declare himself to his constituents.
The new unit does not find unanimity
Despite the announcement of the possible establishment of a new standing unit to fight corruption and conflict by Jean Charest, many observers continue to call for the formation of a public inquiry committee on this issue.
Robert Dutil, Minister of Public Security, claims that this idea did not come from yesterday: Quebec had already consulted the New York Department of Investigation on this issue last January.
The metropolis has had a standing unit against corruption since 1870.
Nevertheless, the announcement of Wednesday has more than surprised one.
It must be said that this measure was not discussed in the least at the meeting of the Standing Committee of the Quebec Police Service on 29 October last year, despite Robert Dutil's presence.
Nor was it lacking that Stéphane Bergeron, critic and member of the Party of Québécois, qualified this announcement in terms of public security as "the magic rabbit" and "the right solution at a table end".
Minister Dutil, in turn, had turned to those who fear that political power had too much influence on the future unity in question.
"You will see the result when we announce it," he was pleased to confirm.
"One is aware of this problem."
According to Réjean Parent, the President of the CSQ, nothing can replace the conduct of a public survey.
"The more M. Charest insists on preventing the formation of this investigation committee, the more people like you and I think he has something to hide," he said.
"The only way to form a committee of inquiry is to resign Jean Charest," said Yves Boisvert, lecturer of ethics and political systems at ENA (State University for the Training of High Administrative Officers).
In order to get out of this deadlock, he proposes to Quebec to grant financial control a special mandate so that it can carry out appropriate investigations through corruption and secret agreements.
"One should be able to extend the mandate of audit control," he decided.
He also believes that Quebec's audit could grant the same powers as Commissioners, which would also allow her to oblige people to make a statement.
The formation of a standing unit is not the only project in the drawers of the Charest government.
Quebec will also require Ottawa to amend the penal law in order to better adapt to this type of crime.
This demand comes from the Supreme Prosecutor of Operation Marteau, who informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the case law in this way of prosecution is not clear.
Vic Toews, Minister of State for Public Security, confirmed his colleague from the Justice Department, Rob Nicholson, was currently dealing with certain amendments relating to this dossier.
During Operation Printemps 2001, which concerned the groups of motorcycle police, 131 persons were arrested, although the penal law had not been revised.
As a result, Ottawa has enforced the law against gangsterism.
Rivers under strict surveillance
Several river flows remain under strict surveillance due to the high rainfall that has occurred in some regions of the province since Tuesday.
In Shawinigan, in the administrative region of Maurice, a landslide occurred on Wednesday afternoon.
Two houses were evacuated preventively.
In the evening another landslide took place in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in the administrative region of Lanaudiere.
A road has sunk into itself.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, heavy rainfall has spread from 40 to 70 millilitres of precipitation to several regions.
Between 20 to 40 further millimeters of precipitation were expected here according to the regions until Thursday evening.
The areas north of the river and the valley of the Outaouais region were most affected.
There had been a total of up to 100 millimeters of rain showers.
Since these rainfalls are due to the melting of snow, which has already accumulated in certain sub-areas, the crossing of several watercourses is feared.
On Wednesday evening warnings were issued by the Quebec Security Service about the flood alarm concerning the rivers Ouareau and Achigan in the region of Lanaudiere.
The river flows in the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentine mountains and the Chêne in Lotbinière become the object of flood control and remain under observation.
In the region of Lanaudière, severe rainfall has led to the crossing of some lakes in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildar and Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, an evasive bridge was demolished due to the heavy rainfall.
Ten residences had to be evacuated as a preventive measure.
In Outaouais the crossing of certain lakes has caused the closure of several roads, especially in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
Security continues to be alerted and to monitor the situation as closely as possible, says Security Councillor Annik Bouchard.
On Wednesday, the Quebec High Water Center issued warnings of the strong rise of several rivers, in particular Maskinongé, Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont partially corrected
The Quebecer Radio Moderator Stéphane Dupont has suffered a partial setback before the Canadian Radio Standards Supervisory Board (CCNR) for his controversial statements on social welfare and Haitians, as well as for his out-of-date speech on radio.
The CCNR is of the opinion that M. Dupont and his CHOI 98,1 FM team would have the right to express their own views, but certain statements "would have contained inaccurate information about the social welfare and unjustified negative representations of the Haitian people and also such unscrupulous speech that is not appropriate to the broadcasts broadcast during the day."
The Supervisory Board had also concluded that a discussion on suicide involving the spread of the names of two persons who committed suicide violates the Code of Broadcasting.
The CCNR had received several complaints concerning the comments made during the 2008 and 2010 broadcasts.
The first order was filed following a complaint by the "Front communi des personnes assistées sociales du Québec".
The activists' organisation had complained that the amounts mentioned in the consignment were inaccurate.
Rather, the moderators should provide sound information as misleading.
On the subject of suicide, moderator Stéphane Dupont thought that suicide was an expression of cowardice.
The majority of the Supervisory Board members had concluded that the message conveyed was that suicide should not be seen as a solution to life crises.
"The majority of the Supervisory Board takes into account the fact that the consequences of the "Dupont le midi" broadcast in question have addressed a sensitive issue in a family-friendly and appropriate way."
Therefore, he was not found guilty of anything against his person.
The last issue was the statements that related to the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had given themselves a media-active argument that caused a lot of reactions.
The CHOI moderator had declared not to have donated in favor of the Haitian aid, since it was not certain whether the needy would actually receive the money.
The Supervisory Board believes that these comments were not abusive, but that their cumulative effect presents an unjustified negative representation of the Haitians.
"I have already forfeited my three-day suspension sentence in this matter."
"My file has been virgin for a year and a half," said the moderator.
In all decisions, the Supervisory Board denounces the spread of an unbridled expression.
In all cases, the CHOI-FM broadcaster had acted "outside its obligations".
The consequences for the broadcaster, which, among other things, had to report its decisions once during the main broadcasting period within a period of three days, are minor.
A King of Kung-Fu in Montreal
Nacereddine Zemmal, of Algerian origin, has taken a very special course.
The athlete, who shines in "Sanda" (full contact Kung-Fu), in the kickboxes and in the Thai box, now rises in search of new challenges to the Tatami and the boxing rings of the world.
"I started in Algeria 12 years ago with martial arts such as kung fu and kickboxes," said Zemmal, who has been based in the metropolis since 2008 to develop among the professionals.
I personally am looking for the fight everywhere, since for those who don't like the ground struggle, as the mixed martial arts present it, competitions in North America are rare."
Recently, both the security officer and the UPS company had given their rivals bad news, in which he won two gold medals from the World Karate and the Kickboxing Association (WKA) at the World Championship of Amateurs held in Edinburgh, Scotland between 23 and 30 October.
"I have won in the categories of full contact kickboxing and Thai boxing," he explained.
"I am currently preparing for the San Shou World Cup in China."
"There were those fighters from every category who had ranked among the first four in the last World Championship."
"I made my baby in Toronto in 2009."
"In 2005 I became an Achter in Vietnam."
"In 2007, I finished the fifth place tournament in China while in 2009 I became a third in Toronto," he added.
"It is worth mentioning that I have made progress in every competition."
"With this rhythm I will be first this time or next year!"
"San Shou" or "Sanda" are disciplines originating in China, where fistbeats and footsteps are permitted as well as groundwork.
The two battles usually play on a platform, less often in a boxing ring.
The most prestigious boxing fighter from this type of martial arts is the American Vietnamese origin Cung Le, which is well known in the world of martial arts.
If Nacer Zemmal kept only one event in his career, he would certainly call his presence here at the Super Tournament "King of Sanda", the Super Bowl of the King-Fu.
"This competition is the highest and most prestigious in China," said the sympathetic Poundsman.
"It is a bit like the equivalent to the stadium of Lumpinee (the largest stadium in Thailand).
"That was a great experience."
Zemmal had won his first fight in the semifinals of his category (80kg) before he lost in the finals.
"He who defeated me was a real professional," he analyzed.
"There are four competitors per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 95 kg)."
"The winners of the semi-finals meet each other in the finale of their category."
"Then the winners of each category offer their foreheads to crown a single champion, the King of the King-Fu."
450 million in contracts without a call for tender
Hydro-Québec has approved 450 million dollars of contracts for the Eastmain 1-A-Sarcell-Rupert hydropower project in mutual agreement with project planning companies.
In the midst of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts stands a consortium consisting of the companies BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which has received the most important share, namely that of the project management, to a sum of 295 million dollars without a tender.
This consortium, called "Énergie gérance", was formed in 2004 as an accompaniment to the decision of Hydro-Québec, the private sector to discharge its responsibility to this important hydroelectric project amounting to a sum of $5 billion.
At the beginning of 2005, the Énergie gérance consortium re-entered the lucrative contract without having received a public tender.
For the Québécois party, recourse to business consortia is a serious ethical problem that raises the risk of distortion of competition and price increases.
"This is a new way of playing a carded game and dispels competition."
"This means that instead of playing carded games in a secret way, you are now performing in an open form," said Sylvain Simard, PQ member at the press conference yesterday.
In the early morning, Simard raised the question before the National Assembly, because it seems difficult to understand how public interest can be served in this way.
Minister of Resources Nathalie Normandeau had responded in the afternoon by saying vehemently that this contract was about a carded game.
"I remain faithful to my line," she said, "by strengthening that the PQ was "unreasonable" and that "it lacks her hardness".
She said it was "the minimum" that the PQ apologized.
The model of the consortium is common practice worldwide.
It is usually a temporary alliance of this kind, which allows two or more companies to pool their expertise in a bid for a tender for a complex project.
The "Eastmain" project has a high level of complexity in terms of its scope of work.
The construction process is under way and should be in place by 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without any competition; there had already been negotiations.
In addition, even with relatively simple projects, the model of the Consortium in Quebec is by no means an exception.
As the newspaper "Le Devoir" noted last week, the model of the consortium used in the field of civil engineering and consulting is subject to government investigations.
A brief overflight of the Quebec Business Register allows more than 200 consortia to be named, some of which seem to be of permanent duration.
In this way, for example, Dessau works in partnership with the majority of its core competitors, including CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin or Roche and Tecsult.
Any link, and of which there are several dozen, leads back to one and the same legal person, namely Dessau.
As regards the consortium "Énergie gérance", Minister Normandeau stressed that "the territory of Baie James is subject to a particular dynamics of labor and that hydro-québec has been paying particular attention to this fact since the 1970s".
Réal Laporte, the major employer of the Société d'énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has made a statement that has caused the nose to shrink over the fact that the project management contract has been agreed upon.
"If you make a tender and there are only a few applicants, your prices will speed up."
"So you have two options: either you take the people who are on this mart and tell you that you will negotiate a satisfactory agreement at a good price."
"The idea, however, is that the price is not decisive, but the people's expertise," Laporte confirmed.
This contract granted to the consortium "Energie gérance" is part of a long list of contracts over more than 50,000 received by the party Québécois.
The contracts were approved either by the Hydro-Québec or the SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcell-Rupert project.
After review, the newspaper "Le Devoir" counted more than 100 engineering and consulting contracts approved by companies or their branches, including in particular resource laboratories, between 2002 and March 2010.
SNC-Lavalin had signed 22 contracts, Génivar had received 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without including their participation in "Energie Gerance".
All these contracts have been negotiated.
They amount to a total of $449 783 344 including the contract with "Energie Gerance" over $295 131 564.
Sylvain Simard had said that the four companies that form the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) of the "Parti libéral du Québec" are well known.
Minister Normandeau had made it clear that the PQ was equally linked to the companies they "financed" before specifying that it was rather their managers.
Barometer responsible consumption - The "green" label is not a source of confidence
Greener, but unscathed skeptical.
The Quebec consumer has little confidence in the main players of sustainable growth, but neither in the branded brands nor in the eco-labels to control his choice.
Shame, though it bathes in a media-effective universe, where it is so full of information in favour of a more responsible consumption: the barometer responsible consumption has a lack of credible information to complain about, an inadequacy that makes itself known as a brake on its commitment, as the first reading that was held yesterday showed.
Although they have driven the consumption of so-called socially acceptable products in 2010, the Quebecers still seem to have little credit to those who try to sell them.
Two-thirds of the Quebec population admit that they do not believe in the environmental commitment of the companies as much as in green corporate advertising, the measuring instrument developed by the responsible consumer centre of the University of Sherbrooke reveals.
Another finding: half of consumers doubt the credibility of the official certificates attached to the supposedly fair products, but also the credibility of the products and brands that are declared to be environmentally conscious, says the barometer.
According to the same pattern, the discourse of politicians on this subject is taken seriously by only 14.6% of the Quebec population.
However, the information on responsible consumption seems to be important for the stimulation of this consumption segment, which is currently being revived by almost only one third of Quebec's consumers.
Indeed, emptiness and dubious nature of the information dampened the zeal of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the barometer according to the higher price of the products.
In addition, one third of the Quebecers are distrusted of the declared performance of green products and services they are trying to provide.
According to another Communication, more than half of consumers had already changed their habits in 2010 and mainly changed the brand of one or more products in order to express their conviction.
According to Barometer, they also preferred 61% purchases from dealers in their neighborhood and favoured the purchase of food grown in their region.
Green and responsible - the index of environmentally conscious consumption had reached a 64th of the maximum value of 100 this year - the Homo consumer of Quebec loves to present himself as king of recycling, who tries to reduce his traces left in the environment by taking care of animal welfare.
Nevertheless, social and environmental awareness seems to be stopping in front of his car, according to the barometer: just 28% of Quebecers have indicated that they have used public transport in 2010 or preferred the driving centre to demonstrate their environmental interest.
The increase and cycling were also supported by 39.1% of the participants in this comprehensive behavior survey, which feeds the clichés.
Government bond for the acquisition of eXcentris
The Quebec Government, which was asked by Société Angus and the company Parallèle to participate financially in the acquisition of the eXcentris cinema complex, agrees to cooperate, but only in the form of a competitive bond.
The development company Angus as well as the company Parallèle, who had hoped to make a donation of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to take over the cinema complex eXcentris belonging to Daniel Langlois on the Boulevard Saint-Laurent in order to return to its real cinematic function, apparently does not get what they requested.
Although the government has accepted to involve itself in this matter, on its own terms.
Instead of the expected donation, the Quebec government is offering a bond at a lower level than originally expected, which could create an existable solution to favourable conditions, at least in the opinion of the sources from the state rumors.
A first action plan and a request after 12.8 million had already been rejected from Quebec last spring, the petition has been corrected since the summarily downwards.
A proposal, together with an action plan, has already been sent by the President of the Société de développement des entreprises culturelles (SODEC), François Macerola, to Minister St-Pierre, who manages the eXcentris file.
Several days ago, he sent her a final report.
However, the counter-proposal of the cabinet was sent to the SODEC on Wednesday.
Parallèle and Angus now have time to respond to these until December 31st.
In any case, the premise of state donations seems to have been really pushed aside.
Let us remember that the Quebec owners of cinemas and cinema complexes had opposed a direct state investment to support the acquisition of eXcentris by arguing that the cult minister had no financial support for real estate projects there , which he had not given to other cinemas as well.
However, several other market participants of the segment claimed substantial economic assistance in contrast.
Film director Daniel Langlois had presented the author's cinema in the premises of his cinema complex for over ten years after the self-financed construction of the cinema, which could justify the exception of the State Treasury.
The lack of cinema halls showing independent films is more than obvious in Montreal, and eXcentris knew to keep his clientele at the pole.
The Société Angus and the company Parallèle with Christian Yaccarini in the lead, for their part, manage a privately funded campaign, one of which they hope to raise the purchase by $700,000.
Since spring 2009, only one canvas continues to show films in eXcentris, namely Le Parallèle.
The goal of the future buyers is to reopen the three cinema halls on 27 February next year with the presentation of the very successful film by Xavier Beauvois "Des hommes et des dieux".
Christian Yaccarini, however, did not remove the newspaper "Le Devoir" and one ignores what he and his group think of the downward-corrected proposals they have made.
Secret of complexly shaken Canada ventilated
The new American diplomatic lines, spread by WikiLeaks, revealed the mystery of what the United Nations considered to be the inferiority complex of the Canadians to the Americans, but with the same blow they reveal the superiority of the latter to Canada.
As a result, the American diplomats are amazed that the Canadian electorate does not have Canadian-American relations in mind in the election process, and they believe that the visit of President Obama would have helped the conservative government to enforce its 2009 budget!
The four new messages between the American Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, which were publicly distributed yesterday, offer even more striking details than the mere substantial content on which to gnaw.
A link dated 22 September 2008, i.e. the period during which the federal election campaign was in full swing, reports on the point from which the United Nations no longer participates in the operations discussed by its political leaders.
To the great amazement of David Wilkins, the American ambassador in Ottawa.
Mr Wilkins offers various ways of explaining this situation.
"Canadians who are almost inherently inferior may be more likely to cause Canadian political leaders to talk about internal issues of everyday life than the United States to send the black Peter in this election (as in 1988 in the campaign on free trade)", he describes.
The United Nations, he concludes, is thus "the proverbial Goliath of this election: omnipresent, but potentially too threatening to speak of him".
The ambassador understands this "quiet silence" even less, as the two countries have intensive political and economic relations.
" Logically," he evaluates, "it should be the ability of a candidate, a party and much more of a party leader to lead such an essential relationship that the voter has as a key factor in the idea of urination."
The other expression of this sense of importance is read in the announcement sent on 22 January 2009 by Terry Breese, Managing Director of Ottawa, to prepare President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your journey will help to ensure the continued existence of the government in the vote of confidence on the federal budget at the beginning of February, when Canada will announce its first deficit after more than a decade, which has resulted from a revitalization programme of between 30 and 40 billion dollars," says Breese.
Nowhere had he mentioned that the government had to delay the parliamentary session before Christmas in order to prevent Parliament from being overthrown by the coalition and the continued existence of the opposition parties would have an impact on the quality of the proposed revival programme.
Another communication from Ambassador Wilkins, dated January 2008, informs Washington of the increasingly negative picture that CBC broadcasts dramatic series from the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about broadcasts such as Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which you can observe little subtle references to Maher Aar, the "No Flight List" or also abductions for the purpose of hearings conducted by the CIA's muscle part.
Another communication reports in detail on how Hillary Clinten asked her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner at her first bilateral meeting whether Europe was willing to accept certain prisoners from Guantanamo.
Mr. Kouchner should have answered the question with yes, but on the basis of an individual "case-by-case" decision.
At the end of the meeting, as described, "he handed out to the Secretary of State a paper in respect of Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
"The Secretary of State has promised to read the file again."
Finally, we note that the minds are warmed up with regard to the WikiLeaks website.
Tom Flanagan, an old and Stephen Harper very close adviser, had explained about CBC that those responsible for this massive leak should be "killed".
He had referred here to Mike Huckabee from the United States.
Global plan for the renewal of lighting
In Cancun yesterday, the UN has proposed a plan to renew the lighting of households, trade and industry in 100 countries with a view to achieving a reduction in greenhouse gas (FCH) which corresponds to almost one third of the additional reduction that needs to be achieved in order to stabilise the global climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan takes its place in the steps of the concrete major projects that the UN hopes to implement in Cancun in order to compensate for the absence of mandatory reduction obligations on the industrialized countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, the main problem in the form of the 1.8 billion tons (Gt) of the FCFCs emitted to the earth due to lighting would be avoided if the white-hot pears, which so far still represent a monopoly of 50 to 70% on the market, were replaced by fluorescent or better, by light-emitting diodes (LED).
The lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This corresponds to an equivalent of 70% of the emissions of the global fleet.
Last year in Copenhagen, the major exhaust emissions such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, were committed to voluntary reduction plans to reduce global emissions of CFCs from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, 5 Gt would still have to be deducted from this balance in order to stabilise the climate increase by 2 degrees Celsius from today until 2020, in order to prevent it from becoming out of control.
In the white light bulbs 95% of the energy escapes in the form of heat, and the remaining 5% produce the light.
The compact light bulbs reduce energy consumption by 75%, while the new LED light bulbs reduce this energy demand by twice as much.
The compact light bulbs average between 6000 and 10,000 hours.
The new LED light bulbs, such as those that the manufacturer Philips has launched this week - this company has also participated in the UN study - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a white-hot pear, which suggests the saving possibilities of the exchange plan to be applied in 100 countries.
In addition to the fact that his completely novel light bulbs deliver very little heat, they can also work with a rule resistance.
And they don't contain any mercury.
Several specialists have shown that compact light bulbs have reserves, because they contain mercury and therefore they have to be disposed of as special waste, which is not always possible in the developing countries, except the producers provide an acceptance point.
However, according to the report, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not the compact light bulb, but rather the coal-fired power plants that emit significantly more mercury to produce the electricity wasted by the white-hot pears.
In the United States alone, these coal plants emit 25,000 tonnes of mercury annually.
The report sets out in detail the benefits that each country would generate through this international programme.
Indonesia, for example, would save one billion dollars a year on the purchase of electricity and eight million tonnes of CO2, which means an equivalent of 3.5 coal plants whose construction would cost Indonesia 2.5 billion.
Ivory Coast eagerly expects the announcement of the election results
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon called for the "unadvised" publication of the results of the presidential election of the Ivory Coast immediately after its expiry.
"The Secretary-General underlines the need for the independent electoral commission to maintain its work and to publish the preliminary results without further delay," said a UN Chief Press Officer.
"He asks all the parties and institutions of the Ivory Coast to prove their responsibility and to refrain from any initiative until the provisional results are announced."
Despite pressure from certain foreign governments, the Electoral Commission had allowed the deadline, which was set at midnight on Wednesday, to expire three days after the election on Sunday without publication of the results.
About forty minutes before the deadline, the President of CEI had confirmed on television that the Commission would "go ahead with work" to announce the results.
On Wednesday many calls from all over the world have become loud, and the CEI may at last call out the name of the winner of the second round under Laurent Gbagbo and his opponents Alassane Ouattara.
The Gbagbo camp, however, anticipates the cancellation of "fraud" votes in the north by the Constitutional Council, which was achieved by the former rebel camp of the Forces nouvelles (UN) during the coup failed in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, head of the Ivory Coast Presidency campaign, had confirmed that the UN-appointed manoeuvres to intimidate voters in the north of the country had deterred the President's supporters from going to the election.
The whole election could be cancelled if the complaints lodged by Gbagbo are taken into account by the Constitutional Council.
However, the Gbagbo Contractors are now more of the opinion that the highest court of the country is not neutral, as it is led by Paul Yao N'Dré, a politically closely connected with Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man of the north who disagrees with any connection with the ex-rebels, has judged the delay in proclaiming the election results as "unacceptable" and has asked Gbagbo to respect them even if he has not gone so far as to claim victory.
His allies reaffirmed that Gbagbo blocked the publication of the results as he knew he had lost; and file a complaint before the Constitutional Court after preventing the Electoral Commission from publishing the results were illegal.
The second round of the presidential elections on Sunday was held for the coronation of the unification and reconciliation process of a country divided into two parts over the years.
On Wednesday, the United Nations had warned the Ivory Coast politicians that they could be held responsible in the event of possible outbursts.
On 31 October, Laurent Gbagbo had the first round of the election, with 38% of the votes against the 32% for Alassane Ouattara, who had received the public support of former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
Unemployment rate in France remained stable in the third quarter
The unemployment rate in France is stable at 9.3% (including the overseas departments at 9.7%), in the sense of the International Labour Office (IAA) in the metropolis, according to the preliminary seasonally adjusted data published on Thursday by the Insee Statistical Office.
The unemployment rate in the metropolis is established at 2,631 million.
The figures for the second quarter ranged from 9.3% of the working population in the metropolis to 9.7% in overseas departments.
Over the year, the unemployment rate increased by 0.1 percentage points.
In more detail, 3.4 million French metropolis workers were not employed in the third quarter, but wanted to find a job, including whether they were employable every two weeks or not or whether they were looking for work or not.
The situation of young people in the labour market has continued to deteriorate with an increase in the unemployment rate of 24.2% in the metropolis (+ 0.9 percentage points within three months, +0.5 percentage points over the year) and 25% with the inclusion of overseas regions.
In the third quarter, 637,000 young people between 15 and 24 years of age were unemployed, according to the IAA.
The elderly, for their part, have seen a slight increase in the unemployment rate of 6.4% in the metropolis (+0.2 percentage points over three months and over the year), i.e. 482,000 of those over 50 years old, 6.6% including overseas departments.
Only the 25-49-year-olds could benefit from the stability of unemployment in the third quarter; 8.3% in the metropolis (-0.1 percentage points over three months, +0.1 percentage points over one year) and 8.8% in France as a whole.
After an examination of his calculation procedures, the Federal Statistical Office of Insee has no longer published the monthly unemployment figures since 2006.
On the other hand, Eurostat, the Statistical Office of the European Union, continues to use this method and announced on Tuesday a rate of 9.8% in France for October (including the overseas departments) compared to 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini accused and arrested
Against Alexandre Guérini, 53, head of a disposal company and brother of the president of the General Council of the Bouches-du-Rhône Region (PS), an investigation procedure was initiated and he was sent to prison in Luynes near Aix-en-Provence in the course of an investigation into the public markets suspected of fraud.
Alexandre Guérini was accused of undermining social assets, misappropriation of general property, healing, involvement in corruption, unauthorized bribery and possession of weapons, his lawyer said.
"Alexandre Guérini is ready to fight and intends to express himself on all the questions that the prosecution will ask him, instead of spreading brainspinks."
"It's easy to imagine a number of criminal charges, another thing is to prove them," said his lawyer Florence Rault of the AFP (Agence France Presse) before hearing his client.
Mr Guérini, brother of Jean-Noël Guérini, the first man of the PS (Parti Socialiste) in the department, was interested in giving the judge a memorandum of his justification before hearing with his lawyers.
A member of Guérinis, Philippe Rapezzi, was also charged and detained on Wednesday evening.
According to attorney Lucien Simon, her client had never done anything other than keep running his estate, which he had to manage.
According to Simon, he would never have known about the business area or the target location of the associated funds.
In this affair, Daniel Pinna, former Director General of the Public Service of the Aubagne metropolitan area, was again accused of subjugation and accompliceship on Wednesday, but then under the obligation to stay away from the protagonists of these acts under judicial supervision.
"My client was able to provide explanations of the facts that were being accused of him."
"The chief prosecutor has taken into account not to rob him of his freedomů, his lawyer Yann Arnoux said.
Four more persons were charged and released from prison on the night of Tuesday to Wednesday, including two of them under legal supervision, according to Deputy Attorney General Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, Deputy Managing Director of the Marseille Provence Métropole disposal company (MPM), is prosecuted for "unauthorised influence and passive bribery".
Two civil servants of Aubagne, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier were also arrested, who were arrested on the basis of the title "Hintering and Disincentivement of General Goods by a Public Service Officer", and the other on the grounds of "Participation in the Infringement of Public Funds".
The lifelong companion of Alexandre Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, was also accused of "healing and undermining social assets".
Among the people who were confronted with Guérini was Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently imprisoned for a similar affair of fraud by public authorities that had affected Corsica.
The guards suspect his society to have contributed to washing money from "high" criminal circles.
The investigation against X for alleged fraud in the award of public contracts, particularly in the field of disposal, will be conducted in April 2009 following anonymous letters in the files of several open investigation procedures.
Close sources of investigation show that the investigation focuses in particular on the conditions of the surcharge and the operation of a landfill in La Ciotat, which also covers waste from the Aubagne area, as well as from certain cities of the Marseille (MPM) catchment area.
Affaire Clotilde Reiss: the Elysée Palace exaggerates its intermediate function for Syria
Within more than six months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, a young French researcher who was detained in Iran for "spionage", held the French public in breath, put diplomacy in alert and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All of this under the attention of the diplomats of the United States.
The American documents received by WikiLeaks and read by the newspaper "Le Monde" reveal some backgrounds of this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée had explained its strategy to the Americans, who went so far as to give this advice on how to deal with their own crisis of "seizures" in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how the French authorities have tried to convince Washington that the liberation of the young French woman did not benefit from the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian prisoner in France who was arrested by American justice on the basis of trade in material in favour of the Iranian nuclear program.
Finally, they put in a bright light the way in which the French Bureau tried to manipulate the media for the purpose of making them believe the idea that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad had played a central role in the liberation of Clotilde rice.
In truth, he had done nothing in this regard.
A diplomat telegram, edited in Paris on 12 August 2009, bears the title "Iran: French comments on how to deal with hostages".
François Richier, Elysée consultant on strategic issues, was accompanied by Patrice Paoli, director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explained the French method to her.
They advised the Americans to make every effort to bring back their own nationals who would be held in Iran forcibly.
"Much noise," they said, "articulates loudly and clearly and without letup" the words "basic human rights", "indemnity", "immediate release" in the media.
This is necessary to embarrass the Iranian regime, which is very sensitive to its image.
"Pursues this all the more, especially since the Iranians ask you not to do so."
Because "silence doesn't solve anything", past the attempts at discussion about inconspicuous ways, the Iranians are "masters in evasive manoeuvres".
Mr Richier added that the arrest of foreigners was a "common Iranian tactic": "seizing for political extortion".
He announces that the release of Clotilde Reiss from prison (which was due on August 16 on the day she fled to the French Embassy) "requires the payment of a large sum of money to the Iranians" (230,000 euros of deposit).
And he makes it clear that the Elysée is anticipating further hostage-taking, a phenomenon that will "enforce itself".
The Iranians could "in the near future arrest another of the approximately 1,800 French citizens who live in Iran," he said.
August 28, 2009.
Clotilde Reiss was released from prison twelve days ago, but is still being detained in Iran.
An information has been circulated: the Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition requires the United States to Iran for illegal trade in sensitive electronic material, has been released from prison following a decision by a judge in Paris.
Like many other observers, the American Embassy is asking questions about this disturbing coincidence.
For Washington, which pursues the illegal Iranian networks of acquisition of the material intended for the nuclear program, the release of Majid Khakavand is a bad news.
Did France buy a cow trade?
The liberation of the Iranian from that of the French?
On the occasion of a further discussion with Kathleen Allegrone on 4 September, François Richier assures that this is not the case.
The Elysée, he says, was not only "fully surprised by the judge's decision", but also tried to resist it.
"There has been a lively exchange between the French Presidency and the French Minister of Justice" (currently Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot change the judicial decision," he explains.
Mr Richier would also like to point out that Majid Kakavand remains under "strict" supervision of the French secret service.
The Elysée consultant dials a telephone number, sets up again, then informs the American diplomat, the Iranian "was currently in the buildings led by the Iranian Embassy in Paris".
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysée does not spare its efforts to believe by means of announcements and media-organised "refugees" that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad is playing a "important" and "influenced role".
The Americans do not observe this activity without irony and find that the manipulation bears fruit, as several press articles reflect the official French version.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009 called for "the media flash of the French authorities".
What is the basis for so much "thank you" towards Mr. Assad, asks the Paris Embassy.
"Despite their declarations full of praise, the French authorities secretly admit that they only have a vague idea of what the Syrians have actually done."
The document then examines the reasons which led the Elysée to abandon this fiction.
The intensive communication efforts "aim to confirm Sarkozy's policy of opening up to Syria", he analyses.
A policy launched in 2008 was perceived "by numerous critics in France and abroad as premature and undeserved".
"The Syrian role building" Paris attempts to "show Syria what acknowledgment you can achieve by playing a constructive role in the region".
The aim is also to "sow a cross between Syria and Iran".
The American Embassy knows this from a good source.
On August 11th, François Richier had entrusted her with: "Of course, we do not know whether the Syrians have done anything."
"But we thanked them for everything."
"This should at least cause confusion among the Iranians".
Clotilde Reiss returns to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy welcomes her in the Elysée.
In a communiqué, he thanked the Presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in favour of the release of our countrymen".
No online games for young Koreans after midnight
The South Korean government will pass a law called "the Cinderella", which will forbid young people to play online games after midnight, by blocking their access, so indicated government leaders.
A draft law designed to encourage online game operators to deny access to these games to young people under 16 years of age after midnight will be presented to Parliament in December, described representatives of cult and family ministries.
"Many children play these games all night long and then have difficulties in learning at school and also in living a normal life during the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep," said Jo Rin, Minister responsible for this draft law of the French press agency Agence France Presse.
The online games will be available again from 6 a.m.
The producer companies would have a year to prepare for the application of the law, he explained.
The government is also looking to ask manufacturers to cut down the daily time limit for access to these games on those young people whose parents are asking for it, the controller added.
It will also provide those who wish to have free programs available to allow them to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "networked" countries, and the newspapers regularly report various events associated with intensive Internet use.
The country is also an undisputed champion in global online gaming competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals in the World Cyber Games against 58 other nations.
World Cup 2018-2022: FIFA appoints the host country
On Thursday, the FIFA Executive Committee appoints the World Cup host countries 2018 and 2022, a highly political choice that threatens to push the technical criteria into the background, in light of corruption suspicion.
However, one thing is certain: the 2018 edition of FIFA's Royal Discipline will take place in Europe, its traditional high castle (the 4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 edition will then be somewhat more exotic; the International Football Association hopes to win new territories (catar, Australia) for itself after the premiere on the African continent in 2010, or to pursue its branch in the United States or in Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of persons belonging to the delegation (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, Emir of Qatar, Belgian and Dutch Heads of Government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) gives the measure of the economic and political commitment of a world championship.
So the things behind the scenes are threatening to stop until the last minute.
Otherwise, it is difficult to set up a hierarchy of candidates.
According to FIFA's evaluation report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) file offer better arguments than their competitors.
But these considerations will not be so important for the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the time of the election.
The Sunday Times, which was at the beginning of the revelations with the suspension of two members of the Executive Committee (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could as well have ruined the chances for their own country, the cradle of football, which was only allowed to run the World Cup once, namely in 1966.
The BBC had once again given food to this on Monday by sending out a documentary report which fires three influential members of the committee, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Reason enough to exasperate FIFA and embarrass the English leaders, who primarily had had an intensive lobbying with David Cameron over the past few weeks.
The head of government hopes for a new edition of the chess move succeeded by his predecessor Tony Blair, who had won the 2012 Olympics for London in 2005.
Would this intensive effort be sufficient to restore the image of England to the committee?
Nothing is less certain, as the duo Spain Portugal is not lacking in drums with its already finished stages, its expertise (WM 82 in Spain, Olympic Games 92 in Barcelona, EM 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
But the economic and financial shadows of the two countries could dampen their ambitions.
The possible reprisals against the English, as well as the doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal increase Russia's chances of becoming a major outsider despite its gaps in the dossier (states, hotels, transport).
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, however, has decided to challenge the unwarranted reference to the statements made by the English press "an unfair competition in the preparation of the vote" by the members of the committee.
"You throw them with dirt, you try to compromise them," said Putin.
By 2022, the United States, strengthened by the experience of 1994, seems to be the logical favorites.
First World Economic Power, headquarter of FIFA's main sponsors, the country seems to have a long list of advantages over Japan and South Korea that have set up a very nice project separately.
However, these new candidatures seem premature for two countries that had co-organised the competitions in 2002.
Another threat: the FIFA-sponsored World Cup 2026 grant for China, which leaves the Asian chances to fall to 2022.
With Australia and Qatar, which had drawn all registers with the maintenance of futuristic stages, FIFA is pursuing its expansion towards new areas, but these two countries pose a greater risk than certainty.
Australia, as well as Japan and South Korea, may suffer from the weakness of television rights (due to the shift in time), which is the sensitive nerve of FIFA.
Second mandate: openness
De Gaulle had really stopped.
Mitterrand had made him think he was bumping.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not show the slightest hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than this.
A mandate in the Elysée calls for the next one.
The current Head of State will be an ergo candidate in 2012.
But openness is not well on the face of the mystery that holds the presidency function.
So you have to act as if the doubt existed from now on.
On the one hand, and on the other.
In 2006, the supporters of Jacques Chiracs stated that a third mandate was not excluded without even believing in it.
On November 15th, Nicolas Sarkozy seriously assured him to make his decision "at some point in the autumn of 2011.
That he would sound the perspective of "two mandates" on Tuesday evening in the Elysée in front of the UMP parliamentarians had thus spread a little feverishness.
Was that the official announcement of his candidacy?
Far missing.
The President merely reminded us that the 2008 amendment to the Constitution limits the number of five-year terms to only two.
He made a statement, no announcement.
It is not the first time he mentioned the presidential election on such meetings in a humorous tone.
"You have seven and a half years with me, or at best," he told them in July 2009.
A new one in May 2010: "I don't think I'm thinking about the phase after that."
His words of the day before yesterday make him no more a candidate than the day before, but no less.
If they make comments, then for a double reason.
The acceleration of the race around the candidacy with the PS on one side.
However, it is not the opening of the competition with Ségolène Royal that drives Nicolas Sarkozy to reveal himself.
On the contrary, it is his obvious candidacy in 2012, which many members of the PS advise early on than accepted to the combat contest.
The bad polls on the other side.
For the first time, the right-wing voters would prefer a candidacy of François Fillon to that of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% versus 44%, according to the poll of the BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate, and there is no discussion about it with the UMP," reacted immediately and cautiously to the Prime Minister's environment.
"If he found a defeat as possible, he wouldn't be a candidate," says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will always believe in being able to win," corrects Alain Juppé, who has settled down with openness.
Euro: the ECB is forced to maintain its purchases of government papers
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB last year should provide an opportunity to demonstrate how to get out of the crisis, or at least announce the arrangement of a large number of unconventional monetary policy measures to come to an end at the end of the year.
The crisis of European sovereign debt obliges the central bank in Frankfurt to bear no doubt the present, more than tense situation on European bond markets, in order not to exacerbate them.
The political costs would be far too high.
French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde welcomed yesterday at a press conference the ECB's active role in the resolution of European sovereign debt.
She did not dare to say that she felt that the central bank could do even more, for example by encouraging her programme of public bond purchases.
"I reserve my reasons for my European trading partners for (...)".
Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB, on the occasion of his hearing in Brussels on the occasion of the European Parliament's Economic and Monetary Committee, did not very much speak about his projects, but rather was pleased to point out that the programme of purchases of government papers on the secondary market would "go ahead" and that we will see at the meeting on Thursday "how the decisions will fail".
Only certainty: the ECB will remain unchanged at 1%, the lowest level since May 2009.
In practice, last week the Treasury's bond purchases doubled from the ECB to approximately 1.35 billion euros.
And according to indiscretions of some merchants, she was said to have made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese government papers yesterday.
In total, Eurosystem central banks have made purchases of EUR 67 billion since May 2010.
Among the dealers, the anticipation of a follow-up of the purchase price is by no means disputed (see page 29).
The economists no longer expect a remarkable change in course.
If the bond operations of more than three months have already disappeared from the ECB's arsenal, the latter will continue to make itself available to the unlimited reserve of funds in a liberal manner, over a period of one week to three months.
Today, economists are already concerned that this measure will be extended for a few months.
"I cannot imagine that the ECB will substantially change its programme".
"Otherwise, she would risk provoking new tensions in the short term," says Michael Schubert, economist of Commerzbank.
"A progressive exit planned for the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely to me," says Norbert Bräms, economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In the field of its intervention on the sovereign debt market, "the ECB should maintain such a volume of purchase of bonds that will boost the sluggish market", adds Norbert Bräms.
Given the relevance of the exposed position of European banks in the markets of sovereign debt in the euro area, the central bank has no choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
"It must enter the market at any price to the producers of the lack of investors and act in such a way as to prevent the rapid enthusiasm for the yields paid to the weakest states," testified an important bond holder yesterday.
If the interest rates were to be increased, the States would be even more prevented from reducing or stabilising their debt.
This is the price to protect the euro.
The Berlusconi government covers Italy
After a week's start worrying about Italy, yesterday the situation relaxed a little with the decline in interest rates to 10 years.
A return to deceitful silence.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister for Economic Affairs, regional presidents Giulio Tremonti had qualified the situation as "innumerable" and had heard him expect a "unpredictable" weekend, which the person concerned, however, immediately denied.
At any rate, on Tuesday, the German interest rate scissor had reached its record of 210 basis points, and the prices of the contracts to cover bankruptcy risk had increased to 263 points, resulting in a certain headlessness in Rome.
Silvio Berlusconi pointed out to his Council of Ministers that the discrepancy between Spain and the German interest rates was 400 basis points.
His right hand, Gianni Letta, however, had expressed itself as "heavily concerned" by the "market turbulence" and a possible risk of infection from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third economy of the eurozone, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that Italy is like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, economist at the Hudson Institute.
In a clear sense, his problem is the absence of economic growth and the associated, sluggish tax receipts that put the state at risk of no longer being able to meet its financing needs.
The last Brussels forecasts were a cold shower for the government.
In the future, an Italian growth of 1.1% is expected in 2011 and of 1.4% in 2012... although the budget available to the Senate for examination is estimated at 1.3% and 2% respectively.
Under these conditions, according to the European Commission, the budget deficit will amount to 4.3% of GDP next year (compared to the 3.9%) and 3.5% predicted by governments in 2012 (rather than 2.7%).
This is also why the riot over a new budget collective, which could be used after the holidays for a sum of EUR 7 billion.
"If necessary, new austerity measures must be taken," says accountant Olli Rehn.
At the moment, Italy receives the support of international institutions.
"The foundations of Italy's economy are in order and its accounts are settled, we have been repeating this for a long time," says Arrigo Sadun, Italian trustee of the International Monetary Fund, who is entrusted with Italy with the IMF.
"At the moment there are no problems, either in the short term or in the long term, as Italy, despite its high indebtedness (119.2% of GDP in 2011, A. d. R.), is calling for less stabilisation than other countries," observes Pier Carlo Padoan, OECD chief economist.
The question of political instability remains.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will be faced with a motion of censure from the Chamber of Deputies, as a result of which the preferred elections could be held by the end of March.
So there is a slightly favourable period ahead for decision-making on a serious crisis.
Europeans are thinking about the development of anti-crisis measures
Christine Lagarde made it quite clear yesterday at a press conference in Paris: "I think they proved it on Sunday afternoon as well as in the evening: Europeans are clearly united, willing and committed to defending their currency and their currency area."
Although completely relative - yesterday's decline in the interest rates of European government bonds was water on the mills of governments as well as the ECB.
However, it is not yet possible to talk about a beginning of normalization.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's had announced that it could reduce Portugal's debt record, which is probably the most effective target of the speculators today.
"As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political perceptibility that is particularly affecting the banking systems," says the economists of Exane BNP Paribas.
Above all, "political time is much slower than that of the markets".
The European countries, which are well aware of both this gap and the danger it presents, are intensifying discussions to strengthen the existing anti-crisis measures.
The informal discussions between the most directly concerned finance ministers and, in the wider sense, with their counterparts of the G20 are progressing well.
And this also applies to the meetings of Eurogroupe and Ecofin at the beginning of next week.
The ECB meets today.
The plan includes the lot of unconventional measures to strengthen the back of the eurozone countries in the crossroads of markets (see below).
As far as the EU Stability Fund is concerned, its Executive Director, Klaus Regling, has already started his Asia tour in Singapore on Tuesday to inform investors in the Far East of developments regarding the crisis in Europe.
If the aim of his visit is not to explicitly fundraise, he will certainly prepare the terrain for this.
The first securities issues on the part of the EU Stability Fund are scheduled for next month.
Yesterday, an official American representative of the Reuters Agency had entrusted the United States with a possible increase in the funds mobilised by the IMF's additional direct involvement.
Portugal and Spain, the first countries, for their part, are sending themselves to undertake structural reforms, particularly in the field of labour market organization.
Reforms which will be added to the austerity measures, but which will have an impact in the near future.
Lisbon and Madrid take a different path from that of Greece and Ireland.
Both the one and the other have to avoid asking for international assistance at all costs before they have drawn up their own budgetary corrections and decided on essential structural reforms that will bring them back to their confidence in the long term.
In turn, European investors are talking about the options available to speed up the normalisation process of sovereign bond markets.
Axel Weber, who was on his way through Paris on 24 November, had first brought out the idea that if the 750 billions of euros mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to step back into its own pockets.
The economists of Barclays Capital, with regard to the market of European sovereign debt at the very heart of the player, judge that an extension of around EUR 100 billion would suffice, "preferably" in the form of a direct liquidity injection.
This funding exists: the European mechanism of doped financial stabilisation, which currently amounts to EUR 60 billion.
A council that has every chance of being examined carefully in the European capitals.
Especially when market conditions are at the forefront.
Snow and Smoothness: 24 Departments in Alarm Level Orange
The snow episodes still cause traffic difficulties, especially in the secondary transport networks of Brittany and threaten to affect various economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now in alarm stage Orange due to the threatening risk of snow and slippery ice.
The regions of Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienne have added to the 20 departments already in the Orange alert stage; 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, then later at night.
According to Météo France, the intense snow showers tangle the north of the Gironde as well as the Charentes, it snows lightly on the et Ile-de-France.
In the departments concerned, snow blankets of 2 to 5 cm are expected, sometimes from 7 to 10 cm, as well as 1 to 3 cm, even up to 5 cm in the Paris region.
The regions concerned are Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin.
According to Météo France, the snowfalls are considerable enough to cause traffic barriers and to affect certain economic activities.
In the Côtes d'Armor region, several regional roads are blocked for heavy traffic of over 7.5 tonnes, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac transport axes.
The traffic situation of the secondary transport networks in Brittany is very difficult, according to the traffic police, who advise against using their own vehicle only in case of emergency, and the use of some TER buses has been cancelled throughout the day.
In Picardy school traffic was cancelled for Thursday.
No specific restrictive measures were foreseen for heavy goods transport on Wednesday evening.
The prefecture "calls on drivers to be extremely careful on the roads and to adapt their driving behaviour accordingly."
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) asked airlines to delete 25% of their flights from Roissy Paris Airport on Thursday and 10% of their flights from Orly due to the expected heavy snowfall.
DGAB recommends that passengers contact their airline.
Gatwick Airports in the south of London and Edinburgh Airport, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Métro Grand Paris: First Financial Drafts
Since the debate on the modernisation of the transport economy at Ile-de-France is in full swing, it has been raining billions.
At least in the discussions.
In particular, the 23 billion for the Metro Grand Paris, to be built by the Société du Grand Paris, are remembered.
In order to guide the start of the construction of the SGP, the state has declared a capital donation of EUR 4 billion.
In the theoretical scheme, this is the sum that the SGP would then allow to give in the markets part of the financial sum to its double.
Today, it has finally come to first reckonings.
The 2010 supplementary budget, reviewed this morning by the National Assembly's Financial Commission, contains the measures envisaged to cover the first part of this budget.
These are two measures: the creation of a special tax on the development and higher taxation of offices in the Ile-de France.
The first, according to Article 15 of the draft law, is "in favour of the public-law institution Société du Grand Paris".
This figure is: "The product of this tax amounts to 117 million euros per year".
The second is a reorganization of existing corporate taxation: "to modernise it in order to increase the resulting product and to deliver this increase to the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would that bring?
A mystery.
This sum is not mentioned in the text.
Of the 4 billion you are far away.
"It is stated that the tax resources will be added to the EUR 4 billion of the capital invested by the state and the Société du Grand Paris will gradually be provided for the project," the explanatory statement is available.
The SGP does not find this system offensive at all.
"Since the moment when you book revenue (the two taxes, i.e. R.), you can cover the projectation for over three years and then draw only from the 4 billion," is explained.
"This is recorded in the budget and gradually deducted".
The SGP estimates that 2013 will start to record the 4 billion for the 2014 budget.
This measure, whose four promised billions are still to be sought for a long time, is in danger of giving rise to a fairly moving parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will take place on 7 December.
Compulsive Hackers and Emsy Spies
The affair WikiLeaks has a double meaning.
On one side, it has emerged as an obvious scandal, a scandal that is merely a scandal in the sense of hypocrisy that governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes at international level and gives a foretaste of the future dominated by regression.
But let's take the line.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation that each file created by a secret service (an x-any nation) consists exclusively of newspaper sections.
The "extraordinary", American revelations about the sexual habits of Berlusconis throw away nothing more than what you could read for months anyway in every x-any journal (except those whose owner is Berlusconi) and the terrifyingly caricatured profile of Gaddafi has been offering cabaret artists fabric for their sketches for a long time.
The rule according to which the secret dossiers may consist only of news already known is essential for the dynamics of the secret services, and not only this century.
If you go to a library dedicated to esoteric publications, you will realize that every work (about the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau, the Templers or the Rosary Kreuzlers) repeats exactly what has already been written in previous works.
This is not only because the author of occult texts does not want to publish research (yet because he did not know where to find news about the non-existent), but because those who devote themselves to occultism believe nothing but what they already know and confirm what they have already learned.
This is also the success mechanism of Dan Brown.
So are the secret files.
The informant is lazy, and lazy (or limited mind) is also the head of the secret service (otherwise he could be whatever, for example editor at Libération), who considers only true what he recognizes.
The top secret information about Berlusconi, which the American Embassy had sent to the State Department in Rome, was the same as those who had published Newsweek the week before.
Why, then, was such a lifting made for the disclosures of these dossiers?
On one hand, they say what every educated person already knows, namely that the messages - at least since the end of World War II and since then the Heads of Government can call each other or take an airplane to meet for dinner - have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of a few small representations, have turned into spy centers.
Any viewer of investigative films knows this very well, and it does not happen out of hypocrisy that one does so to ignore it.
Nevertheless, the fact that it is repeated publicly violates the mission of hypocrisy and serves to put American diplomacy in a bad light.
Second, the idea that an x-any hacker can unravel the most secret secrets of the most powerful country in the world is a significant blow to the prestige of the state department.
In addition, the scandal brings fewer victims than the "smart" ones.
But we devote ourselves to the deep nature of what has happened.
Once, at Orwell's time, all power could be bundled up like a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
Orwell's prophecy could have turned out to be perfectly correct since then, where one can control any movement thanks to the telephone, any transaction made, the hotel visited, the chosen highway and so on; the citizen would become the total victim of the eye of power.
But if one is confronted with what is happening today, that even the secret crypts of power can no longer escape the control of a hacker, the control process ceases to be one-sided and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - elected as the revenger of the citizen - can experience the secrets of power.
How, though, can a power no longer be able to keep its own secrets?
It is true, Georg Simmel already said that a real secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that any knowledge of the character Berlusconis or Merkels is basically a secret free from secrecy, since it reveals the public sphere; but in WikiLeaks' style, revealing that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets means robbing them of any power.
WikiLeaks did neither Sarkozy nor Merkel wrong, but Clinton and Obama did.
What will be the consequences of this insult to such a powerful power?
It is obvious that in the future the states will no longer put any reserved information online - that would be like a hanging attached to the street corner.
But it is equally obvious that with the current technologies it is futile to hope to be able to keep confidential reports on the phone secret.
Nothing is easier than finding out if and when a head of state has moved on to an airplane and contacted one of his colleagues.
How could private relationships be maintained in the future and only for certain ears?
I know very well that my prediction at the moment sounds like science fiction and romantic, but I see the need to imagine the government agents moving in secret ways on uncontrollable march routes, carrying their messages nowhere else than in mere memory, and also hiding the few written information they have received in shoe sales.
The information would be stored in a single copy in closed drawers: basically, Watergate's spying attempt had less success than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology is progressing like cancer these days, that is, backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communication, the Internet reconstructed a telegraph with (telephone) wire.
The (analogues) video cassettes had enabled the film researchers to explore a film band for band by flushing from behind and venting all the secrets of the assembly, while the (numeric) CDs nowadays allow nothing but jumping from chapter to chapter, i.e. in macro portions.
With the high-speed trains, you drive from Rome to Milan within three hours, while this requires three and a half hours by plane, including switching.
It is therefore not unusual for politics and communication technology to return to car and horse.
One last observation.
In ancient times, the press tried to understand what secrets were forged between the messages.
At present, it is the messages that demand confidential information from the press.
Climate: How France Speaks Beautifully its Financial Promises
One year after the Copenhagen Treaty, it is time to examine compliance with the rapidly resolved financing promises (also called "fast start" or early financing) implemented by developing countries.
And already the coarse French fine-talks have been discovered.
With the Copenhagen Treaty, developing countries have committed themselves to providing 30 billion dollars between 2010 and 2012.
The EU has promised EUR 7.2 billion over three years, France EUR 1.26 billion (i.e. EUR 420 million per year).
On the occasion of the opening of COP16, the EU has drawn all the registers to convince its partners of its commitment to fast-start financing: a detailed progress report from its Member States, a press conference, major events, brochure distribution.
Operation Transparency is remarkable and highly appreciated for its real value: developing countries and civil society like to see all developed countries do the same at the same precision level.
The EU announces that it will have released €2.2 billion in 2010, bringing it to the right path to respect its commitment of €7.2 billion in 2012.
But when you look into the details, things are a little more complicated.
According to the Copenhagen Treaty, this money should be "new and additional" to ensure that additional use has been made, without adversely affecting public development aid.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what "new and additional" means.
While the European Commission had proposed harmonisation, certain Member States, including France, blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the benchmark he considers to be the best.
For example, the European Commission has chosen as the benchmark for those in 2009: international funding is maintained and provides 150 million in the framework of the "Fast-Start" funding for over three years.
Other countries have chosen similar benchmarks, either in terms of year or in terms of conditions at the level of public development aid.
In return, France considered that the funding of "all new projects" in 2010 was "new and additional".
In other words, there are no indicative figures for the expenditure of the previous year or at the global level of public development aid.
In concrete terms, the total amount of French aid to the developing countries can remain stable (or decrease) - France proposes to comply with its commitment to "new and additional" financing.
Another crucial element is the breakdown into donations and loans.
There is no rule about this yet, and everyone chooses his calculation mode.
Some, such as France, are 1 loaned € as equivalent to 1 donated €.
Obviously, this is difficult to justify: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans can be justified for certain profitable investments (often linked to emission reduction projects based on the most effective technology), it is fraudulent to present the euro taken as an equivalent for a donated euro... In addition, only the cost of the loan for the donor country should be counted as commitment (i.e. the equivalent of an interest rate).
But France has nothing other than the following considerations: it "respects" its obligation of 420 million euros by taking up 91.5% loans (€389.8 million) and donating 8.5%) 36.1 million euros - see also the EU document to convince itself of it.
France is the only country in the EU that uses loans to a large extent.
Germany demands 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (among others) are committed to 100% with donations.
In other words, if the vast majority of the European Union spends € 1 to meet its commitments, France only gives 10 cents and understands a comparable effort.
Nice Hokuspokus!
All in all, France operates in its fast-start financing with a double vertigo: in part with a further development of the action over time and in part with the reality of financial commitment.
France manages to make it believe that it has spent 420 million "new and additional" millions in accordance with its promises and saves 36.1 million euros.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it seems that it was Bercy who carried out the arbitration) could have a double negative effect; once within the EU (why do the other Member States continue to donate if it is enough to borrow?) and then in the negotiations, because the developing countries are not completely deceived...
The chapter of early financing only a small question in a relatively short time compared to the whole of discussions on climate.
But it could be the drop too much in the immense machinery of the UNFCCC.
Let us hope that this will not be the case.
Whatever the case, it is essential to learn his lesson from this first year of early financing.
First of all, France could announce a change in its type of accounting for 2011 and 2012, in the spirit of respect for its obligations and of balancing justice with the other countries of the European Union.
Above all, however, France could bring forward the discussions on the subject of long-term financing (a different, decisive and currently discussed issue): it does not escape the question of "feasibility" or the nature of its loans.
France could change its position to be as progressive on the issues of dispute as it is on other matters.
The hope is therefore based on the new Minister for the Environment, Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprising announcement about the fast-start of France and its vision of "feasibility" as well as the use of loans would naturally lift the international trust base that is necessary for further discussions.
Alarm - pesticides taken by children
A child of 10 years takes up 81 different chemical substances over the day, such as a study published this Wednesday by the Association of Générations Futures (former movement to protect the rights and respect of future generations).
The association, which explains that its results "in view of the small number of samples analysed do not represent a statistically significant value, but represent an illustration character of the problem dealt with", had usually bought the food consumed within four, from about ten years to meals, plus an interim meal in the supermarkets in Oise and Paris between July and September.
These typical meals - including the official recommendations of five fresh fruit and fruit parts, three dairy products and 1.5 litres of water per day - have been examined as well as the rhinoceros of laboratories in search of chemical substances, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The teller balance is low-lying: 81 chemical substances, including 42 rated as possibly or probably carcinogenic and five classified as safe karziogens, as well as 37 substances with endocrine disruptor factors, according to studies of several institutions such as the International Cancer Research Centre.
"Even if the legal limits for each chemical individually consumed substance are not exceeded in the approximate total of cases, it is very clear from this survey that the reality in which the consumer is exposed to potentially carcinogenic substances or substances with endocrine disruptor factors is alarming," the association notes.
At breakfast alone, butter and tea with milk already contain more than ten of the possibly carcinogenic residues and three safely proven as carcinogenic, as well as more than twenty residues that may affect the hormone system.
The apple imported from Brazil, as an intermediate meal for the study, has traces of six chemical substances, including a fungicide banned in France.
The same applies to green beans from Kenya, included in lunch, where the study found traces of a highly prohibited insecticide in the EU.
In addition, the hack steak, the tuna from the can, even the baguette and gum of pesticides and other chemical substances were spilt.
The analyses have revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform in tap water.
At dinner the salmon steak with 34 determined chemical residues was "most abundant", and even the plastic plate used to warm the meal in the microwave was not unburdened.
The ultimate risk of this "pollutant cocktail" to the consumer is "probably underestimated", the study says.
The Alliance Europe Ecology-Les Verts (EE-LV) for its part has proposed, "in view of the urgency of the situation", the introduction of a moratorium on the use of pesticides to stop the "increase in civilisation diseases".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) on the presence of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
