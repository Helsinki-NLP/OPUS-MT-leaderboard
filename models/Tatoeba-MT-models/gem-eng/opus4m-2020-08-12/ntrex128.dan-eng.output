Politicians in Wales are afraid to "like fools"
There was dismay among some members of the Welsh National Assembly about a proposal to change their title to MWPs (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
It has arisen because of plans to change the name of the Assembly to Welsh Parliament (the Welsh Parliament).
AMs from all over the political spectrum are concerned that the change of name could lead to ridicule.
A member of the Labour Party said that his group was concerned because "it rhymes on Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means silly, and pwp means shit.
A member of the Plaid Cymru party said that the group as a whole was "not satisfied" and had proposed alternatives.
A Welsh conservative said that his group was "open" to the name change, but noticed that there is only a short verbal leap from MWP to Muppet (fjols).
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced in the same way as the letter u is pronounced in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently putting together a draft law on the introduction of name changes, said: "The final decision on the names of Members of this House is, of course, up to Members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh National Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation of the proposals, in which there was broad support for calling the Assembly a Welsh Parliament (Welsh Parliament).
As regards the title of the AMs, the Commission preferred Welsh Parliament Members or WMPs, but the MWP had the greatest support in a public consultation.
AMs seem to propose alternative options, but the struggle for consensus can prove difficult for the chairman of the assembly, Elin Jones, who is expected to draft a bill on the changes within a few weeks.
The reform proposal contains other changes in the way the assembly works, including rules on disqualification of AMs and the composition of the committee system.
The AMs will have the final vote on what they should be called when the bill is debated.
Macedonians vote to change the name of the country
The voters vote on Sunday on whether their country's name should be changed to "Republic of Northern Macedonia".
The vote will take place in an attempt to resolve a decade-long conflict with the neighbouring country of Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that their northern neighbour's name is a claim on Greece's territory and has long protested against Macedonia's attempt to become a member of the European Union and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov opposes the vote and says he will vote.
Supporters of the vote, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change of name is only a price paid to become a member of the European Union and NATO.
The clocks of St. Martin's remain silent while the churches of Harlem fight
"The older people I have spoken to said that in the old days there was a bar and a church on each corner," said Mr. Adams.
"Today there are none of the parts."
He said it's understandable that the bars are disappearing.
"People socialize in other ways these days," he said.
"Bars no longer constitute the neighborhood's living rooms, where people enter on a daily basis."
In relation to churches, he is concerned that the money obtained from selling assets does not last long and that they are "before or later back where they started".
He adds that churches could be replaced by apartment complexes that are full of the kind of people who do not help the neighborhood's recurring sites.
"The overwhelming majority of people who buy property in these buildings are white," he says, "and it breathes further to the development where these churches eventually close completely, because it is unlikely that most of the people who move into the property will become members of the churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis – Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin's a decade later.
The original Methodist congregation moved out in the 1930s.
A black congregation that had worked nearby took over the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation under priest John Howard Johnson, who was at the head of a boycott of shops on 125th Street, one of the main shopping streets in Harlem, who would not employ or promote blacks.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but when Father Johnson’s parishioners planned to restore the building, they ordered the bellplay.
Priest David Johnson, father Johnson's son and successor in St. Martin's, proudly called the bellplay "the poor's bells".
The expert who played at the bellplay in June called it something else: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also noticed that it was the first bellplay in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger bellplay in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin's did not find a substitute for him.
What has been happening in St. Martin's over the past few months has been a complicated story about architects and entrepreneurs, some of whom have been obtained by church leaders, others by the bishophood.
In July the Church Council – the leading body of the parish, composed of leading laymen – wrote to the bishop's judgment on concerns that the diocese "would try to push the expenses forward" to the Congregation Council, even though the Congregation Council had not been involved in appointing the architects and entrepreneurs whom the diocese sent in.
Some members of the congregation complained about a lack of transparency on the part of the bishop.
Shark hurts 13-year-old scuba diving for lobsters in California
A shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy on Saturday as he dived for lobsters in California on the first day of the lobster season, says officials.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told the KSWB TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and then with a group paddled over to him to help him out of the water.
Hammel says he thought it was just a thrill to have caught a lobster, but then he realized that the boy was shouting, "I was bitten!
I was bitten!"
"Here his collarbone was torn up," said Hammel, "he saw when he came to the boy.
"I cried out that everyone should come out of the water: 'There is a shark in the water!'" added Hammel.
The boy was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is reported in critical condition.
It's not known what kind of shark attacked.
The lifeguard Larry Giles said by a media briefing that a shark had been seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was not considered a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries on his upper torso.
Officials closed the access to the beach on the route from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for security reasons and to carry out investigations.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 sharks in the area but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the beauty market in the UK
Sainsbury's takes up the competition with Boots, SuperDrugs and Debenhams with rows of beauty products with special assistants like storm agasins.
As part of a major effort to absorb Britain's beauty market, which has a value of GBP 2.8 billion and continues to grow, while fashion and home products are falling. The larger rows of beauty products are being tested in 11 shops around the country and launched in several shops next year if they turn out to be a success.
The investment in beauty products takes place as supermarkets look for new goods for shelves previously used for television, microwaves and household products.
Sainsbury's says that they double their selection of beauty products to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, introduced for the first time.
The existing ranges from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees also get more space with branded areas like those seen in shops like Boots.
The supermarket also relaunches the range of boutique makeup, so most of the products are suitable for vegans – something that is increasingly required by younger shoppers.
In addition, Fragrance Shop is testing perfume shops in two Sainsbury's shops. The first opened in Croydon in the south of London last week, and the second opens in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Online shopping and a trend towards buying small quantities of food daily from local merchants means that supermarkets need to do more to get people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, director of Sainsbury's, has said that the stores are going to look like storm warehouses, as the supermarket chain takes up the competition with the discount chains Aldi and Lidl by introducing more services and goods that are not food.
Sainsbury's has introduced Argos outlets in hundreds of shops and has also introduced a number of Habitat outlets since they bought both chains two years ago. These measures have strengthened their sale of groceries and have made purchases more profitable.
The supermarket's previous attempts to update beauty and pharmacy departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint action with Boots in the early 00s, but the collaboration ended with an argument about how the profits of the pharmacies in the supermarkets were to be distributed.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold their 281-store pharmacy chain to Celesio, who owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, 125 GBP three years ago.
According to the strategy, Lloyds will play a role in the plan by adding an additional range of luxury care brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, said: "We have changed the look and decor of our range of beauty products to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be available to give advice.
Our range of brands is designed to suit all needs and the absorbent environment and the practical locations mean that we are now a convincing destination that challenges the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones "rapid", after Holly Willoughby withdraws from agreement to GBP 11 million
Dragons' Den Star Peter Jones left "rapid", after the TV host Holly Willoughby withdraws from agreement to GBP 11 million with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their home product and accessories brand True.
The company had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrows Goop brand.
This Morning host, 37, went to Instagram to announce that she is leaving the project.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragons' Den-star Peter Jones furious, after she withdraws from their lucrative lifestyle brand at the last moment – to focus on her own new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say that Jones was "rapid" when the popular TV woman during a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new agreements – with a value of up to GBP 1.5 million – meant that she no longer had enough time for their home product and accessories brand True.
The company had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrows Goop brand and was tipped to double Willoughby’s estimated GBP 11 million worth.
Willoughby, 37, went to Instagram to announce that she left True while Jones flew out of Britain to one of his holiday homes.
One source said, "Truly was one of Holly's top priorities.
It should have been a long-term project that she should have dealt with in the next few decades.
Her decision to withdraw surprised everyone involved.
No one would believe what happened on Tuesday.
There is a stock full of goods at Marlow headquarters, which is already ready for sale."
Experts estimate that the report from This Morning host, which is among the highest-profit stars in the UK, can cost the company several million because of large investments in products – everything from pillows to candles to clothing and home products – and the potential for further delays in launch.
And it can also be the end of a long friendship.
Mother of three Willoughby and householder Dan Baldwin have had a close relationship with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby created True together with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined the board in March.
The two couples go on vacation together, and Jones owns 40% of the shares in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby shall be the fire ambassador for M&S and replace Ant McPartlin as host at ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source near Jones said last night, "We couldn't comment on his business activities."
Hard talk, and then we fell in love.
He made fun of the criticism he would get from the news media to give a comment that "is not a president worthy" and to be so positive to the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said in his parody on a newsword.
"I gave up nothing."
He noted that Kim was interested in another meeting, after Trump proclaimed their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards nuclear disarmament of North Korea.
But the negotiations on nuclear disarmament have stopped.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders in the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see a "correspondence" from the United States in relation to North Korea's initial action against disarmament.
He noted that instead the United States continues with sanctions aimed at keeping the pressure running.
Trump adopted a more optimistic view of the speech at his electoral meeting.
"It's going really well with North Korea," he said.
"There was an uproar of war with North Korea.
Millions of people could have been killed.
Now we have a wonderful relationship."
He said that his attempts to improve the relationship with Kim had produced positive results – the end of rockets, the release of hostages and the repatriation of Earth leftovers from American military men.
And he defended his unusual approach to Kim.
"It's so easy to behave stately, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this dense arena, we'd have about 200 people standing there," said Trump, pointing to the group right in front of him.
Indonesian tsunami and earthquakes ravage island and kill hundreds
For example, in the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, non-governmental organisations were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 per cent of Lombok’s population were homeless, there was no declaration of national state of emergency, which is a prerequisite for the call for international emergency aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases it has been clear that they are not asking for international assistance, so it is a little challenging," said Sumbung.
While Save the Children is putting together a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet certain whether foreign employees can work in the field.
Mr Sutopo, spokesman for the National Emergency Response, said that Indonesian officials assessed the situation in Palu to see if international organisations would be allowed to contribute to the emergency response.
Because of the constant earthquakes facing Indonesia, the country is very badly prepared for natural disasters.
Tsunami resorts have been built in Aceh, but they are not a common view of other coastlines.
A warning was issued in Palu, but apparently a tsunamisir is missing, and it has probably affected the death toll.
Even under the best conditions, it is challenging to travel between the many islands of Indonesia.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that has been in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the new accident site.
President Joko Widodo made Indonesia's inadequate infrastructure a central point in his election campaign, and he has spent a lot of money on roads and trains.
However, Mr Joko's administration has been plagued by a lack of funding in the course of the election campaign next year.
Mr Joko also experiences pressure from underlying sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have taken on a more conservative form of faith.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands removed from their homes when Christian and Muslim gangs fought on the streets with machetes, bows and arrows and other primitive weapons.
See: Liverpools Daniel Sturridge settles against Chelsea at the last moment
Daniel Sturridge rescued Liverpool from a defeat in the Premier League to Chelsea with a scoring on the 89th minute Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a delivery from Xherdan Shaqiri small 30 meters from Chelsea's goal, while his team was back with 1-0.
He pointed to the ball with left foot before making a high shot against the farthest pole.
The ball flew high above the field towards the top right corner of the net.
The ball dropped over a jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
"It was just about getting in the position of getting hold of the ball. Players like Shaq always try to get as far ahead as possible, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible," said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming, and I made a single touch, and I didn't think so much about it, and I just took the shot."
Chelsea led 1-0 at the half-game, after the Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The Chelsea-angrier returned with his heel back to Mateo Kovacic before he set off on the midway and sprinted into Liverpool's runway half.
Kovacic made a quick one-two in the middle course.
He then made a long delivery that led Hazard into the field.
Hazard ran away from the defense and ended against the most distant pole with a left foot shot past Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool fights Naples in the Champions League group game at 15 Wednesday at Stadium San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea plays against Videoton in UEFA Europa Leaguge at 15 Thursday in London.
Death rates from tsunami in Indonesia rise to 832
The death toll from Indonesia's earthquakes and tsunami has risen to 832 reports the country's disaster preparedness early Sunday.
Many were reported trapped in the quarries from buildings that fell after the earthquake, measuring 7.5 on the judge scale. It hit Friday and created up to 6 meters high waves, told the spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at a news conference.
The city of Palu, which has over 380,000 inhabitants, was covered with debris from collapsed buildings.

Parliament's status of Cromwell will be the latest memorial of the discussion on the rewriting of history.
The removal would be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of so many of England's cultural and religious artifacts carried out by his fanatical, Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as "crazy" and an "try to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of statues that the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside the palace at Westminster would become a goal.
The image storm during the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor performed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for his great-grandfather Thomas' actions in the last century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's amazing image of Cromwell is a testimony to 19th century attitudes and part of the history of a figure that many still think is worth paying tribute.
Mr Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of Parliament against external pressure, in his case pressure from the monarchy.
Whether it is an accurate representation is subject to ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is one recognizable figure representing one side of the struggle.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worth saluting and commemorating."
Dræbergris Attacks and Kills Chinese Farmer
According to local media reports, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in southwestern China.
The man, identified only under his surname "Yuan", was found dead with an exaggerated artery and stained in blood near a pighouse in the Liupanshui market in Guizhou Province, South China reported Morning Post Sunday.
A pig farm is preparing to inject pigs with vaccines at a pig farm on 30 May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He had allegedly traveled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The following morning the cousin found him dead and discovered that a door to the pig path next to it was open.
He said that there was a large herd of blood in his mouth in the pig's path.
A forensic investigation confirmed that the pig of 250 kg had bitten the farmer to death, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and injured," said the cousin, who goes under the surname "Wu", in a quote from Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed that Yuan entered the market at 4:40 on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market leader told Evening News that the pig had been locked away to prevent it from attacking others while the police are collecting evidence at the crime scene.
It is reported that Yuan's family and authorities from the market are negotiating compensation for his death.
It belongs to the rarity, but there are previously recorded cases where pigs have attacked people.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts and left the man with serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 20 - pound [295 kg] pig mustered a Welsh farmer against his tractor, into his wife's scare away the animal.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba CBC News told that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a "trigger".
"They're just playwrights.
Those guys, they're very curious... they're not trying to hurt you.
You just have to treat them with respect," he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa are expected to give heavy rain in much of the South West USA
As forecast, Hurricane Rosa becomes weaker as it moves over the cooler waters of Mexico’s northern coast.
However, Rosa will rain heavily with flooding in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States over the coming days.
Rosa had 38 m/s, a Category 1 hurricane, at 10 Sunday (Danish time) and was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, a low pressure outlet is forming across the Pacific, moving east towards the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the peninsula of Baja California on Monday as a tropical storm, it begins pushing tropical moisture north into the southwestern United States.
Rosa will give up to 254 mm of rain in parts of Mexico Monday.
Then the tropical moisture will interact with the nearer low-pressure outlet and create heavy rain in the south-west of the United States in the days to come.
Locally, 25 to 101 mm of rain will create dangerous storms, liquid precipitation and possibly landslides in the desert.
The tropical moisture will create rain at up to 51 to 76 mm of rain per hour locally, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 51 to 101 mm of rain is expected in parts of the southwestern United States, especially over large parts of Arizona.
There is a great likelihood of storm floods with rapidly deteriorating conditions because of the scattered nature of tropical rain.
It would be a very bad idea to move out into the desert on foot when there is a danger of tropical rain.
Heavy rain can turn chasms into roaring rivers and thunder will create powerful local winds and create dusty wind.
The approaching low - pressure outlet will provide heavy coastal rain in parts of southern California.
There is a risk of a total rainfall of more than 13 mm, which may result in smaller amounts of liquid precipitation and smooth roads.
This would be the region's first rainfall in their rainy season.
Scattered tropical rain showers will approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday and spread more late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the Four Corners area on Tuesday and will continue on Wednesday.
In October there may be great temperature fluctuations throughout the United States, as the Arctic gets cooler, but the tropics remain relatively warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in the temperature over short distances.
There is a good example of dramatic temperature differences throughout the central United States on Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of almost 11 degrees between Kansas City in Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa.
Over the next few days, the remaining summer heat will try to build up and expand again.
Large parts of the central and eastern United States are expected to experience a warm start in October with temperatures above 26 degrees from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
There may be up to 26 degrees in New York City Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above the average.
Our long climate outlook indicates that temperatures are very likely to rise above the average in the eastern US in the first half of October.
Over 20 million saw the consultation of Brett Kavanaugh
Over 20 million witness statements from the nominee to the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of a sexual assault allegedly taking place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television stations.
At the same time, the political struggle continued with stations that interrupted the regular programs to tell about Friday's late development: an agreement made up of Senator from Arizona Jeff Flake, who allowed the FBI to investigate the charges for a week.
Ford told the Senate's judicial committee that she is 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh in drunken condition was grunting at her and trying to take her clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh said in an emotional testimony that he's 100 percent sure it didn't happen.
According to Nielsen, it is likely that 20.4 million saw that Friday.
The company listed average ratings on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
There were no immediately available ratings from other stations showing it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has problems measuring how many people watch programs in offices.
To put it in perspective, it's an audience that matches a fight during the NFL playoffs or the Oscar distribution.
Fox News Channel, whose polled hosts have strongly supported the appointment of Kavanaugh, was at the top of all stations with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the hearing, which lasted all day long, said Nielsen.
ABC was second-ranked with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
The interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that he would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, he was captured for open CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning, while demonstrators shouted at him when he tried to take an elevator to the hearing of the Judicial Committee.
He stood with a downturned gaze for several minutes while he was being scolded, and CNN sent live.
"I'm standing right here in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?"
He was told, "You have so much power, and so many women are powerless."
Flake said that his office had issued a statement and said before the elevator closed that he would have more to say at the hearing in committee.
All the television stations covered live a few hours later, when the Judicial Committee was to vote on whether Kavanaugh's nomination should proceed to a vote for the entire Senate.
But Flake said that he would only vote in favour of the belief that the FBI would investigate the charges against the nominee in the following week, as the democrats, who are in the minority in the Senate, had demanded.
Flake was partly convinced by conversations with his friend, the democratic senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and a number of senators afterwards, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice had an influence because it was clear that the Republicans would not have votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation of the charges against Kavanaugh.
UK Prime Minister accuses critics of "playing politics" with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the EU to "play politics" with Britain's future and undermine national interests.
UK Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham in the UK on 29 September 2018.
In another interview next to that with Theresa May on the front page of the newspaper, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson made his attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit and said that a proposal that Britain and the EU should collect each other's tariffs was "all through ridiculous".
Shotcrab on Wayde Sims: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson suspected of standing behind the LSU player's death
The police have arrested a suspect for the shooting at Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and imprisoned under suspicion of negligent manslaughter, said the Baton Rouge police.
Officials released video of the Sims-Simpson confrontation, and the police said that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police found the glasses at the crime scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on it, reported the CBS subsidiary WAFB.
After the hearing of Simpson, the police said he confessed to the shooting at Wayde.
His bail is set at $350,000, the lawyer reports.
The juror in East Baton Rouge Parish issued a preliminary report on Friday saying that the cause of death was a wound from a gunshot that went from head to neck.
The police department says that a task force from Louisiana State Police, the state police laboratory, the police from Southern University and citizens in the area have assisted in the investigation leading to the arrest.
The sports manager at LSU, Joe Alleva, thanked the police in the area for their "care and search for justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 198 cm high forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per match last season.
Friday morning, the basketball coach at LSU, Will Wade, said that the team is "crush" and "in shock" at Wayde's death.
"That's the kind of thing you're always afraid of," said Wade.
Volcano Spears Ashes About Mexico City
Ash spewed from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern districts of Mexico’s capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity arose in the crater and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded in 24 hours.
The center monitored the rumblings and tremors over several rounds.
Pictures on social media showed thin layers of ash on car windows in neighborhoods of Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noted increased activity in the volcano, located 72 kilometres southeast of the capital, since an earthquake measuring 7.1 on the judge scale shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
The police meet with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the vote on independence
Six were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday, after demonstrators who want independence, in the wake of thousands of participating in rival demonstrations marking the first anniversary of Catalonia's polar vote on liberation.
A group of masked separatists held the rioters back, threw with and powder paint and created dark dust clouds on streets that would normally be full of tourists.
There were also fights later in the day, where the police used their staff to keep the fights down.
For several hours, independence groups shouted "Not forgotten, nothing forgiven", and were met with Unionist demonstrators who shouted "Long live Spain".
14 people were treated for minor injuries that occurred during the protests, the local press reported.
The mood is still high in the region of independence one year after the vote on 1 October, which was declared illegal from Madrid but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The voters voted overwhelmingly for independence, but the electorate's affiliation was low, and those who opposed the detachment boycotted the vote in a large way.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop the vote during violent clashes at polling stations throughout the region.
Independence groups had camped night to Friday to prevent a demonstration to support the national police.
The demonstration was held, but was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said that he no longer dares to hope that Catalonia can achieve independence.
"Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying for joy in having been given the opportunity to vote, but now we are stuck," he said.
Although they got a narrow but important victory in the regional elections last December, the Catalan independence parties have fought to maintain momentum, and many of their best-known leaders have either themselves moved into exile or are in detention, awaiting judgment for their role in holding the vote and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, recorded the protests on his phone in support of the police and said that the conflict was created by politicians on both sides.
"There'll be more and more tension," he said.
On Saturday, Mr Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who has been waiting for his trial since last year, announced that he would stand up for the European Parliament elections next year.
"The position of candidate in the European elections is the best way to reject the setback in democratic values and the subversion we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested, after house hit by car
Three men of 33, 34, and 39 were arrested after a car bumped into a house in Londonderry several times.
The incident took place at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 19.30 BST.
Detective Bob Blemmings said there was damage to the gates and the building itself.
Perhaps a crossbow was also fired at the car at some point.
Shots from Menga give Livingston victory at 1-0 over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured the victory
The rises of Livingston overcame the Rangers and gave Steven Gerrard his second defeat after 18 matches as manager of the Ibrox Club.
Dolly Mengas shot made the difference when Gary Holt's team moved side by side with Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's team has not won out in the league this season and will meet the leading Hearts team, after which they are eight points, next Sunday.
Before that, the Rangers will be visited by Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, in turn, is expanding their undefeated streak to six games, and Chief Coach Holt has still not had a defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston misses chances against cash stamina
Holt's team should have been ahead of long before they scored, and their direct playing style created major problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but handed in across the target, after which Alan Lithgow inevitably hit outside the target, after he slipped in to hit Craig Halkett's transversal header in front of the target.
The home team was pleased to let the Rangers play in front of them because they knew they could give the stamina problems in the event of death.
And it was under the circumstances that the important goal came.
Rangers went freepark, and Livingston took advantage of an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson together created the layout for Menga, which made a touch and scored from the middle of the field.
At that time, Rangers had dominated the ball ownership, but fought to get through the home team's defenses, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was virtually not challenged.
The pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced a rescue from Kelly.
Scott Pittman's shot was averted with the feet of Rangers target Allan McGregor, and Lithgow shot outside the frame during another of Livingston's deathball situations.
There were repeated deliveries into Livingston's field but were prevented, and two demands for a penalty park – after Halkett's strike on Glenn Middleton and one by hand on the ball – were rejected.
"A phenomenal" from Livingston – analysis
BBC Scotlands Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal effort and strong result for Livingston.
All played fantastically and exceed the expectations of their upward journey.
Their playing style and troops are largely unchanged since their return to the best league, but a large part of the honor must go to Holt for the way he has strengthened the team since he joined.
There were a lot of heroes.
Commander Halkett was fantastic and led a well-organized defense, and Menga held Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on his toes throughout the game.
The Rangers, however, lacked inspiration.
They have sometimes been really good under Gerrard, but they played under level.
Their endings lacked sharpness – only once they got exposed to the home team – and it is a sudden awakening for Rangers, who is in the middle of the scoreboard.
Erdogan receives mixed reception in Köln
There was smile and blue sky Saturday (September 29) when Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve relations with the two NATO members.
There has been disagreement over areas such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's rapprochement with the European Union.
Erdogan then went to Köln to open a new, large mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police held a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but a lot of supporters appeared nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of Erdogan opponents – many of them Kurdish – also took note and condemned both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to accept them.
The competing protests reflect a controversial guest who is seen as a hero by some German Turks and mocked as an autocrat by others.
Accidents on the way in Deptford: Cyclist dies in collision with car
A cyclist is dead in a collision with a car in London.
The accident occurred close to the crossing between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford in the southwestern part of the city around 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped, and there were rescuers on site, but the man died on site.
The accident occurs a few months after another cyclist died in a collision with a car whose driver fled the site, on Children's Street, about six miles from Saturday's accident.
Metropolitan Police said police officers were working to identify the man and inform his relatives.
Roadblocks are set up, bus routes are changed, and motorists are encouraged to stay away from the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Officers Damaged During Distress
Six prison officers have been injured in a high - security prison, according to the Prison Office.
There was unrest in the prison of HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 9.30 BST on Sunday, and the unrest is still going on.
Specialized "Tornado" officers have been brought in to deal with the riots involving eight inmates and going into one wing of the prison.
The officers were treated for minor facial injuries on site.
A spokesperson for Prison Service said: "Specially trained prison staff are deployed to deal with the ongoing unrest in HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees have been treated for damage.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and are resolved that those responsible will be reported to the police and may end up spending longer time behind bars."
HMP Long Lartin has over 500 inmates, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison inspector was treated in the hospital after being attacked by an inmate.
And last October, rioters were called to prison to deal with serious riots in which employees were attacked with billiard bullets.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with storm floods (dry areas may take advantage)
It is rare for a tropical low pressure to hit Arizona, but this is most likely to happen at the beginning of next week when the remains of Hurricane Rosa move across the desert landscape in the south-west USA and create a risk of storm flood.
National Weather Service has already issued warnings about storm floods for Monday and Tuesday in Western Arizona, eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a direct route over Phoenix Tuesday with arrival late Monday with rain.
National Weather Service in Phoenix pointed out in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones had maintained tropical storm status or low pressure within 320 km of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 64 km of the border with Arizona."
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center provide 51 to 102 mm of rain with isolated amounts up to 152 mm in the Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Other areas of the south-western desert landscape, including the central Rocky Mountains and Great Basin, will probably get 25 to 51 mm with the possibility of 102 mm locally.
For those outside the risk of storm floods, the rain of Rosa can be a blessing because the region is hit by drought.
Flooding is a very serious matter, but it is likely that some of the rain will be useful because the South-West United States is currently experiencing drought.
According to the U.S. drought monitoring, just over 40 percent of Arizona experiences at least extreme drought, the second highest category," reports weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa is expected to land on the peninsula of Baja California in Mexico.
Rosa still has hurricane power on Sunday morning with maximum wind strength of 38 m/s and is located 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and moves north at 19 km/h.
The storm meets cooler waters in the Pacific and therefore falls in strength.
It is therefore expected to hit Mexico with tropical power on Monday afternoon or evening.
The rain over parts of Mexico can become strong and give rise to a high risk of flooding.
"Precipitation of a total of 76 to 152 mm from Baja California to the north-west Sonora with a potential of up to 254 mm", reported weather.com.
Rosa will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the border to Arizona early in the morning Tuesday as a tropical low pressure, which will then move up through Arizona and into the southern Utah late Tuesday evening.
"The main expected danger from Rosa or the remains of it is very heavy rain in Baja California, the north-west Sonora and the south-west desert region of the United States," reported the National Hurricane Center.
The rain is expected to create life - threatening storms and floating falls in deserts as well as landslides in mountain terrain.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four Arrested for Homicide Attempts
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man are under arrest under suspicion of attempted murder, after a 16-year-old was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found wounded in the Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton around 4 BST Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital where his condition is reported to be stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man was arrested during the night in the Radstock area, reports the police in Avon and Somerset.
Officers have called on anyone who may have mobile recordings of the incidents to come forward.
Trump says that Kavanaugh was the subject of the democratic party's "wrath and anger"
"A voice in Judge Kavanaugh is a voice against the ruthless and monstrous tactics of the democratic party," said Trump at an electoral meeting in Wheeling in West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh has been exposed to "the evil, the anger" of the democratic party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh made a witness statement in front of Congress Thursday and strongly denied the accusations of Christine Blasey Ford that he had committed sexual abuse for her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also gave a witness statement at the hearing on his allegations.
The president said on Saturday that the "American people saw the skill, quality and courage" at Kavanaugh that day.
"A voice at the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh is a voice that confirms one of the most skilled legal minds of our time, a lawyer with a fantastic past in public service," he said to a group of supporters in West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to the nomination of Kavanaugh, while he spoke of the importance of republican attendance at the polling stations at the mid-term elections.
"In five weeks, there will be one of the most important choices in our lifetime.
You can't vote for me, but you're actually voting for me," he said.
"That's why I'm going around fighting for great candidates."
Trump argued that the Democrats are on a mission to "dispute and block".
The first important procedural vote in the Senate on the nomination of Kavanaugh is expected to take place by Friday at the latest, a person high in the Republican Party has told CNN.
Several hundred killed by Indonesian earthquakes and tsunami, the death toll is growing
At least 384 were killed, and many of them washed away by huge waves that struck the beach when a great earthquake and a great tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, said authorities Saturday.
Several hundred people were gathered at a festival on the beach in Palu City on Friday, when up to five feet [6 m] high waves hit the coast at dusktime, many sucked in death and destroyed everything on their way.
The tsunami arose after an earthquake that measured 7.5 on the judge scale.
"When the Tsunamit Russel arose yesterday, people were still engaged in activities on the beach. They did not immediately run and became victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's disaster preparedness GDPB, during a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come alone, the towed cars, tree trunks, houses, it hit everything on land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had moved through the open sea at 800 km/h before it hit the coast.
More people managed to survive by climbing trees to escape the tsunami, he said.
About 16,700 were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
The disaster preparedness has published aerial photographs showing many damaged buildings and shops, twisted and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
Afterdaughters continued to shake the coastal town on Saturday.
The range of earthquakes could be felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Technology Assessment and Application Board (BPPT) said in an announcement that the energy released during Friday's great earthquake was about 200 times more powerful than the nuclear bomb that was thrown over Hiroshima during World War II.
The city is geographically located at the end of a long, narrow bay, and it may have made the tsunami bigger, said the board.
Nugroho described the damage as "comprehensive" and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of a number of victims were found trapped under the debris from collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 had been injured and that 29 were reported missing.
Nugroho said that the number of deaths and injuries could be greater along the 300 km long coastline north of Palu, the Donggala area, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communication "was completely paralyzed without information" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
"There are more than 300,000 here," said Red Cross in an announcement and added that their employees and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, but it could get a lot worse," they said.
The board was criticized on Saturday from many fronts not to mention that a tsunami had hit Palu, but officials said that the waves had arrived within the time of the warning.
In amateur recordings shared on social media, you can hear a man on the top floor of a building that desperately shouts warnings about the tsuamia coming closer to people on the street below.
Within minutes, a wall of water strikes the coast and carries buildings and cars away.
Reuters could not verify the authenticity of the recordings immediately.
The earthquake and the tsunami caused a major power failure that cut off the communication around Palu and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate the rescue effort.
The military has begun to send cargo aircraft with emergency aid from Jakarta and other cities, reporting authorities, but there is still a strong need for food and basic needs among the evacuated.
The city airport has been reopened, but only for relief work, and remains closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is expected to visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll after Indonesian tsunami is over 800.
It's really bad.
World Vision employees from Donggala have come safely to Palu city, where employees seek shelter under tarpaulins set up in the courtyard at their account. They came past areas with extensive road damage, said Dosaba.
"They told me they had so many broken houses," he said.
It's really bad.
Even when relief organizations started to work hard to put relief work back on, there were complaints that foreign relief workers with extensive expertise were prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian legislation, financial support, supplies and staff from abroad must only enter if the area where the accident has occurred is declared to be a national disaster area.
It hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a disaster at the provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, spokesperson for Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says 'OK, it's a national disaster', we can open up international assistance, but there's no status yet."
On the second night in Palu after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, friends and family held to the missing people in the hope that their closest would be the miracles that brighten the gloomy tales of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled up by a sewer.
On Saturday, rescue workers released a woman who had been caught under rubble for two days with her mother’s body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders to Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other of those captured at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were among his students.
"As a veteran in paragliding, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon told us how during the hours, after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel circulated in paragliding circles, he had desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the participants in Palu, who attended the festival on the beach.
However, his messages resulted in only one gray flybone instead of two blue ones.
"I think that means that the messages were not delivered," he says.
Twenty take 26,750 USD while filling up the ATM in Newport on the Levee
Twenty stole USD 26,750 Friday morning from a Brink's employee who was fulfilling a ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport police.
The driver of the car had emptied the ATM into the entertainment complex and prepared to deliver more money, wrote detective Dennis McCarthy in the press release.
While he was busy, another man ran "up the back of the Brink's employee" and stole a bag money that should have been delivered.
Witnesses saw more suspects fleeing the scene, according to the press release, but the police did not indicate how many were involved in the incident.
Everyone with information on the identity of the thieves, please contact the Newport police on 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
He announced the switch on Saturday on Twitter, where he wrote, "The creature previously known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has had the nickname Ye for a while and used the name as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change takes place before his performance in Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande on the show, who canceled for "emotional reasons," said the creator of the show.
The name is an abbreviation of his present artist name, but West has previously said that the name has religious significance for him.
"I believe that 'ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," said West earlier this year, discussing his album title with the radio host Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
It went from Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye – which is a reflection of our good, bad and confused sides, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are."
He is one of a number of famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs has changed between Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he reported that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
One of West's former partners, JAY-Z, has also switched between lower and upper case letters and changed whether the tie is included.
Mexico's AMLO promises not to use military force against civilians
Mexico's newly elected President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has promised never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches 50 years for a bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he "would never ever use the military to oppress the Mexican people."
Tropper shot at a peaceful demonstration on the ground on 2 October 1968 and killed up to 300 at a time when left-wing student movements were raging in many places in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly state grants to students and opening up several free, open universities.
He has said that unemployment and the lack of educational opportunities drag young people into criminal gangs.
The US should double the funding of artificial intelligence
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount they spend on research in the field, says investor and AI user Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come, after various parts of the US government have issued announcements on artificial intelligence. However, the United States still lacks a formal strategy for artificial intelligence.
However, China introduced its plan last year and aims to take the lead in innovation in artificial intelligence by 2030.
"It would be a good idea to double the research budget for artificial intelligence, as all other countries are so far behind the US, and we are looking for the next major breakthrough in AI," said Lee.
The doubling of the budget could double the chances of the next major achievement of artificial intelligence in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee published the book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" this month at Houghton Mifflin Harcourt and is Managing Director of Innovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the most prominent companies in artificial intelligence in China, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University he worked on a system of artificial intelligence that beat the highly ranked American Othello player, and later he became head of Microsoft Research and Director of Google’s branch in China.
Lee recognised previous technology competitions supported by the US government, such as the Robotics Challenge held by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when a new competition was coming to identify the next visionary.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to obtain government grants, says Lee.
"It's not China that takes the academic leaders, it's the big companies," said Lee.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have employed star students from universities to work with artificial intelligence.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could also help the United States to strengthen its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I think that PhDs within artificial intelligence must have automatically offered work permits.
The Chinese State Council issued its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
China’s National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people in academic institutions in a way that corresponds to the National Science Foundation and the distribution of money by other state organizations to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China,” said Lee.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defence set up a joint centre for artificial intelligence to involve partners from industry and research, and the White House announced the foundation of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced an investment of USD 2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
NSF currently invests over USD 100 million a year in research into artificial intelligence.
However, American legislation, which is trying to set up a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence, has been standing still for several months.
Macedonians vote to change the name of the country
The Macedonian people voted on Sunday on whether their country's name should be changed to "Republic of Northern Macedonia", an action that would resolve a decade-old conflict with Greece that has blocked Macedonia's attempt to gain membership of the EU and NATO.
Greece has a province called Macedonia and maintains that the name of its neighbouring country towards the north constitutes a claim on Greek territory and has therefore used their veto when Macedonia has applied for accession to NATO and the EU.
The two governments concluded an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents believe that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's primary Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that he will not take part in the vote, and a boycott campaign has raised doubts as to whether the number of voters will be the 50 % required for the vote to be valid.
The question on the ballot was: "Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that it is a price worth paying to create access to associations such as the European Union and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that arose as a result of the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote on the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because it means more secure lives for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
The vote is not legally binding, but enough Members of this House have said that they will respect the result of the vote and assert it.
The change of name would require a majority in Parliament of two thirds.
The state electoral commission said that no irregularities had been reported at 3 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16% compared to 34% in the latest parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of registered voters voted.
"I voted today because of my children. We belong in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital of Skopje.
Macedonia's Prime Minister, Zoran Zaev, his wife, Zorica and his son, Dushko, took part in the vote in Macedonia on a change in the name of the country that would open up to membership of NATO and the EU, in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
Before Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small stage and pulled up chairs in front of tents set up by those who will boycott the vote.
"We are for NATO and the European Union, but we want membership with raised foreheads, not the back door," said Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want us to be like Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of European-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership would give a strongly needed investment in Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe that a large majority will vote in favour because over 80% of our citizens are in favour of the European Union and NATO," said Zaev after giving his vote.
He said that a "yes" result would be a "secure of our future".
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonia Institute for Political Research indicated that between 30 and 43 per cent of voters would participate in the vote – less than the required turnout.
Another poll conducted by the Macedonian TV channel Telma TV indicated that 57 percent of the respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said they would vote in favour.
For the vote to be valid, the turnout must be at least 50 per cent plus one vote.
If the vote fails, it will be the first major political loss for the pro-Western government since it took place in May last year.
See: Manchester Cities Sergio Aguero fights throughout Brighton defense and scores
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling fought the Brighton defense in Manchester City's 2-0 victory Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy with his scoring coming after 65 minutes.
The Argentinean attacker received an episode on the midway at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran fast past three Brighton defenders before he swung out on the open track.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green shirts.
He fought past one defender and then ran from several on the edge of Brighton's field.
He then made a left handover and found Sterling.
The English forward used his first touch in the field to give the ball back to Aguero, who used his right boot to outsmart the Brighton goalie Mathew Ryan with a shot in the right side of the net.
"Aguero is struggling with some problems with his feet," said the city manager Pep Guardiola.
"We talked about him playing around 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he scored a goal at that moment."
But it was Sterling who gave Sky Blues the immediate lead in the Premier League game.
That target arrived after 29 minutes.
Aguero received in the sequence the ball deep into Brighton's territory.
He sent a nice delivery along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane took a few touches before he led Sterling towards the farthest pole.
The Sky Blues-forward dashed the ball into the net just before it slipped past the goal.

Scherzer wants to do some rockies
Nationals have been eliminated from playoff participation, so they didn't have much to fight for.
But the always competitive Scherzer hopes to take the caste on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if there is still the opportunity to participate in playoffs for Rockies, who have played a battle more than the Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West.
The Rockies held at least in a wild-card slot with a 5-2 victory over the Nationals Friday night, but still have their first division title for good.
"Even if we don't have anything to play for, we can go to the game knowing that the atmosphere would be at its highest among the audience here in Denver, and that the opponents would play at the enough highest level I'm going to face this year.
Why shouldn't I be excited to play under those conditions?"
The Nationals have not yet announced the start-up to Sunday, but will probably put Scherzer in as pitcher in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would be the first man on the spot for the 34th time, trained his pitch on Tuesday and wanted pitch on Sunday, which is normally his rest day.
The right-hand player from Washington is located at 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump is holding an electoral meeting in West Virginia
The President referred indirectly to the situation surrounding his election to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, as he spoke of the importance of republican attendance at the polling stations at the mid-term elections.
"Everything we've done is at stake in November.
Five weeks from one of the most important choices in our lifetime.
It's one of the big, big ones – you can't vote for me, but you're actually voting for me. That's why I'm travelling around and fighting for fantastic candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "You can see this terrible, terrible radical group of democrats, you can see, it's happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power with all the means available, and you can see how evil they are.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to drive to gain power and control. That's what they want, power and control, but we don't want to give them that."
The Democrats, he said, have as a mission "dispute and block."
"And you've seen it over the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "wrathful and evil and vile and lying."
He referred to the senior democratic senator of the Senate's judicial committee, Diane Feinstein, by name, which triggered the loud bow from the audience.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh, wait a minute – it was really bad body language – the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer a spacious party.
They are intolerant to those who express their views.
When Momentum's activists in my local party voted to censor me, it wasn't really a surprise.
I am just the latest in a large number of Labour MEPs who have been told that we are not welcome – just because we have made our views known.
My colleague, Joan Ryan, received a similar treatment because she strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship initiative was to criticize me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
In relation to the importance of a responsible economic policy, in relation to national security, in Europe, ironically, similar problems in which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
In the invitation to the meeting in Nottingham East Labour on Friday it was stated that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
For most of my eight years as a local Member of Parliament, Friday evening's meetings have been just like that.
Today, unfortunately, the tone of many meetings is not so, and the promise of "kinder, gentler" politics is far behind in the past if it ever started.
It has become increasingly clear that dissenting views are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and that all opinions are weighted as to whether the party's leadership can accept them.
It started shortly after Jeremy became the leader when colleagues with whom I previously thought I shared a political stance began to expect me to make a U-turn and take positions that I would otherwise never agree with – whether it was about national security or the EU's internal market.
When I say my opinion to the public – and it really doesn't matter what I say – a long line of rough messages follows the social media that calls for the withdrawal and contradiction of the middle-seeking policy and tells me that I should not be a member of the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I am luckier than some of my colleagues because the comments made to me are usually political.
I have deep respect for professionalism and the will to fight with colleagues who are overwhelmed by sexism or racism every day, but who are still fighting.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is how normal abuse has become.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that Labour should create a tolerant culture.
But in reality it is no longer a spacious organization and with every vote of censure or change of rules of selection the party becomes narrower.
I've been given a lot of advice over the last two years that if I put a lid on myself and I'm not that loud, I'm gonna have to "get by" myself.
But that's not why I went into politics.
Since I became a member of the Labour 32 years ago, when I went to school, I was provoked by the neglect of the Thatcher government, which had left our classroom in a state of decline, and I set myself up to create better public services for those who need it most – whether as a city councilman or minister in the government.
I have never hidden my policy, nor in the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could in any way have been confused about my political positions and disagreements with the current leadership.
To those who tabled the resolution on Friday, I would say that when the country falls towards Brexit, which will harm households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the need to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But the one message I have is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to the local voters, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no kind of threat of renunciation or political propriety will prevent me from acting on the basis of what I believe is your interest.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Undefeated Ayr Becomes Top Team
Two late scorings may have got the final result to draw a not quite truthful picture, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved the victory in this amazingly entertaining match of the day in Tennent's Premiership.
They are now at the top of the scoreboard and are the only undefeated team of ten.
In the end, it was just as much their superior defense as their better use of the opportunity that bore the home team home, and coach Peter Murchie was absolutely entitled to be satisfied.
"Our battles have been demanding so far, and we are still undefeated, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said, "Respect for Ayr, they used their chances better than us."
Grant Anderson's scoring after 14 minutes was followed by a successful kick from Frazier Clio and brought Ayr in front, but a yellow card to the Scottish team player Rory Hughes, who was awarded for the battle by Warriors, gave Melrose an advantage, and Jason Baggot made a scoring that was not followed up by a kick.
Climo expanded Ayr's lead with a penalty park just before the half-game. He scored and then got a soloscoring, so there were 17-5 to Ayr at the break.
But Melrose began well in the second half, and Patrick Anderson's scoring, which was followed by a kick from Baggot, reduced the point difference to five.
There was then a long break because Ruaridh Knott had suffered a serious injury. He was carried out of the field on stretchers. When the game was resumed, Ayr expanded the lead with a scoring from Stafford McDowall and a follow-up kick from Clima.
Working Ayr commander Blair Macpherson then got a yellow card, and again Melrose took advantage of their extra man with a scoring from Bruce Colvine without a follow-up kick after a period of intense pressure.
However, the home team came back again, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card to tackle Climo without the ball, MacPherson could after a line-out score behind the emerging Ayr cluster.
Clima followed up with a kick inside the poles and followed up with a more almost right after the game was resumed, after Kyle Rowe caught up with David Armstrong's box kick and sent winger Gregor Henry off to the home track's fifth scoring.
Still Game-star looking for a new career in the restoration industry
Still Game-star Ford Kieran seems to take the step to the restoration industry after it became apparent that he has taken the directorship of an authorised restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he writes and is the main character of along with his partner Greg Hemphil.
The duo has announced that the next ninth season will be the last of the series, and it seems that Klän is planning a life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he's the director of the Akrifmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, but a source suggested to Scottish Sun that Klär would be part of Glasgow's "growing market for restaurants".
"Havet is ours": The domestic state of Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen the route to the Pacific
Sailors patrol around the Navy headquarters, surrounded by rains, in La Paz.
In public buildings there is a sea blue flag.
Fleet bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon River are painted with the motto: "The sea is ours, it is a right.
It's a duty to take it back."
Throughout Bolivia, the whole of the inland state is reminded of a stretch of coast lost to Chile in a bloody conflict over resources in the 19th century, and so is the desire to sail again in the Pacific.
The hopes may be at their peak for several decades, while Bolivia awaits a judgment from the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of voting.
"Bolivia has momentum, a sense of community and clarity, and of course waits with a positive look at the outcome," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the decision of the International Court of Justice on large screens throughout the country and hope that the Hague court will agree that Chile – after decades of discussions – is obliged to negotiate to give Bolivia sovereignty over an area with access to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president, who is facing a controversial election campaign next year, also has a lot to do with the verdict on Monday.
"We are close to returning to the Pacific," he promised last August.
But analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will take Bolivia’s party – and that there would be no major changes if it did.
The UN Assembly, which has its seat in the Netherlands, does not have the power to surrender Chilean territory and has stipulated that it cannot determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The judgment of the International Court of Justice only six months after the final arguments were heard indicates that the case "was not complicated," said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And instead of promoting Bolivia's cause, the last four years may have given way to setbacks.
"The story of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian leadership," said Zárate.
Morales' war rhetoric has done away with the remaining Chilean goodwill, she said.
Bolivia and Chile will continue their discussions at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making was abnormally quick.
On Monday, Bolivia will have "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "end an era of 139 years of disagreement and gain benefits for both parties," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of Latin America's most popular presidents, used the maritime problem as a political crutch.
"Bolivia will never give up access to the Pacific," he added.
"The verdict is an opportunity to see that we have overcome the past."
North Korea says there will be no nuclear disarmament unless they can trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says that his nation will never disarm their nuclear weapons if they cannot first trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to respect promises made at a summit in Singapore between the rival leaders.
His comments were made in the wake of the apparent relaunch of the locked nuclear diplomacy over three months after the meeting in Singapore with North Korea's Kim Jong Un by the US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.
Ri says that it is a 'desirable dream' to continue sanctions and the US's opposition to a declaration ending the Korean war will ever bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is reluctant to declare as long as Pyongyang has not taken significant steps towards disarmament.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want another summit.
But there is widespread scepticism as to whether Pyongyang is serious about abolishing an arsenal that the country most likely sees as the only thing that can guarantee their safety.
Pompeo is planning a visit to Pyongyang next month in preparation for a new summit between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris reveal the latest collections with large headwear that you will soon be able to buy in local shops
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or block the sun completely, you'll find the answer here.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne lifted on the catwalk veiled for a collection of remarkable headwear of extra large size as part of their SS19 collection. The collection impressed at Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical hats have dominated Instagram this summer, and the two designers have sent their eye-catching creations down the catwalk.
The most impressive work from Valentino was an elaborate with a feather-like wide shadow that covered the heads of the models.
There were also other extra large accessories, including watermelons with jewels and even a pineapple – but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had stitched lips that resembled Hannibal Lecter more than haute couture.
One creation resembled snorkeling and masked diving gear, and others resembled a melted waffle ice cream.
And if you continue the big fashion statements, you're lucky.
Snipers predict that the huge hats could get to shops near you.
The hats arrive in the heels of "La Bomba", the straw hat with a 60 centimeter wide shadow, which is seen on everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label, which is behind the most impractical hat that was spread across the social media, has sent a new great creation down the catwalk – a beach bag in straw that is almost as large as the model that shows it.
The orange sauna bag with bastfrynser and a white leather handle was the most eye-catching in the Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
The famous stylist Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: "I expect to see big hats and beach bags in regular shops next summer. The designer has had so much influence that it will be hard to ignore the demand for accessories in huge size."
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
The independent schools of Scotland have many fine academic achievements behind them, and it has continued in 2018 with yet another number of outstanding exam results, which are also strengthened by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other efforts in the local environment.
With up to 30,000 students around Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to deliver the best service level to their students and parents.
The independent schools try to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen career and their position as global citizens.
As a sector of education that can put together and implement a tailor-made curriculum, we find that modern languages remain a popular topic in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to a man in a language that he understands, it will hit his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it will strike the heart."
It is an important reminder that we cannot just stick to English when we want to build relationships and trust among people from other countries.
We can look at the latest exam results this year that languages are highest in the statistics with the most passed exams in the independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages received the high grade A.
The data collected by the 74 member schools of the SCIS showed that 72 percent of the students had the grade A in mandarin, while 72 percent of those who studied German, 69 percent of those who studied French, and 63 percent of those who studied Spanish also received an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as important competences that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Language is now perceived as a topic choice at the same level as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent schools and elsewhere.
A study by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills carried out in 2014 found that among the reasons why employers could not fill job vacancies, 17 % had to do with lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly important in preparing young people for their future careers.
More job opportunities will in future require language skills, and these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Whatever career the young people choose, if they have learned another language, they have a great advantage in the future with a lifelong skill like this.
The possibility of communicating directly with people from other countries automatically gives a multilingual person a head start to the competitors.
According to a YouGov poll with over 4,000 respondents in the UK in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to conduct a conversation, and French is the only language spoken by a multi-digit percentage, 15 percent.
Therefore, it is important to invest in language teaching for those who are children today.
When you can speak more languages, especially languages from developing countries, children have a better chance of finding meaningful work.
In Scotland there is a difference between schools in which languages are taught.
A number of schools focus on the more classic modern languages, while others teach in languages that are expected to be most important to the UK when looking forward to 2020, e.g. mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child is interested in, there will always be a number of languages to choose from in independent schools with teachers who are specialists in the field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that prepares children and provides them with the skills required for success regardless of what the future holds.
At present, it cannot be denied that languages continue to be really important for the future of the country in a global business environment, and this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should really be regarded as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, this diversity and this distinction to the young people of Scotland.
Il fout bien le faire.
John Edward is the head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron gets debut for Lakers Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans who will watch LeBron James play their first match for Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James is playing in Sunday's opening match before the season starts against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it's not yet fixed how many minutes he's playing.
"It'll be more than 1 and less than 48," said Walton on Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James most likely won't play the whole game.
After the training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans in relation to Lakers' planned six matches before the start of the season.
"Where I am in my career, I don't need to fight before the start of the season to get ready," he said.
Trump's election meeting in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is starting a series of electoral sessions tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is Trump's first out of five scheduled electoral sessions next week, including meetings in Trump-friendly places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the vote on the confirmation of Trump's appointed judge at the Supreme Court is suspended, Trump is trying to support the forthcoming mid-term elections because the Republicans are at risk of losing control of the Congress when the votes are cast in November.
When is Trump's election meeting in West Virginia tonight, and how do you see it online?
Trump's election meeting in Wheeling in West Virginia is held at midnight (Danish time) the night between Saturday 29 November and Sunday 30 November 2018.
You can watch Trump's election meeting in West Virginia online via live stream on YouTube.
Trump will most likely be talking about this week's hearings on Brett Kavanaugh, which are nominated to the Supreme Court. The hearings were tense because of charges of sexual abuse, and the expected vote in the Senate on confirmation has been suspended for a week while the FBI is investigating the charges.
But the main objective of this series of electoral sessions is to create momentum for the Republicans who face a difficult election in November.
People from President Trump's campaign team said that next week's five electoral sessions aim to "create energy among volunteers and support when the Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"Conference control is so important to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible now that we are entering the busy campaign time," said a spokesman for the Trump campaign, who would not be quoted by name, to Reuters.
Tonight's electoral meeting is held in Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling and is expected to attract Trump supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and be covered by media from Pittsburgh", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month, Trump has visited West Virginia, the state he won by over 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia's Republican candidate for the Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who is behind the polls.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to step up to give him a boost in the polls," said Simon Haeder, who deals with state science at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team United States has shown a battle spirit and is trying to keep hope alive before Sunday's single duels
After three one-sided rounds, Saturday's four-man duels might have been what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging momentum is a completely invented sport concept, but a concept that the players believe in – not least in competitions like this one.
Where would they say there's momentum now?
"They led by six points, and now it's four, so we probably see it a little like momentum," said Jordan Spieth, before he held the fourth.
Of course, Europe has the advantage: it is 4 points ahead and there is 12 points more to play about.
As Spieth says, however, the Americans feel that they have a bit of wind in the sails, and there are plenty of encouraging things to focus on, not least the shape of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day long and both can boast with three points of four possible.
Spieth has been sharp from tea to green and sets a good example for his teammates.
The loud shouts of cheer were louder as the round continued, and Spieth hit an important well that secured victory in duel four, even though he and Thomas had been two blows behind two duels.
His well that secured them the battle on hole 15 was met with a similar scream – the sort of scream that shows that he does not think the American team is out of competition yet.
"You just have to find the inner strength forward and focus on your own struggle," said Spieth.
That's all the players have left now.
18 holes where you can make a difference.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, no doubt the biggest story from the Ryder Cup.
Europe's remarkable but sympathetic couple have gained four points in four games and appear flawless.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't get a bookey Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided the bookeys Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes Friday morning.
The series and the way energy seems to flow both to and from the wild audience shows that they are the ones that become the hardest to hit on Sunday. And it would undoubtedly be very popular if a potential European victory were dubbed by Fleetwood or Molinari when the sun goes down over the Le Golf National.
First of all, synchronously on each of their holes.
However, it is too early to talk about European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made a brief trial against Sergio Garcia, the morning completely in the four-man duels when he formed couples with Alex Noren.
A bookey and two double bookseys on the first nine holes dug the Spaniard and the Swede into a hole they were never near getting out.
Sunday, no one can help you out of your hole.
The games with four balls and two teams a two players are so fascinating to look at closely because of the interactions between the pairs, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and the way the strategy can change quickly.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has created a considerable leadership before the last day, but the four-man duels have also shown that the United States team has the spirit of struggle that some, especially in the United States, have had doubts.
Europe creates leadership on 10-6 ahead of the last day in the Ryder Cup
Europe has a great advantage before the last day at the Ryder Cup, after they came out of the fourballs and foursomes of Saturday with a lead over the United States of America of 10-6.
The playful duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the road with two victories over a difficult Tiger Woods and has so far received four points at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjørn's European team, trying to win the trophy they lost on Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an imprecise American team in tomorrow's fourballs and won the 3-1 series.
The U.S. gave more resistance to foursomes, they won four games, but they were still behind.
Jim Fury's team needs eight points in Sunday's 12 singles if they're to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European debutant who has won four points in a row, and he and Molinari, who together have got the nickname "Molliwood" are after a sensational weekend the only second pair in Ryder Cup's history who have won four points in their first four matches.
They smashed Woods and Patrick Reed in fourballs and then elegantly defeated a reckless Woods and the American debutant Bryson Decambeau with an even more impressive 5&4.
Woods, who fought through the first two matches on Saturday, had little geniuses, but now he has lost 19 out of his 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose was well rested for the fourballs of the morning and returned to the partner Henrik Stenson in foursomes and won a 2-1 victory over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – which is number three in the world.
Europe, however, feels as they would like it, on a lightly windy day south-west of Paris.
Triple Major winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas showed the way for Americans with two points on Saturday.
They got a hard-hit 2-1 victory over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Paulter in fourballs and later returned and beat Paulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in foursomes, after losing the first two holes.
It has only happened twice in the Ryder Cup history that a team has fought back after being back with four points before the singles. However, as Furyks currently has the trophy, they only have to achieve indecisiveness to keep it.
After being second best for two days, however, it seems that they cannot master a counterattack on Sunday.
North Korea says they will not disarm unilaterally if there is no confidence
The Secretary of State of North Korea told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions reinforce their mistrust of the United States and that it will not unilaterally abandon their nuclear weapons under such conditions.
Ri Yong Ho told the General Assembly of the worldwide organization that North Korea had shown “significant goodwill” in the past year, for example by stopping nuclear and missile tests, settling an area for nuclear testing and promising not to further develop nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we have not seen a similar reaction from the United States," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, there is no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances, there is no chance that we will take the first steps ourselves and disarm unilaterally."
While Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's opposition to a "phase-down" approach to nuclear disarmament, where North Korea would be rewarded if they took gradual steps.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit ever between a seated US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, where Kim promised to work "nuclear disarmament on the Korean peninsula", while Trump promised to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea has requested a formal end to the Korean war, which took place in 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up their nuclear weapons.
Washington has also shown opposition to soaking up harsh international sanctions against North Korea.
"USA insists on 'nuclear disarmament first' and expands the pressure with sanctions to achieve their purpose by coercion and even opposes the 'declaration of the end of the war'," said Ri.
"The perception that the sanctions can bring us to our knees is a wishful dream among people who don't know who we are.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions strengthen our mistrust."
Ri did not mention plans for a summit between Kim and Trump, as the American leader pointed out at the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the Minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and the South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: "If nuclear disarmament were to be negotiated with South Korea and not the United States, the negotiations would not be so locked."
Nevertheless, the tone of Ris speech was very different from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that firing North Korea's missiles against the American mainland was inevitable, after "Mr Evil President" Trump called Kim a "rocked man" on a suicide mission.
Last year, Trump threatened the United Nations with the "total destruction" of North Korea, but this year he praised Kim to show courage in relation to disarmament, but said that there is still much to be done and that the sanctions have to remain until North Korea disarms.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he didn't have a schedule for these actions, but said, "It doesn't matter if it takes two years, three years or five months."
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The Security Council must maintain sanctions with conviction and without error until we achieve the total, final, confirmed nuclear disarmament."
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously increased economic sanctions against North Korea in an attempt to stop Pyongyang's missile and nuclear programme.
Pompeo met Ri on the sideline of the UN General Assembly and then said that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for another meeting.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times during the year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said that progress had been made, while North Korea only a few hours later accused him of making "gangstery demands."
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to close a missile facility and a nuclear complex if the United States took "similar steps."
He said that Kim had told him that the "similar steps" he required were the security promises that Trump gave in Singapore, as well as movements towards normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course to get enough sleep
A new course at Harvard University has given all bachelor students more sleep. The aim of the course is to counteract the growing macho culture where you study all night held up by large amounts of caffeine.
A researcher has shown that students at the world's best university often have little idea of taking care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, Professor of Sleep Medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, has done the course, which he thinks is the first of its kind in the United States.
He got the idea for the course after giving a presentation on the effects of sleep deprivation on learning.
"When the show was finished, a girl came up to me and said, "Why am I only told this now when I'm on the candidate?"
"She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, which is offered for the first time this year, explains how good sleep habits can improve your academic and sporting performance as well as your overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Director of the University's Health Department, says that the university has decided to offer the course after finding out that the students were in serious sleep deprivation during the week.
The hour-long course consists of various interactive exercises.
In one of the exercises there is a picture of a dorm where students have to click on coffee cups, curtains, running shoes and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, and how your sporting performance is affected by sleep deprivation and how important good sleep habits are.
In another part of the course, participants will hear about how long-term sleep deprivation increases the risk of heart attacks, blood clots, depression and cancer.
Participants are encouraged to think about their daily habits by clicking on different icons on an interactive map of campus.
"We know that this will not change students' behaviour immediately.
But we think they have the right to know - just as you have the right to know how cigarettes affect your health," adds Professor Czeisler.
The pride in taking a "all-nighter" still exists, he says and adds that modern technology and increased pressure on the students have caused sleep deprivation to be a growing problem.
The "secret weapon" against stress, fatigue and anxiety is good and sufficient sleep, he said – it even counteracts weight gain, because lack of sleep makes the brain think that you are starving, why they are constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler organize the course last year when he took one of his courses at his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and made him work to make it a general course throughout the university.
He hopes that the next will be that all graduates will be offered a similar course before they continue their education.
Professor Czeisler recommends the students to set an alarm so that they know when to go to bed and when to go up. This can raise awareness of the harmful effects of the light from electronic screens, which can move at dawn and make it harder to fall asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Goals from Menga lowers Gerrard and Co.
Rangers suffered another defeat on the road, when Dolly Menga's goal meant that Steven Gerrard's incoherent team had to thank with a defeat of 1-0 in Livingston.
The team from Ibrox was out after their first victory on the track since the 4-1 triumph at St. Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team gave it only second defeat in 18 games as a coach. Thus, there are eight points up to Hearts on the first place of Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga struck seven minutes before the break, which an uninspired Rangers team could not respond to.
Rangers now descend to a sixth place, while Livingston climbs up to a third place after Hibernian with only the target score different.
And there could be more bad news on the way to the Rangers, as line judges Calum Spence had to be treated after being hit in the head by a thrown object that seemed to come from the open-air section.
Gerrard made eight changes in the setup that reached Betfed Cups semifinale by toning past Ayr.
Holt, on the other hand, stood with the same 11, who shaved a point of Hearts' conduct last week, and he would have rejoiced to see his sharp team exhausting the opponents all over the field.
Rangers had the ball the most, but Livingston was more effective.
They should have scored two minutes in the game when Menga's first delivery sent Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder's attempt was over.
A deep fries park from Keaghan Jacobs found its way to Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense player Alan Lithgow kicked past the rear pole.
The Rangers, however, took control, but played more in hope than in ability in the attack game.
Alfredo Morales was at least not satisfied when Judge Steven Thomson confessed to the Colombian's appeals for a penalty park when he and Steven Lawless collapsed after a quarter of a game.
Rangers managed only two shots on target in the first half, but former Rangers goalkeeper Liam Kelly did not have any problems with Lassana Coulibaly's head impact and Ovie Ejaria's domestic shot.
Although Livis' opening in the 34th minute was a coincidence, it must be said to be deserved for their efforts alone.
Again, Rangers couldn't handle a deadball situation in the depths of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who took the time to find Menga, who could easily kick it in.
During the break, Gerrard replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, which almost immediately gave a paw when the flyer sent the ball into Morelos, but the well-playing Kelly ran from his position to block.
But Livingston forced the stamina to play on their premises with many long balls up the track from Lithgow and Halkett.
Holt's crew could have expanded the lead in the last part of the game, but McGregor rejected Jacobs with a safe hand before Lithgow heated next to targets.
Rangers' intern Glenn Middleton appealed again for a late penitentiary after being dried up with Jacobs, but Judge Thomson also looked the other way.
Yearbook: Inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from the yearbook "Sunday Tomorrow": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today – if we count... – was the day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger invented a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that would lead in the long term to the apparatus known as the geiger counter.
The Geiger counter has become a fixed component of both science and popular culture, as can be seen in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", where Roy Rogers and Dale Evans played the leading role as peasant scientists:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It is a geiger counter that is used to find radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms that the radioactivity of the minerals does."
Evans: "Stop it, now it's on!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before he would have turned 63.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" cancer cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" cancer cells and kill them
Vaccine teaches the immune system to recognise cancer cells as part of treatment
The method consists of extracting immune cells from a patient and changing them in the laboratory
They can then "see" the protein that is common to many cancers and where they are re-injected
A test vaccine is promising in patients with a variety of cancers.
When a woman with ovarian cancer was treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognise cancer cells, the cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method consists of extracting immune cells from patients and changing them in the laboratory so that they can "see" the protein called HER2, which many cancers have, and then inject the cells again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said, "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "makes several cancers to develop", including breast, ovary, lung and intestinal cancer, explains Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach, taking immune cells out of patients and "teaching" them to attack cancer cells, has worked in the treatment of a particular type of leukemia.
Kanye West gave Trump-friendly speech wearing a MAGA hat after his SNL performance.
It didn't go well.
After an incoherent performance in the Saturday Night Live study, Kanye West was turned off when he praised the President of the United States, Donald Trump, and said that he himself would stand as presidential candidate in 2020.
After playing the third song of the evening Ghost Town wearing a Make America Great Again case, he began a thundering speech against the Democrats and maintained his support for Trump.
"I talk so often to white people who say, 'Why do you like Trump, he's a racist?'
But if I were concerned about racism, I would have moved from the United States long ago," he said.
SNL started this evening's show with a sketch with Matt Damon, where the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony in the Senate's court committee on Christine Blasey Ford's assault charges.
Even though the recordings were not shown, comedian Chris Rock Wests was tying on the social media.
It's not sure if Rock was trying to show West by setting up the footage.
West also complained to the audience about poor treatment backstage because of his headwear.
"They bullied me backstage.
They said, "Don't wear that hat out there."
They bullied me!
And they said I had sunk deep," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see how deep I have sunk?" and said that he would put on his Superman coat, because that means that "you can't decide what to do.
Try it with love."
The audience buhede at least twice of his comments, and the SNL staff seemed to be embarrassed, Variety explains with a comment from a person who was present: "There was bombing in the studio."
West had been booked as replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose then girlfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days before.
West confused many by performing with the song I Love It, while he was dressed like a Perrier bottle.
West received support from the leader of the conservative group, TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest people: THANK YOU NOT TO LET YOUR COULD OF THE POUBLISH."
Talkshow host Karen Hunter tweeted that West is just "as he is, and that's fine."
"But I do NOT choose to reward a person (by buying his music, his clothes or supporting his "art"), who embraces and pours out an ideology that is harmful to society.
He's allowed.
And so have we," she added.
Before the show, the rapper had announced that he had changed his name to the "entity officially known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name, and thus follows Diddy, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Rapkollegaen Snoop Dogg has been called Snoop Lion, and the recently deceased music legend Prince changed his name to a symbol and then to The Artist Formerly Known as Prince.

Game of Thrones star Kit Harington lengthens after toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for swinging swords in the role of Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor longs for the stereotypical macho hero and says that such TV characters mean that young men often feel that they have to be hard to be respected.
Kit said to Sunday Times Culture that he believes that something has gone wrong and asked how to tackle the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo age.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones-star Rose Leslie at 31, admitted that the problem was his "very important".
"For the time being, it is very important to me – where have we gone wrong in the city with masculinity?" he said.
"If we look at the current problems, what is it that we have taught young men in their upbringing?"
Kit believes that television can be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to the very masculine characteristics.
He continued: "What is innate, and what is learned?
What is it that young men learn from television and on the streets that makes them feel that they must be men in this way?
I think this is one of the big questions of our time – how do we change that?
Because it is obvious that something has gone wrong for the young men."
During the interview he also admitted that he will not make successors to the Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, and said that he is "complete with battlefields and horses".
Kit participates from November in a re-recording of Sam Shepard's True West, which is the story of a film director and his brother who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that he considers it to have met his wife Rose as the best in the entire Game of Thrones experience.
"I met my wife because of this series, so it has given me my future family and shaped my life forever," he said.
Rose played Ygrite, as Kit's character, Jon Snow, falls in love with, in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The couple was married in June 2018 at Leslie's family property in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has published a 14% increase in the number of citizens with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people in the country are affected, according to the health authorities.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, 40,000 new cases were registered.
The vast majority of the new cases were sexually transmitted, which is a new trend.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China because of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people receiving HIV in this way has been reduced to something near zero, says Chinese health authorities at a conference in Yunnan Province.
In a year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexually transmitted HIV is an acute problem in China’s LGBT environment.
In 1997, homosexuality was legalised, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be a widespread phenomenon.
Studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men marry women before or since because of the country's conservative values.
Many cases of infection are due to a lack of prevention in these circumstances.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has promised free and equal access to HIV medicine as an attempt to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that personnel leaked data on Republican senators and thunders against "hazardous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
Member of the House of Representatives Maxine Waters denied on Saturday's allegations that a member of her staff has shared personal information about three Republican senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrats claimed that the claims came from websites and support from the "extreme right wing".
"Lies, lies, and more terrible lies," Waters wrote in a Twitter listing.
The published information contained alleged home addresses and telephone numbers of the American senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina as well as Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of whom are from Utah.
The information was posted on Thursday on the Internet by an unknown person on Capitol Hill. It happened during a hearing in the Senate on allegations of sexual abuse against the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak happened after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative support sites such as Gateway Pundit of RedState announced that the IP addresses pointed out that the information had been provided by Waters' people, after which they published information about a member of the Waters staff, writes The Hill.
"This unfounded charge is completely untrue and a direct lie," continued Waters.
"The membership of my staff, whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false accusations, is by no means responsible for this leak of information.
This unfounded charge is totally untrue and a direct lie."
Waters' report quickly received criticism online, including from former press secretary in the White House Ari Fleischer.
"It's an angry denial," wrote Fleischer.
"It suggests that she does not have the right temperament to be a congressman.
If you're accused of something you haven't done, don't get angry.
You can't be defiant.
You can't question the prosecutor's motives.
You have to keep your senses."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction with the Democrats' criticism of Kavanaugh, which was criticised for being too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who aims to take over Waters' place in the mid-term election, also made his opinion known on Twitter.
"Great, if that's true," he tweeted.
In the official report of Waters, she says that her staff has contacted "the relevant authorities and the order of these fraudulent claims."
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are found," she continued. "And that they will be held legally responsible for their actions, which are destructive and dangerous to everyone in my staff."
Review Johnny English Strikes Again – Understood spy comedy with Rowan Atkinson
It has become the norm to look for a Brexit angle in all recent films with a British ice cream, and it also seems relevant to the latest action comedy in the Johnny English series, which started back in 2003 with Johnny English and appeared again in 2011 with Johnny English - born again.
Will the sardine self-satisfaction, whether we are in grudges, become the country's new export option?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English with the rubber face and the big eyes has been given his permission to make roarers again- again. His name signals more than anything else that he is a comical invention aimed at places where the cinema visitors do not speak English.
He is, of course, the tumultuous secret agent, who, despite his desire to be a smooth gentleman, has a little Clouseau, a knife tip Mr. Bean and decently clipped off him who performed a single tone to the Charios of the Fire song at the opening ceremony of the Olympics in London in 2012.
He is also originally based on the world-wide and international sluggish pants that left chaos in their cooling water, after Atkinson portrayed him in Barclaycard’s television commercials.
There are some good moments in this last shot on the JE tribe.
I loved it when Johnny English approached a helicopter wearing a medieval armor, and the propellers sounded against his helmet.
You can see Atkinson's talent for physical comics, but the humor feels rather understated and strangely unnecessary, especially now that more "serious" film series like 007 and Mission Impossible also offer convincing comics as an ingredient.
The humor seems to be directed at children rather than adults, and to me Johnny English's crazy adventure is not as inventive and focused as Atkinson's silent movies in the role of Mr. Bean.
The infinitely current starting point for the film is that Britain is in serious trouble.
An Internet hacker has infiltrated England's top secret spy network and revealed the identities of all the English agents in the field to the horror of the responsible agent – a sadly small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last chance for a pompous and combat-ready Prime Minister who already suffers from a complete meltdown in political popularity: Emma Thompson does his best with this Teresa May-like character, but there is not much to work with in the manuscript.
When her security advisers inform her that every active spy has been exposed, she is forced to cancel someone's pension.
And of course it's the clumsy Johnny English, who is now a school principal at a high school, but who secretly teaches how to become a secret agent. There are some fun sequences here when English stands for a kind of School of Rock education in spying.
English hastens back to a crisis meeting at Whitehall and is reunited with its hard tried previous right hand Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough has now been married to an over-enthusiastic but well-meaning submarine captain – a role played by Vicki Pepperdine.
Thus, the Royal Intelligence Service's great effort is left to Batman and Robin when they meet Olga Kurylenko's beautiful five fatale, Ophilia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister has stumbled close to being implicated by the charismatic and scary tech billionaire Jason Volta – the game of Jake Lacy – who claims to be able to solve England’s computer problems.
English and Bough start their furiously risky escapades: dressed as servants they set fire to an excellent French restaurant; they create chaos as they smuggle themselves on board Volta's luxury yacht; and English creates pure ragnarok when he tries to use virtual reality glasses to familiarize himself with Volta's house.
All the cannons are fired in the film's closing sequence, but however well-meaning and energetic it is, there is a sense of child television about it.
Pretty mediocre.
And as I couldn't avoid thinking with the other Johnny English films: Can't the English film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that gives his talent justice?
Labour rejects the plan of four-day working week with unchanged salaries for the British
Jeremy Corbyns Labour is said to be considering a radical plan so that the English can settle for a four-day week, but get paid for five.
The party will allegedly have managers to use their savings from artificial intelligence (AI) to give employees an extra day off.
This would mean that the employees would have three days of weekend without losing their pay.
Sources state that the idea would be consistent with the party's economic objective of drawing the country in a more favourable direction for the workers.
Trades Union Congress supports the idea of a four-day working week as a way for workers to benefit from a changing economy.
An experienced member of the Larbour Party said to The Sunday Times: "A political proposal is expected to be published by the end of the year."
"This is not going to happen in a day, but a four-day working week is a goal that fits the party's approach to changing the economy to the benefit of the workers and to the party's overall strategy for industry."
Labour would not be the first to support such an idea when the Green Party proposed a four-day working week during the election campaign for the 2017 parliamentary elections.
However, the objective is not supported by unanimity in the Labour Party.
A spokesman for the Labour Party said: "A four-day working week is not the party's policy and is not under consideration in the party."
Labour's shadow finance minister John McDonnell used last week's party meeting to record his plans for a socialist economic revolution.
McDonnell states that he is determined to take power back from "anonymous directors" and "users" in utilities.
The plans of the shadow finance minister also cast doubt on whether the current shareholders in water supply companies will get their money back, since a government with Labour at its head could "count off" them on the basis of immoral acts.
He also confirmed plans to get employees on company boards and to set up including owner-funds, which will distribute 10 per cent of the share value of private companies to employees who are expected to receive up to £500 per year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell 60 Minutes if the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh can change their voice
The FBI investigation into charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week, and it raises the question of whether the FBI finds could get the Republican senators to draw their support.
In an interview that was shown on Sunday, 60 Minutes journalist Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could dig out something that could change their attitude.
Kennedy seemed to be more open to the idea than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Yes, of course," said Kennedy.
"When I went to the hearing, I said that I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened – after the accusations came out – and said, "Did you do it?"
He was steeled, determined and unambiguous."
Graham's voice, on the other hand, seems to have been chiseled in stone.
"I've decided on Brett Kavanaugh, and other things would require a very violent accusation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know Brett strongly denied it," Graham added with reference to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of those she mentioned could confirm it.
It happened 36 years ago.
I can't see that it was supposed to change anything."
What is the Global Citizens Festival, and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
On Saturday, New York is the host city of the Global Citizens Festival – an annual music festival with a very impressive selection of artists and an equally impressive goal; to put an end to world poverty.
Global Citizens Festival will for the seventh time receive tens of thousands of people on Central Park’s large lawn, where they can look forward to concerts with Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes. At the same time, the festival will draw attention to the real goal of ending extreme poverty in 2030.
Global Citizen Festival started in 2012 and is an extension of the Global Powery Project, an international interest organisation that fights to end poverty by increasing the number of active opponents.
To receive a free ticket to the event (if you do not want to pay for a VIP ticket), concertgoers must perform a number of tasks or "actions". For example, do voluntary work, write to a world leader, make a phone call or another meaningful action that can draw attention to the goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been, now that they have 12 years left to achieve the goal?
Does it create the idea of rewarding people with a free concert real change, or is it just another case of so-called "clicktivism" – i.e. people feel that they make a difference by signing a signature collection online or making a Twitter listing?
Global Citizen reports that since 2011, they have registered more than 19 million "actions" from their members aimed at different goals.
They believe that these actions have encouraged world leaders to make binding targets and political action equivalent to more than 37 billion dollars, which by 2030 are expected to have affected more than 2.25 billion people.
At the beginning of 2018, the group listed 390 objectives and actions that had become due to their actions, which amounted to over $10 billion, which had already been paid out or collected.
The Group estimates that so far these funds have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
One of the main objectives is The Power of Nutrition, which has started in England and is a collaboration between investors and strong people. They strive to "help children live out their full potential" and promise $35 million to address nutritional problems in Rwanda after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the help of the English government, donors, governments of other countries and world citizens like you, social injustice with malnutrition can become a footnote in the history books," said the ambassador for The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, to the audience at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that the UK Government has now promised funds to improve nutrition for mothers and children after receiving more than 5,000 online calls. This project, Power of Nutrition, will help five million mothers and children with advice on nutrition.
In answer to one of the website's frequently asked questions that read: "What makes you think that we can put an end to extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen wrote: "It will be a long and hard fight, and sometimes we will stumble and make mistakes.
But like the civil rights movement and the movements towards apartheid, we will succeed because we are stronger together."
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are among the performers at this year's festival in New York. Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman must be hosts.
The United States can use its fleet to "block" Russian energy sports, says the U.S. Interior Minister
"If necessary" Washington can use its fleet to prevent Russian energy from entering the market, including in the Middle East, reveals the US Secretary of State, Ryan Zinke, to the Washington Examiner.
Zinc claimed that Russia’s interference in Syria – especially where they operate on the invitation of the legitimate government – is a pretext to extend the sale of their energy.
"I believe they are in the Middle East because they want to sell energy, just as they do in Eastern and Southern Europe," he must have said.
And according to him, there are both methods and resources to prevent it.
"U.S.A. with our fleet has the opportunity to ensure that there is free passage on the sea routes, and if necessary, we can also block them, so that we ensure that their energy does not enter the market," he said.
Zinc spoke to the participants at a meeting held by Consumer Energy Alliance – a non-profit organisation that considers itself to be "the voice of the American energy consumer".
He compared Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran and said that they are basically the same.
"The economic opportunities in relation to Iran and Russia are about using and replacing fuel," he said, referring to Russia as a "one-trick pony" whose economy is dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements come after the Trump administration has aimed at increasing European exports of liquid natural gas, which will replace Russia, which is by far the cheapest choice for European consumers.
In order to achieve this, spokespersons of the Trump administration, including Donald Trump himself, have tried to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 line project, which Trump said made Berlin the "capture" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the 11 billion expensive Nord Stream 2 line, which is expected to double the current capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is an economic project alone.
The Kremlin believes that Washington's strong opposition to the project is an expression of unequal conditions of competition and simply because of economic considerations.
"I believe that we share the view that energy should not be a tool for exerting pressure and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose a supplier," said the Russian Energy Minister, Aleksandr Novak, at a subsequent meeting in Moscow with the US Energy Minister, Rick Perry, in September.
The position of the Americans is met with criticism from Germany, which has confirmed its participation in the project.
Germany's leading industrial organisation, the BDI, has asked the United States to interfere with EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a major problem with a third party interfering in our energy supplies," said the head of the BDI, Dieter Kempf, after a recent meeting between the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the Russian President, Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren "considers strongly" to stand up for the presidential election in 2020," says the Senator from Massachusetts
Senator of Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren "considers strongly" to stand up for the presidential election after the mid-election," she said on Saturday.
During a city council meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering setting up.
"It is time for women to go to Washington and repair our political system, and it requires a woman in front," she said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6th, I would like to give a strong consideration to the presidential election."
Warren expressed his opinion on President Donald Trump under the City Council and said that he "led the country in the wrong direction."
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren has been expressed in his criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
On a Saturday, Warren wrote, "Of course, the FBI will investigate the case before the vote."
However, a Thursday poll shows that the majority of Warren’s own hinterland does not believe that it should be set up by 2020.
According to a poll from Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe, 58% of "probable" voters in Massachusetts said that the senator should not set up.
32 % supported the potential candidate.
The opinion poll showed greater support to former Governor Deval Patrick by 38% for and 48% against a possible setup.
Other high-profile democratic candidates discussed in the presidential elections in 2020 include former Vice-President Joe Biden and Vermont's Senator, Bernie Sanders.
Biden states that he will announce his final decision in January, writes the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentions Track Palins PTSD at an election meeting for Donald Trump
The 26-year-old Track Palin was a year in Iraq after joining the army in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
"What my own son is going through after he has come home makes me relate to other families who feel the consequences of PTSD and other injuries that our soldiers return home with," she told the audience to a Trump election meeting in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in space" and said of his son and other war veterans that "they have changed and have become harder. They go and wonder if there is respect for what their colleagues on land and in the air and all other members of the military have done for the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and was charged with domestic violence against a woman, to prevent the report of domestic violence and to be in possession of a drunken weapon, says Dan Bennet, a spokesman for the police in Wasillas.
18 States and D.C. support opposition to new asylum law
18 states and the District of Columbia support a legal objection to a new American law that denies asylum to victims who flee from gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and D.C. delivered a Party-Dependent Declaration in Washington on Friday in support of an asylum seeker who opposes the law, says NBC News.
The full name of the applicant in the Grace vs. Sessions trial, which the American Civil Liberties Union gave in August against the Federal Law, has not been published.
She states that her partner "and his violent sons who are gang members" had abused her, but American officials rejected her application for asylum on July 20th.
She was detained in Texas.
The state prosecutors who support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of American asylum seekers come, as countries with far-reaching problems of gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum law reversed a decision by the U.S. Foreign Office in 2014, which allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to seek asylum.
District of Columbia State Attorney Karl Racine said on Friday that the new law "regards decades of state, federal and international law."
"Federal legislation requires all asylum applications to be decided on the basis of relevant facts and circumstances, and such an obstacle goes against that principle", states the Party-dependent declaration.
The lawyers also argued in the declaration that the law on rejection of immigrants harms the American economy, as they are more likely to become independent and "deliver necessary labour".
In June, Justice Jeff Session's immigration judges waived the right to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and atrocities.
"Asyl is offered to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear on the basis of race, religion, nationality or membership of a given social group or political position," said Sessions in its decree of the law of 11 June.
Asylum has never been meant to solve all the problems – or just all the serious problems – faced by people around the world every day.
As the death toll doubles, attempts to find survivors in Palu desperate
For survivors, the situation only got worse.
"It's very exciting," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, consoling her little boy at an evacuation center in the ruined city of Palu.
"Every minute, the ambulance comes in with a body.
We're running out of clean water."
The inhabitants now returned to their destroyed home to sort in blooded possessions and save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals, which were also hit by the 7.5 earthquake, were unable to follow.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who broke his back and shoulder, were outside the Palus military hospital, where patients were treated outdoors due to severe aftershock.
He had tears in his eyes when he told him how the violent earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I got up against a ruined wall, I think," Haris said to the Associated Press and added that his family was going to a wedding in the city.
"I heard my wife yelling for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
American Ambassador accuses China of unfine methods and propaganda ads
A week after a Chinese newspaper brought a four-page ad in an American daily that hit the drum for the benefits of an American-Chinese collaboration, the American ambassador in China accuses Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
The U.S. president, Donald Trump, referred Wednesday to China's Dailys paid entry into Des Moines Register – Iowas' best selling newspaper – after accusing China of interfering in the 6th November Congress elections. China rejects the accusation.
American officials say to Reuters that Trump's accusation of Chinese interference in the US election marks a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to advertise in order to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are now locked in an escalating trade war where they have, in several stages, imposed customs duties on each other's imported goods.
China's retaliation rate in the trade war was to hit exporters in states like Iowa, which supported Trump's Republican Party, believe Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China, former governor for a number of years in Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural food to China, said that Beijing has harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in a director of the Sunday's Des Moines Register that China "steps up the use of the unfine methods by running propaganda ads in our own free press."
"By spreading propaganda, the Chinese government uses the proud American tradition of freedom of expression and freedom of the press by running a paid ad in Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In the kiosks here in Beijing, on the other hand, there will only be a few disagreements. And you will not get a fair picture of the different positions of the Chinese people on China's worrying economic direction, as the media are under strict control of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers failed to publish" his article, although he did not say which.
Republicans alienate women before the mid-term elections with the Kavanaugh case, warning analysts
While many top Republicans support and defend the Supreme Court-nominated Brett Kavanaugh against charges of sexual abuse, analysts warn that they will experience a counter-reaction in the forthcoming mid-term elections, especially from women.
The case has put the emotions in the boil, and most Republicans have already announced that they would like to see the voting process continue.
"This can't be done about," said Grant Reher, professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, to The Hill in an article on Saturday.
Reher said he doubted that Republican Senator Jeff Flakes (Arizona)'s request for an FBI investigation in 11 hours would soften the anger of voters.
"Women don't forget what happened yesterday – they won't forget it tomorrow or November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, according to The Hill last Friday.
On Friday morning, during a demonstration in the Senate, the demonstrators shouted: "November is coming!" when the Republicans, who control the judicial committee, chose to proceed with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Professor Christine Blasey Ford, says Mic.
"The democratic enthusiasm and motivation will reach new heights," the independent political commentator Stu Rothenberg told the news media.
"People say it has already reached a high level; it is right.
But it can reach even higher, especially among female swingers in the suburbs and younger voters – 18-29 years old – who rarely vote, even though they don't like the president."
Even before Ford’s public accusations of the sexual assault of the Supreme Court nominee, analysts had pointed out that if the Republicans continued to nominate, it could be set back.
"It has become worse for the Republicans," said Michael Steele, former President of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It is not just about the vote of the committee or the final result, or whether Kavanaugh is held responsible; it is also about how the Republicans have dealt with it here and how they have dealt with it," says Guy Cecil, president of the United States of America – a group that supports Democrats in being elected – to the news channel.
But the Americans seem to have shared views on who to believe after the Ford and Kavanaugh testimonies, where the latter have a little more on their side.
A new opinion poll by YouGov shows that 41% of the respondents believed in Ford’s testimony, while 35% said that they believed in Kavanaugh, or probably.
In addition, 38% said that they believed that Kavanaugh was either probably lying or certainly lying under his testimony, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
At the request of Flake, the FBI is now investigating the allegations made by Ford and at least another, writes Deborah Ramirez for The Guardian.
Ford told the Senate's judicial committee last week that Kavanaugh fully committed crimes against her when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee showed his sexes to her at a party when they both studied at Yale in the '80s.
The inventor of the Internet plans to create a new Internet and compete with Google and Facebook
The inventor of the Internet, Tim Berners-Lee, launches a new company to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend is called Inrupt and is a company based on Berners-Lees open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who has access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company Berners Lee joked that the plan of Inrupt is "world domination".
"We have to do it now," he said about the startup company.
"It's an historic moment."
The app uses Solid's technology so people can make their own "personal online data collection" or a POD.
It can contain contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It is as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were available in a single browser at the same time.
What is unique about the personal online data collection is that it is up to the user to decide who can access the specific information.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data".
According to the company's CEO, John Bruce, the idea of Inrupt is to pool resources, processes and abilities to make Solid accessible to all.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some software developers on project contracts and a community of volunteer programmers.
From this week on, technology developers around the world can make their own decentralised apps using the available tools on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee says that he and his team are not talking to "Facebook or Google about whether to change everything completely, so that all their business models suddenly become redundant."
"We're not asking their permission."
In a headline on Medium last Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission is to offer commercial energy and an ecosystem that can guarantee the integrity and quality of the new Internet built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he started the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an important voice in the so-called net neutrality debate.
While Inrupt launches, Berners-Lee will still be the inventor and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely optimistic about the next period of the Internet," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Religious recipient of the Victoria Cross from World War I is hailed
The only clergyman of the English Church who won the Victoria Cross by fighting during World War I will be celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel and priest Bernard Wann won the order on September 29, 1918, under the attack of Bellenglishe and Lehaucourt.
But he was killed four days later by a sniper and was never told that he had won the highest English military order.
On Saturday, a memorial stone was revealed by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northhamptonshire.
Michael Vann, one of his grandchildren, said it was "unbelievably symbolic" that the stone was revealed exactly 100 years after his grandfather's orderly achievement.
According to London Gazette, Lieutenant Colonel Vann, on 29 September 1918, led his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a very thick fog and under severe fire from machine gun and artillery."
He later ran up to the front line and led his people with the "greatest manpower" before he alone attacked an artillery and made three cannons harmless.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918 – just one month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann of 72 said that his grandfather's actions were "something I knew I could never live up to, but that makes me humble."
He and his brother James Vann also laid a wreath after the parade, which was led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he "felt very honored to participate in the parade" and added that "the support of all these people emphasizes the true heroism."
MMA fans stayed up all night to see Bellator 206, but instead got Gurli Gris
Imagine that you've been up all night to see the starry Bellator 206 and then refused to see the main event.
There were 13 matches on the program from San Jose, including six matches on the main program, and they were shown through the night in England on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m. when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were ready to meet, the viewers in England were somewhat surprised when the transmission changed to show Gurli Gris.
Some were unimpressed after they had stayed awake until early morning for this very battle.
A fan on Twitter described the shift to a children's cartoon as "a sort of sick joke."
"According to the legislation, this content was not appropriate at 6 a.m., so they had to switch to children's programmes," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president when asked about the broadcast.
"'Grisen Gurli', yes."
Bellator's Managing Director, Scott Coker, said that they will work to include English viewers in future planning.
"When we think about the retransmission, I think we can make it work," said Coker.
"But six o'clock is Sunday morning over there, and we won't find a solution until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on the case.
Believe me, when they changed, I got a lot of messages, and they weren't all friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical mistake.
But that was actually the law.
I can promise you this won't happen next time.
We'll just have five games instead of six, as we normally do, and we tried to give our fans something extra, and then we went over time.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley had "minority" over sexuality
The Olympic diver Tom Daley says he felt less worth than everyone else in his upbringing because of his sexuality, but it motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said that he didn't realize it until he got into the larger classes, that "all aren't like me."
When he was on Radio 4's first Desert Island Discs with Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about homosexual rights to give others "hope".
He also said that he was less concerned about winning the Olympics after becoming a parent.
The usual host on the radio program that has been running for a long time, Kirsty Young, has taken off for a few months because of illness.
Daley was a guest in the Laverne's first program and said that he felt "less worth" than anyone else in his upbringing, because "it was not socially accepted to like boys and girls."
He said, "From today on, the feelings of feeling worth remembering and feeling different have been the things that have given me the strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so he didn't disappoint everyone when they got to know his sexuality.
The double Olympic bronze winner has become a high-profile LGBT champion and used his participation in this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal for a decriminalization of homosexuality in several countries.
He said he spoke out because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without negative consequences, and he would give others "hope".
The triple world champion said that he had been "surprised" when he fell in love with a man – the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married the Oscar winner last year, who is 20 years older than him, but told me that the age difference had never been a problem.
He said that it is difficult to find someone of the same age who has experienced similar ups and downs when you go through so much at such a young age – he went to his first Olympics at the age of 14, and his father died of cancer three years later.
In June the couple became parents to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that "his whole perspective" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, it would all be about winning a gold medal," he said.
"But there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after having been diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley told me that his father did not accept that he should die, and one of the last things he asked was whether they had received tickets to London in 2012 – when he would sit on the front row.
"I couldn't tell him he wouldn't be there at that time.
I held his hand when his breathing stopped, and it only dawned on me that he was not immortal when he stopped breathing and was dead," he said.
The following year, Daley took part in the Olympics in 2012 and won the bronze medal.
"I just knew that this was what I had dreamed of my whole life – diving in front of a home audience at the Olympics. There was nothing that could beat that feeling," he said.
It was also the inspiration for his first song selection – Proud of Heather Small – that had meant a lot during the OL and still gave him goose bumps.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11.15 BST.
Unsharp Mickelson on the bench of the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson sets record on Sunday when he plays his 47th match in the Ryder Cup, but he has to do something about the shape if it's not to be a sad milestone.
Mickelson, who sets the record for the 12th time in the competition, which is held every 2 years, was put on the bench by Captain Jim Fürk because of Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being in the center of the events of the United States as usual, the five - doubled big winner had to act like cheerleaders and practice his game in the hope of correcting his looks.
Not even at the height of his career he had the most straight drive, why the 48-year-old is not a perfect match to the course at Le Golf National, where the long rough often punishes erratic shots.
And if the track wasn't a big enough mouthful, at the ninth match on Sunday, Mickelson must meet the always precise winner of British Open Francesco Molinari, who has joined the newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans, who start the 12 single battles, start strongly, Mickelson's fight can be decisive.
Fürk did not express surprising confidence in his teammate.
"He understood his role completely today, slapped my back, put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," said Furyk.
"He has a great faith in himself."
He is in Hall of Fame and has given so much to these teams before – and also this week.
I didn't think he'd play two games.
I imagined he'd have to play more, but that's how it went, and that's how it should be.
He wants to be out there like everyone else."
On Sunday, Mickelson beats Nick Faldo's record for most games in the Ryder Cup.
It could be the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never fully matched his individual achievements.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 victories and seven undecided, although Furyk said his presence contributes with something indefinable.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, funny, he likes to stick to people, and he's good to have in the hold," he explained.
"I also think the younger players had fun playing against him this week, which was fun to see.
He contributes much more than just the game."
Captain Thomas Bjørn of Europe knows that great leadership can quickly disappear
The European captain Thomas Bjørn knows from experience that a solid leadership before the last day of the Ryder Cups singles can quickly become annoying.
The Danish debuted in 1997 in Valderrama, where a team led by Seve Ballesteros had a lead of five points above the Americans, but was about to be caught before the finish line with a victory of 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a nice tour in Valderrama, we had a nice tour in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we only just won exactly," says Bjørn after seeing the 2018 team win both 5-3 Friday and yesterday for a total tour of 10-6 at Le Golf National.
The story tells me and the rest of the team that it's not over.
It's going to be full of garbage tomorrow.
Go out and do everything right.
It's not over until you have the points on the board.
We have a goal, and it's trying to win the trophy, and that's where our focus lies.
I have always said that I focus on the 12 players on our side, but we are also aware of what's on the other hand – the best golfers in the world."
Pleasure over the performance of his players on a difficult course, Bjørn added: "I don't take any of this for granted.
Tomorrow is a whole new challenge.
Tomorrow, it is the individual achievements that count, and it is something quite different.
It's great to be out there with a partner when it's going well, but when you're out there alone, you're tested on all the parameters as a golfer.
That's what players need to understand – get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you must leave your partner, for he must also get the best out of himself."
Otherwise, it looks like opponent Jim Furyk, who hopes for better individual performance than in the partner game with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Füryk himself has experienced twists on the last day. First on the winning team in Brookline, before he lost when Europe made the "Miracle on Medinah".
"I remember every word," he said when he was asked how Captain Ben Crenshaw had spoken to his players in 1999 before the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you would like to have a good start, as you saw at Brookline, as you saw at Medinah.
When momentum has found a direction, it puts a great deal of pressure on the intertwines.
We put our team together in relation to it and put the players on track in the order in which we feel. We try to create magic tomorrow."
Thomas has been given the task of trying to lead the setback and facing Rory McIlroy in the top game, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Paulter and the other Europeans play in the first half of the order.
"I chose this group of players in this order, because I think it will keep us all the way through," said Bjørn about his choice of single players.
Germany's new warship is being postponed again
The German fleet’s newest frigate should have been ready in 2014 to replace warships from the Cold War. However, the Germans have to wait at least a year yet because of technical problems and an escalating price, writes local media.
The deployment of the largest ship in the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg class of frigates, "Rheinland-Pfalz", has been postponed until the first half of 2019 according to Die Zeit newspaper, which quotes a military spokesman.
The ship was supposed to have become part of the fleet in 2014, but rendezvous problems have plagued the ambitious project.
The four ships from the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, which the fleet ordered back in 2007, will replace the aging frigates from the Bremen class.
They are known to have a powerful cannon, a wide range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles as well as stealth technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Another important feature of the latest frigates is a smaller need for maintenance: it should be possible to have the frigates away from home ports for up to two years.
But the repeated delays mean that the advanced warships – which are said to make Germany appear as an overseas power factor – will already be obsolete when they are deployed, writes Die Zeit.
The failed F125 frigate created headlines last year when the German fleet officially refused to take up the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the fleet delivered a ship back to the shipbuilder after delivery.
It was not known much about the reasons for the return, but German media mentioned a number of crucial "software and hardware errors", which made the warship useless in combat situations.
Software errors were of particular importance as the ships from the Baden-Wuerttemberg class must be controlled by a crew of 120 sailors – only half of that crew from the older Bremen frigates.
It also turned out that the ship was too heavy, reducing its performance and limiting the fleet's ability to update in the future.
The 7000 tons of heavy "Rheinland-Pfalz" is said to be twice as heavy as similar ships used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to hardware errors, the price of the project, which includes training of the crew, is also becoming a problem.
It is said to have reached staggering €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion), with an initial price of €2.2 billion.
The problems with the latest frigates are becoming even more important in the light of recent warnings that Germany's fleet power is shrinking.
Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Government's Defence Committee, admitted earlier this year that the fleet "run out of ready-to-set ships."
The official said that the problem has grown over time because the old ships were taken out of service without being replaced.
He regretted that none of the frigates from the Baden-Wuerttemberg class were ready to become part of the fleet.
National Trust Sneams the Secret Life of Bats
New research from an area in the Scottish highlands is trying to reveal how bats use the landscape when they hunt.
The hope is that the findings will shed light on the behaviour of the unique flying mammals and will help in the work on future conservation efforts.
The study is conducted by scientists from Scotland's National Trust and follows common bats, dwarf bats, long-eared bats and water bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment is placed in carefully selected locations in the area to record the activities of bats throughout the season.
Data is also collected from staff from NTS and volunteers using handheld detectors.
In-depth analysis of the sound recordings will reveal the frequencies of the bats and show which species does what.
To produce a detailed landscape view of their behavior, a report and a map of the habitat are made.
NTS Rob Dewar Nature Conservation Adviser hopes that the results reveal which areas of habitat are most important and how they are used by the different species.
This knowledge can help to determine the benefits of habitat conservation efforts such as the establishment of meadows and how best to preserve forest areas for bats and similar species.
The number of bats in Scotland and the United Kingdom has fallen dramatically over the last 100 years.
They are threatened by buildings and urban expansion projects that affect shipowners and restrict their habitat.
Windmills and lighting can also pose a danger, as can fly traps, chemical treatment of building materials and pet attacks.
In fact, bats aren't blind.
But because they primarily hunt at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes.
They use an advanced echolocation technique to find insects and fly around obstacles.
NTS, which is responsible for the conservation of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, takes bats very seriously.
They have ten trained experts who often collect data, inspect shipowners and sometimes make rescue operations.
The organization has even made Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve at the area around Thrave in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight out of ten of Scotland's bat species.
The caretaker of the area, David Thompson, says it is an ideal territory for them.
"Here at Threeve we have a really good area for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, a lot of old trees and all the good habitat.
Man there is much you don't know about bats, so work here and elsewhere can help to understand what they need to thrive."
He emphasizes the importance of looking for bats before making maintenance tasks on properties, as the destruction of a single nest can kill up to 400 females and young ones, thus risking the destruction of an entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass or disturb them or their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish project manager for the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to give a hand.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many of the species we have, we don't know how the populations develop."
Ronaldo rejects the charges of rape, while lawyers file a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has called rape charges against him "fake news" and says that people "will promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyers are getting ready to sue the German news media Der Spiegel, who brought the charges.
The attacker from Portugal and Juventus has been accused of having raped an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
It's said he paid her $375.000 to keep it a secret, wrote Der Spiegel last Friday.
Some hours after the claims had been published, 33-year-old Ronaldo counted his 142 million followers on Instagram Live and criticized the information for being "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news," said the five-fold winner of Ballon d'Or to the camera.
"They will promote themselves by using my name.
That's normal.
They'll be famous by saying my name, but it's part of the job.
I am a happy man, and everything is good," added the player smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel because of the charges they have called "an unforgivable publication of suspicions of privacy".
Lawyer Christian Schertz says that the player would seek compensation for "moral corruption in a class similar to the accusation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The incident allegedly took place in June 2009 in a room at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly took back to the player's room, where he must have raped her anal according to the filed report in Clark County City Court, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronald fell on his knees after the alleged incident and said that he was "a good guy 99% of the time" gripped by "one percent".
The case files claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex but that there was consent to it.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had her injuries photographed in a hospital, but that she later agreed to an agreement outside the court because she felt "afraid of retaliation" and worried about being "publicly ashamed".
The 34-year-old now says that she will reverse the agreement, as she is still deeply affected by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo faced a shift from Manchester United to Real Madrid when the event was supposed to take place, and changed this summer to the Italian big club Juventus for 100 million €.
Brexit: United Kingdom "will forever regret" losing car manufacturers
Britain "will regret it forever", if it lost its world-leading car manufacturer status after Brexit, said business minister Greg Clark.
He added that it was "anxious" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily lower production at the plant in Burnaston near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that longer waiting time at the border in the case of a Brexit without agreement could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which produces Toyotas Auris and Avensis, produced almost 150,000 cars last year, where 90% of these were exported to the rest of the EU.
"As I see it, production will stop at our factory if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March," said the Managing Director of Burnaston, Marvin Cooke.
Other British car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, express fear of leaving the EU without an agreement on cross-border trade.
For example, BMW says that they will close their Mini factory in Oxford one month after Brexit.
The main concern of car manufacturers is about the risks associated with the supply chain in the event of an outage without agreement.
Toyota's production runs on a tight schedule, where parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU.
If Britain leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, problems could arise at the border, which according to the automotive industry could lead to delays and a lack of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day's production at the Derbyshire plant, and then production would be stopped, said the company.
Clark says that Theresa May's Chequers plan for future negotiations with the European Union is "complemented so that these inspections are precisely avoided at the border."
"We need an agreement. We want the best agreement that not only allows us – as I call it – to enjoy our current success, but to seize this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today program.
"The opinions of Toyota and other manufacturers point out that we need to be able to continue what has been successful supply chains."
Toyota could not say how long production would have stopped, but in the longer term higher prices would reduce the factory's competitiveness, which will ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years and is a co-responsor at the factory, says that his members are becoming more and more concerned: "My experience tells me that as soon as these jobs disappear, they will not come back."
A government spokesman said: "We have proposed a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the European Union."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, says the White House
Donald Trump's important meeting with the Deputy Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein can "be postponed for another week" as the settlement of the Supreme Court-nominated Brett Kavanaugh continues," said The White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein looks the special prosecutor Robert Mueller over the shoulder during his investigation of Russian interference, relations between Trump's assistants and Russia and the President's possible obstruction of the court's proceedings.
Whether Trump will fire the Deputy Minister of Justice and thereby risk Mueller's independence has been a gossip topic in Washington for months.
The New York Times earlier this month wrote that Rosenstein was considering carrying a microphone to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of dismissing the president via the 25th paragraph.
Rosenstein denied the news.
But last Monday he went to the White House, and the rumor was that he would quit.
Instead, a meeting was held with Trump on Thursday, which was at that time in the United Nations headquarters in New York.
Trump said that he would "not prefer" to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was delayed to avoid a coincidence with the Senate's court hearing, where Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual assault, were to testify.
Last Friday, Trump ordered a week's FBI investigation of the allegations against Kavanaugh, which delayed the Senate's election.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders was on Fox News on Sunday.
When she was asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "There is no date set. It could be this week. I can also imagine that it could be pushed a week with everything going on in the Supreme Court.
But we have to see, and I always like to keep the press up to date."
Some journalists would challenge the claim: Sanders has not held a press meeting in the White House since September 10.
The host Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said that the lack of press meetings was not due to TV journalists' games for the gallery, but added, "I don't disagree that they play up to the camera."
She then said that the direct contact between Trump and the press will be increased.
"The president accepts more questions from the press than any president before him," she said, adding without quoting a source, "We've looked at the numbers."
Press meetings will still take place, said Sanders, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask direct questions to the President of the United States, it is infinitely much better than talking to me.
We're trying to give it a rich opportunity, and you've seen us do it over the last few weeks, and it's going to be in the press when you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump often accepts questions when he leaves the White House or attends open hearings or press meetings with high-ranking guests.
Press meetings with Trump alone are rare.
This week in New York the president showed why when he made an improvised and sometimes mysterious figure in front of the present journalists.
Minister of Health contacts EU staff in Scottish healthcare after Brexit concerns
The Minister of Health has written to the EU staff working in Scotland's NHS to express its gratitude and its desire for them to remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before Britain withdrew from the EU.
The government of Scotland has already committed itself to paying for the applications for permanent residence for EU citizens working in its delegated public sector.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on withdrawal have continued and it appears that decisions are expected to be taken by the autumn.
But the British Government has also increased their preparation for a possible Brexit without an agreement.
I know this must be a very uncertain period for all of you.
That is why I would like to reiterate how much I appreciate the efforts of each employee, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from and outside the EU come with valuable experience and competences that strengthen and improve the work of health care for the benefit of patients and local communities.
Scotland is absolutely your home, and we very much want you to stay.
Christion Abercrombie has acute surgery after major injury
The lineback from Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, was acutely operated after having suffered a major injury in Saturday's 31-27 defeat to Vanderbilt Commodores, reports Tennessee Mike Organ.
First Coach of Tennessee State, Rod Reed, told journalists that the incident took place before the break.
"He went out to the sideline and just fell out there," said Reed.
Practitioners and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before they put him on a stretcher and took him into further investigation.
A Tennessee State spokesman told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie's operation at Vanderbilt Medical Center was over.
Harris added that there are no "any details of the type or extent of the damage yet", and Tennessee State is trying to find out when he caused the damage.
Abercrombie studies in second year and starts her first season in Tennessee State after a shift from Illinois.
He had five battles on Saturday before leaving the game, giving him 18 battles gathered this season.
Foreign buyers are charged higher stamp duty when buying houses in the UK
Foreign buyers are charged higher stamp duty when buying a property in the UK. The extra money is to help the homeless according to the Conservative Party.
This move must dampen Corbyn's success in attracting young voters.
The higher stamp tax will affect those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Ministry of Finance expects it to raise £120 million a year for the homeless.
Theresa May will today propose that foreign buyers be charged a higher stamp tax when they buy properties in the UK for the benefit of the homeless.
The draw will be seen as an attempt to match Jeremy Corbyn's success in attracting young voters with promises of cheaper housing and going after them with the highest income.
The increase in the stamp tax will affect people and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK. The income from this will be used for the government's fight to ensure that everyone has a place to sleep.
The additional fee, added to the current stamp fee and the higher levels introduced two years ago on multi-home purchases and purchases for rent, can reach 3%.
The Ministry of Finance expects it to collect £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13% of new constructions in London are purchased by people living abroad, making prices higher and making it more difficult for first-time buyers to get a foothold in the housing market.
Many rich areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become " ghost cities" because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new bill comes only weeks after Boris Johnson proposed a cut in the stamp tax to make it easier for young people to buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping the property prices up by buying land they do not use. He asked May to drop the quotas on cheap homes to solve Britain's "disgraceful housing situation."
Corbyn has proposed an obvious number of housing reforms, including control of rental prices and the withdrawal of the lessor's opportunity to put people on the streets if they comply with the lease.
He will also strengthen the possibility of building public residential buildings.
May said: "Last year I said that I would use my presidency to restore the British dream; that life will be better for every generation.
And that means repairing our non-functioning housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who will live, work and build a life here.
But it cannot be said that it is as easy for foreign companies and people living outside the UK to buy homes as for hardworking British.
For far too many people, the dream of owning a home has become too distant, and the unworthiness of sleeping on the street is still far too widespread."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to become a coach of Scotland"
The head of Sunderland, Jack Ross, says that his "ultimative goal" is at some point to become the coach of Scotland.
The 42-year-old shot has the challenge of reviving the North East club, which now has third place in League One, three points from the top.
He switched to Stadium of Light this summer after looking for St. Mirren back in the Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
"I played a game with the B team, and that was it," said Ross BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
"But I grew up to see Scotland on Hampden with my father when I was a child, and it's always pulled into me.
However, this option would only arise if I succeed in training clubs."
Ross' predecessors as coach for Sunderland are Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former coach for Alloa Athletic says that he had no concerns about following such established names in such a large club and had previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Now I measure success based on whether 'I can get this club back in the Premier League.'
Based on the structure and facilities of this club, it undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task, but I'll probably only see myself as successful here if I can get the club back there."
Ross is only three years in the career as a coach after a period of assistant training at Dumbarton and a 15-month failure as part of Heart's training staff.
Then he helped Alloa come back after being pushed down in the third-best row and transformed St Mirren from the fallout threat to the title winners the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did during his career as a player for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a real divide," he remembers the time in Alloa.
"I sincerely believed that training was the right thing for me, more right than being a player.
That sounds strange because I did well, served sensibly and had some success experiences.
But it can be hard to play.
There's a lot of things you need to go through on a weekly basis.
There is still the kind of stress and pressure that trains, but it just feels right.
I have always wanted to train, and now I do. I have not felt more comfortable with myself throughout my adult life."

The best time for a beer is Saturday at 5:30 p.m., shows study
The heat wave this summer has increased earnings for England's pubs but has put restaurant chains under greater pressure.
Sales at pubs and bars rose by 2.7% in July, while sales at restaurants fell by 4.8%, showing figures.
Peter Martin, a business consultant at CGA, who has collected the figures, said: "The continuing sunshine and the UK's unexpected long World Cup have meant that July follows the pattern of June, where the pubs experienced sales of 2.8%, except that the restaurants are harder hit now.
The decline of 1.8% in restaurants in June was only worse in July.
Pubs and bars with a focus on the sale of beverages clearly did the best and experienced progress similar to the decline of the restaurants.
Pupils with focus on food suffered in the sun, but not as much as the restaurants.
Looks like people just want something to drink.
Across pubs and bars, sales of beverages increased by 6.6% for the month, while food fell by 3.3%."
Paul Newman, who analyses the service industry, said: "The results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
When it comes to sales on the outdoor-off-home market, weather and major social or sports events are the main factors.
It is no surprise that the restaurants are still struggling, although a decrease in sales of 4.8% year after year will really hurt over rising costs.
The long, warm summer could not come at a worse time for the food industry, and only time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we have had in August will give a much needed breathing space."
The total increase in sales combined for pubs and restaurants including new openings was 2.7% in July, showing the decline in newly started brands.

Every five children have secret accounts on social media that they hide from their parents
Every five children – up to the age of 11 – have secret accounts on social media, which they hide from their parents and teachers, show investigation.
A study of 20,000 students in 4-9th grade reveals growth in "false Insta" pages.
The news has heightened fear of sexual content
20% of the students said they have a "main account" that they can show their parents
Every five children up to the age of 11 create accounts on the social media that they hide from adults.
A study of 20,000 students from 4th grade onward reveals violent growth in "false Insta" accounts – a reference to the Instagram imagery service.
The news has heightened the fear of sexual content being posted.
20% of the students said they have a "main account" that they can show their parents while they also have private.
A mother who fell over her 13-year-old daughter's secret account, so a teenager who called on others to "rape me."
The study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) for private schools found that 40 % of 11-18-year-olds had two profiles, half of which admitted to have private accounts.
The head of HMC, Mike Buchanan, said: "It is frightening that so many teenagers are tempted to make online profiles where their parents and teachers cannot find them.
Eilidh Doyle will be the voice of the athletes on the board of Scottish Athletics.
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Board of Scottish Athletics at the annual general assembly of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland's most winning athlete, and President Ian Bettie described the change as a good opportunity for those who make decisions about sports to benefit from her great 10 year experience at international level.
"Eilidh enjoys great prestige in the athletic world in Scotland, Great Britain and the rest of the world, and we are sure that athletics in Scotland will benefit from getting her on board," said Beattie.
Doyle said, "I will try to be the voice of the athletes, and I hope that I can contribute and help in plotting a direction for sports in Scotland."
The American, who won two of his four Olympic gold medals in the 200- and 400-metre races at the Olympics in Atlanta in 1996, and who are now often commentators of the BBC, could not go after a transitory ischaemic attack.
On Twitter he wrote: "A month ago I was hit by a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said that time would show if I would get on top of it and to what extent.
It has been hard work, but I am quite healthy, have learned to go again and do today agility exercises!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Advertising for breast pump comparing mothers with cows gets mixed reception online
A breast pumping company has shared opinions online with an advertisement that compares nursing mothers with cows that are milking.
To mark the launch of what is said to be the "first silent breast pump in the world", the technological consumer magazine has published a sarcastic music video-inspired advertisement to show the freedom that the new pump gives mothers.
Four real moms dance in a salad full of hay for a song in which it says, "Yes, I'm milking myself, but you don't see a tail" and "If you hadn't noticed, this isn't my breasts."
"Pump it out, pump it out, I'll feed my baby, pump it out, pump it out, I'll milk my bosom."
But the advertising, which has been published on the company’s Facebook page, has led to controversy online.
With 77,000 views and several hundred comments, the video has received a mixed reception from the viewers. Many say it makes fun of the "danger" of the dairy industry.
"Very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they must become pregnant and feed before they can produce milk, except that their babies are stolen from them shortly after birth," wrote one user.

Another wrote: "Intelligiblely traumatic for both mother and child.
But yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump to mothers who are allowed to keep their children?"
Another added, "What an insensitive advertising."
Others defended the advertising, and a woman admitted that she thought the song was "unbelievably funny."
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
If I was still breast-feeding, I'd have one.
Lactation made me feel just like a cow.
The advertising's a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
It's a brilliant product," one wrote.
Another commented: "It is a fun advertising directed at mothers who pump milk (often at their workplace or in toilets) and feel like 'cows'.
It is not an advertisement that praises or criticizes the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, the women reveal that they have danced with the discreet pumps in their bras.
The concept behind advertising is based on the fact that many women who are breast-feeding say they feel like cows.
The pump from Elvie is completely silent, has no pipes or hoses and fits discreetly in a breast-fed bra, giving women the freedom to move, keep their children and even go out while they are pumping.
Ana Balarin, partner and director of Mother, wrote: "The pump from Elvie is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between nursing mothers and dairy cows, we would focus on the challenges of breast pumping, while we showed in an entertaining and recognizable way the freedom that the new pump can give."
It's not the first time the Elvie pump made headlines.
In London Fashion Week a mother went to two catwalks for Marta Jakubowski while she used the product.
Several hundred migrant children secretly moved to tent camp at the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has exploded, although the number of border crossings has not changed. This is partly due to a tougher rhetoric and the tighter laws of Trump administration that make it harder to place children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors have been undocumented immigrants themselves, and they have feared their possibility of staying in the country by standing up and accepting a child.
The return risk increased in June when the authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of the household would provide fingerprints and that these data would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week Matthew Albence, a high-ranking official at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified to Congress and told them that they had arrested several people who applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The administration later confirmed that 70 % of the arrested had pure criminal records.
"Nearly 80% of those who are sponsors or members of sponsors' households are residing illegally in the country, and a large proportion of them are foreign criminals.
So we keep chasing those people," said Albence.
In an attempt to deal with children's cases more quickly, the authorities have introduced new rules requiring some of them to meet in court within one month of their detention.
Many use video calls instead of meeting up and talking their case for a legal stay with an immigration judge.
Those who are judged unjustified for residence are deported quickly.
The longer children are in custody, the more likely they are to experience anxiety or depression, which may lead to violent outbursts or attempted escape, it is said from relief workers and in reports that have emerged from the system in recent months.
People who advocate better conditions say that these risks are more pronounced in larger facilities such as Tornillo, where size makes it harder to keep an eye on whether a child is suffering.
They added that moving to a tent village without mental preparation or the opportunity to say goodbye to friends can accumulate traumas that many are already struggling with.
Syria informs US, French and Turkish "employees" that they must withdraw immediately
When Syria's Foreign Minister, Walid al-Moualem, spoke to the UN General Assembly, he asked Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, also Deputy Prime Minister, said that the presence of foreign forces in the country is illegal and under the pretext of combating terrorism, and they will "be met with similar means."
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he said to the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the war against terror "nearly is over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have fled their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue to "fight this crucial war until we have cleared up all Syrian territories" for both terrorist groups and "illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria who primarily train and advise Kurdish and Syrian-Arab forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in the war - torn country.
In the area of refugees, Moualem said that conditions were good enough for them to return home, after which he accused "some Western countries" of "spreading unwarranted fear" that caused the refugees to disappear.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to help facilitate these repatriations," he said.
"They are policing what should be a purely humanitarian matter."
The United States and the European Union have warned that no assistance will be made available to rebuild the country until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Syria to establish a buffer zone in the last major insurgent city of Idlib has created an opportunity to continue political talks.
Because of the agreement between Russia and Turkey, a large attack was avoided by Syrian forces supported by Russia against the province, where three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action would go after jihadists from the Nusra Front, a group of sources of Al-Qaeda who "will be destroyed".
The UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of the new committee soon to outline a post-war constitution for Syria and to pave the way for an election.
Moualem has laid down conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in the committee and states that the work of the panel should be limited to "reviewing the legislation of the current constitution", and warned against interference.
That's why Trump wins another presidential term.

There is currently no sign of vision fatigue.
Since 2014, viewer numbers in the best transmission time have almost doubled for CNN to 1.05 million and nearly tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in best broadcast time compared to 1.7 million viewers four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBC’s The Rachel Maddow Show has most viewers with up to 3.5 million viewers in nights with great news.
"It's a spectacle that people are attracted to because it's not something we understand," said Neal Baer, director of the ABC Drama Designated Survivor about a leader of the cabinet who becomes president after an attack destroys the congress building.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy writer and author behind "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Snowing Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
She remembers a rate in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he was going to vote for Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
"He said, 'Because he makes me laugh,' said Scovell.
The chaos has entertaining value.
But unlike all other television programmes, the stories coming from Washington can decide between Roe and Wade whether refugee families can be reunited and the health of the world economy.
Changing the channel is only the most privileged wonder.
And yet it's more than being an enlightened citizen when you see six hours of panel debate, where experts discuss Bob Woodward's use of "deep background" when he wrote his book "Fear"; Paul Manafort's ostrich leather jacket for $15,000 ("clothed with hybris," wrote The Washington Post) and the implications of Stormy Daniel's vivid descriptions of Trump's anatomy.
At least I'll never see Super Mario in the same way.
"Some of the things that make it feel like a reality show is that he gives you something every night," said Brent Montgomery, Managing Director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", about the Trump show's rotating crew and daily surprises (disputes with N.F.L, praise to Kim Jong-un.)

When I got Fleiss this week, it was 26 degrees outside his home on the north coast of Kauai, but he sat inside and saw MSNBC while he was recording CNN.
He could not force himself away; not with Brett Kavanaugh, who was to be consulted in the Senate's judicial committee, and the future of the Supreme Court had to be decided.
"I remember when we were doing all these crazy shows in the past, and people said, 'It's the beginning of the end of Western civilization'," Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right."

Great sums find their way to the close middle-way election to the House of Representatives
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania receives large sums of money. As a result of an equalization of two "Congressional Districts", two congressmen fight for the same seat.
This newly converted suburb district in Pittsburgh creates problems for the democratic representative of Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another special election last spring.
Lamb opposes another member of the Congress, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who now represents the 12th district of Pennsylvania, which overlaps heavily with the new 17.
The cards were converted after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled in January that the old district was unlawfully placed in the favor of the Republicans.
The struggle for the new 17th district has started a struggle for financial resources between the committees of the major parties, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a election with high vigilance in March's special election for the 18th district of Pennsylvania.
The seat has been on the Republican hands for over ten years, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political commentators give the Democrats a small advantage.
The United States considered punishing El Salvador for support to China, but changed its mind
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognised Beijing with few protests from Washington.
Trump had a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela from Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until partners threw out Trump's management team.
Foreign Minister officials decided to call back senior US diplomats from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama after "the recent decision to stop recognising Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, Foreign Minister spokeswoman in an announcement earlier this month.
But only El Salvador was punished. They received about $140 million from the United States in 2017 for, among other things, drug control, development and financial support.
The proposed penalties, including cuts in financial aid and restrictions on admission permits, would have been painful for the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder statistics.
As internal meetings progressed, North and Central American officials launched a summit on security and economic development, which should have continued last year's meeting, which was considered a step towards preventing immigrants from coming to the United States.
But in mid-September, top officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place anyway, and thus dropped the consideration of punishment to El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence must speak to the conference scheduled for mid-October in order to send a signal of the importance that the Americans attach to the meeting, said diplomats.
And the three U.S. agents secretly went back to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without new harsh demands or penalties from Washington.
A spokesman for Bolton from the White House did not want to comment on the details of the case described by three American officials, including two diplomats who would like to talk about the internal considerations if they remained anonymous.
Their descriptions were confirmed by an outside analyst who is close to the administration and who also spoke on the basis of anonymity.
Known History
The next obstacle could well be the special prosecutor Robert Mueller's report on Trump's possible obstacle to the investigation, for which there is considerable and publicly available evidence.
It is said that Mueller will also address his investigation into the question of whether Trump's campaign secretly cooperated with Russia on the attack on the elections.
If Congress were to come on new hands, Trump would likely be held accountable while preparing to meet the voters again and, in time, a jury of his fellows.
There are many uncertainties, and I do not claim that Trump’s finale is inevitable – and the same applies to his counterparts in Europe.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we must all make choices that will affect how long the battle will continue.
In 1938 German officers were ready to make a coup against Hitler if only the West could resist him by supporting the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and did not seize the opportunity to avoid the years of bloodbath afterwards.
It is about such turning points that the axis of history turns, and the irresistible march of democracy on or off.
In the United States, there are now several of these turning points.
What if Trump fires the man who decides the future of Mueller's investigation, Deputy Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein?
Rosenstein's seat has been warm since the present newspaper announced that he had proposed last year to make hidden recordings of the president and challenged his suitability for office.
According to Rosenstein, The Times' production is inaccurate.
"How do we react if F.B.I.'s recently requested investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is suspended or not properly carried out – or if he is approved to the Supreme Court despite credible charges of sexual assault and false testimony?
And, more importantly, will we vote for a Congress that will hold Trump accountable for the mid-term elections?
If we fail these trials, it will be a long winter for democracy.
But because of what I learned in Prague, I believe we can do it.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the Nazi regime itself, who once occupied the country of my embassy.
She survived, immigrated to America, and sent me away 60 years later to light the Sabbath light on the table with the garden cross.

Graham Dorrans from Rangers is optimistic about the fight against SK Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will host SK Rapid Vienna on Thursday. After the impressive undecided result in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, with a victory against the Austrians, they will have good opportunities to move on from Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented the midfielder Graham Dorrans from getting the season debut before the 2-2 fight against Villarreal, but he believes that Rangers can use the result as a springboard for something even bigger.
"That was a good point for us, because Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old.
"We went to the fight with the belief that we could get something home, and we got a point.
Perhaps we could have gone home, but all in all that was probably a reasonable result.
They were probably best in the first half, but we got out in the second half and were the best team.
Thursday will be another great European evening.
We hope to get three points, but it will be difficult because they got a good result in the last game. But with the audience behind us I am sure we can put pressure on them and get a good result.
The last year has been hard because of everything that has happened to my injuries and the changes in the club, but the mood is good now.
The team is good, and the boys really enjoy it.
Hopefully we can run on now, put last season behind us and succeed."
Fear of pension savings makes women sleepless
Despite the fact that the survey participants had a solid idea of how they wanted to be cared for, there were few who talked to the family about it.
About half of the participants in the Nationalswide study reported that they discussed the cost of long-term care with their spouse.
Only 10 percent told me they were talking to their kids about it.
"Most people want a family member to take care of them, but they don't do anything to start the conversation," says Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationalswide's life insurance business.
That's how you get started.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to take care of you if you do not share your wishes with them in good time.
Use your advisor and your family to discuss where and how you will receive care. These choices can be crucial factors for costs.
Ask your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you find out how to pay for the expenses.
Long-term care can be financed by means of traditional long-term care insurance, life insurance with cash payments or self-insurance with your own funds – as long as you have the finances for it.
Get the legal documents arranged: Take the legal battles in the lead.
Get an authorization so that you can get a trusted person to handle your medical treatment and make sure that doctors and nurses comply with your wishes, in case you cannot communicate yourself.
Consider also an economic mandate.
In that case, you shall designate a trusted person who may make financial decisions and ensure that your bills are paid if you do not have the opportunity to do so yourself.
Do not forget the small details: Imagine that one of your aging parents needs urgent medical attention and is on their way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medicine and allergy?
Get all these details down in writing, so you're ready.
"It's not just a question of the economy – who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What medication?
Who's the dog looking for?
Get the plan in place."
Man shot several times with air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air rifle on his way home from a tour of the city.
The victim was in the '40s and was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, diaphragm and hand.
Officers describe the shooting, which took place around 2:30 p.m., as "incidentally."
The victim didn't see the perpetrator.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police urge witnesses to stand up.
Tsunami and earthquakes in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a violent earthquake and a tsunami, which on Friday hit the Indonesian city of Palu.
Since the communication routes are out of play, emergency workers have not been able to receive information from the Donggala County, an area north of Palu, which is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the earthquake hit.
Here are some facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi province and is located at the bottom of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, which in 2017 had an estimated population of 379,800.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and the tsunami hit.
Donggala is a county that extends over 300 km of coastline on the northwestern part of the island of Sulawesi.
In 2017, the government, which is an administrative region under a province, had an estimated population of 299,200.
Fisheries and agriculture are the pillars of the Central Sulawesi economy, especially in the Donggala coastal area.
Nickel extraction is also important in the province, but takes place mainly in Morowali, which is the coast opposite to Sulawesi.
According to Indonesia's disaster centre, Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times over the last 100 years.
In 1938 a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
In 1996, Donggala was again hit by a tsunami who killed nine.
Indonesia is seismologically affected by the so-called fervor in the Pacific and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Some of the greatest earthquakes and tsunami in recent years have been:
2004: A violent earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia’s Aceh Province in northern Sumatra triggered a tsunami on 26 December that struck 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, including more than half of those in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit Sumatra's west coast at the end of March and only in April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake measuring 6.8 struck south of Java, Indonesia’s most densely populated island, and triggered a tsunami that hit the southern coast and killed almost 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of 7.6 struck near the city of Padang, the capital of the western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: An earthquake measuring 7.5 struck one of the Mentawai islands from Sumatra and triggered a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A superficial earthquake struck Pidie Jaya's reign in Aceh and spread destruction and panic as the population was reminded of 2004's deadly earthquake and tsunami.
No tsunami was triggered this time, but more than 100 were killed by the collapse of buildings.
2018: Heavy earthquakes hit Indonesia’s tourist island Lombok and killed more than 500 people, mainly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son charged with domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and vice president candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested for violence.
29-year-old Palin of Wasilla, Alaska was arrested for suspected domestic violence, preventing the reporting of domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to the report issued on Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, he took the phone from a female acquaintance when she tried to report the alleged crime.
Palin is in custody at the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility with a deposit of $500 without security, reports KTUU.
He was brought to trial on Saturday, when he declared himself "by no means guilty," reports the network.
Palin is charged with three Class A crimes that could lead to a one-year prison sentence and a $250,000 fine.
He has also been charged with a Class B offense that could lead to a single day sentence in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged with crimes.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
The case is pending at Alaska's Veterinary Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, with preventing the reporting of a violent crime in the home and possession of weapons in affected condition in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of having slapped her in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups after explaining his son's violent behavior with PTSD as a result of his posting in Iraq.
Earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia: several hundred dead
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake on Friday hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
The earthquake measured 7.5 and triggered a tsunami that destroyed hundreds of homes.
The area is free of electricity and communication routes, and the number of deaths is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake hit just south of the central Sulawesi, which is northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
On the social media there are videos that show at the moment where the earthquake strikes.
Several hundred people were gathered at a beach party in the city of Palu, when the tsunami broke down on the coast.
Public prosecutors try to get terrorist suspects in NYC sentenced to rare death sentences
Public prosecutors are trying to impose a death sentence on Sayfullo Saipov, a suspect in the terrorist attack in New York City, who killed eight people – a rare punishment that was last sentenced to a crime in the state in 1953.
In October, 30-year-old Saipov reportedly used a construction rental car Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bicycle path along West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, where pedestrians and cyclists who got in the way were maimed.
As a basis for the death penalty, the prosecutors must prove that Saipov "wilfully" killed the eight victims and "wilfully" caused serious personal injury, which is required by the declaration of intent for capital punishment in the southern district of New York.
According to the legal document, the death penalty is a possible result of both of these charges.
Several weeks after the attack, a state jury was able to present Saipov for a 22-point appeal, including eight charges of murder in gangsters typically used by public prosecutors in organised crime cases and an accusation of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "comprehensive planning and preparation," said the charges and described Saipov's performance as "extreme, vicious and depraved."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused personal injury, bodily injury and loss to families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleveland, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," says the statement of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since New York's southern district last raised the defendant in a death penalty case.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was sentenced to murder of two drug suppliers, but ended up being sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The death penalty was last imposed in a New York State case in 1953, when Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being sentenced to espionage on behalf of the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenberg couple were executed in the electric chair on 19 June, 1953.
Saipov came from Uzbekistan and, according to the legal documents, showed no signs of remorse in the days and months following the attack.
According to the police, he told the investigators that he was well off with his actions.
According to the charges, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to commit the attack by watching ISIS videos on his phone.
He also asked to hang the ISIS flag in his hospital room, told the police.
He has refused to accept the 22 points of the charges.
David Patton, one of Saipov's public defenders, announced that they "were of course disappointed" at the decision of the prosecutors.
"We believe that the decision to go after the death penalty and not accept a confession and life imprisonment without the possibility of release will only prolong the trauma for all those involved," said Patton.
Saipov's defenders had previously asked the charges not to go after the death penalty.
Conservative Minister believes that NIGEL FARAGE should take over the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the public army" during a demonstration at the conservative meeting today.
The former Ukip leader said that politicians should be able to "mark" the pressure" from Eurosceptics – after one of Theresa May's own ministers had said that Farage should take over the negotiations with the European Union.
Private Conservative MEP Peter Bone said to the Birmingham demonstration that Britain would have "been out now" if Farage had been a Brexit negotiator.
May's challenge in creating a gathering in the deeply divided party is underlined by the fact that conservative remainers participate in a separate demonstration against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is fighting to keep his compromise plan on track during attacks by both Brexiters, Remainers and the European Union.
Her allies insist that despite the setback she will continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels – and thus force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package or "chaos".
To the demonstration Leave Means Leave in Solihull, Bone announced that he would scrap the Chequers plan.
He explained that Farage should have been included and given him responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was responsible, we'd be out by now," he said.
The Minister from Wellingborough added: "I will fight for Brexit, but we have to scrap Chequers."
On the basis of his EU resistance, he said: "We did not fight world wars to be subordinate to anyone.
We will determine our own laws in our own country."
Bone rejected the fact that the public's position should have changed since the vote in 2016: "That the British people should have changed their mind and would like to stay in the European Union is completely wrong."
Conservative Brexitist Andrea Jenkyns was also at the demonstration and told the journalists: "I'm just saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The Chequers plan is unpopular in the broad population, the opposition does not vote for it, it is unpopular in our own party and among our activists, who are actually on the street and get us elected.
Now drop Chequers, and start listening to me.'
As a point of observation to May, she added, "Premier ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Farage told the procession that politicians should be able to “mark the pressure” if they fail the resolution of the vote in 2016.
"Now it is a matter of trust between us – the people – and our political class," he said.
"They will betray Brexit, but we are gathered to tell them that we will not let them get away with it."
In a message to the enthusiastic audience, he added: "You must make sure that the political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit, can feel the pressure.
"We are mobilizing the people's army here in the country that gave us the victory in Brexit, and we will not stop until we have become an independent, self-governed and proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, marchers marched through Birmingham before a two-time shot in the middle of the city.
Scattered activists fanned with Conservative Mod Brexit banners after the propagation of the group this weekend.
The Labour colleague Lord Adonis made a mockery of the security problems with the Conservative Party app before the meeting.
"These are the people who claim to be in control of the IT systems and technology for Canada, of border controls, of free trade without frontiers in Ireland," he said.
"It's quite a joke.
Nothing is called a good Brexit," he added.
Warren "considers strongly" to stand up for the presidential election
Member of the House of Representatives Senator Elizabeth Warren "considers strongly to stand up for the presidential election" after the mid-term election in November.
According to Boston Globe, the Massachusetts democrat spoke of his future during a city council meeting on Saturday in the Western Massachusetts.
Warren, who has often criticised Donald Trump, will try in November to re-elect the state's Republican candidate Geoff Diehl, who was co-chairman of the Trump Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
One has wondered if she would challenge Trump in 2020.
The Holyoke meeting on Saturday afternoon was her 36th meeting with the voters at the town hall, since Trump took over the office.
One participant asked her if she was planning to stand up for the presidential election.
Warren replied that it is time that "women go to Washington and repair our political system, and that requires a woman in front."
Arrest on the LSU Sims shooting case
The Baton Rouge police, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that a suspect for the shooting of Wayde Sims, the basketball player from LSU, was arrested on Friday.
The Baton Rouge police reported that 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson had been arrested on Friday for an ET news meeting at 11 a.m.
They had released a video of the shooting on Friday to ask for help in identifying a man on the footage.
Twenty-year-old Sims was shot and killed near Southern University early Friday.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head and died of the damage," said police chief Murphy J. Paul, according to the media 247sports.
Wayde intervened to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and confessed to have been present in possession of a weapon and to have shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without any problems and is now a police officer in the East Baton Rouge District.
Sims was a two meter high third-year student who grew up in Baton Rouge. Last season he played 32 games, started in ten and played an average of 17.4 minutes and made 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is close to the World Championship, after team orders give him victory over Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the orders of the Mercedes team would play a decisive role in the race.
From the driver's position, Bottas got off to a good start and was close to snuffing Hamilton completely off when he defended his position in the first two turns and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to drive in the pit, leaving Hamilton to fight with the traffic at the back of the field, which should have been crucial.
The Mercedes car went into pit a bit later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton came back in front, when, after some wheel contact, the Ferrari driver had to reluctantly leave the inner lane after a double defense at the third turn.
Max Verstappen started from the back row and was number seven after the first round on his 21st birthday.
Then he led in a large part of the race when, in an attempt to quickly finish, he failed to change tyres to take Kimi Raikkonen's fourth place.
He had to go to pit at round 44, but could not increase the pace of the last eight rounds, why Raikkonen secured fourth place.
"It's a hard day because Valtteri made it amazing all weekend and really was a gentleman when he let me pass.
The team did an incredible job to secure us both first and second place," said Hamilton.
Really bad body language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein at an election meeting on Saturday because she insisted that she had not leaked the letter from Christine Blasey Ford, who accused the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
At an electoral meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention the testimony that Ford had given before the US Senate's judicial committee, but instead said that the events in the Senate showed that people were "wicked and repugnant and dishonest".
"The one thing that could happen, and the beautiful thing that has happened in the last few days in the Senate, when you see the anger when you see people who are angry and evil and disgusting and dishonest," he said.
"When you look at statements and leaks, and then they say, "Oh, it wasn't me.
It wasn't me."
Do you remember that?
Diane Feinstein, was it you who leaked it?
Remember her answer... was it you who leaked the document – "Oh, uh, what?
No, no.
I haven't leaked anything."
Hey, hold on a second.
Did we leak... no, we haven't leaked anything," he added in an imitation of the senator.
Feinstein got the letter about Ford's accusations against Kavanaugh back in July, and it was leaked earlier in September – but Feinstein denied that the leak came from her office.
"I haven't hidden Dr. Ford's accusations, and I haven't leaked her story," said Feinstein to the committee according to The Hill.
"She asked me to keep the letter confidential, and I did."
But her denial was not well received by the president, who said during Saturday's election: "I tell you that it was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
During the president's continued defence of the nominee judge to the Supreme Court, who has been accused of sexual assault by three women, Trump proposed that the Democrats use the accusations to benefit their own cause.
"They do not shed any money in their efforts to take power back.
You can see the evil, the abominations, they don't care who they have to drum to get power and control," said the president, according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars vs Belfast Giants 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars did well after Friday lost the Elite League match against Belfast Giants by winning the 5-3 return match in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants quickly came forward with two targets with attacks from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie evened out at home before Dwyer brought the Giants back to the front.
Francois Bouchard evened out for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory with two more goals.
It was the third Elite League defeat of the season for Adam Keefe's team that came from behind to beat Dundee 2-1 in Friday's fight in Belfast.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the sides where the Giants went out as victors in the three previous matches.
Dwyer spent the fourth minute at 3:35 from an assistant from Kendall McFaull with David Rutherford as an assistant when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In a busy first period, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt was behind Cownie's compensation at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure that the Giants came forward at the first break when he made his second goal at the end of the first period.
The home team regrouped, and Bouchard rebalanced with a nice goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran worked together to help Nielsen lead Dundee ahead for the first time in the game late in the second period, and he secured victory with the fifth goal of the team halfway through the last period.
Giants, who have now lost four out of their five matches, are at home in Milton Keynes for their next match on Friday.
Air traffic controllers died to ensure that hundreds of air passengers avoided earthquakes
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is hailed as a hero after he died to ensure that a plane with several hundred passengers safely came to the ground.
More than 800 people are dead and many are missing, after a major earthquake on Friday hit the Sulawesi island and triggered a tsunami.
Heavy aftershocks still plague the area, and many are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Although 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung's colleagues fled for life, he refused to leave his place in the floating control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He stayed in his seat to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, who held on the runway, got safely in the air.
He jumped out of the control tower because he thought it was falling apart.
He died later in the hospital.
According to the Australian ABC News, spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said that his decision may have saved hundreds of lives.
We got a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"We're broke," he added.
The authorities fear that the death toll can reach several thousand, and the country's preparedness for disaster reports that there is limited access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
"The death toll is expected to rise because there are still many bodies in the ruins, and it is not possible to reach them," said the spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Up to six meters high waves have destroyed Palu, who is holding a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft fly in emergency aid and supplies.
The 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, said to Sky News: "Every minute a new ambulance comes with several bodies.
There's a lack of clean water.
All the stores are looted."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is working hard to help the survivors, but we do not know what we are going to find out.
It's already a tragedy, but it can get a lot worse."
Indonesia's President Joko Widodo arrived at Palu on Sunday and said to the country's military: "I ask you all to work 24 hours a day to carry out all the tasks associated with the evacuation.
Are you ready?" he said according to CNN.
Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombrok earlier in the year, where more than 550 people died.
Flight crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says that a man is missing after the plane crash in the lagoon
The airline behind the plane that crashed into the lagoon in the Pacific Ocean, Micronesia, now says that a man is missing, although it had previously been reported that all 47 passengers and crew members had been evacuated from the sinking plane.
According to a press release, Air Niugini states that it could not locate a male passenger on Saturday afternoon.
The airline announced that it was working with local authorities, hospitals and police to try to find the man.
The airline has not returned to requests for more information on the passenger, e.g. age and nationality.
Local boats helped save the other passengers and the crew, after the plane hit the water during landing at the airport on the island of Chuuk.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline says that six passengers stayed in the hospital until Saturday and that they were all in stable condition.
It is still not clear what caused the crash and the exact order of the events.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both state that the plane landed in the lagoon in front of the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane was flying past the runway.
The American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane landed on very low water.
"That was really lucky," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and other passengers could go in water for life to get to the emergency exits on the descending plane.
He said that the crew panicked and yelled, and that he had suffered a minor head injury.
The American Navy said that sailors working to renovate a quay nearby also helped in the rescue work by using a rubber boat to ship people ashore before the plane sank at about 30 meters depth.
Data from Aviation Safety Network shows that 111 people have died in accidents involving PNG-registered airlines in the last two decades, but that Air Niugini has not been involved in these accidents.
Analysts determine the timeline of the night in which a woman was burned alive
The Public Prosecutor closed his evidence on Saturday during the appeal of a man accused of burning a woman alive in 2014.
Analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, Paul Rowlett, testified for several hours as an expert in data analysis.
He described to the jury how he used telex data to intertwine the course of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said he got location data from several different cell phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, which was contrary to his previous claims, writes The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was close to Chambers' cell phone at the time he had claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, he visited the police Sanford.
Sanford sat in the stand on Saturday and told me he was out of town that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said that he was lying because my truck was in Nashville.
Another contradiction was that Tellis said that he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
The mobile data showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that at some point after Chambers' death, Tellis had deleted Chambers' text messages, calls and contact details from his phone.
"He erased her from his life," said Hale.
The defense is scheduled to begin its procedure on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the jury to vote later that same day.
The High Breed: What is political hip hop?
A hiphoptrio would like to challenge the negative view of the genre by giving their music positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol believes that hiphop has moved away from its origins with political messages and social problems.
They will return to the starting point and make political hip-hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently received a revival in Britain due to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
Nanny in New York sues couple after firing with "racist" texts
A nanny in New York is suing a couple for discriminatory firing after receiving a text message from a mother who complained that she was "another black person".
The couple denied that they were racists, but compared the case with "expression".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two, expressed his apprehension at finding out that the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, was black when she met on her first working day in 2016.
"No, no, no, no, no," wrote Plasco-Flaxman to his husband in a text message.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Giselle Maurice, even twice.
When she discovered her mistake, the "inconvenient" Plasco-Flaxman fired Giselle Maurice and said that their former nanny, as from African-American, had been bad for her work, and that instead she expected a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Giselle Maurice was paid for her one day's work and sent home in a Uber.
Now, Giselle Maurice is suing for compensation for the firing and compensation for 350 dollars a day for the six months she was supposed to have lived with the family, even if this was agreed without a contract.
"I'd like to show them that you can't allow yourself to do something like that," she said to the newspaper on Friday and added, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple have defended themselves that they are not racists and that the firing of Maurice was justified because they were afraid that they would not be able to trust her after insulting her.
"My wife had come to send her something she wouldn't have said.
She's not a racist.
We're not racists," said Joel Pasco to The Post.
"But would you leave your children to someone you had been rude to, even if it had happened by mistake?
Your baby?
Oh, come on."
Plasco compared the case to "expression" and that his wife had born two months before and was in a "very difficult situation".
"Do you really go after someone like that?
It is not very friendly," added the investment adviser.
Although the trial is still in progress, the People's Court has already depreciated the couple on social media and shamed their behaviour and logic.
A new letter reveals that Paddington publishers feared that readers could not relate to a talking bear
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was recorded for publication, said of the letter: "It's hard to imagine being the one who reads it for the first time before it was published.
It's quite fun to read now when you know how popular Paddington became."
She said that her father, who worked as a cameraman on the BBC before he was inspired to write the children's book about a small teddy bear, would have been optimistic, even though his story was rejected, and that the 60th year for the publication of the books was "bitter-sweet" after his death last year.
She describes Paddington as a "very important part of our family" and says that her father was proud of his success in all modesty.
"He was a quiet man, and he didn't like to brag," she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it almost felt as if you had a child who achieved something: you are proud of them, even though it is not really your merit.
I think he saw Paddington's popularity that way.
Although it was his work and his imagination, he used to say that it was Paddington's fault."
Say goodbye to dying daughter over the phone
After the landing, her daughter was taken to Hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where the doctors in vain tried to save her life.
"Nad called at regular intervals to say that it was really bad and that she probably didn't survive," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad that she would die within the next few minutes, and that I had to say goodbye to her.
So I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, baby.
I'll see you soon.
I'll see you.
The medication she had received to keep her heart going slowly lost their effect.
She was dead shortly before, and now her body shut down.
I just had to sit there and wait for it to happen.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to try to get together."
Finally, the grieving Ednan-Laperouse boarded the plane with the other passengers who had no idea what she was going through.
"No one knew," she said.
"I bowed my head, and the tears kept running.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane I had an overwhelming sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Suffering Women Trying to Stop Suicide Shoppers
Two women who have lost relatives to suicide are trying to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have set up maps on a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers where you can get help.
Davis's son Tyler was 13 when he had a depression, and 18 when he committed suicide.
"I don't want any parent to experience the grief I experience every day," she said.
45-year-old Sharon Davis said her son was a promising cook with an infected smile.
"His smile was known by everyone.
People said his smile lighted up the room."
But he stopped working before he died because he felt really bad.
In 2014, it was Tyler's 11-year-old brother who found him after he had taken his life.
Sharon Davis said, "I'm always afraid if it spreads."
Sharon Davis made the cards to "tell people that there is someone out there that you can contact and talk to, even your friends.
Don't go with your own thoughts – you have to talk to someone."
Sharon Davis' long-standing friend, Kelly Humphreys, lost his girlfriend for 15 years, Mark, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say anything about being sad or depressed or something," she said.
"Some days before Christmas he began to change.
He was really down Christmas Day. When the children opened their gifts, he had no eye contact with them at all."
She said that his death was very traumatic for them, but that they have to get through it: "It has created a hole in our family.
It's torn us apart.
But we all have to keep on fighting."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is still unsolved while the FBI is starting investigation
"I thought that if we could actually get something like what he was asking for – a time-limited study with limited scope – we could perhaps get a little agreement," said Flake on Saturday and added that he feared that the committee would "fall from the hind" in the middle of the locked-up party situation.
Why would Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not have the FBI do their research?
Their restraint is due to the timing.
The mid-term elections are only five weeks away, on 6 November, and if the Republicans, as expected, manage poorly, they will be weakened in their efforts to get the man they would like to have elected to the highest judicial office in the country.
George W. Bush has called Senators to get them to support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Bush and thereby met his wife Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI completes its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still not known whether Kavanaugh can have at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would give Vice President Mike Pence the decisive voice and elect him to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean jumpers falls under Kim Jong-un
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug referred to data from South Korea’s merger ministry and said there were 1,127 defectors last year compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park mentioned that stricter border controls between North Korea and China and higher figures due to traffickers were involved in the changed figures.
Pyongyang has not made any official comments.
In time, the vast majority of those from North Korea are offered citizenship in South Korea.
The government of South Korea states that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the Korean war ended in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the longest border facing North Korea and which is easier to cross than the heavily guarded demilitarized zone between North and South Korea.
China regards the defectors as illegal immigrants and not as refugees, so that they are often forced to return home.
The relationship between North and South Korea – which technically is still in war – has improved significantly over the last few months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries of Pyongyang met to discuss the stranded negotiations on nuclear disarmament.
This happens after the historic meeting in June between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed to work towards a nuclear-free Korea on a general level.
North Korea's Secretary of State Ri Yong-ho blamed American sanctions for the lack of progress.
"Without confidence in the United States, there is no faith in our national security, and under such circumstances it is impossible that we will disarm ourselves," said Ri in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he is unfit for the Supreme Court
President of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called Brett Kavanaugh, who is nominated as Supreme Court judge, "hysterical" and said that his temperament was not suitable for the Supreme Court.
Pelosis's comment came in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman had behaved that way, they would have called her hysterical," Pelosi said about his reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Committee on Legal Affairs last Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally rejected the accusations that he had committed a sexual assault on Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
In his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, and when he talked about his family and his years in high school, he almost cried and was crying.
He also condemned the Democrats in the committee and called the accusations against him "grotesque and coordinated character courage" arranged by the left wing, who was angry that Hillary Clinton did not win the presidential post in 2016.
Pelosi said that she believed that Kavanaugh's statement proved that he could not sit in the Supreme Court because it showed that he was prejudiced against the Democrats.
"I think he has disqualified himself with the statements and the way he went after Clinton and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi went away when she was asked if she would try to bring Kavanaugh to a state court if he was confirmed and if the Democrats get a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I would say that if he does not speak the truth to Congress or the FBI, he is not fit to sit in the Supreme Court, but certainly in the court he is in now," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the Washington D.C. appeal court.
Pelosi added that as a democrat she was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions regarding Obama's health reform or the abortion case Roe v. Wade, because he is considered a conservative judge.
During the hearings, Kavanaugh did not answer questions as to whether he would reconstruct certain previous Supreme Court decisions.
"It must not happen that a hysterical, preconceived person must challenge a job as a judge and expect us to say 'yes, it's not just great'," said Pelosi.
And women have to use it.
It's a fair outcome, months and years of anger that's over, and she can't get it out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's abnormal."
She continued: "I got a lot of support from a woman who was the boss who said that she also cried when she got angry, but that she developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and started crying, she would say to the one she was talking to: "You might think I'm sorry because I'm crying.
But I'm angry."
And then she just kept going.
And I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are allowed as an expression of anger, partly because they are basically misunderstood.
One of my most obvious memories is from one of my first jobs in an office with an overweight of men, where I often cried with anger, where I was caught at the neck of an older woman – a cold boss, whom I had always been a little afraid of – and pulled out on the stairs.
"You must never let them see you cry," she said to me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They'll think you're sorry, and they'll be glad they got you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a member of the Congress of Democrats from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential election campaigns.
In 1987, when Hart was exposed to having an affair on a boat called Monkey Business and withdrew as a candidate, Schroeder was really frustrated and came to the conclusion that she could do as well herself as the presidential candidate.
"It wasn't a very well thought out decision," she laughed at me 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race, and they certainly did not need another candidate.
Some called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarves."
Because it was late in the election campaign, she was behind with fundraising, so she promised she wouldn't participate unless she collected $2 million.
The battle was lost in advance.
She discovered that some of her supporters, who gave $1,000 to men, gave her only $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she thought.
When she gave a talk about her not wanting to stand up, she was overwhelmed with feelings – gratitude for the people who supported her, frustration over the system that made it so difficult to travel money and reach voters instead of voters, and anger over sexism – that she got a lump in her throat.
"You'd think I had a nervous breakdown," Schroeder recalls how the press reacted to her.
"You'd think I was sponsored by Kleenex.
I remember thinking, what are you going to write on my tombstone?
"She cried"?
How the trade war between the United States and China can be an advantage to Beijing
The opening ointments in the trade war between the United States and China were loud, and although the battle is far from over, division between countries can be an advantage to Beijing in the long run, say experts.
US President Donald Trump fired the first warning shot earlier this year by imposing duties on important Chinese exports, such as solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The largest increase this week in new customs duties affecting goods for a value of USD 200 billion applies in principle to half of all products imported into the United States from China.
Beijing has made a return every time, most recently by imposing customs duties of 5-10% on American goods for USD 60 billion.
China has sworn to follow the United States all the way, and the world's second-largest economy is unlikely to give after just a moment.
If it causes Washington to withdraw its claims, it means they're yielding, but for China's president, Xi Jinping, it would be far too embarrassing to bow down to the United States.
Experts say, however, that if Beijing plays its cards properly, the American pressure in the trade war can have a positive effect on China in the long run by making the two markets less dependent on each other.
"A quick decision in either Washington or Beijing can create the groundwork for an economy that can come out of control in both countries, and it's actually much more dangerous than you thought," said Abigail Grace, research worker with a focus on Asia at the New American Security Thought Tank Center.
Syria is 'ready' to receive refugees, says Foreign Minister
Syria says that it is ready for refugees to return and is asking for help to build the country that is destroyed by the more than seven-year war.
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the situation in the country was improving.
"Today the situation is more stable and secure thanks to the successful fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to control the areas destroyed by terrorists and is working to restore a normal state of affairs.
All circumstances are now in place so that the refugees can return to the country they had to leave because of terrorists and the unilateral economic sanctions that hit their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million acids have fled the country since 2011, when the war began.
A further six million people still in the country need emergency aid.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian government was happy to accept help to rebuild the devastated country.
But he stressed that the government would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that helped support the uprising.
Europe secures Ryder Cup victory in Paris
The European team has won the Ryder Cup 2018 and beat the American team 16,5 - 10,5 in Le Golf National outside Paris.
The United States has now lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won a single Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the trophy back when Captain Thomas Bjørn's team reached the 14.5 points that it required to beat the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who had a hard time most of the tournament, shot his drive in the lake at par 3 on 16th hole, causing him to lose the match against Francesco Molinari.
Italian Molinari did well in all rounds and became 1 out of a total of 4 players who have received 5-0-0 since 1979, where the current format of the tournament started.
American Jordan Spieth was sent out with 5&4 of the lowest ranked European player, Danish Thorbjørn Olesen.
No. 1 on the world rankings, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 and 1 to Ian Paulter from England, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
The veteran with eight Ryder Cups in his luggage, Spainrd Sergio Garcia, became the tournament's most winning European with 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a tough year.
I am very grateful that Thomas chose me and believed me.
I'm really happy to get the trophy back.
It's a team effort, and I'm glad I could help," said an emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He sends the torch to his compatriot John Ram, who fell the American golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in a single match on Sunday.
"I'm incredibly proud to have beaten Tiger Woods. I followed him as a child," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a Ryder Cup history of 13-21-3.
It's a joke statistic for one of the best golfers ever who has won 14 big titles, surpassed only by Jack Nicklaus.
The American team had trouble finding the form throughout the weekend with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who had a solid game throughout the tournament.
The American captain, Jim Furyk, said after his team's disappointing show, "I'm proud of the boys, because they fought for the cause.
There was still time this morning when we countered Europe.
We lost.
The hat off for Thomas.
He's an excellent captain.
All his 12 players played really well.
We will regroup, and I will work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee, and then we will move on.
I love those 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to lighten your hat.
