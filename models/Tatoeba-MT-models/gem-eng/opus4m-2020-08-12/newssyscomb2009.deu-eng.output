Triumph of the right-wing populists in Austria, total they reach 29 percent
After the first preliminary results, a marked weakening of both parties in the previous great coalition and a clear strengthening of the right-wing populist parties brought the preferred parliamentary elections of Sunday in Austria.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) suffered particularly losses, where the position of former chairman Wilhelm Molterer is seriously on the verge.
In contrast, the election leader of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), the Carinthian state chief Jörg Haider, is preparing for a triumphal return to federal politics.
According to the results so far, Social Democracy (SPÖ) remains the strongest force in the country with 29.8 percent of the votes, but loses 5.5 percent of the votes compared to the last elections in 2006.
The ÖVP cut even worse, which loses almost nine percent of the votes by 25.6 percent.
These are the worst results of these two major parties in the Austrian post-war history, and especially of the People's Party, which had demanded the preferred elections, this is a truly disastrous result.
At the beginning of July, when the ÖVP had resigned from the coalition, the People's Party had a clear advantage over the SPÖ.
But the voters probably punished the party for failing the government.
Already in the first reactions to the results there were speculations about the possible resignation of the party chairman and former vice-chancellor Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that this could be the case already on Monday at an extraordinary meeting of the party board.
Such a development would probably pave the way for the most likely way out of the electoral debacle, i.e. to a renewal of the great coalition of SPÖ and ÖVP.
In view of the strengthening of both right-wing populist parties - the Freedom Party (FPÖ) received 18 percent, the BZÖ eleven percent of the votes - the Social Democrats expressed their fear at the same time that the year 1999 could be repeated when the People's Party agreed with the populist parties (at that time the FPÖ was still unified, in 2005 it split itself from the BZÖ) with regard to a common government, which had even caused sanctions on the part of the European Union.
Jörg Haider, who already stated that he was willing to cooperate with each party, is obviously relying on this development and is starting from a return to Vienna to Austrian federal politics.
The Green Party also moved into Parliament, but suffered minor losses and dropped from third to fifth place among the Austrian political parties.
No other party has probably mastered the four-percent price and therefore did not move into Parliament either.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India can cool down
In the view of the Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg, if it is not possible to solve the problem with the Czech scientists who have been accused in India of the illegal collection of beetles, there could be some cooling of Czech-Indian relations.
This was emphasized by the Minister in New York after today's meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukhordshi.
"If this does not work out, then surely, there will be some cooling," he explained after a meeting that took place on a Czech initiative.
Mukherdshi said after the talks, in judicial matters the executive could only intervene difficult.
In spite of all this, he argued that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was acquitted by the charge and was given a fine which the central government wanted with the local government in Dardjiling, in whose case the case-law falls.
"His problem could be solved," said the Minister.
For Emil Kučera, who was sentenced to three years imprisonment, it would be best if Mukherdshi were called at a higher authority.
He could thus ask for release for bail and wait freely for his judgment, the Minister said.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner had made the same statement during negotiations.
"He recommends an appeal to a higher court, then he would be eligible for a pardon," said the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way the Czech side can intervene in the whole matter is to let the condemned "competent legal support" be declared, the Indian minister pointed out.
At the same time, he said that such assistance would already be offered by the Indian side.
"We have a great interest in maintaining good contacts with India that have a long-term tradition.
The Indians also admit this," said Schwarzenberg.
At the same time, according to the Czech press agency ČTK, in front of his partner, he confirmed the Czech Republic's importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We really think it is a big mistake to arrest and accuse these Czech scientists," he said.
An answer to the question of whether he had received a commitment from the Indian side to deal with the matter did not go away from the minister.
"I've already been promised quite a lot," he simply noted.
A Czech judge over the wringing of the seabed
It enters an electronic map showing Australia and the adjacent sea areas.
However, he is not interested in the continent, but in a small point, lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and together with it also the adjacent seabed.
The area is as large as the continent itself," says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is one of the thirty members of the UN Division for Oceans and Sea Rights.
His boss, the division director, the Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, follows the interpretation and supplements it.
This is where there is work and enthusiasm.
The seabed has so far held a little known world, which is rich in natural sources.
Here, oil can be found, ore and other non-renewable raw materials, but also unknown living organisms that carry the key to the development of a medicine for cancer.
A seabed larger than the mainland
The neighbouring states today vehemently declared their claim to the new sea areas.
After a UN convention, they avail themselves of their rights, on which they agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay in Jamaica.
This is mainly the area of the so-called continental shelf, which often reaches a few hundred kilometres from the shores of a country into the sea.
According to the Convention, this country has an exclusive right to all sources of the continental shelf.
"Simplifiedly expressed as a continental shelf, the part of the seabed and its soles is considered to be a natural continuation of the continent below the sea surface.
It crosses the shoreline, often also the border of two hundred nautical miles of the so-called exclusive economic zone," explains Mikulka.
The request submitted by the relevant Commission country to establish the external borders of the continental shelf must be supported by a comprehensive scientific and technical documentation based on many cost-intensive studies and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparatory work.
"One of our tasks is to provide the Commission with legal and technical technical support.
The Commission has so far negotiated five applications from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Until now, only the last three countries have had success," adds Mikulka.
An international echo recently encountered the success of Australia, which was the first country to significantly enlarge its sea areas.
But New Zealand is also a winner - the expansion of the seabed, which was approved by the Commission last week, is about 1.6 million square kilometres, i.e. about six times the size of the actual state.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in the investigations.
The profits that flow to them in the future from the use of the seabed will, as they promise, have an invaluable value.
Other countries will also gradually submit their applications.
You can do this for ten years from the moment they ratify the "Montego Bay Agreement".
Where the continental shelf ends, the area of the ocean floor, referred to by the Convention as a "common heritage of humanity", begins.
This is no longer a state with a special position.
The right to promote in this area is conferred on an international institution set up by the Convention.
"The seabed, however, is not a gold mine land," says some exaggeration director Mikulka, adding that "individual areas are legally defined and the system is contractually anchored".
Czechs in the Pacific
A part of the sea floor belongs to the Czech Republic today.
It shares it with other states of the former Eastern bloc within the framework of the joint organization "Interoceanmetal".
In 1991, it was granted the status of a so-called "breakdown investor" by the Convention, as well as by investors of a few more countries.
The organization has the right to promote in the Zone Clarion Clipperton in the Pacific Ocean between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati.
The area to be investigated by the investor is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The seabed is divided there, it is a kind of tatra on the seabed.
"There you can promote on an area of a total of 75,000 square kilometres.
The area is a rich site of polymetal concretions containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," says another lawyer, Indian Pakshi Rajan.
The Macedonian employee of the Rober Sandev division brings such a concrete approach as a pattern.
It reminds us of a small potato or, with some imagination, of the legendary scheme that the legend has brought to life after the Golem.
German Special Forces were on site for hostage relief
The Egyptian government had requested assistance from Germany to resolve the hostage crisis - the experts came.
When it became serious, the special units were ready, but they were not used.
More and more details are being known about the circumstances of the liberation of eleven European tourists abducted in Egypt.
According to the Ministry of Defence and the Interior, German special forces were indirectly involved in the rescue operation.
Thus, both specialists in the Bundeswehr as well as officials of the GSG 9, were the pilot squad of the Federal Police, the Federal Criminal Office and logistics experts of the Technical Aid Office at the place of liberation.
However, as ministers continued to report on Monday evening, the German forces were not needed because the hostages let their prisoners run and fled when they recognized signs of a violent liberation.
The Egyptian government had accepted the assistance offered by Germany to involve them as local support forces.
"Unfortunately, this has not been done," said a spokesperson of the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
The attackers had kidnapped the group from the five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian and their eight Egyptian companions in the south of Egypt on 19 September.
After the abduction in a desert area in the south of Egypt, the hostages had been dragged back and forth in the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
Until recently, the identity of hostages remained unclear as well as the details of the release or possible ransom payments.
The rescuers have now arrived in Cairo safely.
Steinmeier said that the liberated hostages were in the care of the German Embassy.
He did not comment on the details of the release.
At first, there was no information in Berlin when they returned to Germany.
According to the "Picture" newspaper, the five holidaymakers and the special forces are to be flown out with an Airbus of the Air Force and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
US House of Representatives Refuses Rescue Package
The first chamber of the U.S. Congress has made the 700 billion dollar bailout package for the financial markets scarcely fail.
The Dow Jones went to the depths.
With 206 to 227 votes, the US House of Representatives has rejected the government's rescue package for financial markets.
Despite all the appeals of U.S. President George W. Bush and leading politicians of both parties, there was no majority in favour of the programme to curb chaos in the financial markets.
In a dramatic action, the supporters had desperately tried to convince the critics of the 700 billion dollar package.
Barney Frank, one of the democratic negotiators, had called for an agreement, even if the plan was unpopular.
"It is difficult to get political recognition for avoiding something that has not yet occurred," he admitted.
In the course of the vote, the Dow Jones broke in by more than six percent or by 600 points.
The investor's concerns were that the state bailout package could fail.
He recovered shortly before the end of the vote, and then, after the failure became known, he fell back.
Experts are now expecting further severe turbulence on international financial markets.
The approval of both the House of Representatives and the Senate is necessary for the programme to enter into force.
Organizers record rising booking figures
It seems to be a good winter for the German tour operators:
For travel bookings for the coming months, sales increased significantly compared to the previous year according to a study - even by more than 30 percent for the winter season.
Despite weak economic prospects, according to a study, the Germans' desire to travel remains undiminished.
When booking for the winter season, the rice offices recorded a sales increase of 31 percent compared to the previous year, as the German Travel Association (DRV) announced on Monday in Berlin.
According to the study by the market research institute GfK, there are already increased booking figures for the autumn months.
For example, the sales increase of travel agencies for October amounted to around 11 percent compared to 2007, the DRV announced.
The basis for these results is GfK figures, which evaluates monthly booking data of 1200 German travel agencies and calculates them for the total market.
The travel bookings made until the end of August 2008 were included.
Due to the weak dollar rate, travel to the US was particularly needed, the DRV announced.
The increase in booking is around one third.
In addition, Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as the Germans, are particularly sought-after destinations.
In particular, package travel is high in the course, explained DrV President Klaus Laepple.
In view of the rising cost of energy and food, the costs "are better calculated for the customer than for the individually organised holiday".
Money could save consumers, among other things, through early book discounts or all-inclusive offers, said Laepple.
The summer months have also been very well booked, so that there will be an increase in sales compared to the previous year - although according to another study the number of Germans who made a trip fell compared to the previous year.
My first time Octoberfest
Ballermann-Apres-Ski-Hits in the endless loop, beer made of Liter-Krügen and celebrities in Designer-Dirndln.
A meadow debut.
Susanne Kronsucker and I actually don't have much in common.
She's a blonde, a TV hostess and wears a tailor-made dirndl.
I've got dark hair, I'm a student and my dress is a second hand.
But one thing connects us: almost three minutes on the meadow, the photographers are already crashing on us and pinching the memory cards full - very flattering and that at my first meadow visit.
That's how you make friends.
The cheap dirndl seems to accomplish its purpose.
When Wiesn-Touri and actually located north of the White-Wheat-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-
But first arrived in the Theresienwiese, everything is half so bad.
Almost everyone wears dirndl or leather trousers; no one looks opposed or embarrassed - all completely normal.
Strange looks at the chocolate banana stand only reap my dirty aprons.
A Munich woman draws my attention to the fact that I would have incorrectly tied the apron: "Left hoast free, mid virgin, right forgiven, rear wedded."
Secretly, I set the loop from the back to the left.
"Sure," said and laughed.
Others make less effort to subtle flirting techniques and wear simple felt hats on which "To drink to get dressed!" stands and extends to an unsolicited backside.
The young man with the exhibitionist attitudes is called Bob, who comes from England and also visits the Oktoberfest for the first time.
He finds it "gorgeous", with a long drawn "ooooo".
That's what he tells me after he's rid himself of his previously drunk measure.
Right next to one of these hydrants, everyone thinks he's a garbage bin.
So Bob's one of these infamous "Wildbiesler."
Others are not lucky enough to get rid of alcohol in this way.
At eight o'clock in the evening, paramedics run in crowds across the party square, who have to take care of the poor swallowers.
The nurses always appear in the pack - always four at a time drag a covered carrying from tent to tent.
It works like most meadow visitors: empty, full back.
You don't see who's in the promille sarge under the plane.
"These are the ones where goarneber pack," one of the paramedics called me upon request and disappeared in the mire.
Name of the victim of the accident announced by the police
The name of a 63-year-old female pedestrian who died in the hospital after she was hit by a car in Essex was announced.
Carole Paulson, who lives on Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the accident on Friday afternoon on Shenfield Road in the city center.
She was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford but later died.
A 51-year-old man was arrested after the accident because of suspicion of wanton driving.
Meanwhile, he was released on bail.
Turkey expands the diplomatic horizon
Long before Turkey sought to join the European Union, the European powers were interested in entering deep into Turkey's hinterland.
On the eastern side of the Bosporus, perhaps just 20 steps within Asia, is one of the finest relics of this failed, imperial endeavor.
The Hydarpasha station was designed by the two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in the Neo-Renaissance style.
At least that's what the guides tell you.
The building sits riding at the end of the platform with a tower at every corner of the front and looks like any provincial German town hall.
The rock is dirty.
The whole building is falling apart about
But once you are inside the curved ticket switch, there is no doubt about the grandeur of the project, the most western access of which was.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, the Anatolia-Bagdad Society.
Germany, which was a late mover in the imperialist game, had before its ambitions to implement the Middle East, by means of a train link to Damascus, Baghdad, and beyond what is today Saudi Arabia.
But Germany's imperialist projects paralyzed during the first world war.
His railroad tracks were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his Arabs.
The relative isolation of its surrounding region, created by the insurmountable limits of the cold war, has disappeared.
British forces moved out of Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies from Palestine and Syria
And there was also bad news for the Hyderpasha train station.
In 1917, a munitions train flew into the air, destroying the artistic roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then it has slowly decayed, largely passed from history.
Today, however, this railway line, at least symbolically, serves as a gateway to Anatolia and everything east of it to highlight the expansion of the diplomatic horizon of the Tukei.
The Governing Party for Justice and Development, the ACP, has introduced a wretched new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of the neighbouring regions, created by the borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
Now there is a policy of rapprochement.
Remarkably, the Turkish Government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian splitters Hamas and Fatah, with Iran and Iraq and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
In order to assess the key facts of this new foreign policy, I have taken the night train to the Turkish capital Ankara to visit one of the ACP's leading foreign policy experts, the Turkish MEP Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning, about ten and a half hours later, after a bumpy ride on tracks that produced the same step of the old world in the famous documentation "The Night Mail", I arrived in the Turkish capital, which is considered to be a new city, for the new secular state project, the Ottoman past to turn my back on.
However, the ACP, known for its Islamic roots, represents a paradigm shift in Turkish unity
This has triggered a lot of mistrust in the West, especially in Washington.
A taxi took me to the head office of the AKP, a specially crafted, state-of-the-art stone and steel construction, in a developing suburb, surrounded by semi-finished shopping centres and pubs where middle managers in suits, both men and women, met to complete the first business of the day.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a middle-right politician from almost any other political party in Europe.
Suit, tie, I'm sure he even packed a blackberry.
"The objective of the Party's foreign policy is now to reintegrate Turkey with its immediate neighbours.
The Cold War was an exception," he tells me.
Turkey had been cut off from its hinterland.
Today, she has to look east and west at the same time.
There would not be either one or the other.
She'd have to do both.
"But surely Turkey could at some point," I asked, "be forced to decide?"
"Turkey," he said, "did not want to make this decision."
He then highlighted a point that almost everyone I spoke with almost routinely stated: Turkey's relations, not only with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus and around the Black Sea, are just as beneficial to Europe and the United States as they are to Turkey.
With Turkey on board, the message seems to be able, in the transcribed sense, to drive Europe as a whole on those rail lines east towards Asia and the Middle East.
Back at Hydarpasha's station, after another largely sleepless night, I thought of these two German lordships, Mr. Ritter and Mr. Conu, who had watched the construction of this building 100 years ago.
How surprised they would have been to learn that Europe's ambitions in the Middle East could now, to a large extent, lie in the hands of Turkey.
And when I was waiting at the dock for the ferry to take me back over the Bosporus, I remembered that Turkey was always called "the sick man of Europe" in those days.
At least there did not seem to be much doubt as to which continent should have a right to this fascinating country.
In memory of Vernon Handley and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown writes: As Guildford's musical director since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (born 11 September) was responsible for Guildford Philharmonic and Choir.
As part of his music program for the city, he founded his great youth choir, Proteus, the following year.
He was meant for young people up to 21 years old, but when the choir sang for the last time in 1979, some of us were already at the end of 20 - we simply refused to leave the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological form changer) stood for the willingness and ability of the choir to attack any piece of music presented to him, whether it was a Madrigal or from the Messiah, whether a capella or with a full orchestra.
The musical versatility of such a young choir was often amazing, always exciting and only thanks to the inspiration of that man and his enthusiasm for the music that never left behind for years.
How often did death keep us "let the music speak for itself".
He used to say, "The composer knows what he wants."
It's all in the music.
So sing it!"
His way of conducting was absolutely clear and precise, never mastery but never superfluous.
However high the musical level was, he always demanded an even higher.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any conductor should have been beaten to the knight, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the last two decades, from 1962 to 1982, in which he led the Guildford Philharmonic.
For the last 40 years I have written some criticisms for over a hundred of his concerts and I can honestly say that I was never disappointed by a single person - often I was inspired by them.
Death Handley was that rare combination of size and personal modesty.
He hated conductors who, according to his words, simply "entered the world with one or two famous rocking horses."
So many of us will miss him.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
In your paper for William Woodruff (September 25th), you write that "he resumed teaching economic history in Oxford in 1946 and received a Houblon-Norman research grant in 1950 ... while he was studying for a BSc, a MA and a doctorate at the same time.
This is a conclusion from an author's remark in Woodruff's book "Jenseits von Nab End", but it is not true.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a lecturer in economic history at the University of Nottingham and during this time he wrote a doctoral thesis on the British rubber industry under the supervision of Professor J.D. Chambers, who was later published in 1958 as "The British Rubber Industry".
He was born in 1950-1951 in the United States in the course of a Houblon-Norman scholarship, and spent the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham and went to Illinois.
It is not known why Woodruff wanted to cover this part of his career.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philology.
`I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino `Flamenco and Life', because his photographs in black and white, in the documentary style, are fantastic.
They made me aware of them because of their simplicity and because of the power they radiate, how they always treat the protagonists with respect.
An exhibition that shows many feelings.
Resino knows to find the magical moments.'
Second round of excellent sales at Honda.
In November Honda starts marketing the second generation of Honda Jazz.
While his predecessor model had a large interior, this large space limousine offers a much larger one.
In addition, there are also the technical refinements that enable even more comfortable driving and saving fuel.
Changes before the coming revolution.
This is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although, aesthetically speaking, the new jazz has a similar line to its predecessor, the changes that have been made to this big limousine are numerous.
Among other things, the innovative design, the new room flexibility, the larger dimensions of the car and the new mechanics are to be emphasized.
However, before you start to analyze the new model, you have to say that this new jazz appears six years later, after the first generation has appeared on the market.
According to the first observations, Honda, compared to the other manufacturers, managed to renew this model for a shorter time.
Although the Honda Jazz is less known in Europe, this model is a phenomenon in terms of its sale on the other markets.
This is a case in Japan, in the country where jazz is the best-selling car of the year 2002 and also in the course of this year 2008.
After the jazz appeared on the market, about one million models were sold in Japan alone.
The second market was the Old Continent, with about half a million cars sold in six years.
Nevertheless, Honda tries to increase the sale of the new jazz model within the segment.
In this way, while Japanese companies sold a total of 83 000 jazz models in 2007, the expected estimate amounts to 10 000 cars, which is 17% of the expected growth on the European market.
With regard to the Spanish market, Honda has sold a total of 8 000 jazz models since 2002, which is 6.7 % of total sales at Honda in Spain.
As for the new generation of the model, the managers of the branch in Spain expect to be able to sell 2,000 jazz models per year.
More precisely, the new Honda Jazz model allows the sale reduction to be hidden in Spain.
In reality, the leaders of the brand hope to complete the year with total sales of 22,000 models, which is 4 000 cars less than in 2007, a reduction of 16%.
Despite this increase in sales, Honda increased its market share in Spain to 1.8% compared to the previous year (1.6%).
At the same time, the Japanese company hopes to reach 2% in 2010.
To achieve this share, Honda relies on the emergence of a new model.
It is Insight, a hybrid car with 5 doors and compact size of 4.7 meters in length, the Japanese company hopes to sell about 200 000 models a year all over the world.
According to the Japanese manufacturer's market estimates, 50% of insight models are sold in the United States, while the rest are distributed in the Old Continent and Japan.
Insight on the market is scheduled for the first months of the year, and for the first time its public presentation will take place in Valencia in January.
With regard to the first generation, the new jazz grows in all its sizes.
Its length is 3.90 meters (plus 5 centimeters), its width is 1.69 meters (plus 2 centimeters) and the distance between the axes is 2.50 meters, which leads to the assumption that it has grown 5 centimeters.
The height, on the other hand, does not change and remains 1.52 meters.
Along with the increase in dimensions, the interior is also enlarged.
This success is due, on the one hand, to the new space flexibility program and, on the other hand, to the central position of the fuel tank, a solution that was also used in the previous Jazz model.
The capacity of the trunk, which has a double charging area, also reaches up to 339 litres, i.e. 19 litres higher than the capacity of the first generation trunk.
It must be stressed that these measures are available in the version with a 1.4 litre petrol engine, because the capacity of the Honda Jazz trunk with a 1.2 litre petrol engine is 379 litres.
Among other improvements, apart from the additional equipment elements such as leather seats or the possibility to install panoramic windows, improved access to the seats is offered.
The opening angle of the back doors is 80 degrees, with the first jazz having only 67 degrees.
The engines of the second generation of jazz are also new.
At the beginning of its marketing, this small model has 2 versions of the petrol engines: 1.2 and 1.4 litres.
Both variants have an i-VTEC system, which allows low fuel consumption and lower CO2 emissions, excellent technical performance and simultaneously provides high torque power for the whole engine run time.
The first version with 1.2 liters achieves the power of 90 hp at 6 000 rotations with maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4 900 min?1 .
This gasoline engine - the predecessor jazz model reaches 78 hp - has 5.3 liters of gasoline consumption and CO2 emissions of 125 grams.
With regard to the predecessor engine, which reached 83 hp in the previous generation, it now makes it to 100 hp.
The Jazz 100 PS model 1.4 has 5.4 litres of petrol consumption and 128 grams of CO2 emissions.
'Auto-Biene', avoiding collisions
In order to advance the development of accident prevention technologies, Nissan was inspired by nature this time, more precisely, by the bees.
The Japanese company has developed a robot whose flight goes back to the swarm behaviour of bees and avoids accidents.
This robot is a bio-mimetic car robot drive or BR23C and represents the first step in accident prevention technologies.
The engineers from the Nissan Motor Co Technical Development Center have developed these small robots in cooperation with the Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology of the renowned University of Tokyo (Japan).
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Head of Technology-PR and R&D-Brand Management, the BR23C represents an extension of the four-layer Nissan security shield.
This robot is supposed to ensure that the cars of this brand are able to avoid collisions.
During the flight, each bee builds its own oval flight space, which is very similar to the Nissan safety sign.
But the most important thing is the bee’s facet eyes, which can see over an angle of 300 degrees in all directions, which allows her to fly undisturbed in her personal airspace without interruption.
In order to replicate the all-round perspective, the technicians developed the so-called Laser Range Finder (LRF).
He notices obstacles that are up to two metres in distance before the BR23C and are in radius of 180 degrees, calculates the distance to the object and sends a signal to a boarded microprocessor, which is directly translated into signal for preventing the collision
`At the moment when obstacle is noticed, the little robot will imitate the bee flight and immediately change direction by turning his wheels around 90o or even larger angles to avoid the collision.
The biggest difference to other arbitrary systems is that this evasive manoeuvre takes place absolutely instinctively.
If not, the robot could not be able to react with sufficient speed to avoid obstacles,' explains Toshiyuki Andoh, the director of the laboratory for mobility and the leading engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot deviate up or down, but cannot cross; it can only move on two dimensions and in the direction that allows it to rotate its wheels and not in the infinite directions and in the infinite way as the bees do.
For this reason, Nissan has used the rotation function in addition to acceleration and braking functions so that the small robot avoids collisions.
`This device only needs to process the information every a few seconds and act on this information.
It does not require to store either the information or the intuitive logic of the manoeuvres made, which is why it can work continuously with just or a few dozen KB of the storage space.
That sounds surprising, but it's not about the GBs and not even the MBs of the storage space.
This is the first step in the development of technologies for the immediate prevention of collisions, a technology that Nissan prophesies in the next ten years at the series cars.
The robot works with lithium-polymer batteries that are lighter and last longer than a variety of lithium-ion batteries.
Another possible application of this technology in the future could be the integration of the unit with a GPS navigation system through satellite to lead up to the target while driving while avoiding the obstacles on the way.
She's shaking before she's loaded with a mortgage.
It must be seen that the US Department of Finance, except that it has sufficient liquidity to provide the support, is not without skill.
Before the crisis and in order to avoid the involvement of US citizens in mortgage stories of allegedly paying banks, a fun and informative game for the Internet surfer has been developed: `Bad Credit Hotel', it says.
Or maybe the 'hotel of bad loans' or the mess.
The third aspect of this accommodation and especially its receptionist is to think one, two and up to three times if it is the moment not to ask for any credit.
And especially where you can do it, which is probably the goal of the game.
Certainly it has useful information, but without details.
This is more of a page for teenagers than a place for all spectators.
What will happen when the game is expanded?
Well, when a dreamy room appears in the hotel.
At least something, because it's not about buying a better house.
Morgan Stanley makes its capital available to MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) into its business, which would be the first bank in Japan to spend nine billion dollars and thus take over 21% of its capital, a innovation that is due to a strong fall in its exchange rate.
One week after a preliminary agreement had been made public, the two banks explained that MUFG will buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's stocks at a uniform price of $25.25, resulting in a total amount of $3 billion.
The assumed price is less than 19% of the share's price value on August 31st.
MUFG will invest an additional six billion dollars in the acquisition of convertible shares, which will secure a 10% profit and can be resold at a price of $3.25.
Morgan Stanley stated that the global deal will be made on the basis of a uniform average price of 29 dollars, i.e. 28% above the current price value.
The Morgan Stanley share, however, fell by 6.79% at around 17.00 GMT to 23.07 dollars.
`This strategic link represents an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley's transition to the status of a holding bank', said John Mack, Director General of the American Group.
Morgan Stanley accepted this status last week, which should allow him to extend his business to new areas, but under the supervision of the Federal Reserve.
Their connection with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis is forcing the biggest names of Wall Street to adopt a much more cautious attitude than before.
The arrangements presented on Monday also show that the agreement was changed over the last few days: Last Monday Morgan had simply explained that she would sell up to 20% of their shares for about $8.5 billion to Japan.
`A week ago', said in Tokyo Toshihide Mizuno, Managing Director of the MUFG, `we thought that the participation would consist entirely of common shares.
But given the current economic and market situation, we wanted to reduce the risks and secure ourselves. '
Based on a balanced average price, MUFG will pay 7% below its price value for its Morgan Stanley shares.
And the business will go with a reduction of the profit by about 20% per share.
The agreement provides that in one year, MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferential shares into common shares if the latter are exchanged at more than 50% above the sale value within a given period, i.e. at approximately $47.
Morgan Stanley assures that the funds provided by MUFG will enable him to use investment opportunities, strengthen their balance sheet and increase their sales.
However, a group press spokesperson refused to provide more detailed information on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After the investment of MUFG, Morgan Stanley should be able to book a payable ratio of about 15%, one of the best in this sector.
Morgan explained that since the end of August, he had 'significantly' lowered his balance sheet.
The last few weeks were hard for the group who had to watch their exchange rate go down by half, while the price of insurance against incapacity for payment accelerated.
This price went down on Monday, but remained at a high level, at about 12%.
Goldman Sachs, the only remaining 'survivors' of the large investment banks on Wall Street after the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the purchase of Merrill Lynch, announced last week, 15 billion dollars, partly at Berkshire Hathaway, the group of Warren Buffett.
Rafael Correa this Monday in Quito.
Refound the Republic around socialism of the 21st century.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Equatorial Rafael Correa.
This Sunday, following the example of his like-minded and friends, it was that third party who put the plan of a new constitution to the vote.
Mission accomplished, because according to the public results of 80% of voters' votes, 64% agreed with 'Yes' in the referendum.
According to these results, 28% voted with 'No', 7% of the ballots were invalid and 0.7% were empty.
In order for the Constitutional Project to be adopted, more than half of the votes cast must be cast.
On Sunday, two polls conducted at the exits of the polls and a census of a non-governmental organization had announced a clear victory for 'Yes', and he prophesied 63% to 70%.
In the night from Sunday to Monday, by the way, Rafael Correa had called for the victory of his constitutional project.
The 'Constitution has triumphed overwhelmingly', he had assured Guayaquil, the seat of the government 280 kilometers southwest of Quito, and congratulated the Equatorialians.
Of course, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Chávez and Morales, but also by his Chilean like-minded Michelle Bacheloret.
The election held in silence in accordance with the Conference of Observations of the Organization of the American States (OAS) referred to a text consisting of 444 points to secure the 'new socialism' for which the President is committed.
The Constitutional Project transfers state power to the economy by leaving it the sole right to 'development planning' in a country that lives largely from the promotion of oil by foreign companies and by the currencies, sending emigration to the country.
The project, driven by the Correa elected in 2006, also grants the Head of State greater power, which will be able to exercise up to two consecutive mandates of four years each, and will have the opportunity to dissolve the National Assembly.
Correa already announced that he would use this power and seek a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also ensures the principle of free medical care and education, which the President has already begun to introduce in this country with 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population live below the poverty line.
In the end, it also foresees banning the presence of foreign troops, which will put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington on the use of an Equatorial base as a base for American anti-drug operations.
The 19 hostages were freed in Chad
An Egyptian command started the attack on the abductors of the eleven tourists and their eight companions who had been captured ten days ago.
You're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions, who were held in the desert for eleven days, were brought back to the Egyptian capital this Monday afternoon healthy and undamaged.
In the morning they had been liberated from an Egyptian command in Chad.
Apparently in good condition, the hostages reached the al-Maza military base right next to Cairo International Airport at 3:30 p.m. on board a special aircraft.
They were taken directly, without being able to speak to the press, on board a helicopter to the hospital of Maadi, a foreign district of Cairo, to be investigated there.
They enjoy all 'best health' and the kidnappers 'no ransom was paid', said Egyptian tourism minister Zoheir Garanna on the roller field.
After being captured on September 19 at an off-road safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat in the border area of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, the group of hostages was repeatedly taken from one hiding place by 35 unknown abductors.
These are eleven tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - and also eight Egyptians: two leaders, four chauffeurs, one border guard and the director of the agency Aegypus, organizer of Safari.
An Egyptian security officer explained that 30 members of the special units, from two helicopters, started the attack at night shortly before dawn.
`On both sides shots fell and half of the kidnappers were killed, the rest fled', said the responsible person who wants to remain anonymous.
He stated that a total of 150 members of the Egyptian Special Forces had been sent to Sudan, where they were supported by German and Italian commands.
The head of the Italian diplomats Franco Frattini reported from Belgrade, where he is, about the role played by secret agents and elements of the Italian special units.
'We must acknowledge that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and performance of our men from the secret service and special units', he explained without further details.
He also argues that a ransom had been paid.
On the eve, the Sudanese army had claimed to have stopped an off-road vehicle in a patrol where the kidnappers, including the leader from Chad, had killed six and two arrests.
The army explained that they were in connection with a rebel group from Darfour, the Libération du Soudan-Unité movement (SLA-U), which, however, immediately contested this movement.
Letters - The silent majority of culture
A debate on the financing of culture makes headlines and is a central theme of the current election campaign.
All the better.
But one area of our cultural life remains in oblivion.
Who will stand up and challenge the pitiful sums that are given to the small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or the national historical places that are suffering from lamentable starvation?
Which politicians will dare to remind the Federal Government that it is neglecting its monuments and its culturally important buildings?
That there are no real laws in Quebec, as in Canada, that effectively protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government is providing 3.5 million euros for the restoration of Chinon Castle in the Loire Valley alone?
With our American neighbours, the constitution of their country states that the protection of the cultural heritage belongs to the culture of the American, and that this cultural heritage must be protected by all citizens, all parliamentarians and all government districts, in mutual agreement.
In Quebec, in the association of the historical societies of Quebec, at least 40,000 volunteers gathered in 211 historical societies are trying to deal intensively with history, save a few groceries from the numerous private archives, and preserve the archaeological remains.
They are also often the watchdogs of our cultural heritage who protest with the power of desperation when sponsors and decision-makers release their bulldozers on our old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When will there be a stage for history and cultural heritage?
Benelux governments state parts of the Fortis Bank
With a partial nationalisation, the Benelux countries want to take advantage of the Belgian-Dutch Fortis Bank, which has been hit by the US financial crisis in turbulence: the three states make a total of EUR 11.2 billion available to the banking and insurance institution, which also has branches in Hungary.
The governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands have consulted at the highest level on the weekend, together with the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commission Competition Authority.
In the euro area, the Fortis is the first victim of the international financial market crisis that has been going on for a year, so decisions that are now being taken in connection with the Bank could have a precedent.
In line with the decision taken on Sunday night, all three countries buy the respective shares of the bank to about 49 percent.
The bank will probably sell some of its holdings, especially the insurance activities purchased by Dutch ABN Amro last year.
The stocks of Fortis started a steep downhill last week, during the second half of the week there were already serious crisis scenarios.
However, analysts agree that the bank with its 85,000 employees is far too big for a bust.
The Institute's securities fell 12% to a 14-year-old depth on Friday.
Since January, the value of the shares has dropped by more than two thirds.
In view of the current share prices, the Group’s market value is EUR 14 billion, which is unrealistic according to the management.
According to management, the USD 700 billion American bailout package and the resulting uncertainty in the markets are due to the fortis stock market.
On Monday, however, the courses rose slightly.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed the new Director General of the Bank.
The financial institution was also looking for a private buyer, but there was no interested party with a factual offer.
The Belgian government, however, was trying to calm down - no investor should shake for his money, it said.
There has been no panic among customers so far, the bank's branches have not been stormed.
In Hungary, the Fortis has independent branches, but it also calls its own leasing companies.
Fuch in the chicken stable
Due to a person's drug consumption, life and health insurance in America often refuses to enter into a contract with a customer.
Data protection experts fear that the data market could become uncontrollable.
"There are data protection programs that link the use of drug data in any case to the consent of the person concerned.
These should be in independent hands, otherwise we trust the fox with the chickens" - quotes the Washington Post Richard Dick, developer of the program for tracking prescription data.
Insurances determine the fees and the amounts of payments in the event of damage, depending on the customer’s health status, and should the risk be overrated, the insurance will not be completed at all.
In the past, the customer was sent to a medical examination and the contract was concluded only in knowledge of the results of the investigation.
Ten years ago Dick invented a much cheaper method: on the basis of the customer's identification number, he derives the data of the last one and a half years from the pharmacies, that is, what preparations were purchased, and the program calculates from what disease the customer suffers and how his health is.
For example, if he regularly buys large amounts of cholesterol-lowering medications, it could be concluded that his blood fat level is untreatable, which would automatically turn him into a higher risk group.
There are several versions of the program in circulation - some even define a risk multiplier, so that the insurance companies only have to do the paperwork, but there are smaller difficulties.
One of the disadvantages is that many medications can be taken for different purposes, such as against migraines and hot flushes, but also against depression.
The latter is a high risk factor from the point of view of the insurers, while those mentioned above are not.
For the query and processing of the data, own companies have formed themselves, who, before they receive the data, ask the patient for his consent.
In the meantime, they have to do this by law, although omissions have not yet been handled.
Some companies even process the results of laboratory studies and connect them with the data on drug use, thus providing an even more accurate picture of the health status of patients.
More and more companies have access to the data and control of their use becomes more difficult at the same time.
Although there is a separate data protection law for health data, its effect is limited to healthcare providers and insurance companies.
The draft law has already been submitted to Congress, according to which the authorities could also control the data processing companies.
Dick Richard realizes that this is too little, so he wants to further develop his program so that the data can only be passed on with the consent of the person concerned.
Another question, of course, is that the person concerned may hardly be able to prohibit access to his data, as the insurance companies will not otherwise conclude a contract with him.
And so the chickens are left to some extent the grace of the fox.
Global food plan from Marseilles
European Union and India double trade
After the European Union and India are both the leading trading partners of each other, this was the main topic alongside other global problems at the ninth summit.
Today, too, the French-Indian summit is taking place, which mainly discusses cooperation in the nuclear sector.
While the European Union acknowledges that India is an emerging, democratic great power, which should be given more votes and say rights in international matters, the Member States have not yet been able to agree whether or not to support the permanent membership of New Delhi in the UN Security Council.
This question was not discussed at yesterday's ninth meeting in Marseille.
The French President and current EU President Nicolas Sarkozy, as well as Commission President José Manuel Barroso and Chief diplomat Javier Solana, received Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. An agreement was reached that trade should double over the next five years, i.e. to a good 100 billion euros.
Given the fact that the trade in goods rose from 25 billion to 55 billion between 2000 and 2007, this target is not even as ambitious.
In this sense, the 26 existing civil aviation agreements with India have also been legally merged into an agreement, so that air transport will also be accelerated in the future.
Until 2009, India intends to sign the Free Trade Agreement with the Union.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the pact.
The aim is to achieve a balance in the currently unbalanced relationship between the EU and India: while the Union is India's number one partner, New Delhi is only rank nine among EU partners.
The summit was dedicated to global concerns.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, as well as terrorism, was most strongly condemned by both sides, and the convening of a UN conference was also a matter of urgency.
The Doha Round should also be concluded, with both sides guilty of failure.
The EU stressed its commitment to its energy and climate programme, i.e. reducing emissions of pollutants by at least 20% by 2020.
India also agreed to make a kind of global compromise at the forthcoming climate summit and to reduce greenhouse gas production by 50 percent by 2050.
The rise in food prices should also be combated, so both support the convening of an international conference on the financial crisis.
The Indian Head of Government is visiting the French capital today, where at a bilateral meeting he will sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
In Paris, however, it is hoped that contracts to French companies worth EUR 20 billion will be awarded for the construction of nuclear reactors in India.
According to Agency notices, the agreement is to be adopted for 15 years.
Over 300 Italian publishers in Frankfurt
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
More than 300 Italian publishers will be present at the 60th Book Fair, the most important international event for right acquisition.
The international Frankfurt Book Fair awaits over 7,000 exhibitors from 101 countries for the current event. They will distribute over the 171,790 square meters of the fair and present over 403,000 titles. Turkey will be the guest of honor of the event.
The Under-Secretary of State for the Ministry of Cultural and Cultural Affairs Maria Giro will represent the Italian government during the opening ceremony in the exhibition hall: Italy will be represented in the 264 m2 exhibition room "Punto Italia".
This will be followed by a press conference near the Room Structure in the exhibition hall 5.0 of the book fair: on this occasion, figures, trends and perspectives on publishing in Italy will be discussed.
According to the data, the importance of foreign writers' books is diminishing throughout, but especially in the adult and youth sections.
Found the small aircraft of billionaire Steve Fossett, which disappeared a year ago
The small plane of Steve Fossett, which disappeared on a flight over the desert of Nevada on September 3, 2007, was discovered.
The parts have been found on a high plateau of 3000 m altitude, in the area of the Sierra Nevada Mammoth Lakes between the states of California and Nevada.
However, no human remains were found inside the plane.
The Sheriff of Madera County, John Anderson, completely dispelled the last doubts during a press conference: "The plane has been located on which a force has been sent out. Now we have the security that it is the plane with which Steve Fossett flew on the day of his disappearance."
Mr. Anderson also confirmed that no human remains were found in the plane or its vicinity.
The 63-year-old billionaire was declared dead in February.
The U.S. Traffic Safety Office (Ntsb) noted that only a few hours after the sighting of the aircraft, a team was sent out to identify the machine: it was the Bellanca 8kcab, which was lost on September 3, 2007, after Fossett started a 3-hour flight in Yerington, Nevada.
Yesterday, in California, near the border with Nevada, some of the personal items of Fossett were found from a couple near their home on the Mammoth Lakes.
These are two identifications with the name Fossetts, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of illinois, cash and a jacket.
The search for Fossett had been abandoned one month after its disappearance.
The billionaire had conquered a place in history through a long succession of records.
In 2002 he managed to circle the world ball in a hot air balloon in the sixth race: a two-week, lonely flight.
Three years later, he flew the world in a single flight without a stopover by plane.
Among his numerous records is also a 15445 m altitude flight over the Andes, but this with a co-pilot.
Glk, the advertising you don't expect
A Suv that falls through its original design and the special line design, the protruding surface and its clear angles from the traditional schemata.
With this off-roader, Mercedes-Benz has tried to breathe new breaths into the sector.
Especially because of its exceptional characteristics, the presentation of the Suv Glk will be unconventional, which will be shown in the Mercedes-Benz showroom from 17 October onwards.
Thus, the commercial drum accompanying the appearance of the new model will also appear in a new dress, namely in the form of a 3D campaign – this is a novelty in the car sector in backward Italy.
A project with a maximum effort to be carried out in different phases, which will take over the central shopping mile of Milan, the Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first phase will consist of the presentation of the car in form, with 3D glasses distributed near the Corso Como giving the whole a special look: the new Suv will thus appear in its almost real dimensions as a three-dimensional model.
In fact, the car will appear to emerge from the poster on which it is depicted.
With the help of the Elumina8 technology, the new Glk is illuminated in all its details at different moments to reassemble it as a whole.
Undoubtedly, Mercedes's concern with this advertising is to introduce a new kind of authorship into this rather stereotyped field.
But will it succeed in attracting the interest of future buyers? We will see it.
Now it's clear who the Italian Hooligans are.
They come from Triveneto – now they risk the stadium ban
Who are only these 150-200 boys and girls who are now ashamed of all of Italy? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia", which has been travelling behind for years by the Italian national team and which, frankly, until recently has not caused any serious problems.
Never before have there been clashes with opposing fans.
The origin of the group lies in the right environment.
The conveyors come from the Triveneto.
From Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udine.
In Sofia, other smaller groups from Campania and Apulia collided with these.
They wear the Tricolori on which the cities of the militants appear: however, they were removed on Saturday to avoid identification.
Their examples are the English fans.
In Bulgaria there was now a clash with a truly right-wing radical fan scene, that of Levski.
Of the Figc, 144 cards for the game were made available to Italian fans: all were displayed by name and thus easy to control.
In fact, they were also all controlled by the Viminal: among those who travelled to Sofia, no one was involved in a running stadium ban procedure.
Four fans of the Italian team, who were already preloaded in this respect, were also denied the ticket and the trip to Bulgaria.
Now the Viminal is waiting for the reports of the Bulgarian police to take further steps: in this case, the arrested or identified tifosi can expect a stadium ban of at least five years.
This is an international ban that prevents access to the stadiums throughout Europe.
So our hooligans will no longer put a foot in a stadium.
Good luck.
But now, of course, there is fear of imitation cities, which could follow these little more than 150.
"This fire must be stopped immediately, and that does not in any case give such behaviour the opportunity to justify it," says the Viminal.
Therefore, "eyes on above all also with regard to the game of the national team on Wednesday in Lecce."
In fact, there is a small core of the Italian Ultras in Apulia.
Tomorrow, the Osservatorio (Sport supervision) gathers on Tuesday the Casms, which can count on part of the Aise, that is, the secret services dealing with the problem of stadium violence.
"Duce-Duce Calle and the raised right arm during the anthem of Mameli? In Bulgaria this is not a crime..."
This is the idea of Domenico Mazzilli (evidently expressed without joy), who has been the director of the Osservatorio on the viminal for a few weeks (he took over the post of Francensco Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Prior to this, Mazzilli was the president of Trieste, where now a core of the supporters of Ultras Italia, founded in 2002.
It is true, says Mazzilli, that in Bulgaria it is not against the law to praise the Duce, but no doubt the behaviour of these 150-200 people was a disgrace.
"I am not a sociologist – add the No. 1 of the Osservatorio – crimes are handled in the country of their actions.
So far, this group had been holding back, but now it is necessary to consider what has happened and will happen.
But we also talk about the pipes during Mameli's hymn: although this is not a crime, it allows me, for there is no education..."
