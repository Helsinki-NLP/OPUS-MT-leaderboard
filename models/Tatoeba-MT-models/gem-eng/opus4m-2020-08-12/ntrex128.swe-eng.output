AM in Wales is worried to "appear as puckon"
Some AMs, members of the Wales National Assembly, are confused by a proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament – Member of the Wales Parliament).
The proposal comes after plans to change the name of the National Assembly to the Parliament of Wales.
AM across the political spectrum is worried about being ridiculed.
An AM for the Labour said his group was worried because "it rhymes with Twp and Pwp."
For readers who do not know Welsh: Twp means stupid in Welsh and pwp means pajs.
An AM for Plaid said that the group was generally "dissatisfied" and has proposed other options.
A conservative whalesare said that his group is "open" to the change of name, but pointed out that it was a short step from MWP to Mupp.
In this context, W is pronounced in Welsh like the letter U in English in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently compiling legislation for the change of name, said: "The final decision for what members of the assembly should be called is of course up to the members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh congregation the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which found strong support for calling the Wales Parliament Assembly.
As regards the title of AM, the Commission proposed Welsh Parliament Members (Members of the Wales Parliament) or WMP, but MWP received the greatest support in a public consultation.
AM obviously proposes other options, but problems with reaching a consensus can cause problems for Presiding Officer Elin Jones, who is expected to submit draft legislation on the change within a few weeks.
The legislation of the amendments also includes other amendments to the functioning of the congregation, including rules for disqualification of an AM and the design of the comitology system.
AM may vote on what is to be called when they debate the legislation.
Macedonia conducts a referendum on changing the name of the country
On Sunday, voters shall vote on whether to change the name of the country to "Republic of Northern Macedonia".
The referendum is an attempt to end a dispute that has been going on for decades with neighbouring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its neighbour represents a claim on its territory and has repeatedly protested against its attempts to become a member of the EU and NATO.
Macedonia's President Gjorge Ivanov opposes the referendum on the change of name and has said that he will disregard the outcome.
However, the supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change of name is the price they have to pay to join the EU and NATO.
The clocks of St. Martin's silence when the churches of Harlem encounter problems
"The older people I'm talking to say there was a bar and a church on every corner in the past," said Mr. Adams.
"Now there is neither."
He said it's understandable that the bars are disappearing.
"People hang out in other ways these days," he said.
"Barer is not like the living room of the area anymore, where people go on a regular basis."
As far as the churches are concerned, he is concerned that the money from the sale of assets will not go as far as the leaders expect and that " sooner or later they will end up on box one again".
He also pointed out that churches can be replaced by apartment buildings with condominiums filled with people who do not help remaining churches.
"The absolute majority of people who buy apartments in the buildings will be white," he said. "This will eventually lead to the closure of all churches, because those who move into the apartments probably won't be members of the churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis – Metropolitan Community 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original White Methodist Assembly moved out in the 1930s.
A black congregation that had a nearby church took over the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black parish led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of shops on 125th Street, a shopping street in Harlem, who refused to hire or promote black people.
The building was seriously damaged in a fire in 1939, but when Reverend Johnson’s congregation planned the renovation, they also built the bell play.
Pastor David Johnson, father Johnson's son and successor to St. Martin's, proudly called the music game "the poor's bells".
The experts who played the bell game in July had a different name for it: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also pointed out that it was the world's first watch game played by a black musician – Dionisio A. Lind, who went on to the larger watch game in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Mr. Merriweather, St. Martin's did not replace him.
The events of the past few months at St. Martin's are a complicated history of architects and entrepreneurs – some who have been employed by the church's play people, others by the episcopal foundation.
The Church Meeting – the congregation’s governing body made up of laymen – wrote to the foundation in July and expressed concern that the foundation would “try to transfer the cost” to the church assembly, even though the church assembly had not been involved when the foundation hired architects and entrepreneurs.
Some members complained about a lack of transparency from the Foundation.
Shark hurts 13-year-old who dives for lobster in California
Last Saturday, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy who dived for lobster in California on the first day of the lobster season, according to officials.
The attack took place just before seven o'clock in the morning, near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told the KSWB TV in San Diego that he had been diving with his friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy call for help and paddled there with a group of others to pull him out of the water.
According to Hammel, at first he thought the boy was just happy to have found a lobster, but then he realized that the boy screamed, "I've been bitten!"
"I've been bitten!"
When Hammel came to the boy, he noticed that the entire collarbones had been torn up.
"I called out to everyone to get out of the water. 'There's a shark in the water!' said Hammel.
The boy was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and his condition is stated to be critical.
It's not clear what shark it was.
The Navy captain Larry Giles told the mass media that a shark had seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but it had been established that it was not a dangerous shark.
Giles also said that the victim was given trouser masks on his upper torso.
Access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas was blocked for 48 hours for investigation and security reasons.
Giles mentioned that there are over 135 sharks in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's entering the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's takes on Boots, SuperDrugs and Debenhams with department store-like beauty walks with beauty specialists.
As part of a considerable push into the UK beauty market of £2.8 billion, which continues to grow despite the fall in fashion and household markets, the larger beauty corridors will be tested in 11 stores across the country and implemented in more stores next year if they are successful.
The investment in the beauty market is part of the supermarket's attempt to fill the shelves that were previously taken up by TVs, microwaves and household products.
Sainsbury's said they're going to double their beauty range to up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Existing selections from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also have more space with marked areas, such as in shops like Boots.
The retail chain also relaunches its boutique make-up brand so that most of the products are vegan – which is what more and more young customers require.
In addition, Fragrance Shop will test stand in two Sainsbury's stores – the first stand opened in Croydon in southern London last week and the second one opens in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Shopping online and the trend to buy smaller amounts of food every day in local shops means that supermarkets need to do more to attract customers.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, has said that their stores will look more and more like department stores in an attempt to fight cheap stores like Aldi and Lidl with more services and products than food.
Sainsbury's has Argos stands in hundreds of stores and has also acquired a number of Habitat stands since they bought both chains two years ago, which they believe has increased the sales of food and made the acquisitions more profitable.
The previous attempt of the rapid purchase to give the beauty and pharmacy departments a facelift failed.
Sainsbury's tested a collaboration with Boots in the early 21st century, but the collaboration ended after a dispute on how the revenues from Boot's sales would be distributed in supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sale of its pharmacy business with 281 stores to Celesio, which owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, £125 million three years ago.
They argue that Lloyds would play a role in the plan by adding an extended range of luxurious skin care products, including brands like La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial manager, said: "We have given our beauty walks a new look and a new feeling to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained employees who can give customers advice.
Our range of brands has been designed to meet all needs, and with an attractive environment in smooth places we are now an attractive beauty destination that challenges the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones "wrong" after Holly Willoughby withdraws from the £11 million deal
Dragon's Den Star Peter Jones is "wrong" about the TV actor Holly Willoughby withdrawing from a £11 million deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time with their brand Truly, with leisure clothes and accessories.
Their operations have been compared to Gwyneth Paltrows' brand Goop.
This Morning-presenter, 37, announced his decision on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has made Dragon's Den star Peter Jones furious by withdrawing from their lucrative lifestyle at the last minute – to focus on their new agreements with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones was "wrong" at a tense meeting at his business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire on Tuesday when the TV favorite admitted that her new contract – worth up to £1.5 million – meant that she no longer could focus on their brand True, with leisure clothes and accessories.
The business has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrows' brand Goop and was expected to double Willoughby's estimated fortune of £11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, announced that she was leaving True on Instagram, Jones flew to one of her holiday homes.
One source said, "Truly was clearly Holly's top priority.
That would be her long-term future for the coming decades.
Her decision to withdraw shocked everyone involved.
No one could believe it happened on Tuesday, so close to the launch.
There is a warehouse full of goods that are ready to be sold at the headquarters of Marlow."
Experts believe that the decision of this Morning-presenter to withdraw may cost the company several million because of significant investments in everything from pillows and light to clothes and the risk of further delays in the launch.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
Three - child mother Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby started True with Capp 2016 and Jones, 52, took the role of chairman in March.
The couple vacation together and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will become the brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of "I'm a Celebrity" on ITV.
A source near Jones said last night, "We're not commenting on his business."
Tough talk "and then we fell in love"
He joked that the media would criticize him for a comment that some would consider to be "unworthy a president" and that he was so positive about North Korea's leaders.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said in a news anchor voice:
"I haven't given up anything."
He said that Kim wanted a second meeting after Trump hailed their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
But the negotiations on nuclear disarmament have come to an end.
More than three months after the meeting in Singapore in June, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the leaders of the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see a "correspondence" from the United States after North Korea's first disarmament step.
He noted that instead the United States continues sanctions intended to maintain the pressure.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech to his followers.
"It's going really well with North Korea," he said.
"We were about to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a sovereign relationship."
He said that his attempts to improve his relationship with Kim have had positive results — an end to rockets, freed hostages, and returned remains of American soldiers.
And he defended his different way of talking about the relationship with Kim.
"It is so easy to behave like a president, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to get into this packed arena, we would have around 200 people here," said Trump, pointing to the audience in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake destroy island in Indonesia, hundreds die
After the earthquake on Lombok, for example, foreign NGOs were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10% of Lombok's population had lost their homes, an exemption permit was not issued, which is required for international assistance.
"In many cases they have unfortunately been very clear that they are not asking for international help, which complicates everything," said Ms. Sumbung.
Save the children gather a team to go to Palu, but it is still unclear if foreign staff can work there.
Mr Sutopo, spokesperson of the Natural Disaster Agency, said that Indonesian officials evaluated the situation in Palu in order to determine whether international organisations should be allowed to participate in the aid work.
In view of Indonesia's constant earthquakes, the country is still sadly unprepared for nature's anger.
Tsunami protection has been built in Aceh, but they are rare on other coastlines.
The absence of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, although a warning had been issued, probably contributed to the loss of life.
Even under perfect conditions it is a challenge to travel between the many islands of Indonesia.
Natural disasters further complicate logistics.
A hospital ship anchored in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it takes at least three days to reach the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo focused on promises to improve Indonesia's worn infrastructure in its election campaign and has spent large sums on roads and rail.
But inadequate funding has plagued Mr. Joko's administration for next year's elections.
Mr. Joko is also under pressure from persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where the Muslim majority has adopted a more conservative form of faith.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands lost their homes when Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets with machetes, bows and other primitive weapons.
Look at: Liverpools Daniel Sturridge signed off at the last minute against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge rescued Liverpool from a Premier League loss against Chelsea with a target for 89 minutes in Stamford Bridge in London on Saturday.
Sturridge got a passport from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 meters from Chelsea's goal when his team was down with 1-0.
He transferred the ball to the left and scooped a kick against the distant pole.
The attempt flew high across the target area towards the top right corner of the network.
The ball finally fell over Kepa Arrizabalaga's jump and ended up online.
"I just tried to get into a position to access the ball and players like Shaq always play forward as much as possible, so I just tried to give myself as much time as possible," said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante approaching and not thinking so much about it but just kicking."
Chelsea led by 1-0 after the first half after a target for 25 minutes from the Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The blue knitter slid a pass back to Mateo Kovacic, spinning off near the middle field and sprinting to Liverpool's side.
Kovacic did a quick give-and-go by the middle field.
Then he got a great kick that brought Hazard into the target area.
Hazard ran away from the defense and got the ball in the net at the far pole with a left foot kick past Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool fights Naples in the group stage of the Champions League at Stadium San Paolo in Naples, Italy at 15:00 on Wednesday.
Chelsea is opposed to Videoton in the Uefa Europa League in London at 3 p.m. on Thursday.
Death rate for tsunami in Indonesia rises to 832
According to the country's disaster agency early this Sunday, the death rate for the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832.
Many people were reported stuck in the ruins of buildings that collapsed in the 7.5 earthquake that struck on Friday and triggered waves up to six meters, said the agency’s spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at a news conference.
The city of Palu, with over 380,000 inhabitants, was full of rushes from buildings that had collapsed.
Police arrest, 32, suspected of murder after the death of a woman
A murder investigation started after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old was found at 7:55 with knife wounds on Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested for murder.
The police have asked people in the area who saw or heard something coming up.
Detective Brian O'Hagan said, "We're in an early stage of the investigation, but I ask everyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I also ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have filmed something with a car camera to contact us because they may have information that is crucial to our investigation."
A police spokesperson has confirmed that the woman found lives in Birkenhead and that the body was found inside a property.
In the afternoon, friends who think they know the woman have arrived to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and the police inform the victim's immediate relative.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to get into his apartment, but the police said no one can get in or get out of the building.
He became speechless when he found out what had happened.
The occupants of the building have been informed that it will take several hours for them to come back in.
A police officer told a man that the whole area was treated like a crime scene.
A crying woman showed up at the scene.
She says "it's so terrible" over and over again.
At 14:00 there were two police cars inside the lockdown and another one just outside.
A number of police assistants were inside the lockdown with an overview of the apartment building.
People with information are requested to send a DM to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 and enter log 247 from 30 September.
Parliament's statue of Cromwell's latest victim of the fight against the rewriting of history
A banishment would be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of so many of England’s cultural and religious artifacts carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society called Mr. Crick's proposal "deepness" and "try to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable that the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster Palace would be drawn into the ongoing debate on removing statues."
The iconoclasm during the English Civil War was neither ordered nor performed by Cromwell.
Maybe wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for what his ancestral Thomas did 100 years earlier.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent representation of Cromwell shows the 18th century's opinion of and is part of the history of a man whom many still think should be praised.
Mr Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: "Many, perhaps more by the end of the 1800s than now, believe that Cromwell defended Parliament against external pressure, in his case from the monarchy.
If this is a proper representation, it is the subject of an ongoing historical debate.
But the conflict in the middle of the 1600s has no doubt affected the development of our nation, and Cromwell is a well-known person who represents one side of the matter.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be praised and celebrated.
Murdering Pig Kills Farmers
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only with his surname Yuan, was found dead with a broken artery and covered in blood in a path on the Liupanshui market in Guizhou Province, South China reported Morning Post this Sunday.
A pig breeder is getting ready to inject vaccine into pigs in a pig farm on 30 May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He is reported to have traveled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan this Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, the cousin found him dead and discovered that the door to a pigsty nearby was open.
He said there was a big pig in the piggy with blood on his mouth.
According to the report, a forensic investigation confirmed that the 250 kilos of heavy pigs had killed the farmer.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and twisted," said the cousin identified with the surname Wu to Guiyang Evening News.
A surveillance camera filmed Yuan when he came to the market to feed his pigs at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday.
His body was found an hour later.
The pig that killed the farmer didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig had been locked up to avoid more attacks while the police collected evidence on the spot.
Yuan's family and those responsible for the market are reported to negotiate compensation for his death.
It's rare that pigs attack people, but it's happened before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts and caused serious injuries to the man.
Ten years earlier, a 300 - pound [300 kg] pig pressed a farmer in Wales against a tractor until his wife scared it off.
When a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are normally not aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a "catalyst".
"They're just playful.
They're very curious and they don't want to hurt anyone.
You just have to show them respect," he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa for vastly heavy rain to the southwestern United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa becomes weaker as it travels over cooler waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
But Rosa will bring floods of rain to northern Mexico and southwestern USA in the coming days.
Rosa had a wind strength of up to 135 km/h, category 1, at five EST on Sunday and was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to travel north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a tree begins to form over the Pacific Ocean and travels east towards the western coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the peninsula of Baja California as a tropical storm on Monday, it will force deep tropical moisture north into the southwestern United States.
Pink will bring up to 25 cm of rain in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, tropical moisture that interacts with the approaching thread will create vastly heavy rain in the southwestern United States in the coming days.
Locally, 2.5–10 cm of rain will cause dangerous flooding, clay flows and possibly landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical moisture will lead to 5–7.5 cm of rain per hour in some places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 5-10 cm of rain is expected in some places in the southwestern United States, especially in large parts of Arizona.
Sudden floods are possible with rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the scattered tropical rain.
It is absolutely not recommended that anyone go out on foot in the desert when tropical rain is expected.
Heavy rain canyons can make rushing rivers and thunderstorms lead to strong local winds blowing around sand.
The approaching trail may bring local heavy rain to parts of southern California’s coastline.
It is possible with a total of over an cm of rain, which can lead to clay flows and track roads.
That would be the first rain in the region during the rainy season.
Some scattered tropical rainstorms will approach Arizona late on Sunday and early on Monday, before the rain gets more extensive later on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to Four Corner on Tuesday and continue on Wednesday.
October can mean intense temperature changes throughout the United States, when the Arctic cools down but the tropics remain warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic temperature changes at short distances.
There is a good example of dramatic temperature differences in the central United States on Sunday.
There is almost ten degrees difference between Kansas City in Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa.
In the coming days, the remaining summer heat will try to spread again.
Large parts of the central and eastern United States are expected to have a warm start on October with around 30 degrees from Great Plains to parts of the northeastern United States.
New York can get 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about five degrees above the average.
Our long-term climate forecast suggests a great opportunity for warmer temperatures than the average in the eastern US in the first half of October.
Over 20 million watched Brett Kavanaugh's interrogation
Over 20 million watched Thursday's arresting testimonies from Brett Kavanaugh, nominated for the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual assault that must have taken place in the 1980s, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the political deadlock continued and the normal broadcast was interrupted for Friday's last minute-twist – Arizona Senator Jeff Flake's agreement with the FBI where they got a week to investigate the charge.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she is absolutely sure that Kavanaugh grabbed her when he was drunk and tried to take her clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh gave a passionate testimony and said he's absolutely sure it didn't happen.
It is likely that the number of viewers last Friday was higher than the 20.4 million specified by Nielsen.
They calculated the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN; Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The number of viewers was not immediately available for other TV networks showing the interview, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen often has problems counting people who look from office.
By comparison, there are as many viewers as for a football match in the playoffs or the Oscars gala.
Fox News Channel, whose presenters have shown strong support for Kavanaugh's nomination, had most viewers with an average of 5.69 million during the day-long interrogation, according to Nielsen.
ABC had the second most with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
Interest was still high after the interrogation.
Flake was in focus during Friday's drama.
After the Republican office issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS filmed demonstrators shouting at him when he tried to take an elevator for an interrogation with the Judiciary Committee on Friday morning.
He looked down on the floor for several minutes while the demonstrators yelled at him, as was shown in the live transmission of CNN.
"I'm standing right in front of you," said a woman.
Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?"
They also said, "You have power when so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office had issued a statement and before the elevator doors were closed he said he would have more to say after the hearing with the committee.
The TV networks broadcast live several hours later when the Judiciary Committee voted if they would pass on Kavanaugh's nomination to a vote with the entire Senate.
But Flake said he was only going to do that if the FBI were to investigate the charges against the nominee in the next week, as the minority democrats have claimed.
Flake was partly convinced by his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and several senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake’s decision had a major impact, as it was clear that the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "political games" around Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union for "political games" about the UK's future and to undermine the nation's interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
UK Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom on 29 September 2018.
In another interview next to her on the front page of the paper, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson continued his attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit and said that the proposal that the United Kingdom and the EU should collect each other's customs duties was "completely unreasonable".
Shooting Wayde Sims: The police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson for the LSU player's death
The police have arrested a suspect in the murder of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and put in custody for murder, said the Baton Rouge police.
The authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson and the police said that Sims dropped his glasses in the fight.
The police found the glasses on site and found Simpson's DNA on them, according to CBS subsidiary WAFB.
After an interrogation with Simpson, the police said he confessed to killing Wayde.
His bail was set at 350,000 dollars, according to Advocate.
The medical examiner in East Baton Rouge Parish released a preliminary report last Friday, according to which the cause of death was a gunshot wound in the head and into the neck.
The police thank Louisiana State Police's relief force, the police's state law lab, the Southern University police and residents of the area for help with the investigation leading to the arrest.
LSU's athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the local police for their "driving and striving for justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 1.98-metre-long forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per match last season.
This Friday morning, LSU's basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "crushed" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
"You're worried about things like this all the time," said Wade.
Volcano spews ashes over Mexico City
Ash from the Popocatépetl volcano has reached the southern part of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Saturday Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after activity had been discovered in the crater and they recorded 183 emissions of gas and ash over the course of 24 hours.
The center discovered several mules and tremors.
Pictures on social media showed thin layers of ash on windshields in areas of Mexico City, like Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noted increased activity in the volcano standing 72 km southeast of the capital since an earthquake of 7.1 affected central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano called Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police co-occur with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independence protesters clashed with the riot police while thousands of people participated in rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarising vote on the session.
A group of masked separatists held back by the riot police threw eggs and paint powder at them, leading to dark dust clouds on streets that are usually full of tourists.
Fights also broke out later during the day, and police used their batons to stop them.
For several hours, the independence groups cried out "never forget, never forgive" while the unionists cried out "Long live Spain".
14 people were treated for minor injuries caused by the protests, according to local pressure.
The mood is still tense in the region that longs for independence one year after the referendum on the first October which was considered illegal by Madrid but was hailed by Catalan separatists.
An overwhelming majority voted in favour of independence, but participation was low when most who opposed the session boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in violent conflicts last year when the police tried to stop voting at electoral stations in the region.
Independence groups camped during the night on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place anyway, but was forced to take another route.
The electrician Narcis Termes, 68, took part in the separatists' protest with his wife and said that he no longer believes that Catalonia will become independent.
"Last year we experienced one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying out for joy in being able to vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite a decisive but marginal gain in regional elections in December, Catalan parties that are too independent have had difficulty keeping up the momentum this year, as many of their most well-known leaders live in self-imposed exile or are in custody pending trial about their role in the organisation of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in support of the police on his cell phone, said that the conflict had been fired by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting more and more tense," he said.
Last Saturday, Mr Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in custody since the end of last year, announced that he is going to be a candidate for the European Parliament elections next year.
"Chairing the European Parliament is the best way to condemn the return of democratic values and the subversive we have experienced from the Spanish Government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after car driving into house
Three men — 33, 34, and 39 — were arrested after a car was driven into a Londonderry house repeatedly.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent, around 19:30 BST on Thursday.
Detective Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building itself were damaged.
A crossbow may also have been fired against the car.
Menga gives Livingston 1-0 against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured the win
Livingston shocked Rangers and sentenced Steven Gerrard to his second loss in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox Club.
Dolly Menga's strike turned out to be the difference when Gary Holt's side was divided second with Hibernian.
Gerrard's side has still not received a win in Premiership this season and meets Hearts, with eight points more, the next Sunday.
Before that, Rangers Rapid Vienna welcomes you to the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston extends its winning range to six games – the head coach Holt has still not experienced a loss since replacing Kenny Miles last month.
Livingston misses chances against two visitors
Holt's team should have taken the lead long before they scored; their uprightness gave Rangers all sorts of problems.
Scott Robinson broke through but dragged his performance across the finish line, and then Alan Lithgow could only shoot wide after slipping in to measure Craig Halkett's nod across the finish line.
The home team was pleased to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could attack in certain games.
And that's how the decisive goal was done.
Rangers gave up a freepark and Livingston used an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson worked together to give Menga a chance, which scored from the middle of the target area.
In that situation, Rangers had dominated the ball, but the defense of the home team was impenetrable and the goalkeeper Liam Kelly was left largely in peace.
The same pattern continued in the second half, but Alfredo Morelos forced a rescue from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was denied by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor's feet and Lithgow shot wide from another of Livingston's determined games.
Crossovers came constantly into Livingston's target area and were handled without any problems. Two penalty demands – following Halkett's challenge by the exchanger Glenn Middleton and one by hand – were dismissed.
"Phenonominal" from Livingston – Analysis
BBC Scotlands Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal presentation and results for Livingston.
Each one was outstanding and continues to exceed expectations on the way up.
Their playing style and staff have hardly changed since they returned to the upper level, but Holt deserves the honor of having galvanized the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was outstanding and led a skillfully organized defense, and Menga held Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall in full swing straight through.
But Rangers lacked inspiration.
They've had their moments under Gerrard, but they didn't live up to the standard.
Their last ball did not hold the measure – they only opened the home page once – and it is something of a alarm clock for the Rangers, which is in the middle.
Erdogan receives a mixed welcome in Cologne
Saturday offered smiles and blue sky (September 29) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany ate breakfast together in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany to repair the relationship between the NATO allies.
They have become divided over human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city has the world's largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police claimed that they prevented 25 000 spectators from gathering outside the mosque for security reasons, but many supporters gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan demonstrators – many of them Kurdish – also made their voices heard and condemned both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to Germany.
The dubious protests show the divided views of a visitor who is considered a hero of certain German Turks and is condemned as a one - man ruler of others.
Road accident in Deptford: Cyclist dies in a car crash
A cyclist has died in a crash with a car in London.
The hook took place near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a well-travelled road in Deptford in southeastern London, around 10:15 BST.
The driver stopped the car and medical personnel were called there, but the man died on the spot.
The hook takes place a few months after another cyclist died in an infectious accident on Childers Street, about 1.5 km from the crash on Saturday.
Metropolitan Police said they're trying to identify the man and inform his immediate family.
Roads have been blocked and buses have been redirected and drivers are asked to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six guards injured in tumult
Six prison guards have been injured in unrest at a high-security prison for men, according to the Prison Office.
Disturbing broke out at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 9:30 BST on Sunday and is still going on.
Specialized "thorn guards" have been called there to deal with the unrest involving eight prisoners on a wing.
The guards were treated on site for minor injuries to the face.
A spokesperson for Prison Service said: "Specially trained prison staff have been sent there to deal with the ongoing incident on HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and are clear that those behind it will be assigned to the police and can receive extended prison sentences."
HMP Long Lartin holds over 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison director was treated in a hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And last October, the riot police were called to the prison to deal with serious concerns where staff were attacked with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flooding (areas with drought can benefit)
It is rare that tropical low pressure reaches Arizona, but that is exactly what is likely to happen at the beginning of next week when Hurricane Rosa’s remaining energy pulls over the desert in the southwestern United States, with the risk of sudden flooding.
National Weather Service has already issued warnings for sudden floods for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona and into southern and eastern Nevada, southeast California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to travel directly over Phoenix on Tuesday, and bring rain late on Monday.
National Weather Service in Phoenix said in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm status or low pressure within 320 km of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 65 km of the Arizona border".
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 5-10 cm of rain, with isolated amounts of up to 15 cm in the Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Other parts of the desert in the southwestern United States, including the central Rocky Mountains and Great Basin, probably get 2.5-5 cm of rain with a risk of up to 10 cm.
In areas without risk of sudden flooding, Rosa's rain can be a blessing, as the region is affected by drought.
Floods are very serious, but some of the rains are likely to be of benefit because the southwestern United States suffers from drought.
According to U.S. Drought Monitor, just over 40 percent of Arizona suffers from at least extreme drought, the second highest category, reported weather.com.
Hurricane Rosa will first travel across the peninsula of Baja California in Mexico.
Rosa, still with hurricane power on Sunday morning with maximum wind strength of 135 km/h, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and travels north for 20 km/h.
The storm strikes cooler waters in the Pacific, calming it down.
It is therefore expected to reach Mexico’s land mass as a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
Some parts of Mexico can get heavy rain, which poses a considerable risk of flooding.
"A total of 7.5–15 cm of rain is expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with a risk of up to 25 cm," reported weather.com.
Rosa will then travel north across Mexico as a tropical storm and reach the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical low pressure, which will then travel through Arizona and into the southern Utah late Tuesday evening.
"The greatest danger from Rosa and its remaining energy is very heavy rain in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the desert in the southwestern USA," said the National Hurricane Center.
The rain is expected to lead to life-threatening sudden floods and mud flows in the desert, as well as landslides in mountainous terrain.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four Arrested for Homicide Attempts
Three boys in their teens and a 20-year-old man have been arrested for attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with knife wounds in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found injured in the area of Excelsior Terrace in Midsomer Norton, around 4:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital and the situation is reported to be "stable".
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested during the night in the Radstock area, said the police in Avon and Somerset.
The police are asking anyone who might have filmed what happened to the cell phone to step forward.
Trump says that Kavanaugh "suffered, evil, anger" from the Democratic Party
"A voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to reject the recklessness and scandalous tactics of the democratic party," said Trump to his supporters in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh had "suffered from the evil, anger" of the democratic party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified to the Congress last Thursday and strongly and emotionally denied Christine Blasey Ford’s accusation of sexual abuse of her several decades earlier when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified to Congress about his accusation.
The President said on Saturday that "the American people saw the brilliant and the quality and the courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
"A voice to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to confirm one of the most skilled legal minds of our time, a lawyer with a first-class history of serving the public," he said to his followers in the audience in West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to Kavanaugh's nomination when he talked about the importance of Republicans voting in the forthcoming mid-term elections.
"We are five weeks from one of our life's most important choices.
I can't run, but I can run," he said.
"That's why I'm going around fighting for sovereign candidates."
Trump claimed that the Democrats are trying "to resist and prevent."
The first final vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place by Friday, according to information to CNN from an assistant to a senior Republican leader.
Hundreds dead in earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia, number of ladders
At least 384 people died, many were swept away when gigantic waves crashed against the beaches, when a great earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, according to the authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu last Friday when up to six meters high waves crashed against the beach at dusk and swept out many to a safe death and destroyed everything in their way.
Tsunamine came after an earthquake of 7.5.
"When the tsunami warning came yesterday, people stopped on the beach instead of immediately running away from there, and they fell victim to tsunami," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's disaster agency BNP, at a meeting in Jakarta.
"Tsunami was not alone but dragged with it cars, logs and houses. It hit everything in its path," Nugroho said. He also said that the tsunami had traveled on the open sea for up to 800 km/h before the affected coastline.
Some climbed up trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
Around 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 facilities in Palu.
Aircraft photos released by the disaster agencies show that many buildings and shops are destroyed, bridges are twisted and have collapsed and a mosque is surrounded by water.
Aftershocks still hit the coastal city on Saturday.
The range of earthquakes was felt in an area with a population of 2.4 million.
Indonesia's Technology Evaluation and Application Agency BPPT stated in a statement that the amount of energy released in the enormous earthquake last Friday was 200 times the size of the nuclear bomb released at Hiroshima in World War II.
The city is at the end of a long, narrow bay, which may have made the tsunami bigger, according to the agency.
Nugroho described the devastation as "comprehensive" and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels have collapsed.
Dead victims were found during the rush of collapsed buildings, he said, and 540 people were injured and 29 are missing.
Nugroho said that the victims and the damage could be even worse along the coastline 300 km north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communication from Donggala "was completely paralyzed without any information," Nugroho said.
"There are over 300 000 people there," said the Red Cross in a statement, and its staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, but it can get a lot worse," they said.
The agency was criticized on Saturday for not having informed that the tsunami had struck against Palu, but the authorities said that the waves had appeared within the time of the warning.
In an amateur video shared on social media, a man upstairs in a building shouts French warnings about tsunami to people on the street below.
Within a few minutes, a wall of water falls against the beach and sweeps away buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately authenticate the video.
The earthquake and tsunami led to a massive power cut that interrupted all communication around Palu, which made rescue work difficult for the authorities.
The military has begun sending cargo flights there with the help of Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, but evacuated persons are still in great need of food and other supplies.
The city airport has been opened for relief work and remains closed to other traffic until October.
President Joko Widodo planned to visit facilities in Palu on Sunday.
The number of deaths in tsunami in Indonesia exceeds 800.
It's very bad.
Workers from the World Vision in Donggala have gone to Palu where they seek protection under tarpaulins on the farm outside the office, but they saw destruction along the way, according to Mr. Dosheba.
"They said they saw many destroyed houses," he said.
It's very bad.
Assistance groups have begun the bitter aid work, but some complained that foreign aid workers with extensive expertise were prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, foreign financing, supplies and staff may only be used if an exemption permit is issued following a disaster.
This has not yet happened.
"It is still a regional disaster," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the authorities say it's a national disaster, we can let in international aid, but that status hasn't been announced yet."
When the second night fell in Palu after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, relatives and friends of missing persons were still hoping that their loved ones would prove to be the miracles that brighten up dire natural disasters.
Last Saturday, a little boy was rescued from a sewer.
On Sunday, the rescue workers rescued a woman who had been trapped in a hurry for two days with her mother’s body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the trainer of Indonesia’s National Air Force, had trained two of the missing screen pilots for the Asian games, which ended in Indonesia earlier this month.
Others who were stuck at Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
"As a paramedic, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon told me that the hours after the skyscrapers heard that Roa Roa Hotel had collapsed, he desperately sent whatsApp messages to the Palu participants who attended the beach festival.
But his messages only got a gray goat, instead of two blue ones.
"I think that means that the messages were not delivered," he said.
Thieves take $26,750 under ATM restocking at Newport on the Levee
This Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's co-worker filling up a ATM at Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport police.
The driver of the car had emptied a ATM in the entertainment facility and would deliver more money, said Detective Dennis McCarthy in the message.
While he was busy, "another man ran up behind Brink's co-worker" and stole a bag of money to be delivered.
The Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, according to the press release, but the police did not indicate how many were involved in the incident.
Any person who has information about the identity of the perpetrators shall contact the Newport police on 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes its name to Ye
The rapper Kanye West changes his name – to Ye.
He announced the change of name on Twitter on Saturday and said, "The message that is formally known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has been called Ye for a long time and used the nickname as the title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The name change comes before his participation in Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande in the program, who cancelled for "emotional reasons" according to the creator of the program.
Ye is an abbreviation of West's current professional name, but he has also said that the word has a religious meaning for him.
"I think 'ye' is the word most used in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," said West earlier this year when he talked about the title of his album with radio hosts Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
It went from Kanye, which means 'the only', to only Ye – a reflection of our good, our evil, our confused, everything.
The album is like a reflection of who we are."
He's one of a number of famous rappers who's changed their names.
Sean Combs has previously been called Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers to be called Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who has previously collaborated with West, has previously written his name with and without hyphens and capitals.
Mexico's AMLO swears not to use the military against civilians
Mexico's recently elected President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has promised never to use the military against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza to "never use the military to oppress the Mexican people".
Forces fired weapons against a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, and killed up to 600 people during an era when left-wing student movements rooted in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans with monthly grants to students and by opening up more free public universities.
He has said that unemployment and inadequate training opportunities attract young people to criminal gangs.
The US should double AI funding
Now that China is becoming more active in artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount they spend on field research, according to the inventor and AI user Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comment comes after several parts of the US government have made statements on AI, despite the fact that the US does not have a comprehensive formal AI strategy.
China presented its plan last year with the goal of being a leader in AI innovation by 2030.
"It would be a good start to double the budget for AI research, given that all other countries are so far behind the US and we are looking for the next breakthrough in AI," said Lee.
A double-size budget can double the chance that the next major AI breakthrough will be made in the United States," said Lee to CNBC in an interview earlier this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published earlier in the month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Innovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's most prominent AI companies – Face++.
At Carnegie Mellon University in the 1980s, he worked on an AI system that beat the top-ranking American Othello player, and later he was in charge of Microsoft Research and was CEO of Google’s China department.
Lee mentioned previous technology competitions from the U.S. government, such as the Robot Challenge from the Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked what would be next to identify future visionaries.
In the United States, researchers often have to work hard to get funding from the government, said Lee.
"It is not China that takes the academic leaders from us, but the companies," said Lee.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have employed leading personalities from universities to work at AI.
Lee said that new immigration policies can also help the US with the AI innovation.
"I think green cards should be offered automatically to doctoral students in AI," he said.
The State Council in China issued its development plan for the next generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
In China, the National Natural Science Foundation grants grants to people in academic institutions like the National Science Foundation and other government agencies distribute money to researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work is lower in China," said Lee.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defence established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to bring together partners from industry and the academic world, and the White House announced the formation of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And earlier this month, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative they call AI Next.
NSF is currently investing over $100 million a year in AI research.
American legislation that would create a National Security Commission on artificial intelligence has not made any progress in several months.
Macedonia's referendum on the change of name
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday if the name of the country is to be changed to "Republic of Northern Macedonia", which would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that has prevented its attempts to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province called Macedonia and claims that the name of its neighbour in the north constitutes a requirement on its territory and has therefore prevented Macedonia from joining NATO and the EU.
The two governments concluded an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change of name would undermine the identity of the Slavic majority in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that he will not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has led to doubts as to whether the minimum 50% participation required for the referendum to be considered valid will be reached.
The question on the ballot box in the referendum is this: "Are you in favour of membership of NATO and the EU with the approval of the agreement with Greece?"
However, the supporters of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that it is worth changing names if it makes it possible for Macedonia, one of the countries formed when Yugoslavia was divided, to join the EU and NATO.
"I am here to vote for the future of our country, for young people in Macedonia so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because it means safer lives for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
The referendum is not binding, but enough Members of Parliament have said that they intend to follow the outcome for it to be considered decisive.
The change of name requires a majority of two thirds of Parliament.
According to the State Electoral Commission, no irregularities had been reported at 1 p.m.
However, participation was only 16%, compared to 34% in the last parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66% of registered voters voted.
"I am voting for my children, we belong in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, who voted in the capital of Skopje.
Macedonia's Prime Minister, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son, Dushko, voted in the referendum in Macedonia on the country's change of name, which would open the way for membership of NATO and the European Union, in strumica, Macedonia 30 September 2018.
Outside this House in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, arranged a small stage and set out chairs in front of the tents set up by those who boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to go with our heads in the air, not sneaking in through the back door," said Kavardarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they do not welcome us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of Euro-Asian integration."
According to Prime Minister Zaev, membership in NATO would lead to much-needed investment in Macedonia, which has unemployment of over 20%.
"I believe that the absolute majority will vote in favour, because over 80% of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," said Zaev when he voted.
He said that a "yes" result would be a "confirmation of our future".
According to a survey published on Monday by the Macedonian Policy Survey Institute, between 30 and 43 per cent of voters voted in the referendum, which falls below the minimum required participation.
According to another study conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia, 57 percent of participants were thinking of voting on Sunday.
70% of them were going to vote yes.
For the referendum to count, 50 per cent of registered voters plus one vote are required.
If the referendum fails, it will be the first serious setback for the Western-oriented government's policy since it took over last May.
Look at: Manchester Cities Sergio Aguero takes himself through the entire Brighton defense to make goals
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling beat Brighton's proposal in Manchester City's 2-0 win at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England on Saturday.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy when he scored in the 65th minute.
The Argentine Strecker got a pass from the middle field at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran between Brighton's three defenders and went out into the open field.
Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He got around a defender and ran from several others at the edge of Brighton's target area.
Then he pushed a pass to Sterling to the left.
The English forward used his first kick in the target area to give back the ball to Aguero, who used the right foot to beat Brighton's goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot in the right side of the net.
"Aguero has problems with his feet," said City's manager Pep Guardiola to the journalists.
"We talked about him playing for 55–60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he scored that moment."
But it was Sterling who gave Sky Blues the initial takeover in the Premier League game.
The target arrived in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep inside Brighton's territory at that game.
He sent a nice kick along the left side to Leroy Sane.
Sane took a pair of kicks and led Sterling to the distant pole.
Sky Blues forward kicked the ball into the net the moment it ended up out of reach.
City meets Hoffenheim in the Champions League group game at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany at 12:55 on Tuesday.
Scherzer wants to play against Rockies
Nationals have been eliminated from the playoffs, so there was no need to force one to start.
But competition-oriented Scherzer wants to throw on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if Rockies, who is a match ahead of Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West, still have a chance for the playoffs.
Rockies got a wild card slot with a win of 5-2 over Nationals last Friday night, but is still looking for their first division title.
"We play if nothing, but we can get a chance to rub the rubber in the knowledge of the atmosphere here in Denver with the audience and that the second team would play at a higher level than any other team I would meet this year.
Why wouldn't I want to be there?"
Nationals haven't announced their starter for Sunday yet, but according to reports, they're leaning against having Scherzer throw under the circumstances.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th start, warmed up in the bullpen last Thursday and would throw on his normal day of rest.
Washington's right-handed pitcher is 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 200 2/3 this season.
Trump gives speeches in West Virginia
The President referred indirectly to the situation surrounding Brett Kavanaugh, who is nominated to the Supreme Court, when he talked about how important it is for Republicans to vote in the forthcoming mid-term elections.
"All we've done is at stake in November.
We are five weeks away from one of our most important choices.
This is one of the big, big... I can't run, but I can run. That's why I'm going around fighting for sovereign candidates," he said.
Trump continued: "You see a terrible, terrible group of radical democrats, you see it happening here and now.
They are determined to take back power whatever it takes, you see their wickedness, terribleness.
They don't care who they have to hurt, who they have to drive over to take over power and control. That's what they want, power and control. We shouldn't let them get it."
Democrats, he said, are fighting to "stand and stop."
"You've seen that for the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "argue and evil and terrible and false."
He mentioned the democratic senator, Diane Feinstein, who sits on the Senate Judicial Committee, which was greeted by a high-ranking audience.
"Do you remember what she said?
"Did you leak the document?"
'Eh, eh, huh?
No, not, no, I'm waiting for a...' It was really bad body language, some of the worst body language I've seen."
Labour is no longer a broad church.
They don't tolerate people who say what they think.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, I was hardly surprised.
After all, I am the latest in a series of MPs from Labour who hear that we are not welcome, just because we say what we think.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated in a similar way when she opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on the security of the nation, on Europe – ironically, similar subjects for which Jeremy criticized previous leaders.
The communication on the meeting with Nottingham East Labour last Friday stated that "we want the meetings to be welcoming and productive".
For most of my eight years as Labour's local MP, the GC meetings on Fridays have been just that.
But now, unfortunately, many meetings are not, and the promise of "kinder, gentler" politics has been forgotten long ago, if it ever started.
It has become increasingly evident that dissenting views are not tolerated within the Labour, and every opinion is judged on the outside if the party leaders accept it.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the leader, when colleagues whom I previously thought had a similar political vision that I expected to make a complete turnaround and take positions that I would otherwise never have had – whether it was the security of the nation or the internal market of the European Union.
Every time I speak in public – and it really doesn't matter what I say – I follow a tire of ignorance on social media that requires me to be dismissed, criticises my policy and says that I shouldn't even be in Labour.
And this isn't just happening to me.
In fact, I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments that are directed at me are mostly political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of these colleagues as they face a stream of sexist and racist insults every day but never give up.
One of the greatest disappointments of this era's policy is the level of insult that is now considered normal.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that Labour should promote a culture of tolerance.
But in reality, we are no longer this broad church, and with every distrust and change in the selection rules, the party is getting tighter.
I have received many advice over the last two years about flying under the radar and not being too forthright, so it "arranges".
But that's not why I became a politician.
Ever since I joined Labour as a school student 32 years ago, provoked by the government's neglect that literally brought my primary school classroom to collapse, I have tried to fight for better public services for those who need it most – both at local level and as Minister of Government.
I have never hidden my political views, and that includes the latest election.
No one in Nottingham East could in any way have been confused about my views on policies and topics where I disagree with the current leadership.
I would just like to say to those of you who supported the request last Friday that when the country is heading towards a Brexit that will harm households, businesses and public services, I do not understand why anyone would want to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour Party leaders.
But my main message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituency – both Labour members and others: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no great deal of threats to my retirement or political convenience will prevent me from doing what I think is best for all of you.

Ayr 38-17 Melrose: Unlaced Ayr on top
Two attempts at the last minute may have distorted the result a bit, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to triumph in this wonderfully entertaining Tennent's Premiership match.
They're now on top, the only unbeatable side of the ten.
In the end, it was their superior defense, as well as their ability to take chances, that gave the home team the profit, and the coach Peter Murchie has every right to be satisfied.
"We have been tested during our games so far and are still unbeatable, so we are of course happy," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said, "Ayr deserves it, they took better chances than we do."
Grant Anderson's 14th minute attempt, converted by Frazier Climo, gave Ayr the lead but a yellow card to Scotland's captain Rory Hughes, who was released by Warriors for the game, let Melrose let the numbers speak and Jason Baggot made an unconverted attempt.
Climo extended Ayr's leadership by a penalty, and at the end of the first half he scored and converted a solo attempt to give Ayr a lead of 17-5 during the break.
But Melrose got a good start on the second half, and Patrick Anderson’s attempts, converted by Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
It then became a long wait after a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, which was carried by the plan, and after the reboot, Ayr’s management increased again with an attempt from Stafford McDowall, which was converted by Clima.
Ayr's acting captain Blair MacPherson then got a yellow card, and Melrose forced the extra man to pay again with an unconverted attempt by Bruce Colvine, at the end of a period of intense pressure.
But the home team recovered and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card for tackling Climo without the ball, McPherson made a touch down from the penalty line-out behind Ayr's mouth.
Clima converted, which he did again almost immediately after the reboot, after Kyle Rowe gathered David Armstrong's box kick and sent off the flank Gregor Henry for home team fifth attempts.
Still Game Star seems ready for new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game-star Ford Klän seems ready to enter the restaurant industry after it was discovered that he has been appointed as CEO of a licensed restaurant business.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the BBC's popular series, in which he writes and plays along with his long-standing comedi partner Greg Hemfill.
Duon has announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last of the series, and Klär seems to be planning for the life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he's the CEO of Atrivmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment, but a source at Scottish Sun suggested that Klär wanted to enter Glasgow's "flowering restaurant industry".
"Havet belongs to us": Coastal Bolivia hopes that the court will open the way to the Pacific again
Seamen patrol a rigged headquarters for the fleet of La Paz.
Public buildings have a sea blue flag.
The bases of the fleet from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon bear the motto: "The sea belongs to us.
It is our duty to restore it."
In coastless Bolivia, the memory of the coastline lost to Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the 1800s is still strong – and it is also longing to sail again on the Pacific.
This hope is higher than in decades now when Bolivia awaits a decision from the International Court of Justice on the first of October, after five years of reflection.
"Bolivia has the drive, a mood of unity and peace, and obviously awaits the result with a positive attitude," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the decision of the International Court of Justice on a large scale over the country, hoping that the Hague court will judge in favour of Bolivia's demand that Chile, after years of irregular discussions, have to negotiate with Bolivia to allow them their own exit to the sea.
Monday's decision also has great importance for Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic native president, who is facing a controversial re-election battle next year.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that it is incredible that the Court judges Bolivia’s advantage, and that not much would change even if it did.
The United Nations Court of Justice, based in the Netherlands, has no right to assign Chilean territory and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the decision was announced only six months after the final arguments indicate that the case "was not complicated," said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And over the last four years, Bolivia's chances may have been damaged rather than promoted.
"The question of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration," said Zárate.
She claims that Morale's aggressive rhetoric has pierced Chile's remaining goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will eventually continue the discussion, but it will be extremely difficult to do so afterwards.
The two countries have not replaced ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, did not consider that the Court's decision had been taken unusually quickly.
Monday will give Bolivia "an outstanding opportunity to launch a new era for relations with Chile" and a chance to "stop 139 years of disagreements with mutual advantages," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents – used the issue of the sea as a political crutch.
"Bolivia will never give up her right of access to the Pacific," he said.
"The decision is a chance to realize that we must move on from the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament requires trust in the United States
North Korea's Secretary of State Ri Yong Ho says that the nation will not disarm its nuclear weapons until they can't trust Washington.
Ri spoke to the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to honour the promises made at a summit in Singapore between the two rival leaders.
His comments came when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems to be on the verge of resolving the nuclear diplomacy situation more than three months after the meeting in Singapore with North Korea leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it is a "desirable dream" to continue sanctions and the US protests against a statement to end the Korean war will ever tame North Korea.
Washington is hesitant to agree to the statement without Pyongyang initiating major nuclear disarmament first.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want another summit.
But there is widespread skepticism against the fact that Pyongyang is really going to get rid of a gun arsenal that the country probably sees as its only chance to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris fashion shows reveal the latest line of huge headgear on the way to shops near you
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or completely block the sun, we have the right thing for you.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne have revealed a range of crispy, oversized headbands for their SS19 collection on the catwalk, which dazzled the stylistics of Paris fashion week.
Unbelievably impractical hats have taken over Instagram this summer, and designers have sent their eye-catwalking creations away.
Valentino's first creation was an exaggerated beige hat with a feather-like wide hat that completely took over the heads of the models.
Other oversized accessories included jewel-drilled watermelons, a wizard hat and even a pineapple – but they are not intended to keep their heads warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre worms, in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had laced lips and resembled Hannibal Lecter rather than haute couture.
One creature resembled a wet suit with snorkel and diving mask, and another looked like a melted glass strut.
And if you keep up the tremendous courage, you're lucky.
Fashion experts predict that the huge hats can be on their way to shops near you.
The oversized hats come just after La Bomba – the straw hat with a width of 60 cm that has been seen on everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand that was behind the incredibly impractical hat that has taken over social media sent out another great creation on the catwalk – a straw beach bag that was almost as large as the swimsuit model that held it.
The Raffia bag in terracotta, with raffia fringes and a white leather handle, was excellent in the Jacquemus La Riviera SS19 collection on Paris fashion week.
The celebrity stylist Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: "I expect to see big hats and beach bags in stores next summer – the designer has had such a big impact that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for oversized accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are crucial for global citizens
The independent schools of Scotland maintain outstanding academic results and this continued in 2018 with yet another set of outstanding test results, only reinforced by individual and collective progress in sports, art, music and other social engagements.
With up to 30,000 students in Scotland, the schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best possible service for their students and their parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their students for further education, their chosen career and their role as global citizens.
As a sector of education that can design and implement adapted curricula, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and popular subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it goes to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it will go to his heart."
It is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely only on English when we create relationships and trust with people from other countries.
This year's test results show that languages are highest on the list, with a maximum number of approved results in independent schools.
A total of 68 per cent of students studying foreign languages received A in the final test Higher Grade.
Data collected from SCIS 74 member schools showed that 72 percent of students studied mandarin received an A in Higher Grade, and 72 percent of students studied German, 69 percent of students studied French, and 63 percent of students studied Spanish also received an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as crucial skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Language as a subject choice is now considered to be as important as natural knowledge, technology, engineering knowledge and mathematics on curricula in independent schools and beyond.
A study conducted by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills 2014 found that employers had difficulty filling their vacancies for various reasons, with 17% attributed to a lack of language skills.
Having said that, language skills are becoming all the more necessary to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more and more future jobs requiring language skills, these skills become necessary in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career choice, they will have a real advantage in the future if they have adopted a second language.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives a multilingual person a competitive advantage.
According to a survey of more than 4,000 British adults published by YouGov 2013, 75 percent replied that they could not speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation in it, and where French was the only language that came up in total in a two-digit percentage (15 percent).
Therefore, it is so important to invest in language teaching for our children.
Being able to speak several languages, especially those used in developing countries, gives your child a better chance to find meaningful employment in the future.
In Scotland, each school will teach different combinations of languages.
A number of schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while others will teach in languages that are considered to be most important to the UK before 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Regardless of your child's interest, there will always be a number of languages to choose from within independent schools, with teachers who are specialists in this field.
Scottish independent schools strive to provide a learning environment that will prepare children and get them with the skills needed to succeed, no matter what the future holds.
In a global economic environment, it is undoubtedly language that continues to be crucial for the future of the country, so it must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be regarded as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
Il fout bien le faire.
John Edward is the head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron makes Lakers debut on Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans who look forward to seeing LeBron James make the debut for Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will be playing in the Sunday's first season match against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But the number of minutes he plays has not yet been determined.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play for a limited number of minutes.
After practising earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for Lakers' preseason schedule.
"I don't need preseason games at this stage of my career to get ready," he said.
Trumps West Virginia campaign event, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is doing his first campaign event tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's Trump's first of five scheduled performances next week, including events at places he has great support, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
Pending a confirmatory vote by his candidate to the Supreme Court's vacant post, Trump aims to build up support for future interim elections, as the Republicans risk losing control of the Congress before the forthcoming elections in November.
What time is Trump's West Virginia rally tonight and how can you look at it online?
Trump Wheeling, West Virginia campaign event is scheduled for 19:00, tonight Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia rally online below via live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to deal with this week's hearing of the candidate to the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh, who was tense after accusations of his sexual abuse, with an expected delay in the Senate vote of up to a week while the FBI's investigation of the case is ongoing.
But the primary purpose of these events is to help the Republicans get some meat on their legs for the November elections.
Thus President Trump said that these five meetings next week aim to "engage volunteers and supporters when the Republicans try to protect and expand the majority of the Senate and the House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"Congress control is so important to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible when we enter the hectic campaign period," said a spokesman for the Trump campaign who did not want to be named to Reuters.
Night's events, scheduled at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, can attract fans from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract attention from Pittsburgh's media", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state where he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican Senate candidate for West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who has fallen behind in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to get there to try and increase his opinion polls," says Simon Haeder, a state scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA struggles to keep the hopes alive in front of Sunday's singles
After three one-sided sessions, the party competitions in Saturday afternoon could have been what was required for this Ryder Cup.
The swinging pendulum of the moment is a completely invented sport concept, but something that players really believe in, and more than ever before in competitions like these.
So what momentum is it about now?
"They had a sex point lead and now it's four, so we carry it like a little momentum I guess," said Jordan Spieth when he finished the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, of having four points of advance with twelve more to win.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel that they have some wind in the sails, but they have much to be encouraged by, not least in the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and combed home three points out of four each.
Spieth has been sharp from tea to green and preceded by a good example.
The victories scalded even higher when his round continued and he lowered a decisive pit to take the game four all-square when he and Thomas had been lying behind with two after two games.
His putt that won them the game of 15 met with a similar wretch, with the conviction that the American team is not yet out of the game.
"You really need to dig deep and worry about your own game," said Spieth.
That's all all all these players have left now.
18 holes to victory.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, Ryder Cups undisputed story.
Europe's odd but adorable couple are four out of four and now nothing can go wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't make a bogey on Saturday afternoon and they also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nine on Friday morning.
These performances and the audience's reactions confirm that they are the players to beat on Sunday and there are no more popular players who could come home a potential European victory when the sun goes down over the Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both, at the same time on different holes.
However, it is too early to talk about European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made the process short with Sergio Garcia, the four-ball hero of the morning, together with Alex Noren.
A bowey and two doubles on the front nine lowered the Spaniards and Swedes in a hole they never even got near to crawling out.
On Sunday, however, there is no one to help you out of the hole.
Fourball and foursome are so fascinating to see closely because of the interaction between the couple, the advice they give, the advice they don't give and how a strategy can change in a moment.
Europe has played better as a law so far and has taken a significant lead for the last day, but this foursomes session also showed that the United States team has a battle rage that some, especially on the part of the United States, had doubted.
Europe takes the lead with 10-6 in Ryder Cup last day
Europe will have a strong advantage at the Ryder Cups last day after coming out of Saturday's fourball and foursomes matched with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
The inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led with two victories over a besieged Tiger Woods and scored a total of four points at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, who fought to keep the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an American team that never really got started in the morning's 3-1 ball.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the foursome and won two games, but it was not enough for victory.
Jim Fury's team needs eight points from Sunday's 12 single games to keep the cup.
Fleetwood is the first European beginner to win four points in a row while he and Molinari, named "Molliwood", after a sensational weekend, are just the second couple to win four points from their first four matches in Ryder Cup's history.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in fourballs, they beat an exhausted Woods and American rookie Bryson Decambeau with an even more powerful 5 & 4.
Woods, who scored two matches on Saturday, showed a few moments of brilliance, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in fourball and foursome, and seven of them in a row.
Justin Rose, slept during the morning's ball and returned to the partner Henrik Stenson in foursomes to a 2 & 1 victory over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - ranked one and three in the world.
Europe had no wind all the way, but it was a nice, windy day just southwest of Paris.
Three-time winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for Americans with two points on Saturday.
They combed home the victory with 2 & 1 over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Paulter in fourball and later returned to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 & 3 in foursome after losing the two opening holes.
Only twice in the history of Ryder Cups has a team come back from a bottom of four points in the single matches, however, Füryk’s side only needs an undecided result to keep the cup.
After being second best for two days, it looks like a counterattack on Sunday can be difficult to get through.
North Korea says that the "never" will disarm unilaterally without trust
The Secretary of State of North Korea told the United Nations Saturday that continued sanctions deepened their distrust of the United States and it was not possible that the country would unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Organisation's annual General Assembly that in the past year North Korea had taken "significant measures to show its goodwill", for example by stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling nuclear test installations and promising not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"We do not, however, see a corresponding answer from the United States," he said.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances there is no chance that we will unilaterally disarm ourselves first."
While Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington’s opposition to a process divided into stages for the nuclear power that would result in North Korea being rewarded as it took gradual steps, his statement seemed significant, since it did not reject a unilateral nuclear solution just as Pyongyang had previously done.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between a seated US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, where Kim promised to work towards "the decommissioning of nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea has sought a formal end to the Korean War 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first phase out its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also turned down negotiations to ease severe international sanctions against North Korea.
"USA insists on "decommissioning first" and increases pressure through sanctions to achieve its purpose through coercion and even opposes the "declaration of ending the war," says Ri.
"The notion that sanctions can get us on our knees is a wishful dream for those people who lack knowledge about us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions deepen our distrust."
Ri did not mention plans for a second Kim-Trump summit as the US leader highlighted in the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the Minister pointed to three meetings between Kim and South Korea's leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: "If the party on this matter of nuclear disarmament was South Korea and not the United States, the nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula would not have come to such a deadlock."
Yet the tone of Ri's speech was dramatically different from last year's when he told the UN General Assembly that North Korea's future ability to reach the mainland with rockets was inevitable after "Mr Evil President" Trump called Kim a "missile man" on a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, commended Kim for his courage to take measures to disarm, but it said that much work still remains and that sanctions must remain until North Korea is disarmed.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he had no time frame for this and said that "if it takes two years, three years or five months", it doesn't matter."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The maintenance of the sanctions of the Security Council must continue with force and without failure until we realize a complete, final, verified disarmament."
The Security Council has unanimously reinforced sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to stifle the funding of Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met Ri in connection with the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times already this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said that progress had been made. However, North Korea accused him a few hours later of making "gangster-like demands".
North Korea promised a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle a missile facility and also a nuclear power plant if the US took "corresponding measures".
He said that Kim had told him that the "corresponding measures" he was seeking were security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and are moving towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take the course to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has led all doctoral students to improve their sleep habits in an attempt to combat the growing macho culture to study through caffeine-filled "days".
An academic study found that students at the world's leading universities are often unintelligible as to the very foundations for how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, Professor of Sleep Medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he considers to be the first of his kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after talking about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
"At the end of it, a girl came up to me and said, "Why can't I know this until now, during my last year?"
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me, he told The Telegraph.
The course, which was organized for the first time this year, explains to the students the importance of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, and improves their general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and CEO of the University's health services, said that the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that the students suffered from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The hourly course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In part of the course there is a picture of a student room, where the students click on coffee cups, curtains, trainers and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, how athletic performance is affected by sleep deprivation and the importance of good sleep habits.
In another part, participants will learn how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression and cancer.
A map of the campus, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that it will not change students' behaviour directly.
But we think they have the right to know - just as you have the right to know about the health effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes," added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride in "good" is still there, he says, adding that modern technology and constantly increasing pressure on the students meant that sleep deprivation was a growing problem.
To ensure that you have enough sleep, of good quality, should be the student's "secret weapon" to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said - even to avoid weight gain because insomnia puts the brain in starvation and makes them constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course and has studied one of his courses last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course was an eye-opener and inspired him to campaign for a campus-wide course.
He hopes that the next step is to ask all doctoral students to complete a similar study programme before starting their studies at the high-performance institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that the students consider setting an alarm for when to lie down and when to wake up and be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can make you turn around the clock, leading to sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal lowers Gerrard's men
Rangers suffered another loss today when Dolly Menga's strike sent Steven Gerrard's uneven side to a 1-0 base in Livingston.
The Ibrox side was looking to take home its first victory on the road since February 4th, but Gary Holt's team delivered Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager to leave his team eight points after Ladbroke's Premiership leader Harts.
Menga beat to seven minutes before half-time and Rangers never managed to even out the results.
While the Rangers now fall to sixth place, Livingston climbs to third place and lies just behind the Hibernian on target.
And there may be more problems on the slope of the Rangers after the lineman Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound after an object was thrown from the far end.
Gerrard made eight changes to the semifinals of Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same Livi 11 who took a score from Hearts last week and he would have been happy about the way his well-sold games surpassed the opponents every time.
Rangers must have dominated, but Livingston did more with the ball control they had.
It should have been goald already two minutes into the game when Menga's first pass let Scott Pittman through to Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder missed his big chance and shot outside.
A deep frispark from Keaghan Jacobs then reached team captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow only reached the rear pole.
Rangers took control of the game, but it seemed to be more hope than belief in their games during the last third of the game.
Alfredo Morelo felt that he should have been punished when he and Steven Lawless collided, but Judge Steven Thomson waved away the Colombian's appeal.
Rangers only managed to score two goals in the first half, but the former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly easily received Lassana Coulibaly's neck and a domestic kick from Ovie Ejaria.
Live opening shots in 34th minute may have gone against the spirit of the game, but no one can deny that their kneeling deserved it.
Again, Rangers failed to deal with Jacob's fixed situation.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher matched Scott Robinson, who remained calm and chose Menga for a simple conclusion.
Gerrard acted at the break when he switched Coulibaly to Ryan Kent and the change gave almost immediate effect when the outsider hit the ball to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly ran off his line to block the attempt.
But Livingston continued to get the opponents to play exactly the kind of games they like, with Lithgow and Halkett sweeping up long fit after long fit.
Holt's side could have strengthened his leadership in the final stage, but McGregor was able to prevent Jacobs before Lithgow nodded outside the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton had yet another late claim for punishment when he was beaten with Jacobs, but again Thomson looked away.
Almanac: Inventor of Geiger Counter
And now a page from Sunday's calendar: 30 September 1882, 136 years ago today ... the day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the manic called Geigermeter.
Geiger meters have become a cornerstone of science since then and are also a major figure in pop culture, as well as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", with the leading role in the seemingly unlikely cowboy researchers Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
MAN "What in the world is that?"
Rogers: "It is a Geiger meter, used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put on these headphones you can actually hear the effects of the atoms emitted by the radioactivity of the minerals. "Evans:
Evans: "Yeah, it's poppin' now!"
His Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" cancer cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" cancer cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognise cancer cells as part of the treatment
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory
They can then "see" a protein that is common to many cancers and then re-injected
An experimental vaccine shows promising results in patients with different cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who learns the immune system to recognise cancer, saw her ovary cancer cells disappear for over 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein that is common to many cancers called HER2 and then reinject the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said, "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "promotes the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovary, lung and colon cancer," explained Prof Berzofsky.
A similar method of taking immune cells from patients and "teaching" them how to target cancer cells has worked when treating a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West supported Trump by wearing a MAGA caps, after his SNL appearance.
It didn't go so well.
Kanye West was built out of the studio during Saturday Night Live after a sprawling appearance in which he praised President Donald Trump of the United States and said that he himself would run for post 2020.
After performing his third song for the evening, called Ghost Town where he was wearing a Make America Great caps, he rallied against the Democrats and repeated his support for Trump.
"So many times when I talk to a white person, they say, "How can you like Trump, he's racist?"
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago, he said.
SNL started the show with a sketch with Matt Damon where the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Legal Committee on the charges of sexual abuse made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not sent, the performance of West’s outlay was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock tried to run West with the post.
West had also complained to the audience that he had been harassed backstage for his headband.
"They bullied me backstage.
They said, "Don't go out there with that hat on."
They bullied me!
And then they say I'm falling low," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you also want to sink low?" and said that he would "put my super-mancape on, because that means you can't tell me what to do.
Test with love."
His comments attracted more burop at least twice from the audience and employees from the SNL seemed embarrassed, Varyty reported. One person said: "There was a death blow in the studio."
West had come in as a late substitute for singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller had died a few days ago.
West puzzled many with his appearance of the song I Love it, dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West received support from the head of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest souls: THANK YOU TO STOP ON YOU TO THE MOBBEN."
But the host of the talk show, Karen Hunter, tweeted that West simply "was himself and it's absolutely wonderful."
"But I chose NOT to reward anyone (by buying his music or clothing or supporting his "art") who I believe embraces and spreads an ideology that is harmful to my society.
He's free.
So did we, she added.
Before the show, the rapper on Twitter announced that he had changed his name and said that he was now "the creature previously known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in Diddy's footsteps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The rappar colleague, Snoop Dogg has called himself Snoop Lion and, of course, the late music legend Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist who was formerly known as Prince.
They're trying to kill for knife cutting at a restaurant in Belfast.
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed at a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident occurred in Ballyhackamore, said the police.
The respondent is expected to be present at the Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
The charges will be examined by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Game of Thrones Star Kit Harington Strikes Against Toxic Masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his sword-turning role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, has spoken negatively about the stereotype of the macho hero and says that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel that they have to be tough to be respected.
In a statement to Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that he believes that "something has gone wrong" and questioned how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity during the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his fellow actor in the Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also she 31, admitted that he feels "quite strong" to address the problem.
"I personally feel quite strong, right now - where have we gone wrong with masculinity?" he said.
"How have we raised men with regard to the problems we see now?"
Kit believes that TV can be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to its very masculine characters.
He continued "What is innate and what is learned?
What is taught on television and on the streets, making young boys feel that they must be in a certain way to be a man?
I think it's really one of the big questions of our time - how do we change that?
It is clear that something has gone wrong for young men."
In the interview he also admitted that he would not make any Game of Thrones followers when the series comes to an end next summer and says that he is "ready with battlefields and horses".
From November, Kit will play in a new recording of Sam Shepard's True West, the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he felt that the meeting with his wife Rose was the best experience from the Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife thanks to the series, so it gave me my future family and my future life," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, in which Kit's character Jon Snow falls in love, in the Emmys winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on Leslie's family property in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced an increase of 14% in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820 000 people have been affected in the country, says health authorities.
Some 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the new cases were transferred through sex and marked a change from previous years.
Traditionally, HIV spreads rapidly through certain parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way had been reduced to almost zero, said Chinese health authorities at a conference in Yunnan Province.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people from year to year.
HIV infection through sexual intercourse is an urgent issue in China’s HBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalised in China in 1997, but discrimination against HBT people is said to be widespread.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will marry women sooner or later.
Many cases of infection are due to insufficient protection in sexual intercourse in these relationships.
Since 2003, China’s government has promised universal access to HIV medicine as part of its efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that personnel have leaked the GOP Senator's data, are blaming "hazardous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
U.S. Congressman Maxine Waters condemned Saturday's allegations that one of her employees had posted personal data on three Republican U.S. senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles-Democrat claimed that these claims were spread by right-wing extremist websites.
"Lies, lies and more reprehensible lies," said Waters in a statement on Twitter.
The released information was reported to contain home addresses and telephone numbers of Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing about the charges of sexual abuse against the nominated candidate to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came sometime after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pondit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was associated with Water's offices and released the information about a member of Water's staff, Hill reported.
"This unfounded claim is completely false and an absolute lie," continued Waters.
"My staff - whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false claims - were in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
This unfounded claim is completely false and an absolute lie."
Waters statement quickly got criticism online, including from White House's former press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is angry," wrote Fleischer.
"This suggests that she does not have the temperament to be a member of the Congress.
When someone is accused of something they did not, they must not be angry.
They must not be defiant.
They must not question the cause of the questioner.
They must be calm and sane."
Fleischer seemed to try to compare Water's reaction with the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who critics accused of having seemed angry during Thursday's interrogation.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who ran for Waters in the middle of his term of office, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Greatly true," he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said that her office had warned "the appropriate authorities and law enforcement agencies for these fraudulent demands.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators will be revealed," she continued, "and that they will be held legally responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to all my employees."
Review by Johnny Svenska Strikes Again - powerless spy parody by Rowan Atkinson
It is now a tradition to look for Brexit benets in every new British-slope film, and the same seems to apply to this new recording of the latest Johnny English action comedin - a series of spy parodies that were kicked in 2003 with Johnny English and got a new life 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will sharp satir tell us how obviously bad we are to become the nation's new export product?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English with the rubber face has got its license to mess up to cases renewed for the second time - his name signals more than anything else that he is a broad comic creation intended for bio-public even in non-English-speaking countries
He is of course the crazy secret agent, who, despite his bizarre claim to smoothieglamour, has got a small piece of Clouseau, a rubble of Mr Bean and a measure of the guy from the opening ceremony to the Olympics in London in 2012.
He is also originally based on the traveler and the international mysterious man that Atkinson once played in the now forgotten Barclaycard TV ads that create chaos wherever he goes.
There are one or two fine moments in the last JE movie
I loved it when Johnny English approaches a helicopter dressed in a medieval armor and when the rotor blades hit his helmet for a short time.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is shown, but humor feels quite low and strangely redundant, especially since the "serious" movie brands like 007 and Mission Impossible themselves now offer comedy as an ingredient.
The humor feels as if it is suitable for children instead of adults and to me Johnny English strange appearances are not as inventive and focused as Atkinson's silent film bravad in the role as Bean.
The constant issue is now that Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated Britain's super-secret web network of spies, revealing the identities of all UK agents out in the field, to the agent in service's great dissatisfaction - an incredibly small role for Kevin Eldon.
It will be the last straw for a Prime Minister who is a pompous and hard-working figure, who already suffers from a complete collapse of his political popularity: Emma Thompson is doing his very best with this quasi-teresa-May character but the script does not offer much to work with.
Her intelligence adviser informs her that when each individual active spy is engaged, she must use someone who has retired.
And that means the pedigree Johnny English in his own high character, now employed as a teacher in some wealthy institution, but who offers unofficial lessons in art to work undercover alongside.
Swedish was sent back to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and reunited with his previously persistent sidekick Bough, once again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine captain, a jolly-hockey-sticks-roll where Vicki Pepperdine is close to waste.
So Batman and Robin are back after everything went so terribly wrong on Her Majesty's Secret Service and bumps into Olga Kurylenko's beautiful five fatal Ophelia Bulletova.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister will fall hard for the charismatic tech billionaire, who claims that he can solve Britain's computer troubles: the unfortunate Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their odyssey of far-like apparitions: dressed as waiters, they set fire to a flashy French restaurant; they create chaos when they smuggle on board the luxury boat of Volta; and English triggers pure anarchy when he tries to use a VR headset to get acquainted with the inside of Volta's house.
There is certainly a lot of work behind the latter sequence, but although the film is both charming and fast-paced, it has an air of children's TV around it.
Pretty moderate all in all.
And like the other Johnny English films, I can't help thinking: Can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that matches his talent?
Labour denies drawing up a plan for British workers to work a four-day week but earns five days' pay
Jeremy Corbyn's party Labour is considering a radical plan that involves the British working a four-day week - but is paid for five.
According to the party, managers want to transfer savings made through the revolution in artificial intelligence (AI) to workers by giving them an extra day off.
It would see employees enjoying a three-day weekend - but keep the same salary.
According to sources, the idea of "matching" with the party's economic agenda in favour of the workers.
Switching to a four-day week has been approved by the Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to benefit from economic change.
A representative higher up in Labor said to The Sunday Times: A review of the policy is expected to be published before the end of the year.
"This will not happen in one day, but a four-day working week is an effort that fits into the party's attitude to balance the economy in favour of the worker and the party's overall industrial strategy."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, including the Greens party, which promised a four-day working week during its election campaign in 2017.
However, this objective is not endorsed by the Labour as a whole.
A Labour spokesperson said, "A four-day working week is not the party's policy and it's not the party's agreement."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour Conference to communicate his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from "faceless leaders" and "sneakers" on state companies.
The plans of the shadow chancellor also mean that the current shareholders in water companies cannot get back all their efforts, because a Labour government can make "deductions" because of what they perceive has been wrong actions.
He also confirmed plans to put employees on corporate boards and create so-called Inclusive Ownership Funds, where 10% of the private company's own capital is transferred to its employees, which then stands to receive annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy report on the 60-minute TV program on whether the FBI investigation of Kavanaugh could change their views
The FBI's investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least one week and raises the question of whether the Agency's investigations could cause some Republican senators to change their position on the issue.
In an interview sent on Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could reveal anything that would change their mind.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Of course," said Kennedy.
"I said when I went into the hearing, I talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, that the statement came out, and said, "Have you done it?"
He was determined, convinced, unambiguous."
However, Graham's voice seems unmistakable.
"I've already decided on Brett Kavanaugh and it would take a dynamite tank," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it," added Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And all of her names couldn't verify it.
It was 36 years ago.
I can't see anything new changing."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event that has a tremendously impressive array of stars that appear and an equally impressive mission; fighting world poverty.
Now, in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people wailing to Central Parks Great Lawn, not only to enjoy artists like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real goals of the event: to fight extreme poverty by 2030.
According to a 2012 statement, the Global Citizen Festival is an extension of the Global Powery Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to combat poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (if you were not ready to pay for a VIP ticket), the concert guests would perform a series of tasks, or "actions" such as volunteer work, email a world leader, call or in other meaningful ways contribute to raising awareness of the goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been with 12 years left to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a genuine way to convince people to act, or is it just about so-called "clicktivism" - people who feel that they make a real difference by signing an online application or writing a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has reported that more than 19 million "documents" have been registered from its supporters who have fought for a variety of goals.
It says that these measures have helped to encourage world leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than 37 billion dollars, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the Group quoted 390 commitments and announcements derived from its actions, of which at least 10 billion have already been paid out or financed.
The group estimates that the assets collected so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the most important commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a partnership based in the UK between investors and stakeholders engaged in "helping children develop to their full potential", promising to give Rwanda $35 million to help fight malnutrition in the area after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from global citizens.
"With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and global citizens, just like you, we can do social injustice as a subnutrition is a footnote in history," said the ambassador of the Tracey Ullman partnership to the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5000 measures were taken requiring the United Kingdom to improve the diet of mothers and children, the government announced funding of the project, Power of Nutrition, which includes dietary programmes aimed at 5 million women and children.
In answer to one of the common questions on his website, "what makes you think we can fight extreme poverty?"
Answered Global Citizens: "It will be a long and difficult road - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti- apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are some of the artists who perform at this year's events in New York, whose hosts are Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The US could use its fleet in a "blocked" to prevent Russian energy exports indicating the Minister of the Interior
The government can "if necessary" use its fleet to prevent Russian energy players from entering the markets, including in the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of State Ryan Zinke has revealed, quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's commitment to Syria - especially where it acts on the invitation of the legitimate government - is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I think they are in the Middle East because they want to sell energy, just as they do in Eastern Europe, southern Europe," he said.
And according to him, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"USA has the ability, with our fleet, to ensure that the waterways are kept open and, if necessary, to apply blocked, to ensure that their energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants in the event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that calls itself "the voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approach to dealing with Russia and Iran, and noted that they are really the same.
"The economic alternative to Iran and Russia is more or less to use and replace fuels," he said, referring to Russia as a "daysend" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
Statements will come after the Trump administration has set the goal of increasing exports of its liquid natural gas to Europe, in order to replace Russia, the much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, the officials of the Trump administration, including President Donald Trump of the United States, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, made Berlin the "captain of Moscow".
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the 11 billion dollar Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
They argue that Washington’s opposition to the project is driven only for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose the suppliers," said Russia's energy minister Alexander Novak after a meeting with US energy secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position was set back from Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading trade organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I strongly dislike the fact that a third party is disrupting our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, Head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a meeting between Chancellor Angela Merkel and President Vladimir Putin of Russia.
Elizabeth Warren will take an "ordinary thinker" if she is to stand up for the presidential election in 2020," says Massachusetts Senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would take an "ordinary thinker" about her participation in the presidential election after the U.S. elections.
During a council meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider taking up her position as a candidate.
"It's time for women to get to Washington and fix our broken government and it includes a woman on top," she said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6th, I'm going to take a real thinker to run for the president's office."
Warren weighed in on President Donald Trump during the council meeting and said that he "took this country in the wrong direction.
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing for our democracy," she said.
Warren has been bold in his criticism of Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course, we need an FBI investigation before we vote."
However, a vote on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's own supporters did not think that she would run for 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of "believable" Massachusetts voters said that the senator should not run, according to a study conducted by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two per cent supported the candidacy.
The study showed more support for a candidacy by former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38% for a potential candidate and 48% against.
Other high-profile democratic names discussed in relation to a potential 2020 candidate include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make his official decision in January, reported Associated Press.
Sarah Palin quotes Track Palins PTSD at Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enrolment in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
"What my own son is going through, what he's going through now when he's back, I can relate to other families who have experience of PTSD and some of the trauma that our soldiers are returning with," she told the audience at a meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest for "the elephant in the room" and said about his son and other war veterans that "they come back like other people, they come back hardened, they come back and wonder if there is respect for what their colleagues, soldiers and pilots and all the other members of the military have given the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and accused of domestic violence against a woman, trying to prevent a report on domestic violence and possession of weapons in drunken conditions, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 States, and the District of Columbia supports the questioning of a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a judicial review aimed at a new American policy that denies asylum to victims who flee gang-related violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and districts submitted a friend-of-the-court application on Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker who challenges the policy, reported NBC News.
Full name of the plaintiff in Grace v. Sessions filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the policy has not been revealed.
She said that her partner "and his violent gang members," abused her, but American officials denied her asylum application on July 20th.
She was imprisoned in Texas.
The state lawyers who support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, countries that produce a large number of asylum seekers, as nations facing major problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy amended a decision by the immigration authorities of 2014 which allowed illegal immigrants to seek asylum in order to escape domestic violence.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law."
"Federal law requires all asylum applications to be assessed on the basis of specific facts and circumstances of the claim, and such a provision is contrary to that principle", according to the Friend-of-the Court report.
Lawyers further argued in the report that the policy of denying immigrants' entry harms the American economy and argues that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "deliver the necessary labour".
In June, Justice Minister Jeff Sessions ordered judges in cases of asylum to cease granting asylum to victims of domestic violence and gang violence.
"Asylum is available to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership of a certain social group or political opinion," said Sessions when the policy was announced on 11 June.
Asylum was never meant to alleviate all the problems - including all the serious problems - that people face every day all over the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu when the death toll doubles in the pursuit of survivors
For the survivors, the situation looked gloomier.
"It feels very tense," said the 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, who comforted his feverish boy in an evacuation center in the city of Palu.
"The ambulance picks up dead bodies all the time.
Clean water is a defect."
The inhabitants were seen returning to their destroyed homes, rotting through water-damaged possessions and trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals injured in the 7.5 earthquake were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered from a broken back and shoulder, rested outside the hospital Palu's Army Hospital, where patients were treated outdoors due to continued strong aftershock.
With tearful eyes, he told us that the violent earthquake shook the room on the fifth floor of the hotel that he shared with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't escape.
I was pushed into the ruins of the wall, I think," Haris told the Associated Press and added that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife yelling for help, and then it became quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
The U.S. ambassador accuses China of bullying with "propaganda ads"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four - page ad in an American daily on the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to China's Daily paying an addition to Des Moines Register - the state of Iowas's best selling newspaper - after accusing China of trying to participate in the United States' sixth congress election, something that China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing tried to interfere in American elections marked what American officials told Reuters was a new phase in an escalating campaign from Washington intended to put pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to use advertising to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in an escalating trade war with increased tariffs on each other’s imports.
China's retaliation tariffs early in the trade war were designed to affect exporters in states such as Iowa who support Trump's Republican party, according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and the former long-standing governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said that Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, wrote Branstad in a debate article in the Sunday's Des Moines Register, "now doubles the bullying by placing propaganda ads in our own free press."
"China's government uses America's beloved tradition of freedom of expression and a free press to spread the propaganda to by publishing paid advertisements in Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, in the newspaper kiosk on the street here in Beijing you will find a limited number of dissenting voices and will not see any true reflection of the different opinions that the Chinese people may have about China's troubled economy, because the media is controlled by the Chinese Communist Party with iron hands," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers nodded the offer to publish" his article, even though he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans scare away female voters from the interim election by Kavanaugh fiascot, warning analysts
Since many top republicans defend the high court’s nominated Brett Kavanaugh, who faces several charges of sexual abuse, analysts have warned that there will be a setback, especially from women, in the forthcoming elections.
The feelings about this have been extremely high, and most Republicans have already shown where they stand in the election.
It is not possible to turn the clock back, says Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, to The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Reehr said he doubts Senator Jeff Flakes (R-Arizona)'s last attempt at an FBI investigation will suffice to calm angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow and not in November," says Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn on Friday, according to Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, the demonstrators "November is coming!", when they demonstrated in the hall to the Senate building when the Republicans who control the court committee chose to proceed with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, reported Mic.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will go on the roof," said Stu Rothenberg, a neutral political analyst, for the news site.
"People say it's already been high, it's true.
But it could be higher, especially among still indeterminate female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18- to 29-year-olds, who, although they don't like the president, often don't vote."
Even before Ford’s public testimony with charges of sexual abuse against the nominated candidate to the Supreme Court, analysts suggested that a setback could follow if the Republicans pushed through the confirmation.
"This has become a confused mess for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the Committee's vote or the final vote or Kavanaugh coming through, it's also about how Republicans have dealt with this and how they have treated her," said Guy Cecil, head of the Priories USA, a group that helps democratic election campaigns, for the news channel.
But the Americans in general seem to be divided over who they should believe in in the wake of Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony, and the latter seems to be the one they most believe in.
A new opinion poll from YouGov shows that 41 percent of the respondents definitely or probably believed in Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent said they definitely or probably believed in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that they thought Kavanaugh was probably or definitely lying during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford, as they from at least another prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford testified to the Senate's court committee on oath last week that Kavanaugh violently attacked her at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that that candidate to the Supreme Court exposed his genital organs to her while they attended a party during their time as students at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a startup aimed at competing with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company based on Berners-Lees open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people get access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is "world domination".
"We have to do it now," he said about the startup company.
"It's an historic moment."
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data store" or a POD.
It can contain contact lists, make lists, calendar, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It is as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all are available in a browser simultaneously.
What is unique about the personal online data storage is that it is up to the user who can access which type of information.
The company calls it "personal authorization through data."
The idea of Inrupt, according to the company's CEO John Bruce, is that the company should include resources, processes and appropriate skills to make Solid available to all.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some software developers to work with the project and a group of volunteer encoders.
From this week on, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralised apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a complete change where all business models are put on high edge overnight.
"We're not asking their permission."
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new web created by Solid.
1994 transformed Berners-Lee Internet when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality in recent months.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and head of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I am very optimistic about this new era on the web," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Priest rewarded with Victoria Cross during World War I celebrated
The only priest in the Church of England who was rewarded with a Victoria Cross during World War I is now celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
Lt Col Reverend Bernard Vann received the award for his action during the attack on Bellenglish and Lehaucourt on 29 September 1918.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never learned that he had been awarded the most prestigious prize of the British military.
A memorial stone was discovered by his two grandchildren during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "brilliant symbolic" that the stone would be revealed exactly 100 years after his grandfather was rewarded with the prize.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lt Col Vann led his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a very thick fog and under heavy fire from field and machine guns."
He later rushed up to the shot line and led with "great bravery" the line forward before he alone settled the battle.
Lt Col Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - a little more than a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "something I know I could never live up to, but something I'm very humble about."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid down a wreath after the parade, led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he "recognized himself very honoured to play a role in the parade" and added that "a true hero's courage is demonstrated by the support that will be given by many people".
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206 and instead got to see Greta Gris
Imagine this, you have stopped all night to see Bellator 206 just to be denied to watch the main event.
The show from San Jose contained 13 games, including sex on the main card and was shown live at night in the UK on channel 5.
At 06:00, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to meet, the British viewers were surprised when the program was suddenly changed to Greta Gris.
Many were not impressed after they had stayed awake until the early morning hours to watch the game.
A fan on Twitter described the program change to a cartoon children's program as "a sick joke."
"It was the government's decision that the content was not appropriate so early in the morning, so they had to switch to children's programs," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's vice president for marketing and communication when he was asked about the broadcast.
"Greta pig, yeah"
Bellator's CEO Scott Coker said they will work on their schedule to better include British viewers in the future.
"I think we're going to be able to find a solution as far as the reprisal is concerned," said Coker.
"But there's six in the morning on a Sunday there and we won't be able to solve this until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, the change of programs upset a lot.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical error.
But it was actually a state issue.
I can promise it won't happen next time.
We will show five games instead of six - as we normally do. We took water over our heads in our quest to satisfy the fans.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "underlying" because of sexuality
The Olympic diver Tom Daley says that during his childhood he felt inferior to his comrades because of his sexuality - but it also encouraged him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize he wasn't like everyone else until he went to high school."
When he spoke in the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about homosexual rights to give other "hops".
He also said he cared less about winning the Olympics after becoming a parent.
The popular show’s regular programme manager, Kirsty Young, has taken a few months off because of illness.
During his one-off performance on Laverne's first program, Daley tells how he felt less "worthy" than others during his childhood, because "it was not socially acceptable to like boys and girls".
He said, "This feeling of feeling less worth and feeling different has been a real source of power and strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "someone," he said, so that he didn't betray everyone when they eventually found out about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a high-profile advocate of HBT rights and used his prominence at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to convince more countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said he took the floor because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without restrictions and wanted to give others "hope".
The three-time world champion said that his love for a man - the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "came as a surprise."
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but he said the age difference had never been a problem.
"When you go through so much in such a young age" - he participated in his first Olympics as a 14-year-old and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was difficult to find someone of the same age with similar life experience.
The couple became parents in June to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that his "whole life perspective" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, it was only about winning gold," he said.
"But you know, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My gold medal is Robbie."
His son bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that Dad did not accept that he would die and one of the last things he had asked about was whether they got their tickets to the 2012 London Olympic Games - where he wanted to sit on the first row.
"I couldn't tell him, you won't be able to sit on the front row of dad," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and it was not until he had actually stopped breathing and he was dead that I finally admitted that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I only knew that this was what I had dreamed of my whole life - diving in front of a home audience on an Olympic arena, there was no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired his first song choice - Proud of Heather Small - a song that had followed him to the Olympics and that still gave him tremors.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson in shape on the bench during Saturday's Ryder Cup
The American Phil Mickelson will beat the record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but then he has to fix the shape to avoid an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who played for the 12th time in a row, was benched by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being at the center of events, as he has often been to the United States, the five-time winner spent his day between acting cheers and training on his game in the hope of getting a chance to show off his ability.
He has never been the straight of drivers, not even at the top of his career and the 48-year-old is not in shape for the tough course of the Le Golf National, where the long call often punishes misses hard.
It is not just the track that deters, in the ninth game on Sunday, Mickelson meets champion Francesco Molinari, who together with novis Tommy Fleetwood won all four games this week.
If the Americans, who are 4 points below before the 12 single matches, have the wind at the start, Mikkelson’s match can be absolutely crucial.
Fury expressed confidence in his player, not that he could say much else.
"He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a slap on my back and put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," said Furyk.
"His self-confidence is not wrong.
He is a celebrity and he has added so much to these teams in previous seasons and during the past week.
I probably didn't think he'd be able to play two games.
I thought he'd make it more, but now it's the way it is and we'll have to settle for it.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else."
On Sunday, Mickelson passes Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup matches played.
It can mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never fully lived up to the heights of his individual achievements.
Mikkelson has 18 victories, 20 losses and seven halves, but Furyk said his presence brought with him other qualities team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, quick, likes to joke with people and he's a good guy to have on the team," he explained.
"I also think the younger players thought it was fun to play against him this week, which was great to see.
He adds so much more than just games."
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the great leadership can soon be a mere memory
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant lead in the last day's singles in the Ryder Cup can quickly become an unpleasant experience.
Dane made his debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where a team led by Seve Ballestero held a five-point advantage over the Americans but finally won with the lowest possible margin with the result 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You are reminded that we led a great deal on Valderrama, we led a great deal on Brookline where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won with distress and beak," said Bjorn (in the photo) after watching the 2018 class win 5-3 both Friday and yesterday and lead with 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So history will prove to me and to everyone in the team that this is not over.
Tomorrow we'll give everything.
Going out and doing everything right.
This is not over until we see the point on the board.
Our goal is to try to win this cup and that is where our focus lies.
I have said it all the time, I focus on the 12 players on our side, but we are well aware of what is waiting on the other side - the best players in the world."
Björn was pleased with his players' performance on a tough golf course and added: "I would never be able to do this myself.
Tomorrow, new challenges await.
Tomorrow, it is the individual achievements that apply and that is a completely different thing.
It’s fun to be out with a partner when it’s going well, but when you’re out there on your own, your capacity as a golfer is fully tested.
It's the message you need to convey to the players, to get the best of yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind and he must also go and get the best of himself."
Unlike Björn, opponent Jim Furk will want the players to perform better individually than they did as partners, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who combed home three points out of four.
Fürk himself has been on both sides of major conversions during the last days of a competition, both in the winning team in Brookline before he ended as a loser when Europe ran "Miracle at Medinah".
"I remember every fucking word of it," he said in reply when he was asked how Ben Crenshaw, Captain 1999, had gathered his players before the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but one would like to go out as fast as on Brookline, as on Medinah.
When the pace starts in one direction, there will be a lot of pressure on these midterms.
We made our setup and placed the guys we wanted to, you know, create some magic tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned to try to lead the fight and meet Rory McIlroy in the top game, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter meet the other Europeans in the top half of the order.
"I went with this group of guys in this order because I think it's enough all the way," said Bjorn about his single choices.
Germany's new warship is being delayed again
The German fleet’s newest frigate would have been launched in 2014 to replace warships of the Cold War, but it will not be launched until at least next year due to incorrect systems and high costs, reported local media.
The launch of "Rheinland-Pfalz", the joint ship for the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg frigates, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper, which quotes a military spokesman.
The vessel should have joined the fleet already in 2014, but the problems that arose after delivery were disastrous for the ambitious project.
The four ships in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class that the fleet ordered in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen frigates.
They will contain a powerful cannon, a range of air-defence and target missiles, as well as certain stealth techniques, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signature.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to station the latest frigates for up to two years without contact with home ports.
But continuous delays mean that the groundbreaking warships - which allow Germany to project power abroad - are already obsolete when they are put into operation, writes Die Zeit.
The fateful F125 frigate created headlines last year, when the German fleet officially refused to put the ship into operation and returned it to Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the fleet returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the causes of the return, but German media indicated a number of important "software and hardware errors" that made the warship useless if it was used on a combat mission.
Deficiencies in the software were particularly important as ships in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors - only half of the crew of older frigates in Bremen class.
It was also found that the ship is significantly overweight, resulting in a deterioration in performance and limits its ability to perform future upgrades.
The 7 000 tonnes of "Rheinland-Pfalz" are assumed to be twice as heavy as similar ships used by the Germans during World War II.
Apart from incorrect hardware, the entire project's price tag - including crew training - will also be a problem.
It is said to have been staggering EUR 3.1 billion (USD 3.6 billion) - compared to EUR 2.2 billion at the start-up stage.
Problems affecting the newest frigates are becoming particularly important in the light of recent warnings that Germany's maritime power is diminishing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, acknowledged that the fleet actually "begins to have a shortage of fully equipped ships".
The official said that this was a growing problem, as old ships were phased out but no replacement ships were provided.
He regretted that none of the frigates in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could join the Navy.
The National Trust listens to the secret life of bats
New research carried out on a property in the Scottish Highlands aims to reveal how bats use the landscape in their quest for food.
We hope that the results will shed new light on the behaviour of unique flying mammals and contribute to directing future conservation activities.
The study, conducted by researchers at the National Trust for Scotland, will follow the South and Dwarf Pistrell as well as brown borrowed and Daubenton bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in important places around the property to track bat activities throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of bat sounds and which species do what.
A habitat map and report will then be produced to create a detailed area view of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, nature conservation adviser for NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management work such as the creation of meadows and how best to maintain forest land for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and the United Kingdom have decreased significantly over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects housing and the loss of habitats.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose risks, as well as aircraft and certain chemical treatments of building materials as well as attacks from house taxes.
In fact, bats aren't blind.
But because of their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes in catching the prey.
They use sophisticated eco-location technology to find insects and obstacles in their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, takes bats seriously.
The organisation has ten trained experts, who regularly carry out investigations, examines the housing and sometimes performs rescue operations.
The organization has also established Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve at Threeave Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
Property manager David Thompson says that the property is the ideal area for them.
"Here at Threeave we have a good area for bats," he said.
"We have the old buildings, lots of veterans and a lot of beneficial habitats.
But there is much about bats that are still unknown, so the work we do here and on other properties helps us to understand more about what they need to thrive.
He stresses the importance of searching for bats before carrying out maintenance in real estate, since it is possible that accidental destruction of a single dwelling could kill up to 400 females and young people, and possibly wipe out an entire population.
Flatter mice are peaceful and it is illegal to kill, trouble or disturb them or destroy their nest.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we don't know how their populations feel."
Ronaldo rejects rape while his lawyers threaten to sue the German newspaper
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the rape charges against him "false news" and says that people "will market themselves" using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which published the claims.
Portugals and Juventus forward have been accused of having raped an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, at a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is said to have paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
In a Live video on Instagram, Ronaldo (33) turned down the reports as "false news" when he spoke to his 142 million followers, just hours after the demands were reported.
"No, no, no, no.
What they said today was false news," said the five-time Ballon d'Or winner to the camera.
"They want to market themselves using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be known by using my name, but it's part of the job.
I am a happy man and everything good," said the player and smiled.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for claims they have called "an unauthorized reporting of suspicions of integrity," according to Reuters.
Advocate Christian Schertz said that the player would seek compensation for "moral damage to an amount corresponding to the seriousness of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged event is said to have taken place in June 2009 in a suite at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga went back to the player's room, where he reportedly raped her anal, according to documents filed at Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was "99 percent" a "good guy" the betrayal of the "last percentage".
According to the documents, Ronaldo had confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was with consent.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and took photographs of her injuries at a hospital, but later agreed on a settlement because she felt "saved of retribution" and was concerned about being "humiliated publicly".
The 34-year-old says that she is now trying to cancel the settlement because she continues to be traumatised by the alleged event.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged assault, and this summer he moved to the Italian giant Juve in an agreement of EUR 100 million.
Brexit: United Kingdom "will forever regret" losing car manufacturers
Britain "would regret it forever" if it lost its world-leading car production status after Brexit, Business Minister Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "disquieting" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, they would temporarily cease production at the plant in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer announced that the effects of delays at the border in the event of no agreement being concluded could result in lost jobs.
The Burnaston factory - which manufactures Toyota's Auris and Avensis - produced almost 150 000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the EU.
"My opinion is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see production stops in our factory," says Marvin Cooke, Toyota's CEO at Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers have communicated their concern about leaving the EU without an agreement on how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW says, for example, that it will close its Mini facility in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main problems concern what car manufacturers say are the risks to the supply chain in the event of a Brexit without settlement.
Toyota's production line is run on a "just-in-time" basis, with parts coming every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars ordered.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, this could lead to border disruptions that the industry says could lead to delays and a lack of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day's consumption in stock at its Derbyshire factory, said the company, and of this production would be forced to stop.
Clark said Theresa May's Chequer's plan for future relations with the EU is "exactly calibrated to avoid border controls".
"We need a deal. We want the best deal that allows, as I say, not only success at the moment to be appreciated, but for us to seize this opportunity." he said to the BBC Radio 4 program Today.
"The statements from not only Toyota but other manufacturers are that we absolutely must be able to continue what has been a very successful set of supply chains."
Toyota could not say how long production would be stopped, but in the longer term warned that increased costs would reduce the plant’s competitiveness and eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the leader of the Unite trade union at the factory, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "My experience is that these jobs never come back.
One government official said, "We have put forward an exact and credible plan for our future relationship with the European Union."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein can be delayed again," says the White House
Donald Trump's meeting with Deputy Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein could be "shooted in another week" while the fight against Brett Kavanaugh nominated the Supreme Court continues, said the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Advisor Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian interference in the elections, relations between Trump and Russia and the President's potential barrier to justice.
Whether Trump will fire the Deputy Minister of Justice, thereby jeopardizing Mueller's independence, has fueled Washington gossip for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing the possibility of wearing wiretap equipment to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of dismissing the president via the 25th supplement of the American Constitution.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But this Monday he went to the White House, and reports that he would resign appeared.
Instead, a meeting was announced with Trump, who was then at the UN headquarters in New York, to be held on Thursday.
Trump said he would "advance" not to fire Rosenstein but then the meeting was delayed to avoid a conflict with the Senate's judicial committee hearing where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual immorality, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both witnessed.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation of charges against Kavanaugh, which further delayed a full vote in the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, spoke on Fox News on Sunday.
When she was asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "A date for it has not been set, it can happen this week, or a delay of one week considering all other things that happen at the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I always like to keep the press up to date."
Some reporters would dispute the claim: Sanders has not had a press conference from the White House since 10 September.
The value Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of press conferences was not due to any disapproval of TV reporters who "play for the gallery", although she said, "I agree with the fact that they play for the gallery."
She then said that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
"The President holds more questioning sessions than any president before him," she said, adding without quoting evidence, "We've looked at these figures."
Conferences will still take place, said Sanders, but "if the press gets the chance to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, it is infinitely much better than talking to me.
We try to do this often and you have seen us do a lot over the past few weeks and it will replace press conferences, and you can then ask questions directly to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Solo press conferences are rare.
In New York this week the president may have shown why, with spontaneous statements and sometimes bizarre appearances before the assembled reporters.
Minister for Health writes to EU employees at NHS Scotland, taking into account concerns about Brexit
The Minister for Health has written to EU staff working in the NHS of Scotland to express their gratitude and their desire to stay after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent a letter less than six months before Britain withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already undertaken to cover the cost of decommissioned status applications for EU citizens working in its decentralised public sector.
In the letter Freeman wrote: "During the summer negotiations between the UK and the EU on exit have continued, with decisions expected to come this autumn.
But the British Government has also intensified its preparations for a possible scenario without agreement.
I know that this must be a very worrying time for all of you.
Therefore, I would like to reiterate how much I value the efforts of each employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from all over the EU, and the rest of the world, provide valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health care and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes acute surgery after he has suffered head injury
Tennessee State Tiger's lineback Christion Abercrombie underwent an acute operation after having suffered a main injury in Saturday's loss with 31-27 against Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Tennessee's Mike Organ.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told the reporters that the damage occurred just before half an hour ago.
"He came to the sideline and just collapsed," said Reed.
Trainers and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before he was placed on a stretcher was carried out for further evaluation.
A Tennessee State representative told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie was operated at the Vanderbilt Medical Center hospital.
Harris added that "there is no information on the type/coverage of the injury yet" and Tennessee State tries to find out when the damage occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year redshirt student, is in her first season with Tennessee State after a transfer from Illinois.
He had a total of five battles on Saturday before he left the game, giving him a seasonal total of 18 battles.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp tax when buying a property in the UK
Foreign buyers are allowed to pay higher stamp taxes when buying property in the UK, and the extra money is used to help homeless people, according to the Tory Party's new plans
The measure should neutralise Corbyn's success in attracting young voters
The increase in stamp duty will apply to those who do not pay tax in the United Kingdom
The UK Ministry of Finance expects to receive up to GBP 120 million a year to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp tax when buying property in the UK. The extra money will be used to help homeless people, which will be announced by Prime Minister Theresa May today.
The measure will be seen as an attempt to neutralise Jeremy Corbyn’s success in attracting young voters with promises of housing at more affordable prices and targeting high income earners.
The increase in the stamp tax will be levied by individuals and companies that do not pay taxes in the UK. The extra money will give a boost to the government’s efforts to combat homelessness.
The additional fee is in addition to the current stamp tax, including the higher levels introduced two years ago in holiday homes and dwellings purchased for rent, which may be up to three per cent.
The Ministry of Finance believes that the measure will withdraw up to GBP 120 million per year.
An estimated 13 percent of the newly built properties in London are purchased by people living outside the UK, which drives up prices and makes it harder for first-time buyers to get a foot in the housing market.
Many prosperous areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become ghost cities because of the high number of foreign buyers spending most of their time abroad.
The new play-out will only come a few weeks after Boris Johnson demanded a reduction in the stamp tax to help more young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping prices up by buying up land without using it, and urged Theresa May to waive quotas on homes at affordable prices to solve Britain's "disadvantaged housing situation."
Jeremy Corbyn has launched a remarkable range of proposals for housing reforms, including leased roofs and an end to settlements without the tenant's fault.
He also wants to give the municipalities greater opportunity to build new homes.
Theresa May says: "Last year I said that I would devote my time as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream, that life will be better for every new generation.
This means solving problems in the housing market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
But it cannot be right when it is as easy for people who do not live in the UK, and also for companies based abroad, to buy homes as for hardworking residents in our country.
The dream of owning their home has become too many people just a distant dream, and homelessness is still an unworthy fact."
Jack Ross: "My final goal is to train Scotland"
Sunderland leader Jack Ross says that his "final goal" is to ever become a coach of Scotland.
The 42-year-old shots look forward to the challenge of blowing life in the club from northeast England, which is currently in third place in League One, three points from the top.
He moved to Stadium of Light last summer after having led St. Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I played a game in the B-country team and that's all," says Ross to BBC Scotland's Sports Sound.
"But when I grew up I looked a lot on Scotland at Hampden with my father, and it has always lured me back.
But that chance can only come if I manage to lead a club."
Among the representatives of Ross as trainer for Sunderland are Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former leader of Alloa Athletic says that he was not worried about replacing such established names in such a large club. He has previously turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Just now I assess success based on the answer to the question 'Can I get this club back to the Premier League?'
This club is definitely part of the Premier League, given its structure and talents," he says.
"It's not easy to get there, but I'd probably just see myself as successful here if I could get the club back there."
Ross has only been a coach for three years, after a period of assistant coaching in Dumbarton and a 15-month Sejour as a member of Heart's coaching team.
Then he helped Alloa come back from moving down to the third division, and lifted St Mirren from being close to moving down to becoming the winner of the championship title the following season.
Ross says he is more satisfied now than ever during his playing career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a crossroads," he recalls, referring to when he took command of Alloa.
"I really thought leadership was right for me, in a completely different way than playing.
That sounds strange, because I had okay results and could live decently on it. Besides, I had some great successes.
But playing can be tough.
There's a lot you have to get through every week.
There is still stress and pressure at work for me, but training feels absolutely right.
I've always wanted to practice and now I'm doing it. I feel better than I've ever done in my adult life."

A study shows that the perfect time to take a beer is 17:30 on a Saturday
The heat wave of summer has resulted in increased revenue for the country’s fighting pubs, but the restaurant chains have got more pressure on them.
Figures show that pub and bar groups increased sales by 2.7% in July, but restaurant revenues fell by 4.8%.
Peter Martin from CGA, who has compiled the figures, said: "The continued beautiful weather and the fact that England remained in the World Cup longer than expected meant that we saw a similar pattern in July compared to June, when the pubs rose by 2.8%.
The decrease in restaurant turnover by 1.8% in June was only worse in July.
Pubs and bars offering mainly drinks showed the absolute best result with figures for the same period last year that had gone up more than the restaurants had gone down.
Pubs offering food also had difficulty in the beautiful weather, although it was not as dramatic as for restaurant owners.
Looks like people just wanted to go out and drink something.
The output of managed pubs and bars rose by 6.6% that month, and sales of food fell by 3%."
Paul Newman at the catering and entertainment analyst RSM says: "These results are a continuation of the trend we have seen since the end of April.
Weather and major sporting events are still the most important factors in sales on the wholesale kitchen market.
It is no surprise that the restaurant groups still have difficulties, although a 4,8 % reduction in sales each year is particularly difficult to deal with in addition to the current cost pressure.
The long warm summer could not have come more inappropriate for companies run by food sales. Time may indicate if the more moderate temperatures we have had in August provide some much needed respite."
The total sales increase in the number of pubs and restaurants, including newly opened establishments, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the fact that fewer new brands are now being launched.
Business Sales Officer Coffer Peach Tracker for the pub and restaurant industry in the UK collects and analyses data on the performance of 47 active groups with a total turnover of over £9 billion, and is an established benchmark in the industry.
One in five children have secret accounts on social media that they hide from their parents
One study shows that one in five children, sometimes as young as 11 years old, have secret accounts on social media that they hide from their parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 high school and high school students shows an increase in the number of false Instagram pages
The result has raised concerns that sexual content is being posted there
20% of the students said they had a "main account" that they showed to their parents
One in five children, some as young as 11 years old, creates accounts on social media that they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 upper secondary and upper secondary students showed a rapid increase in the number of "false Insta accounts", a reference to the Instagram image sharing service.
The result has lated concerns that sexual content is being posted there.
20% of the students said they have a cleaned "main account" that they can show to their parents, and so they also have private accounts.
A mother who stumbled over her 13-year-old daughter's secret side found a teenager who urged others to "violate me."
According to the study, carried out by the organizations Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) of independent schools, 40% of children between 11 and 18 years of age had two profiles, and half of them admitted that they had private accounts.
The chairman of HMC, Mike Buchanan, says: "It is worrying that so many teenagers are attracted to create places on the Internet where parents and teachers do not find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be "the voice of the athletes" on the board of the Scottish Sports Federation, Scottish Athletics
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Board of Scottish Athletics as an external member of the Board of Directors' Annual General Meeting.
Doyle is Scotland's most prestigious sportsman, and President Ian Beattie describes the election as an outstanding opportunity for those who lead the sport to benefit from her broad experience at international level over the past decade.
"Eilidh has won a lot of respect throughout the Scottish, British and international sports world, and we are sure that the sportsmen in Scotland would benefit greatly from her becoming a member of the board," says Beattie.
Doyle says, "I would like to be a voice for the athletes and I hope that I can contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won 200 meters and 400 meters at the Olympics in Atlanta in 1996, has a total of four Olympic gold and is now an expert commentator on the BBC. He lost the ability to go after a mini-stroke.
He writes on Twitter: "Today a month ago I got a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said that if I was to recover, and to what extent, the time had to be set aside.
It has been hard work, but I have recovered completely, learned to go again and now I am doing mobility exercises!
Thank you for all the encouragement!"
Advertising for breast pumps comparing mothers with cows sharing internet
A company that sells breast pumps has caused disagreements on the Internet with an advertisement that compares breast-feeding mothers with cows that are milked.
In order to pay attention to the launch of what is said to be "the world's first silent portable breast pump", the consumer technology company Elvie has released a music video-inspired advertising film with a humorous credit to show the freedom the new pump gives mothers pumping breast milk.
Four real moms dance in a tall barn with cows for a song with lines like, "Yes, I'm milking myself, but I don't have a tail" and, "If you didn't know it, this isn't a juver, this is a boob."
The report continues: "Pump out, pump out, I feed the babies, pump out, pump out, I milk the ladies."
But the advertising film, which has been published on the company’s Facebook page, has caused a conflict on the Internet.
The film has received 77 000 viewings and hundreds of comments, and has met mixed reactions from the viewers. Many say it sheds light on the dairy industry’s “fabrics”.
"A very bad decision to use cows to market this product.
Like us, they need to be pregnant and fed in order to produce milk, but their babies are taken from them just a few days after birth," writes one person.

Another comments: "One understands that it is traumatic for both mother and child.
But why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their children?"
Another adds: "What a real-world commercial. "
Others defend the film, and a woman admits that she thinks the song is "hysterically funny."
"I think this is brilliant.
I would've gotten one if I was still a nurse.
Pumping made me feel just like a cow.
The commercial is a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
This is a brilliant product," someone writes.
Another comments: "This is a funny commercial that turns to moms like pumps (often in the workplace or in the toilet) and feels like 'coss'."
This isn't a film that salutes or condemns the dairy industry."
At the end of the film, the women reveal that they have all danced with the discreet pump stuffed in their hand.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the fact that many women who pump milk say they feel like cows.
But the Elvie pump is completely silent, has no cables or pipes and can be worn discreetly in a nursing bra, giving women the freedom to move, keep their babies and even go out while they are pumping.
Ana Balarin is a partner and ECD at Mother, and she says: "The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between women pumping breast milk and dairy cows, we wanted to put light on breast pumping and the challenges with it, while showing in an entertaining and easily recognizable way what an incredible sense of freedom the new pump gives.
This isn't the first time the Elvie pump makes headlines.
During London's fashion week, a two-child mom appeared on the catwalk with clothes by designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children moved quietly to a tent camp near the Texas border
The number of children in detention has increased, although the number of people crossing the border each month is relatively unchanged. This is partly due to the fact that violent rhetoric and tough policies introduced by the government of Trump have made it more difficult to place children among reference persons.
In the past, most reference persons themselves have been undocumented immigrants, and fear putting their own possibilities of staying in the country at risk by declaring themselves willing to receive a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential reference persons and other adult members of the household would have to provide fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official of the Immigration and Customs Authority, witnessed to the Congress that the Authority had arrested dozens of people who had applied to be the reference persons of the single minors.
The Authority later confirmed that 70 % of those arrested were not known by law enforcement authorities.
"Almost 80% of those who are either reference persons themselves or family members of reference persons are illegally present in the country, and a large proportion of them are criminals.
So we continue to persecute these individuals," said Albence.
In order to deal with children's cases more quickly, officials have introduced new rules requiring some of them to be admitted to court within one month of their being detained, rather than after 60 days, as was previously the practice, according to staff at the premises.
Many of them are present on the video link rather than personally to bring their case for legal status before an immigration judge.
Those who are deemed not to have the right to protection are deported quickly.
The longer children are detained, the more likely they are to suffer from anxiety or depression, which may lead to violent outbreaks or attempts to escape, according to the staff of the facilities and reports coming from the system in recent months.
Proponents say that anxiety rises at larger facilities such as Tornillo, where signs that a child has it difficult to be ignored are more likely, because of the size of the facility.
They add that if children are moved to the tent city without enough time to prepare emotionally and say good - bye to friends, the trauma many are already struggling with can be aggravated.
Syria demands that US, French and Turkish "acquisition forces" withdraw immediately
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also invited Syrian refugees to return home, despite the fact that the war in the country is in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, said that the foreign forces are illegally on Syrian soil, on the pretext of fighting terrorism, and "will be dealt with accordingly."
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he said to the General Assembly.
Moualem underlined that "the war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have died since 2011, and millions have left their homes.
He said that the government of Damascus would continue to "fight this sacred battle until we have freed all Syrian territories" from both terror groups and "all illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, who primarily train and advise both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground in the war - torn country.
As for the refugees, Moualem said that these circumstances are good for coming home, accusing "some Western countries" of spreading irrational fear that will enable refugees to stay away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate their return," he said.
"They are politicizing something that should be a purely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the EU have warned that there will be no help in rebuilding Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say that a fresh agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major Idlib rebel fortress has created an opportunity to move forward with political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement ruled out a large-scale attack by Russian-supported Syrian troops against the province, which has three million inhabitants.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines", and expressed hope that military intervention would be directed against jihadists, including warriors from the Al Qaida-connected Nusra Front, who "will be wiped out".
The UN envoy, Mr Staffan de Mistura, hopes to be able to convene the first meetings of a new committee consisting of government members and members of the opposition soon, in order to prepare a draft post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set out the conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in the Committee and said that the work of the Group would be limited to "reviewing the articles of the current Constitution", and warned of interference.
Why Donald Trump will win a re-election
With that logic, Donald Trump would win the re-election in 2020 unless his presidency ended prematurely through national law and scandal, which many liberal viewers are likely to hope for.
In what would undoubtedly be "the most dramatic finale of a presidency ever!"
At present, there are no signs that the viewers have become tired.
Since 2014, the viewer figures at best transmission time have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN, and are almost three times as high, 1.6 million, on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at the best transmission time, which is an increase of 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has topped the lists for cable channels with as many as 3.5 million viewers on big news nights.
"This is like a fire to which people are drawn, because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, who runs the show for ABC's drama Designated Survivor, which is about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack has destroyed the Capitolium.

Why? she asked.
"He said, 'Because he makes me laugh'," Nell Scovell tells me.
In the chaos there is an entertainment value.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, reporting from Washington can determine the future of the abortion trial, Roe vs Wade, whether immigrant families can be reunited and the prosperity of the global economy.
Shutting off is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Yet it goes beyond being an informed citizen when one has suddenly sat and looked for six hours at an expert panel discussing Bob Woodward's use of "deep background sources" for his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's bomber jacket of ostrich leather for $15,000 ("a garment filled with hybris", as Washington Post said) and the meaning of Stormy Daniel's macabre descriptions of Donald Trump's, hmm, anatomy.
I will never look at Super Mario in the same way again.
"A part of what he does that makes it feel like a reality series is that he comes with something every night," said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", about Trump's rotating role crew and daily intrigues (munk fight with NFL, praise Kim Jong-un).
If you miss a single episode, you'll end up in the back room.
When I spoke to the TV producer Mr. Fleiss this week, there was sun and 27 degrees outside his house in northern Kauai in Hawaii, but he sat and owled indoors and watched MSNBC while recording a broadcast from CNN.
He could not wear out, not when Brett Kavanaugh was to be put before the Senate Committee on Justice and the future of the Supreme Court was in the balance.
"I remember when we did all those crazy programs in the past and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization'," said Mr. Fleiss to me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turned out they were right."

Money from currents into the smoothest race ever before the mid-year election
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th Congressional District receives a lot of money, thanks to the restructuring of a Congressional district that has allowed two members to compete for the same place.
This recently relocated suburb district in Pittsburg is represented by the Democrat Conor Lamb, who got his place in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb campaigns against another member, the Republican Keith Rothfus. He currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which largely overlaps with the new 17th district.
The maps were redrawn after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decided in January that the old districts were constitutionally distorted to the advantage of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district has caused a campaign financing dispute between the main economic sections of the parties, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a familiar name in Pennsylvania after a short win in a broad guarded special election in March to the 18th Congressional District of Pennsylvania.
That place had been held by a Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts had given the Democrats a certain advantage.
The US considered punishing El Salvador for China support but then backed up
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with some resistance from Washington.
Donald Trump had a warm meeting with President of Panama Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017, and had a hotel in Panama, until the partners expelled the leadership team of the Trump organisation.
Officials of the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs decided to recall the heads of the U.S. Missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of "newst decision to no longer recognise Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, spokesperson of the Department, in a statement earlier this month.
However, only sanctions were planned against El Salvador, which received an estimated USD 140 million in US aid in 2017, including drug control and development and financial support.
The proposed sanctions, including reduced financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have hit the Central American country hard with its high unemployment and murder statistics.
While internal meetings continued, American and Central American officials launched a high-level conference focusing on security and economic prosperity to follow up a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step in the right direction to prevent migrants from going to the United States.
In mid-September, however, high administrative officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, which in practice put an end to the consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now going to speak at the conference, which is now due to take place in mid-October.
And the three U.S. envoys returned silently to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without any new hard messages or punishments from Washington.
A spokesperson for John Bolton from the White House declined to comment on the details of the debate, described by the three American officials, two of whom agreed to discuss the internal deliberations on the promise of anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an outside analyst close to the administration who also spoke anonymously.
Studying the History
The next inevitable step could be the report by Special Investigator Robert Mueller on Donald Trump's alleged abuse of justice, for which there is now clear evidence in public records.
Mueller is also reported to lead his investigation into whether Donald Trump's campaign cooperated with Russia in its attacks on the US election.
Should Congress change the majority, Trump will be held accountable to that assembly just when he is preparing to stand up for the election once again, and perhaps finally before a civil jury.
There are many uncertain factors in this, and I do not want to say that Trump will inevitably fall, nor will his colleagues in Europe.
We all have to make different choices, on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect how far-reaching the battle can be.
In 1938, German officers were ready to stage a coup d'état against Hitler, if only the Western countries had resisted him and stood behind the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed, and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of bloodbath that followed.
History revolves around such decisive events, and the relentless progress of democracy is either accelerated or slowed down.
The Americans are now facing several of these crucial events.
What are we gonna do if Donald Trump gives Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls what's going to happen to Mueller's investigation, fired?
Rosenstein has been in trouble ever since this newspaper reported that he was supposed last year to have proposed secretly to record the president, and wondered if he would not be suitable for the office.
Rosenstein says the Times report is not correct.
"How shall we answer whether the recently requested FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or unfair, or whether he may be admitted to the Supreme Court despite credible charges of sexual abuse and false testimony?
And above all, are we going to vote for a congress that holds Donald Trump responsible in the mid-year elections?
If we fail in these trials, democracy faces a dark period.
But I don't think we're going to fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew and was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassador's residence.
She survived, immigrated to the United States, and 60 years later she sent me away to light the Sabbath light on the table decorated with the crosshairs.
With what is inherited, how could I be more than optimistic about the future?"

Graham Dorrans in Rangers is optimistic about the meeting with Rapid Vienna
Rangers receive Rapid Vienna on Thursday. They know that victory against the Austrians after the impressive Spanish match against Villarreal which ended unexpectedly earlier this month will place them in a strong position to qualify from Group G of the Europe League.
A knee-deep man prevented the midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance for the season, up to the 2-2 match against Villarreal. But he believes that Rangers can use the result as a stepping stone against greater success.
"That was a good point for us, because Villarreal is a good team," says the 31-year-old.
"We went into the game in the belief that we could get something, and left there with a point.
Perhaps we could have gotten it in at the end, but in general it was probably a fair result.
I think they were better in the first half, and we got back in the second half, and we were the better team.
Now on Thursday it will be an important evening in Europe again.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it will be a tough game. They got a good result at their last match, but if we have the audience with us we can surely pull out and get a good result.
Last year was very tough, with everything that happened to my injuries and the changes in the club, but now we have a good feeling.
The team is good and the guys have fun, the training is good.
Hopefully we can move forward now, put the last season behind us and succeed well."
Women sleep badly because of fear of pension savings
Although the survey participants had a clear picture of how they wanted to be taken care of, few of them talked to their family members about it.
About half of the participants in the nationwide study said that they had talked to their spouses about the cost of long - term care.
Only 10% said they had talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't take the step and talk about it," said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
Here's how you can start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to take care of yourself if you don’t talk about how you want it in good time.
Work with your advisor and your family and discuss where and how you want care. Your choices can have a big impact on the costs.
Help your financial advisor: Your adviser can also help you find a way to pay for the costs.
Your choice of financing for long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance solution, a life insurance hybrid solution with cash value to cover the costs, or self-insurance with own funds, if you can afford it.
Establish legal documents: Avoid legal disputes from the beginning.
Establish a healthcare authority so that you can appoint a trusted person to review your medical care and ensure that the healthcare provider complies with your wishes, if you become unable to communicate.
Consider also a mandate for your finances.
You then choose a trusted person who can make financial decisions in your place and make sure that your bills are paid if you are unable to do so yourself.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that you have an elderly parent who gets into an emergency medical condition and is on your way to the hospital.
Would you then be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Write down such details so that you are ready.
"It's not just the economy that's at stake, but who's the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What medications are they?
Who's taking care of the dog?
Make sure you have the plan ready."
Fired several times with air rifles in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air gun as he walked home from a night out.
The victim, who is in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area in Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
The police describe the shooting, which took place about 02:30, as a "single incident".
The victim didn't see his attacker.
The injuries are not life threatening, and the police are urging witnesses to hear from them.
Earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the city of Palu in Indonesia last Friday. It states officials. The death figure is expected to rise.
Communications are out of the question, and rescue personnel have not yet been able to obtain any information from the Donggala administrative area, an area north of Palu that is nearer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu after the disaster.
Here are some facts about Palu and Donggala, located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi, located in a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi. The city’s population was estimated at 379 800 people in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and the tsunami struck.
Donggala is a management area that extends along more than 300 km of the northwest Sulawesis coast.
In 2017, the administrative area, which is an administrative region under a province, had a population estimated at 299 200 people.
The pillars of the Central Sulawesis province's economy are fisheries and agriculture, especially the Donggala coastal region.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but it is mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last hundred years, according to the Indonesia Disaster Management Authority.
In 1938, more than 200 people were killed by a tsunami that destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
In 1996, Western Donggala was also hit by a tsunami that killed nine people.
Indonesia lies in the circumpacic seismic ageing, which is often affected by earthquakes.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian Aceh province on northern Sumatra on December 26 triggered a tsunami that affected 14 countries. 226 000 people died along the coasts of the Indian Ocean. More than half of them were in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit Sumatra's west coast at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off Sumatra's coast.
2006: An earthquake with magnitude 6.8 on the Richter scale struck south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, and triggered a tsunami that struck the southern coast and killed almost 700 people.
2009: An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.6 struck near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of Western Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: An earthquake with magnitude 7.5 struck one of the Mentawai Islands outside Sumatra. A tsunami of up to ten meters was triggered. Thousands of villages were destroyed and about 300 people were killed.
2016: A fundamental earthquake affected Pidie Jaya in Aceh and caused destruction and panic, when people were reminded of the devastation of the mortal earthquake and the tsunami in 2004.
This time no tsunami was triggered, but more than 100 people were killed by buildings that collapsed.
2018: Great earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok. More than 500 people died, most on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings, and thousands of tourists were temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested accused of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former Alaskan governor and vice president candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested for assault.
Palin, who is 29 years old and from Wasilla in Alaska, was arrested for violence in the home, for having lodged a notification of domestic violence and for having opposed the arrest, according to a report released on Saturday by the Alaskan State Police.
According to the police report, he must have taken the phone from a female acquaintance who tried to call the police and report the alleged crimes.
Palin is detained in the Mat-Su custody and held against the 500 dollar bail that will be paid if the suspect violates the bail terms, according to the TV channel KTUU.
He appeared in court on Saturday and declared himself "guaranteed not guilty" when he was asked to give up his attitude, according to the television channel.
Palin is suspected of three cases of less serious Class A crimes, which means that he can be jailed for up to a year and $250 000 in fines.
He has also been charged with a case of less serious Class B crimes, which is punished by one day in prison and $2,000 in fines.
It's not the first time Palin's been charged with crime.
In December 2017, he was accused of violence against his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged crime.
The case is now handled by the Alaskan Supreme Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, of having committed domestic violence and of possession of weapons under the influence of that incident.
His girlfriend accuses him of beating her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after she linked her son's violent behavior to post-traumatic stress syndrome, which stems from his military service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia last Friday.
The earthquake, which measured 7.5 on the Richter scale, triggered a tsunami and has destroyed hundreds of homes.
Electricity supply and communications are down, and death rates are expected to rise in the next few days.
The earthquake struck just outside central Sulawesi, located northeast of Indonesia’s capital Jakarta.
Movies that show when it hit are now circulating on social media.
Hundreds of people had gathered at a beach festival in Palu City when the tsunami struck the coast.
Federal prosecutors demand a rare death penalty for a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York City
Federal prosecutor in New York claims the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people. It is a rare punishment that has not been executed for a federal crime in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, must have used a rental truck from the construction and interior design chain Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bicycle path along West Side Highway on lower Manhattan. He maimed pedestrians and cyclists in his way at the attack, which took place in October.
In order to justify a death sentence, the prosecutors have to prove that Saipov "wilfully" killed the eight victims and "wilfully" caused serious body damage, according to the declaration of intent on the death penalty lodged in the Southern District of New York.
Both points of charge may be a death sentence, according to the court order.
A few weeks after the attack, Saipov was prosecuted by a federal jury of 22 points, including eight murders to support protection activities, often used by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime, as well as the abuse and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "comprehensive planning and purpose," said the prosecutors, and at the same time described the way in which Saipov carried it out as "disgusting, cruel and inhumane".
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused family and friends to Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleveland, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco damage and loss," says the statement of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The southern district of New York has not sued in a case in which the death penalty was imposed in a decade.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murder of two drug dealers, but was finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
Last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York was 1953. The married couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being sentenced to spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenberg couple were both executed in the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
According to the court documents, Saipov, a citizen of Uzbekistan, showed a lack of remorse during the days and months that followed the attack.
According to the police, he told the investigators that he was satisfied with what he had done.
According to the charges, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired by the attack after watching IS films on his phone.
He also asked to put the IS flag in his hospital room, the police said.
He has not declared himself guilty of the 22 charges in the prosecution.
David Patton is one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov. He stated that they are "giftly disappointed" on the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to invoke the death penalty instead of admitting to life imprisonment without the possibility of conditional release if the defendant admits to committing guilt only prolongs the trauma caused by these events to all concerned," said Patton.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked the prosecutors not to claim the death penalty.
MEPs from Tories say that NIGEL FARAGE should be responsible for the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the people's army" today during a protest at the Tories conference.
The former UKIP leader said that when one of Theresa May's own MEPs proposed that he would lead the negotiations with the EU, the politicians must "feel the heat" of the European sceptics.
The Conservative MEP Peter Bone said on the March in Birmingham that Britain would have "been gone out" if Nigel Farage had been the Brexit minister.
However, the challenge that Theresa May faces in getting the deeply divided supporters to reconcile has been exacerbated by EU-positive tory members, who have joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep his compromise plan, the Chequers agreement, alive under attack by the Brexitists, people who want to stay in the Union and the EU itself.
Her allies have insisted that she should press and try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the setback, and force EU-sceptics and the Labour Party to choose between her package solution and "chaos".
Bone said at a mass meeting organized by the organization Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wanted to "spola Chequers Agreement".
He suggested that Nigel Farage should have been made equal and given responsibilities in the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had stood by the helm, we would have been out by now," he said.
Peter Bone, who represents the Wellingborough district in Parliament, added: 'I will stand up for Brexit, but we must flush the Chequers agreement'.
He made clear his opposition to the EU and said: "We have not fought world war to become subjects.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Bone dismissed the allegations that public opinion would have changed since the referendum in 2016: "The idea that the British would have changed and now want to stay is completely false."
Brexitanist Andrea Jenkyns from Tory Party was also on the march and spoke to the journalists. "I just want to say, 'Prime Minister, listen to the people.'
The Chequers agreement is unpopular with the public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular in the party and with our electoral workers who are out on the streets and make sure that we are elected.
Put away the Chequers deal and start listening."
And she added a sharp message addressed to Theresa May: "Prime Ministers are allowed to keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Nigel Farage said at the meeting that politicians must be allowed to "feel the heat" if they were to fail the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's about the trust between us, that is, the people, and the political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell them, 'We're not going to let you get away with it.'"
In front of the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to get our political class, which is close to betraying Brexit, to feel the heat.
We are mobilizing the people's army in this country that gave us victory in Brexit, and we will not rest until we have become an independent, self-governing and proud United Kingdom."
At the same time, EU supporters marched through Birmingham and then held a two-hour mass meeting in the central city.
A group of activists waved with banners with the text "Tory members against Brexit" after the group was launched this weekend.
Labour parliamentarian Lord Adonis from the House of Commons mocked the conservatives for the security problems they encountered with a party app when the conference opened.
"These are the people who say they can have IT systems in place and all the technology for Canada plus plus, for frictionless borders and free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's a clean father.
There's no good Brexit," he added.
Warren is planning a "ordinary thinker" to run for the presidential post.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she's going to take a "ordinary thinker about running for the presidential post" after the November elections.
The Boston Globe newspaper reports that the Massachusetts democrats spoke about their future during a city hall meeting in Western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren has often criticised President Donald Trump, and is now standing for re-election in November against the Republican state representative Geoff Diehl, who was Deputy President of Donald Trump's campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
She's been the subject of speculations that maybe she's taking Donald Trump 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th city hall meeting with the voters since Donald Trump joined.
One person asked her if she was planning to run for the president's office.
Warren said it's time for women to go to Washington to repair our broken government, which means a woman on top.
A person arrested for the shooting of the basketball player Sims from LSU
The Baton Rouge police in Louisiana announced on Saturday that a suspect had been arrested for the shooting of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge police announced that Dyteon Simpson, 20, had been arrested at a press conference at 11:00 for ET.
They had released a film of the shooting on Friday to help identify a man visible on the pictures.
20-year-old Sims was shot to death near the Southern University campus early on Friday.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head and finally died of this," said police chief Murphy J. Paul to the media on Saturday via the news site 247 sports.
Wayde went in between to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and confessed that he had been on the scene and had a gun, and he confessed that he had shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and was taken to the police station in East Baton Rouge.
Sims was junior player, 198 cm long and grew up in Baton Rouge. He played in 32 games with 10 starting last season, and cut in 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 returns per match.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world championship title after team order gave him a win over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was clear that Mercedes's team order would play a major role in the race.
Bottas got a good start and almost hung Hamilton on a drought when he defended his position during the first two laps, and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went into custody first and had Hamilton drive into the back of the cluster, which should have been decisive.
The Mercedes went in a lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton went forward after a little wheel-to-wheel-action where the Ferrari driver reluctantly left the inside free with the risk of offering in place after a double move to defend himself in the third curve.
Max Verstappen started in the back row and was seven at the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday.
He then led a large part of the race and held in the decks to reach a fast finish and drive about Kimi Raikkonen and become four.
Finally he arrived in the depot at the 44th shipyard but failed to speed up during the remaining eight shipyards when Raikkonen went up in fourth place.
It's a difficult day, because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and was a real gentleman who let me by.
The team has done an exceptional job and got a one and a two," said Hamilton.
Really bad body language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein at a mass meeting on Saturday, because she maintains that she has not leaked the letter from Christine Blasey Ford in which Brett Kavanaugh, nominated judge of the Supreme Court, is charged with sexual abuse.
The president, who spoke at a mass meeting in West Virginia, did not directly take up Ford's testimony before the Senate's Committee on Justice. Instead, he commented that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were "equal, nasty and lying."
"The only thing that could happen and the beauty that has happened in the last days in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry, mean, nasty and lying," he said.
"You see press releases and leaks and they say, 'No, I haven't.
I haven't done it."
Do You Remember?
Did you leak, Diane Feinstein?
Do you remember her answer? 'Have you leaked the document?' 'Oh, what?'
Oh, no.
I haven't leaked it."
Wait a minute.
'Has we leaked... no, we haven't leaked anything,' he added, and imitated the senator.
The letter detailing Ford's charges against Kavanaugh was sent to Feinstein in July, and leaked in September, but Feinstein denied that the leak would have come from her office.
"I haven't covered Ford's accusations, I haven't leaked her story," said Feinstein to the Committee, according to The Hill.
"She asked me to keep this confidential, and I kept it confidential, as she wanted."
But her dementia doesn't seem to fit the president, who, at Saturday night's meeting, commented, "I'll tell you one thing, that was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The President continued to support the candidate to the Supreme Court, who has been accused of sexual crimes by three women, and he suggested that the Democrats used the charges for their own purposes.
"They are determined to take power back by all necessary means.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to drive over to gain power and control," said the president, according to the Mediaite digital news site.
Elite League: Dundee Stars-Belfast Giants 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Belfast Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars sonned Friday's loss in the Elite League against Belfast Giants by winning the return match with 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
Belfast Giants received an early two-way lead through Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie signed off on the home team before Dwyer restored Belfast Giant's leadership.
Francois Bouchard signed off for Dundee before two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory.
It was the third loss in the Elite League for the season of Adam Keefe's team, who came from behind and beat Dundee with 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season for the two teams, and the Belfast Giants had won the three previous games.
Dwyer's opening goal came in the fourth minute at 3:35 on assistance from Kendall McFaull, and David Rutherford gave assistance when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In the intense first period, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt delivered to the Cownie who signed at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure that Belfast Giants was in charge at the first break when he made his second target for the evening at the end of the first period.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard reciprocated once again with a goal in power play at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran worked together to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time in the game at the end of the second period, and he secured the win with his team's fifth half through the end period.
Belfast Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will play at home against Milton Keynes at their next match on Friday.
Air traffic controllers died to allow hundreds of people on a plane to escape earthquakes
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is now hailed as a hero after he died when he saw to it that a plane with hundreds of people on board could lift safely.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a great earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
Heavy aftershocks continue to plague the area and many are trapped in the rush of the city of Palu.
But even though his colleagues fled for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the wildly floating control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu.
He stayed to make sure that Batik Air's flight 6321, which was then on the runway, could lift safely.
Then he jumped from the control tower when he thought it would crash.
He died later in the hospital.
The spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said that the decision may have saved the lives of hundreds of people, according to the Australian TV channel ABC News.
"We arranged a helicopter from Balikpapan on Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
We are devastated to hear this," he added.
At the same time, the authorities fear that the death toll may rise to over a thousand people. The country’s disaster relief authority says that there is limited access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
"The death rate is believed to continue to increase as there are still many bodies left in the ruins, and many have not been reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the authority.
Up to six meters high waves have destroyed Palu, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft fly in aid and supplies.
The 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma said to Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance comes with dead bodies.
There's no clean water.
Minimarkets are looted everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, Head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is struggling to help survivors, but we do not know what they will meet with there.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse."
Indonesia's President Joko Widodo arrived at Palu on Sunday and said to the country's military: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?" according to CNN.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes at Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
Aircraft crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now states that a man is missing after an aircraft crashed into a lagoon
The airline responsible for the plane that crashed in a lagoon in Micronesia in the Pacific Ocean now states that a man is missing. Previously, it was said that all 47 passengers and the crew had been evacuated from the sinking plane and were in safety.
Air Niugini said in a press release that a male passenger was still missing on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it worked with local authorities, hospitals, and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately answer the questions about more details about the passenger, such as his age and nationality.
Local boats helped save the other passengers and the crew after the plane crashed into the water when it tried to land at the airport at the Chuuköarna.
Officials stated on Friday that seven persons had been hospitalized.
The airline stated that six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday and that their condition was stable.
It is still unclear what caused the crash and what the course of events looked like.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both reported that the plane landed in the lagoon without reaching the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane was slipping past the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane flew in very low.
"It's extremely good," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and others succeeded in wading through mid - deep water to the emergency exits on the sinking plane.
He said that the cabin crew panicked and screamed, and that he had a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors who worked nearby to develop a shipyard also helped in the rescue work by using an inflatable boat to drive people ashore before the plane sank into the 30 - foot - deep [30 m] water.
Aviation Safety Network data shows that 111 people have died in accidents involving airlines registered in Papua New Guinea in the last two years, but Air Niugini has not been involved in any of them.
Analysts draw up a timeline for the night when a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecutor's office closed its appeal in the second trial against a man accused of burning a woman in Mississippi alive in 2014.
The US Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett spoke for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he had used cell phone lists to put together the 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers' movements the night she died.
Rowlett said that he had received location data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers on the night she died, which contradicts his previous claims, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chamber’s cell phone during the period he said he had been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford witnessed Saturday and said that he was not in the city that day.
When the prosecutors asked about Tellis told the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "lying, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was that Tellis stated that he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Mobile phone lists showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that some time after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' text messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He wiped her out of his life," said Hale.
The defense is scheduled to begin its final performance on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be handed over to the jury later that same day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hiphop?
A hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling its music with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol believes that hiphop has come a long way from its origins in political messages and to attack social issues.
They want to go back to the roots and make conscious hiphop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently gained a boost in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
A black one again?!
A nanny in New York is right because of the termination of a "racist" text message
A nanny in New York is suing a couple for discriminating dismissal after receiving a mistyped text message from the mother, who complained that she was "one black again".
The couple deny that they would be racists and compare the mood with "expression".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed horror when she realized that the new child girl Giselle Maurice was black when she came to her first working day in 2016.
"NOEEEEEEEEEEEJ NOT A BLACK GEN," wrote Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman in a text to his husband.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Giselle Maurice, twice.
After she realized her mistake, Plasco-Flaxman was "favorable," and fired Maurice, claiming that their former African-American nanny had done a bad job and that instead she expected a Filipino woman, according to the New York Post.
Maurice got paid for a day's work and was sent home by taxi.
Now she sues the couple for compensation for the dismissal. She demands remuneration of 350 dollars a day for the job she was initially hired to do, which would be for six months and where she would live with the couple. However, she had no contract.
"I want to show them that you don't do that," she said to the New York Post on Friday. "I know it's discrimination."
The couple dropped the accusations that they would be racists and say that the only straight thing was to finish Giselle Maurice's job, and they were worried that they wouldn't be able to trust her when they insulted her.
"My wife had sent her something she didn't mean.
She's not racist.
We are not racists," said Joel Pasco to the New York Post.
"But would you entrust your children to someone you had been rude to, even if it was by mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Seriously."
Plasco compared the mood to "expression" and said that his wife would give birth two months later and were in a "very difficult situation".
"Should you go after such a person?
It's not very nice done," added the investment banker Plasco.
The legal process is still ongoing, but public opinion has quickly condemned the couple on social media and criticises them for their behaviour and reasoning.
Paddington publishers did not think that readers could relate to a talking bear, revealing a new letter
Paddington author Michael Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was adopted, commented on the letter as follows: "It is difficult to imagine what it was like for a person who read it for the first time before it was published.
It's very fun, considering what we now know about Paddington's great success."
She told me that her father, who had worked as a cameraman on the BBC before he was inspired by a little toy bear to write the children's book, had been optimistic when his work was rejected. She added that the 60th anniversary of the first edition was "bitterly sweet" after his death last year.
She describes Paddington as a "very important member of our family", adding that her father was proud in the silence of his final success.
"He was quite silent, and not a boastful person," she said.
"But Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child who succeeds with something. You become proud of the child even though it is not you who have accomplished it.
I think he saw Paddington's successes a little that way.
Although it was his creation and his imagination, he always gave Paddington his own glory."
My daughter was going to die, and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
By the time she landed, her daughter had been rushed to the hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where the doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to say that it was really bad, and that they didn't expect her to make it," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad saying that she would die in two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "I love you so much, Tashi, my darling.
I'll be right with you.
I'm coming to you.
The drugs the doctors had given her to keep her heart alive slowly ebbed out and left her body.
She had died just before, and now everything was extinguished.
I just had to sit there and wait and know that all this happened.
I could not plow or cry or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to get together."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who now mourned the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, who were completely unaware of the difficult trial she was going through.
"No one knew about it," she said.
"I bowed my head down, and my tears ran all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the flight I felt an overwhelming compassion for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Worrying women set up postcards to prevent bridge suicide
Two women who have lost closeness because of suicide work to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have set up maps on a bridge in Wales with inspiring messages and phone numbers that you can call for support.
Sharon Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he began to suffer from depression, and he took his life when he was 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel as bad as I do every day," she says.
Sharon Davis is 45 years old and lives in Lydney. She tells me that her son was a promising chef who had a contagious smile.
"Everyone knew who he was because of his smile.
They said his smile brightened the room."
But he stopped working before he died, because he was "in a very dark place."
Tyler’s brother, then 11 years old, was the one who found his sibling when he had killed himself in 2014.
Sharon Davis says, "I'm worried about consequences all the time."
Sharon Davis created the cards "in order for people to know that there are people to go and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't sit quietly, talk about it."
Kelly Humphreys, who has been a friend of Sharon Davies for years, has lost his partner for 15 years, Mark, some time after his mother died.
"He had not said that he felt depressed or depressed or anything," she says.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed that he behaved differently.
On Christmas Day, he was at the bottom, and when the kids opened his Christmas presents, he didn't have eye contact with them or anything."
She says that his death was a very hard blow to them, but they have to get through it. "It tears up a wound in the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we all have to fight on."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake when the FBI launches an investigation
"I thought that if we could achieve something similar to what he asked for - an investigation that is limited in time and scope - we might get some consensus," said Jeff Flake on Saturday. He added that he feared that the committee would be "split up" because of deeply rooted differences of parties.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate the case?
Their reluctance depends entirely on the time.
Interim elections will take place in just five weeks, on 6 November. If the Republicans make a bad choice, which is expected, they will be severely weakened in their attempts to get the one they want elected to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush has taken the phone and called senators to influence them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for Bush in the White House and through him met his wife Ashley, who was personal secretary to George W. Bush.
What happens after the FBI presents its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are now 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can have at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would enable Vice-President Mike Pence to break the deadlock and confirm his election to the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean jumpers "sunkers" under Kim
The number of North Koreans who leave for South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, says a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, which quotes data from the South Korea Reunion Ministry, says that 1,127 people dropped out last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park says that tougher border controls between North Korea and China as well as higher charges for human smugglers are important reasons.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
Finally, most of the jumpers from North Korea are offered South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans must have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and whose border is easier to cross than the heavily guarded demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Korean states.
China sees the defectors as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often sends them back with violence.
The relationship between North and South, which is still technically at war with each other, has improved markedly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries of Pyongyang met for talks focusing on the negotiations on nuclear disarmament.
This happened after the June historic meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed in general terms to work to free the Korean peninsula from nuclear weapons.
On Saturday, however, North Korea's Foreign Minister, Ri Yong-ho, accused the American sanctions of a lack of success since then.
"Without confidence in the United States, there is no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we cannot unarm ourselves unilaterally first," said Ri at a speech in the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he is unfit to serve in the Supreme Court
The minority leader in the Chamber, Nancy Pelosi, called the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was Temperatically unfit to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosis’s comments came in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help thinking that if a woman had behaved that way, she would be called 'hysterical'," Pelosi said about his reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh became emotional when he denied the charges of having sacrificed Dr. Christine Blasey Ford sexually when they were both teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh became very emotionally touched, and occasionally he almost screamed and the voice grew as he spoke about his family and his years in high school.
He also expressly condemned the Democrats in the Committee, saying that the accusations against him were a "gross and coordinated character murder" organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said that she felt that Kavanaugh’s testimony proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court, as it showed that he was biased to the detriment of the Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with his statements and the way in which he attacked the Clinton and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi hesitated when she was asked if she would try to put Kavanaugh to the national court if he was elected, and if the Democrats get a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I can say this – if he does not tell Congress or the FBI the truth, then he is not only inappropriate to sit in the Supreme Court, but also to work in the court he is in now," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the Washington D.C. Appellation Court.
Pelosi added that as a democrat she was concerned about what decisions Kavanaugh might take against the Medical Insurance Act Afordable Care Act or the abortion case Roe vs. Wade, since he is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions as to whether he would modify certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
It is not the place for a hysterical and biased person to sit in court and expect us all to applaud," said Pelosi.
Women have to endure.
It is a righteous criticism, months and years of anger that boils over, and she cannot get it out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," said Ms. Steinem to me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual.
And she continued: "I got good help from a woman who was CEO somewhere. She said that she also cried when she got angry, but had developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to: 'You might think I'm sorry because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And so she went on.
I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are allowed to get out of anger in part because they are often misunderstood in essence.
One of my clearest memories from one of my first jobs in a male-dominated office, where I once cried with unspeakable anger, was that I was taken into the collar by an older woman. It was a cold boss that I had always been a little afraid of, and she dragged me into a stairwell.
"Never let them see you cry," she said to me.
"They don't know you're furious.
They think you're sad and happy that they managed to push you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic Congressman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential election campaigns.
In 1987, when Hart was caught with an extramarital deal on a boat called Monkey Business and pulled out of the campaign, a very frustrated Schroeder felt that there was no reason not to investigate the idea of putting himself in the presidential election.
"It wasn't a well thought out decision," she said with a laugh to me 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates. The last one they needed was one more.
Someone called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarves."
Since she was late outside, she lay behind with the money collection, and promised not to go in as a candidate if she did not get $2 million.
It was a project doomed to fail.
She discovered that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men gave her only $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she asked.
When she announced in one speech that she would not launch a formal presidential election campaign, she was so overwhelmed by feelings, gratitude to those who had supported her, frustration at the system that made it so difficult to collect money and target voters rather than delegates, and anger at sexism, that the voice staggered.
"You could have thought that I had had a nervous breakdown," Schröder recalls about the press's reactions.
"One could have thought that Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, "What are they going to write on my tombstone?"
"She's crying?"
Why the US-China Trade War Can Be Good for Beijing
The opening of the trade war between the United States and China was deafening. The war is far from over, but the crack between countries can benefit the Chinese government in the long term, according to experts.
US President Donald Trump fired the first warning shot earlier this year by covering important Chinese exports such as solar panels, steel and aluminium with customs duties.
The most important step forward came this week, with new customs duties on goods for $200 billion, which in practice means that half of all goods entering the United States from China are subject to customs duties.
Beijing has responded each time with the same coin, and recently between five and ten percent of American goods were charged for 60 billion dollars.
China has promised to match the measures of the United States. The world’s second largest economy will probably not descend within a reasonable time.
Making Washington back up means bowing down to demands, but public crawling for the United States would be far too embarrassing for China's President Xi Jinping.
Experts believe, however, that if Beijing plays its short-term right, the US trade war press can give positive support to China in the long term, by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"A rapid political decision in either Washington or Beijing can create conditions for economic panic in either country, and it is actually much more dangerous than the viewers have previously wanted to acknowledge," says Abigail Grace, research assistant focusing on Asia at the Center for New American Security.
Syria "redo" for returnees, according to the Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria says that it is ready to receive voluntary returnees and appeals for help to build the country, which is in ruins after the more than seven years of war.
In a speech before the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the conditions in the country are now improving.
"The situation on the ground today is more stable and secure, thanks to our success in combating terrorism," he said.
The government continues to build up the areas that have been destroyed by terrorists, in order to restore normality.
There are now all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
A further six million people still living in the country need humanitarian aid.
According to Al-Moualem, the Syrian regime would welcome help to rebuild the devastated country.
But he stressed that it does not receive conditional support or help from countries that have supported the uprising.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe has won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating Team USA with the final score of 16.5 against 10.5 at the Le Golf National outside Paris in France.
The United States has now lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won again when the Danish captain Thomas Bjørn's team achieved the 14.5 points required to beat the United States.
The American star Phil Mikkelson, who had to fight hard during most of the tournament, ended up in the water at the end of the 16th hole par 3-track, and lost against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari was shining in all rounds and became one of four players who have ever made 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament was introduced in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was defeated by 5 & 4 of the European team's lowest ranked players, Thorbjørn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's top ranked player, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 & 1 against Ian Poulter from England, who may have made his last Ryder Cup.
The Spaniard Sergio Garcia, who is a veteran with eight Ryder Cup behind him, became the tournament's most successful European ever with 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a tough year.
I'm so grateful that Thomas chose me and believed me.
I'm so happy, so happy to win back the victory.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I could be of help," said a touched Garcia after the victory of the European law.
He left the baton to his compatriot John Ram who defeated the American golf legend Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in single on Sunday.
"What incredible pride, to get to beat Tiger Woods. I am grown up to look at him, said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France, and now has the result 13-21-3 for his career in the Ryder Cup.
A strange statistic for one of the world's best players ever, who has won 14 major titles, which has only been surpassed by Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA fought the whole weekend to find fairway, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-quality golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk said after the team's disappointing achievement: "I'm proud of these guys, they've been fighting.
It was time this morning to raise the temperature in Europe.
We took the fight.
The hat off for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players played really well.
We're going to regroup, I'm going to work on the U.S. PGA tour and our Ryder Cup committee and we're going on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be the captain.
You have to bow and bow.
They played better than us."
Algal flowering: Halters decrease in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report from the Florida Fisheries and Wildlife Commission shows a general reduction in algal flowering concentrations for parts of the area around Tampa Bay.
According to the Commission, uneven blooms are reported in the areas around the major municipalities of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier.
The algal flower stretches over 20 miles [20 km] from the coast, from northern Pinellas to southern Lee.
Spots can be seen about one and a half miles out into the sea outside the major municipality of Hillsborough, but in fewer places compared to last week.
Algal blooms have also been observed in the large municipality of Pasco.
Average concentrations in or off the coast of Pinellas have been reported over the past week.
