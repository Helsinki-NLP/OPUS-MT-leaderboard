Welsh members of the National Assembly are afraid not to be taken seriously
Several members of the National Assembly were recently dismayed by a proposal to change the name of the Assembly member or AM to the Welsh Parliament or MWP.
The reaction came because of plans to change the name of the National Assembly of the Welsh Parliament.
Members of several political parties are concerned that they may be ridiculed.
A Labour member said that his group is concerned by your «MWP rimar on Twp and Pwp»
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh, twp means stupid and pwp beesj.
One member of the Plaid party said that the ‘not-good’ group and proposed alternatives.
A Welsh Conservative member said that his group has an 'open mind' when it comes to name change, but added that MWP is not far from the word 'muppet'.
In this context, the Welsh letter w was not different from the English Yorkshire dialect's pronunciation of the letter u.
The National Assembly’s delegation, which is now writing legislative proposals to introduce the name change, said: ‘The final decision as to which members of the National Assembly should be called will, of course, be up to members themselves.’
A Welsh official decision of 2017 gave the National Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the delegation published the results of a public hearing on the naming proposals which showed great support for calling the Assembly the Welsh Parliament.
In the case of the title of National Assembly members, the delegation favoured Welsh MP or WMP, while the MWP elections received the most support during the public hearing.
National Assembly members have, of course, come up with other proposals, but the struggle to become some has given the leader of the delegation, Elin Jones, the main work, to submit the bill in a few weeks.
The legislation of the reforms contains other changes to the way the delegation should function, including rules on disqualification of members of the assembly and the design of a committee system.
Members of the assembly will be able to vote on their names when they debate the bill.
Macedonians smoke in public shelters to change the name of the country
The voters shall, on Sunday, vote on whether to change the name of their country to ‘North Macedonia Republic’.
People's disfellowshipping was determined to resolve a conflict that has taken place for many decades with the neighbouring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of the neighbouring country in the north represents a claim on the territory and has had many objections to Macedonia’s membership applications to the EU and NATO.
The Macedonian president, Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the popular disclaimer of the name change, said he's going to look away from the result.
Those who support popular disapproval, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price of becoming a member of the EU and NATO.
The clock of St. Martin stops while the churches of Harlem, New York, are strutting
"The old ones I talked to said that in the old days there was a bar and a church on every corner," said Adams.
‘There are none of these parts today.’
He said he understands why the bar's gone.
‘People socialise in other ways now,’ he said.
‘Barbars are no longer crowded in the neighborhood that people visit normally.’
When it comes to churches, he is concerned that the money from selling property will not last as long as the leaders believe, 'and sooner or later, they are back where they started.'
He added that churches can be replaced by apartments filled with the kind of people who don't care about helping the historical places of the neighborhood.
"The majority of people who buy share apartments in these buildings are white," he said. "and this is how the day comes when all the churches are shut down, because it is not likely that these people who move into the apartments will become members of these churches."
Both churches were built of white socks before Harlem became a black city - Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin Church a decade later.
The original white Methodist Congregation moved out in the 1930s.
A black sock that had witnessed nearby, moved into the building.
Saint Martin was taken over by a black sock lease by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who also led the boycott of the shopkeepers in 125. Gate, a chief managing officer in Harlem where the owners were opposed to appointing or promoting blacks.
The building had great damage in a fire in 1939, but when pastor Johnson's followers planned to build him up again, they also ordered a new clock game.
Pastor David Johnson, son of Johnson senior and successor of St. Martin, was proud and called the "clocks of the poor."
The expert who played at the clock game in July calls it something else: ‘Ein Kulturskat’ and ‘Ein historische instrument nichtreplacen’.
The expert, Tiffany Ng from Michigan University, also commented that it was the first clock game in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who left the church to play at the larger riverside church clock game 18 years ago.
Merriweather said that Saint Martin did not find a replacement for him.
What has happened in Saint Martin in the past few months has become a complicated story about architects and builders, some of them added by the leaders of the laymen in the church, and others of the episcopal bison.
The sacristy, which leads the sok and consists of the leaders of the layman, wrote to the bishop's death in July with concern that the episcopal symbol "would ask the sacristy to pay," even though the sacristy was not involved in the episcopal addition of architects and builders.
Some of the members of the sock have complained about the lack of openness from the bison.
13-year-old damage to sharks during hummardy in California
Authorities report that a 13-year-old was attacked by a shark on Saturday as he dived for humming in California on the opening day of the hummar season.
Measured her just before 7 a.m. near the Beacon beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel commented on the KSWB TV in San Diego that he had dived with friends in about half an hour Saturday morning when he heard that good shouts for help. He paddled off to good with a group and pulled him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought only good was enthusiastic about having caught a hummer, before he realized that good shouts «yet bite me!
Something bites me!"
"His whole collarbone was torn off," said Hammel, observing when he reached good.
‘I screamed that everyone had to get out of the water: there is a shark in the water!’ he added.
The good was picked up by the air ambulance and taken to Rady Hospital for Children in San Diego, and his condition is critical.
It's uncertain what kind of shark it was that claimed good.
Captain Larry Giles said in a press conference that a shark was observed in the area a few weeks earlier, but that shark was not a dangerous black shark.
Giles caused good damage to the upper body.
The authorities linked access to the water from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours to investigate and secure the area.
Giles commented that there are more than 135 different species of shark in the area, but most are not likely to be dangerous.
Shop of Sainsbury's bets on beauty product
The UK store chain Sainsbury's will compete with Boots, Superdrug and Debenham's beauty product and offer storm gas intensities at the shop.
As part of an investment in the UK's beauty market, worth £2.8 billion, and continuing to grow while fashion and interior sales are falling, Sainsbury's test is to test out their beauty products in 11 stores next year, and several shops if there is a success.
The investment in beauty product comes at a time when the shelves that used to be filled with TVs, microwaves and interiors now stand empty.
Sainbury's said they should double the number of beauty products to 3000 products and offer brand names Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
They shall mark L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees more space and have separate areas for each brand, such as in the Boots stores.
The store also needs to relaunch its own boutique jewellery series and make most of the products vegan, which will attract more young customers.
In addition, the perfume negotiator Fragrance Shop will test the parfyman's hall in two of Sainsbury's shops. The first open in Croydon, London, last week, and the second open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online action and a shift towards buying small quantities of food every day from local retail shops means that large retail chains need to find new ways to reach customers.
Mike Coupe, administrator of Sainsbury's, has commented that shops will look more and more like storm magazine, while stores are trying to fight against the low-cost Aldi and Lidl shops with more non-food services and goods.
Sainsbury's partnered with the interior chain of Argos in hundreds of shops and introduced several Habitat stores, since they bought up both chains two years ago. Sainsbury's claim that this has increased the grocery store and so defended the purchase.
The store's previous attempt to renew the beauty and pharmacy departments was not a success.
Sainsbury's collaboration with Boots early in the 21st century, but this was the end of when the parties didn't get to know how to share the profits from the pharmacy in the shops.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold pharmacy chain Celesio, which had 281 pharmacies and owned the pharmacy chain Lloyds, for £125 million three years ago.
They added that Lloyds still has a role to play and should offer an expanded luxury series of skin products, including branded La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, commented: "We have changed how the beauty shelves will look and experience to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also appointed colleagues with special expertise to provide beauty services.
Our trademarks are designed to suit all needs, while the attractive environment and the practical locations mean that we are now an attractive beauty destination that challenges the old way of acting.»
Peter Jones 'racial' after Holly Willohby withdraws from agreement worth £11 million
The stars of Dragons Den, Peter Jones, are “racial” after the TV host Holly Willoughby withdrew from an agreement with his lifestyle mark worth £11 million to focus on their new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time to promote the interior and addition of their Truly.
The couple's cooperation has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop mark.
The host from the program This Morning, 37, just got to know Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has left the stars from Dragons Den, Peter Jones, in the middle of the development of their new collaboration on a lifestyle brand to focus on their own contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources report that Jones was "racial" when the Golden Holly confessed during a strenuous meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of Jones' business in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that Holly's new contracts - worth up to £1,5 million - means that she no longer has time to cooperate on the interior and adjacent Truly brand.
The cooperation has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop mark and was supposed to double Willoughby's estimated fortune of £11 million.
Willoughby, 37, used Instagram to make sure she wasn't going to work with Truly, while Jones dumped the United Kingdom to calm down in one of her holiday homes.
A source said, "Truly was absolutely at the top of Holly's priorities.
It was to be her long - term plan for the future, and it was to last many decades.
Her decision to withdraw has surprised everyone involved.
No one threatened their own ears on Tuesday, Truly was so close to the launch.
There is a warehouse in Marlow filled with goods ready for sale.»
Experts believe that the decision of this morning host, which is one of the richest stars in the United Kingdom, can cost the company millions due to intense investments in the product, from cushions to candles to clothes and interiors, and can cause delays in launching.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, who is the mother of three, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, has our dear friends of Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby created Truly together with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined in as Chairman of the Board in March.
Couple vacations together and Jones owns 40 percent of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby shall become the M&S brand ambassador and shall replace Ant McPartlin who will host ITV's I'm A Celebrity program.
A source near Jones said yesterday evening, "We're not commenting on his business."
Thick calls 'and then we fall in love'
He puzzled about the criticism he came to get from the media to make a comment some might experience as ‘unpresidant’ and to be so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Said Trump with his customs office as a «newspeaker».
"I have not given up anything."
He commented that Kim was interested in a new meeting after their first meeting in Singapore in June, which Trump called a major step towards the disarmament of the North Korea nuclear program.
But the negotiations on the nuclear weapons programme have been halted.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, the top diplomat from North Korea, Ri Yong Ho, said to the world leaders of the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea has not received a ‘correspondent response’ from the United States in its early disarmament.
Instead, he added, continued the United States with sanctions to press North Korea.
Trump was much more optimistic in his language.
"We're doing great between us and North Korea," he said.
"We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
Now we have a great relationship."
He added that his work to improve relations with Kim has brought positive results -- the end of rocket testing, aid in the liberation of hostages, and the return of the remains to American soldiers.
He defended his unusual procedure when it concerns relations with Kim.
"It's so easily presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get in, we had about 200 people standing right there," said Trump and pointing at the group standing ahead of him.
Tsunami and earthquakes in Indonesia destroy the island and kill hundreds
After the Lombok earthquake, foreign relief organisations were told that they were not needed.
Even if more than 10 per cent of the residents of Lombok had to flee, no one declared a national crisis, needed to obtain international relief.
'Unfortunately, they have in many cases been very clear that they don't want international help, so it's a little challenging,' said Sumbung.
While Redd Barna sets up a team to travel to Palu, it is still not safe if the addition with a foreign passport is allowed to work in the field.
Sutopo, the spokesperson of the Indonesia National Crisis Agency, said that the authorities are assessing the situation in Palu to see whether international organisations are allowed to provide emergency aid.
Although Indonesia is frequently exposed to earthquakes, it is not particularly prejudicial to natural forces.
In the Aceh area they have built shelters for tsunamis, but they are not common in the rest of the country.
In spite of warnings against tsunamis in Palu, there was no alarm, which most likely led to several victims.
Traveling between the Indonesian islands is usually quite challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that was attached to Kai in Lombok to treat those who were injured in the earthquake is now on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the place of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo focused on the implications of Indonesia's infrastructure during the presidential elections, and has spent a lot of money on new roads and railways.
But lack of funding has made it difficult for President Joko's administration, and next year there are choices again.
President Joko is also pressured when it comes to sectarian tensions in Indonesia, while members of the Muslim majority have accepted his conservative threat.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands had to flee when Christians and Muslim gangs fought in the streets and used machetes, arrows and arches, and other primitive weapons.

The number of victims in Indonesia is increasing to 832
The number of victims in the Indonesia earthquake and tsunami has increased to 832, the crisis agency in the country reported early Sunday.
Many people were trapped in the ruins of buildings that fell together in the earthquake, as she did on Friday and had a strength of 7.5 followed by 6 meters high waves, reported the spokesman for the crisis agency, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, in a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, is now covered with collapsed buildings.

Parliament's statue of Cromwell becomes the last victim of the "rewrite of history"
The removal of the statue would be karma for Cromwell and the Taliban-like destruction of several cultural and religious objects in England that his puritan followers did during the civil war in the 1600s.
But the Cromwell Association described Crick’s proposal to remove the statue as ‘noise’ and ‘prove to re-write history’.
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Association, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of statues that the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster Palace would be a goal.
The iconoclasm during the English Civil War was cork ordered or executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps wrong Cromwell would have been the victim of the actions of his ancestor, Thomas, in the century before.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's excellent representation of Cromwell is evidence of public opinion in the 1800s, and is part of the historiography of a figure that many still think is worth celebrating.»
Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was in the 1800s, and is still today, seen as a defender of Parliament against external pressure, and in his case it was, of course, against the monarchy.
Whether this representation is correct or not is still a discussion theme in historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 1600s has shaped the evolution of our nation, and Cromwell was an individual who we know represented one side of that separation.
What he achieved as Lord Protector is also worth celebrating and remembering."
Murdered pig attack and kill Chinese pawn
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a South-West China market, following local media reports.
The man, named Yuan, was found dead, with cut heart rate and covered with blood, near a pig's nest on the market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, reported the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing to give pigs vaccines on a garden on May 30th, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He had recently travelled with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
Next morning he found his cousin's dead, and discovered that the gate to one of the pigs was open.
He said that in the broom there was a big male pig with blood around his mouth.
The autopsy showed that a 250-kilogram pig had killed the farmer, according to the report.
"Being to my cousin was bloody and ruined," said the cousin, named Wu, to Guiyang Evening News.
The surveillance camera shows that Yuan came to the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed him did not listen to Yuan or his cousin.
The market manager told Evening News that the pig had been locked in to prevent him from attacking others, while the police collected evidence of the trip.
Yuan's family is now negotiating compensation with the market leader.
Even if it is rare, such measures by pigs have happened before.
In 2016, a pig went to attack a woman and her husband in Massachusetts, and caused serious harm to the man.
Ten years ago, a 295 kilos of heavy pig held a Welsh farmer captive between himself and a tractor, until his wife's frightened pig disappeared.
After a farmer in Oregon became one of his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba to CBC News reported that pigs are not aggressive to normal, but that the taste of blood can trigger the animals.
"They will only play.
They like to bite a bit, they're curious... they won't hurt you.
You just have to have enough respect for them," he said.
Residues of the Hurricane Rosa brings rain to the south-west of the United States
As predicted in the weather forecast, Hurricane Rosa becomes weaker over the cool waters along the northern coast of Mexico.
Nevertheless, Rosa will carry hot rain to north-Mexico and south-west America the next few days.
Rosa had wind strength up to 136 km/h and was a Category 1 hurricane until 5:00 in the Eastern time zone of the United States on Sunday, and the hurricane center was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is moving north on Sunday.
In the meantime, there is a low pressure over the Pacific Ocean moving eastward towards the west coast of the United States. Rosa comes closer to Baja California peninsula on Monday in the form of a tropical storm, and will move tropical humidity northward to south-west America.
Rosa will bring up to 25 centimeters of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
The tropical humidity will react with low pressure and cause thick rain in the southwest of the next few days.
Locally, between 3 and 10 centimeters of rain can create dangerous flakes and possible landslides in the desert.
Tropical humidity will result in rains of between 5 and 7 centimetres per hour in some parts of the south-west US, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Between 5 and 10 centimeters of rain are expected in parts of the south-west US; especially over large parts of Arizona.
Hazardous flakes may occur due to scattered terrain and tropical rain.
It warns against walks in the desert on foot because of the danger of tropical rain.
The rain can make claps to fluttering rivers and lightning and tore storms will bring strong wind and dust.
The coming low pressure will also bring rain to parts of the coast of southern California.
Total rainfalls of over 1 centimeters are possible, which can create small flutes and smooth paths.
This will be the first rainy village for the season in the region.
Scattered tropical rain showers will start in Arizona late Sunday evening and early Monday morning, before rain increases late on Monday and Tuesday.
Four Corners region can expect a lot of rain on Tuesday and Wednesday.
October can witness intense temperature fluctuations throughout the United States while the Arctic gets colder, but tropical strokes will still be quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic differences in temperatures, even between small areas.
Sunday was an example of dramatic temperature differences in central parts of the United States.
There's almost 20 degrees temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
The next few days will be summer heat trying to build up and spread again.
Much of the central and eastern US is expected to experience a warm start in October, with 25 degrees upwards from the south of the large plains to parts of the northeastern United States.
New York City can reach 25 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above the average.
The long-term warning indicates that there is a high probability of above average temperatures in the East U.S. through the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watch the Kavanaugh board
On Thursday, more than 20 million people witnessed the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh in the U.S. Supreme Court and a woman who owed him for sexual assault in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six different television channels.
At the same time, the political discussion of the case continued, with interruptions in the usual television programs of various broadcasters to reveal the latest news on Friday: a consensus reached by Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake that the FBI will investigate the debt during the next week.
Ford told the Supreme Court Committee that she was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh felt her when he was drunk and tried to take off her dress at a high school party.
Kavanaugh said, under a sensitive detachment, that he's 100 percent sure that it didn't happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people saw off on Friday, according to Nielsen.
The company reached this figure by finding the average number of people viewing CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News and MSNBC.
The number was not clear from other channels showing the issue, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen also has trouble counting viewers who look at from the office.
To put this in perspective, there's a similar number of viewers looking at an American football final or Oscar distribution.
Fox News' hosts have supported Kavanaugh, and the channel was also the one with most viewers during the day with 5,69 million viewers, said Nielsen.
ABC was in second place 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, said Nielsen.
People are still interested in the hearing.
Flake was in focus during the drama on Friday.
After Flake, a moderate republican, declared that he was on Kavanaughh's side, he was filmed by CNN and CBS while Protestants called after him on his way to a hearing with a domain office on Friday.
He was standing and watching in the ground for several minutes while the Protestants were ticking on him on CNN live.
'I'm standing right in front of you,' said one woman.
«Do you think he is telling the truth to our country?»
Some said to him, "You have power, while so many women are powerless."
Flake said that his office has spoken, and before he went into the elevator he said he would have more to say under the committee hearing.
The Broadcasting Bureau showed the audience on television when the Judge Committee was to vote for or against the nomination of Kavanaugh to a full Senate and to a wider voice.
But Flake said he could only do it if the FBI investigated the claims against Kavanaugh in the next week, which the Democrats have also asked for.
Flake was sometimes overconfident after talking to his friend, the democrat and Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and several other senators afterwards, Flake took a decision.
Flake's decision proved to have power, because it became clear that the Republicans could not speak for Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the complaints against Kavanaugh.
Theresa May owes critics to ‘play politics’ when it applies to Brexit
The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Theresa May, owes the critics of her plans to leave the EU to play politics with the future to the United Kingdom without regard to national interests, in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
Theresa May is in Birmingham, England, to participate in the Conservative Party’s conference on September 29, 2018.
Next to the May interview on the front of the Sunday Times, there is an interview with former foreign minister Boris Johnson, where he takes action on the so-called Chequers Plan for Brexit and says that the proposal for the United Kingdom and the EU to collect each other’s fees is ‘in total absurd’.
Wayde Sims shooting in the United States: Police arrest the suspect Dyteon Simpson for Sims-shootinga
The police arrested a man suspected of the fatal shooting where Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player from Louisiana State University (LSU), was killed.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, is arrested and imprisoned for intentional killing, reports the Baton Rouge police, Louisiana.
An official video shows the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police said that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police found the glasses on the road and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, following a report from the WAFB channel, which is linked to CBS.
After the execution of Simpson, the police said he admitted to have shot Wayde.
The deposit for Simpson was set to $350 000, reporting local visas The Advocate.
The Coronan in East Baton Rouge published an early autopsy report on Friday that showed that the cause of death was a shot in the head that went into the neck.
Baton Rouge police thank the state police in Louisiana for their special forces, state police for their crime lab, the Southern University police force and local residents for helping them find Simpson.
The athletic director of LSU, Joe Alleva, thanked the local police for “watching the achievement of justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
The 2 meter high basketball player wakes up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
On average, he scored 5.6 points with 2.6 setbacks per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "stressless" after Wayde was killed.
'This is something we're always afraid of,' said Wade.
The volcano spews out ash over Mexico City
The ashes of the volcano Popocatepetl have reached southern parts of the capital of Mexico.
The National Crisis Prevention Centre asks Mexicans to stay away from the volcano on Sunday after the activity increases in the crater and centre registered 183 gas and ash spills in 24 hours.
The center had observed several rogues and tremors.
Social media images show thin layers of ash on cars in different neighbourhoods of Mexico City, including Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noted an increase in activity in the volcano, which is 72 kilometres south-east of the capital, since an earthquake with the strength of 7.1 falls central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano is known as "Don Goyo" and has been active since 1994.
Police are conversing with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of self-rescue
Six Protestants were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after demonstrations of self-responsive noise accompanied by police forces, and thousands of other demonstrators protested against self-responsiveness one year after the consolation of possible release from Spain.
A group of masked separatists were held back by police forces while throwing eggs and powder varnishes that created dark clouds of dust in streets that are usually filled with tourists.
Coherence also broke out later in the day, and the police used batons to prevent escalation.
In several hours, the "Do Not Forget, Do Not Forgive" separatists cried out against self-responsive cries, "Long live Spain."
Local news channels reported that fourteen people were treated for minor damage after protests.
The vote is still held in the region, and many will still have themselves one year after 1 October, which was called illegal by Madrid, but was celebrated by separatists in Catalonia.
Most of the voters voiced themselves, but there was also a low level of convalescence among those who were against self-steering and boycott sedition.
According to Catalan authorities, almost 1000 people were injured last year after the police tried to prevent the noise and electoral clashes occurred in the region.
Groups who were too self-serving sleeping in tents on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the state police.
The demonstration went off the stack anyway, but it was forced to take another path.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who took part in the separatist protests together with his wife, said that he no longer has hope of self-driving in Catalonia.
"Last year, we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying out of joy in order to be able to voice for themselves, but now we're stuck again," he said.
Even though they won the regional elections last December, the Catalan parties who are too self-serving to hold power this year, while many of their leaders are in exile or arrest while awaiting trial for their role in the organisation of the genocide and the subsequent declaration of self-punishment.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who filmed protests in support of the police on his phone, said the conflict was home to politicians on both sides.
"The tension increases more and more," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders, who have been part of the ongoing legal proceedings since last year, declared that he should make elections in the European Parliament next year.
"To remain silent as a candidate in European elections is the best way to condemn the decline in democratic values and repression we have experienced from the Spanish state," he said.

Menga shooting gives Livingston 1-0-saids over Rangers in Scottish football
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston Sigars says
Stunning Livingston surprises Rangers and Steven Gerrard experiences his other say after 18 games that train for the Ibrox Club in Glasgow.
Dolly Menga's shot turned out to be the difference while Gary Holt's side jammed with the Hibernian squared.
Gerrard's side has no victors in the Scottish Premiership league this season, and shall play against Hearts, as they are eight points behind, next Sunday.
Before it's going to be Rangers' hosts for Rapid Vienna in the European League on Thursday.
Livingston has six wins in a row, and the main coach Holt still hasn't lost since he replaced Kenny Miles last month.
Livingston's missing chances of being dislocated
Hole's team should have rented long before they scora, and created more problems for Rangers with the direct gaming saying.
Scott Robinson broke through, but had low effort towards goal, which meant that Alan Lithgow had to work hard after the meeting with Craig Halkett's heading over the goal.
The home team was happy to let Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could create trouble for the away team.
And that's how the deciding goal became scora.
Rangers took part in a free park and Livingston created an opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson went to Menga, which took a touch and scora from the middle of the penitentiary.
Before then, Rangers dominated the ball, but saw that the home defense was solid and the keeper Liam Kelly was focused.
This pattern continues into the second half, even if Alfredo Morelos forces Kelly to save a target.
Scott Pittman tried to score, but was stopped by Rangers' keeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgow worked far after the ball was returned from Livingston.
Passions were sent back and forth in the Livingston Penalty, while two penalties - after Halkett's challenge to Glenn Middleton, and one by hand - were waved away.
'Female' from Livingston Analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont in Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal struggle and a phenomenal result for Livingston.
Each player played fantastic and still impresses on the curve upwards.
Their playing and player style has hardly changed since they returned to the top class, but much of the thanks for it goes to Holt for the way he has made the shock since he became the coach.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was intense, and organized a defense at military level, while Menga distracted Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall throughout the fight.
Rangers were in contrast not motivated.
Even as good as they've been under Gerrard, they weren't good enough this time.
They didn't play well enough, and cut up the home half once, which should make Rangers realize that they don't get up anymore.
Erdogan gets mixed welcome in Cologne
The governors of Turkey and Germany smiled under blue skies when they met to eat breakfast on Saturday, September 29, in Berlin.
It's the last day of Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany -- which is hoped to repair the relations between the two NATO countries.
Landa has our differences with regard to human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's role in the European Union.
Erdogan went to Cologne to open a large new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
The police prevent a population of over 25 000 from gathering over the mosque because of ‘security reasons’, but many of Erdogan’s supporters met to see their president.
Hundreds of Protestants against Erdogan - many of the Kurdish - also met to condemn Erdogan's policy and the German state's decision to welcome him to the country.
The dulling Protestants reflected the distinction between German Turks, who view Erdogan as a hero, and others who look at him as an autocrat.

The collision nearly crossed at Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a journey in Deptford in southeastern London, at 10:15 a.m.
The driver stopped and ambulance staff arrived quickly, but the man died on the road.
The collision only took her a few months after another hospitalist died, when the leader left Childers Street, about six miles from today's accident.
The London police reported that they are identifying the man and informing his family.
Roads have become connected and buses have to run around the area, while other drivers have been encouraged to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison in England: Six guards damage insurrection
Six prison guards have been injured in an insurrection in a high-security prison for men, says the prison office in England.
Ongoing disorder broke out in the HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire around 09:30 local time on Sunday.
Special "Tornado" forces have been acquired to calm down the rebellion, involving eight prisoners in a secluded part of the prison.
The guards have been treated for minor damage in the ankle.
A prison spokesman said: ‘Special interest guards shall calm down the ongoing rebellion in HMP Long Lartin.
Six guards have been treated for damage.
We do not tolerate power in our prison, and we are clear that those who are responsible will be reported to the police and may have to remain in prison any longer."
There are more than 500 people in HMP Long Lartin, including one of the most dangerous criminals in the United Kingdom.
In June, it was reported that the prison director was treated for injuries, after a prisoner went into action.
And last October, special forces had to come to prison to calm down a serious riot, where prisoners throw billiards at the guards.
The Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with flaum (for the benefit of the drought zone)
Tropical low pressure is rare in Arizona, but there is just such a weather phenomenon that is heading towards Arizona early next week, in the remains of the Hurricane Rosa pulling south-west over the desert and creating fear of flaum.
The national weather service has gone out with flaum warnings on Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona and south- and east-Nevada, south-California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to move directly over Phoenix on Tuesday, and can give rain already late Monday.
The National Weather Service of Phoenix twotra that only «ten tropical cyclonars have had tropical storm or low pressure status within 300 km of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that reached 60 kilometres within the Arizona border.»
The latest models from the national hurricane centre report between 5 and 10 centimeters of rain, with isolated amounts up to 15 centimeters in the Mogollon Rim area in Arizona.
It can count between 2 and 5 centimeters in other areas of the south-west desert, including central parts of Rocky Mountains and Great Basin, with isolated totals up to 10 centimeters.
For areas without flood risk, rain from Rosa may be a glare of drought.
Although flaum is a serious concern, it is likely that this will benefit south-west US areas which are exposed to drought.
According to drought monitors in the United States, there is an extreme drought in over 40 percent of Arizona, the second highest drying category, reports weather.com.
First, the Hurricane Rosa moves across the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
With wind over 135 kilometers per hour, Rosa is 619 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, on Sunday morning, and moves north at a speed of 19 kilometers per hour.
The storm encounters colder water in the Pacific and enjoys it down.
It is expected to reach the coast of Mexico with tropical storm power, Monday afternoon or evening.
Much is going to count in parts of Mexico, which can increase the risk of flooding.
‘Rain between 7 and 15 centimeters is expected from Baja California to north-west Sonora, possibly up to 25 centimeters,’ reported weather.com.
Rosa will pull north along Mexico as a tropical storm before she reaches the boundaries of Arizona early Tuesday morning as a tropical low pressure, which will pull forward through Arizona and into the south-Utah Tuesday night.
‘The greatest danger with Rosa or its remains is much rain in Baja California, north-west Sonora, and the American south-west desert,’ said the National Hurricane Centre.
This figure is expected to create life-threatening flora in desert and mountain ranges.
Action in Midsomer Norton, England: Four arrested for attempted killing
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man are arrested, suspected of killing after a 16-year-old was found knife pieces in Somerset, England.
The teenage good was found to be damaged in the Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton around 04:00 on Saturday.
He was transported to a hospital, and his condition is stable.

The police have encouraged people who may have mobile phone records of what happened, to contact them.
Trump says Kavanaugh 'sad' under the 'smack and sin' democrats were against him
"A word for judgment Kavanaugh is a voice against the relentless and unruly tactics of the Democrats," said Trump during a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh had a «suffer» below the «smack and sine» democrats were through the nomination process.
Kavanaugh witnessed before the Congress on Thursday, and emotionally denied the guilt of Christine Blasey Ford that he assaulted her sexually several decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified about her debts during the hearing.
The president said on Saturday that the "American people got to see how brilliant and brave" Kavanaugh was that day.
"For the record, Kavanaugh is one of the most qualified lawyers in our time, a lawyer with a flawless service in the public," he said to a number of followers in West Virginia.
The president also referred to Kavanaugh's nomination as he talked about the importance of the Republicans in the mid-range.
‘Five weeks to one of the most important choices in our lives.
I don't stand, but I really do,' he said.
‘It’s because I’m traveling around to fight for good candidates.’
Trump argued that the democrats were looking for ‘stand back and block’.
The first important movement in the Senate about the nomination of Kavanaugh is expected to take place by Friday, said a Republican representative of CNN.
Hundreds of deaths in earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia, numbering killers increase
At least 384 people are killed, many of them taken by huge waves on beaches, while a powerful earthquake and a tsunami ramma the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, reported authorities on Sunday.
Hundreds of people were gathered to participate in a festival on the beaches of the city of Palu on Friday when the waves, which were six meters high, hit the beaches at sunset, and took many people while they destroyed everything they came across.
The tsunami came after an earthquake of 7.5.
‘When the tsunami was warned yesterday, there were still people on the beaches that didn’t go once and so they were victims,’ said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the spokesman for the crisis relief agency in Indonesia GDPB, in Jakarta.
'As if the tsunami were enough in itself, he went with himself cars, three tribes, houses; he hit everything on land,' said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami had traveled over the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coast.
Some climbed into three to avoid the tsunami and thus survived.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Photo from the air published by the crisis agency shows many destroyed buildings and shops, twisted and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
The after-sleep continued to hit the coast on Saturday.
The Earthquakes could be marked in the area around, which has a population of 2.4 million.
Indonesia's Technology Testing and Testing Agency (BPPT) stated that the energy from the earthquake on Friday was about 200 times stronger than the energy from the nuclear bomb across Hiroshima during the Second World War.
The geography of the city, which lies at the end of a long, narrow wave, may have increased the size of the tsunami, said the Agency.
Nugroho described the damage as ‘overall’ and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels have collapsed.
The bodies of the dead have been found under the remains of collapsed buildings, he said, and added that 540 people were injured and that 29 are still missing.
Nugroho said that the number of casualties and the size of the destructions can be larger along the coast 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the quake.
'We haven't heard anything from Donggala, communication is cut' said Nugroho.
‘More than 300,000 people are caged there’, said the Red Cross, and added and volunteered to the random areas.
'This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse,' said the Red Cross.
The crisis bureau was criticized on Saturday for not informing that a tsunami had hit Palu, although the authorities said that waves came within the period of notice.
An amateur video shared on social media shows a man on the top floor of a building crying desperately to man down the streets to warn them against the coming wave.
A few minutes later, a wall of water hit the coast, bringing buildings and cars.
Reuters could not verify the video by first.
The tsunami and the tsunami caused power failure and cut the communication around Palu, which made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate the gravitational forces.
The military has started the process of dispatching loading aeroplanes with emergency aid from Jakarta and other cities, reporting authorities, but refugees still need food and other basic needs.
Airports in the city were reopened to receive emergency aid, but will continue to be closed until October.
It was planned that President Joko Widodo should visit the evacuation centre in Palu on Sunday.
The number of deaths in Indonesia exceeds 800.
It's very bad.
They added to the Donggala World Vision have come safely to Palu City, and have set up tent in the backyard of their office. On the way to the city they passed the totally destroyed area, said Doseba.
"They told me they saw many broken houses," he said.
It's very bad.
While the relief organisations are starting to work to help the victims of tsunami, some complain that foreign emergency workers with expertise in crisis management have been refused entry into Palu.
According to Indonesian law, foreign aid organisations and their additions cannot start work until Indonesia has declared that the area is a national crisis zone.
It has not yet happened.
‘There is a provincial crisis’ said Aulia Arriani, a spokesperson for the Red Cross in Indonesia.
‘When the state says ‘OK, this is a national crisis,’ we can open up to international emergency services, but they have not yet updated their status.’
There is evening again in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, and friends and families of those who are still missing still hope for a miracle, but know that such natural disasters do not end well.
On Saturday, a little boy was scared from the sewer.
On Sunday, a woman was frightened from the remains of a collapsed building, where she had play prisoner next to the dead mother say for two days.
Gendon Subando, the trainer of the Indonesian paragliding team, trained two of them without paragliding from the Asian games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
A man called Mandagi said that some of those who were trapped in the Roa Roa hotel were his students.
"As one with a lot of experience in paragliding, I have an emotional burden to bear," he said.
Gendon said that he desperately sent whatsApp messages to the paragliders from Palu, who had taken part in the local beach festival, after he heard that the Roa hotel had collapsed.
But his messages showed only one gray chin, instead of two blue hooks.
'I think it means that the messages didn't come out,' he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 from a mini bank in Newport, Livee, USA
On Friday, twenty-six hundred and seventy-five stole from a worker in the company Brink's as he was filling up a mini-bank in Newport, Levene, USA, following a press release from the Newport police department.
The employee had just emptied a mini-bank in the entertainment area and was about to deliver more money, said detective Dennis McCarthy in the press release.
While the worker was busy, a man jumped up behind the worker and stole a bag of money to be delivered.
Witnesses observed several suspects while escaping from the scene, according to the press release, but the police could not determine the number of people involved in the raid.
If someone has information about who was involved, they should call the Newport Police on 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes name to Ye
The rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
He declared the name change on Twitter on Saturday, and wrote, "The creation previously known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has had Ye as a nickname for a while, and used the name as the title of his eighth album, which he released in June.
The change of names came just before he was to perform on Saturday Night Live, where he was expected to release his new album Yandhi.
He replaced Ariana Grande on the show after she cancelled because of ‘emotional reasons,’ said the program host.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current artist name, West has previously stated that the word has a religious meaning for him.
"I believe the word "ye" is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means "you," said West earlier this year when he discussed the album title with the radio host Big Boy.
"So I am you, I am us, it is us.
The name has changed from Kanye, which means the only one, to Ye-- to reflect the good we do, the bad we do, our confusion, everything.
The album reflects on who we are."
Kanye is one of several famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs is formerly known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he declared that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who has collaborated with West before, has also changed the writing style of the name with and without hyphens and upper case.
Future president of Mexico promises not to send the military against civilians
The future president of Mexico, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has promised never to send military forces against civilians.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he “should never use the military to oppress the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, the military shot at peaceful demonstrators and killed about 300 people, at a time when left-wing student tubes spread in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly support to students and opening several free universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of access to education have led young people to join criminal gangs.
The United States should double investment in artificial intelligence
Since China works more actively with artificial intelligence, the US should double its investments in research on the subject, says the investor and user of artificial intelligence, Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
His comments came after various parts of the U.S. government spoke of artificial intelligence, although the United States lacks a formal strategy for the use of artificial intelligence.
In the meantime, China introduced its plan last year and aims to be number 1 in artificial intelligence innovation before 2030.
"The doubling of the budget for artificial intelligence research would be a good start, as all other countries are so far behind the United States, and we are looking for the next breakthrough in artificial intelligence," said Lee.
A doubling of funding can double the chances of the next major breakthrough in artificial intelligence in the United States," said Lee to CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, who published the book ‘AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order’ this month through the publishing house Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is Managing Director (CEO) of Sinovation Ventures, who has invested in one of the largest companies of artificial intelligence in China, Face++.
In the 1980s he worked at Carnegie Mellon University with a system of artificial intelligence that beat the highest ranking player of the game Othello, and later worked as a leader in Microsoft Research and was president of Google in China.
Lee recognizes previous technology competitions organized by the U.S. state, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked how time the next competition should be, so that he is with and identify the next visionaries.
Researchers in the United States usually have to work hard to get support from the state, said Lee.
‘It’s not China that takes the academic leaders, it’s the big companies,’ said Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have rented excellent university students to work with artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy can also help the United States to strengthen research on artificial intelligence.
"I thought that before artificial intelligence, doctoral students should be automatically given a residence permit," he said.
The Chinese Government published its plan for the next generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
China’s National Science Association finances students at academic institutions, not unlike the American National Science Association and other state organizations, its way of distributing money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, said Lee.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defence established a joint centre of artificial intelligence, which is intended to involve partners from industry and academia, and the White House declared the formation of an artificial intelligence committee.
This month, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI (artificial intelligence) Next.
The National Science Association invests more than $100 million a year in research on artificial intelligence.
At the same time, no one has worked with the proposals on national security and artificial intelligence in several months.
Macedonians vote in public resolution to change the country's name
The Macedonian people voiced on Sunday in a referendum whether they should rename the Republic of Northern Macedonia in order to resolve a decades-old conflict with Greece, which has tried to prevent Macedonia from becoming a member of the EU and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, insists that the name of its neighbouring country in the north represents a claim on their territory and has used veto to vote against membership of Macedonia in NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the new proposed name, but nationalist opponents argue that the name exchange can undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority of the population in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that he should not speak out in disarming, and a boycott has sown doubts as to how far people are going to reach at least 50 percent of the population she needs to be valid.
The question on the People's Liberation Seat is, ‘Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership and are you in agreement with Greece?’
Name change support players, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the price of the name change is worth membership of the EU and NATO. Macedonia is one of the countries that achieved independence after the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I am here today to speak for the future of this country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the EU, because it means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although not binding under the law, a sufficient number of Members of Parliament have said that they will follow the outcome of the vote in order to make her ruling.
In order for the name change to take place, Parliament needs two thirds to be closed down.
The State Election Committee reported that nothing unusual had happened before 13:00.
Only 16 percent had voiced, unlike 34 percent in previous parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 of all registered voters voiced.
"I speak to my children, we belong to Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, an elected representative in the capital, Skopje.
Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voiced in Strumika in the People's Liberation in Macedonia for whether to change their name and open to join NATO and the EU on 30 September 2018.
Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, organized a boycott of the disembarkation in front of Parliament in Skopje, by setting up tents and chairs.
‘We are for NATO and the EU, but we are not to change the name of our country,’ said Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want us under the name of Macedonia, we can go to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of the Eurasian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev has said that membership of NATO will attract investors to Macedonia, which has more than 20 per cent unemployed.
‘I believe that the majority will vote in favour of the change, of which 80 percent of our citizens will join the EU and NATO,’ said Zaev after hearing.
He said that a yes result can be interpreted as a ‘confirmation of our future’.
A poll last Monday of Macedonia’s Policy Research Institute showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will participate in the public dislocation – something in the required number.
Another estimation of the Telma TV channel in Macedonia showed that 57 percent of the voters plan to voice on Sunday.
Of these, the channel said 70 percent was going to vote yes.
In order for the public release to close down, at least 50 percent must be voiced, plus one voiced.
If people's disembarkation is not closed, it could damage the policy of the left-wing government that took over in May.
See: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero navigates through Brighton Defense and Scorar
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling wrecked the Brighton defense that led to 2-0 win for Manchester City on Saturday in Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy, as he scoraded for 65 minutes.
The Argentinian peak took a midway pass at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran past three Brighton defense players and reached an open path.
Suddenly, Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He got around one defender, before running past several others on the edge of the Brighton Penalty.
He got past a passport on the left and found Sterling.
The English point used its first kick in the field to give the ball back to Aguero, who used the right foot to hit the Brighton keeper Mathew Ryan with a shot straight into the right end of the target.
“Aguero wear still with the feet,” said the City Trainer Pep Guardiola to reporter.
‘We’re talking about that he could play 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scoraded when he did."
But it was Sterling who gave them the sky blue the first advantage of the Premier League game.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero took the ball deep inside the Brighton Territory.
He kicked the ball in a beautiful way along the left end of the path to Leroy Sane.
Sane held the ball while he led Sterling towards the goal.
The sky blue point kicked the ball into the goal right before he slipped out of the path.
City to play against Hoffenheim in the Champions League Group phase at 12:55 on Tuesday in the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play Spoilers against Rockies in American baseball
With Nationals eliminated from playoff content, there was no reason to force a new start.
Scherzer has high competitive instincts, and hopes to take the “moon” on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if it can lead to “playoff” for Rockies, who lead with one game over Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West.
Rockie's water at least 5-2 against National Friday night, but looks forward to locking down the first division title.
"Even if we don't play for something, it's worth playing because of the atmosphere here in Denver, with the audience and the other layer that most likely plays at the highest level this far this year.
Who does not want to play with such relationships?’
It is still uncertain who is going to start in the Nationals on Sunday, but Scherzer may want to ‘pitche’.
Scherzer, who in that case starts for the 34th time, will throw a "bullpen session" on Thursday and will "pitche" normally on Sunday.
Scherzer, who comes from Washington, is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 stringouts in 220 2/3"innings" this season.
Trump collects selectors in West Virginia
The president, in an obscure way, referred to his first election for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while he spoke about the importance of the Republican voting in the U.S. media.
‘Everything we have done so far is at stake in November.
We're five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our lives.
This is one of the big, big -- I don't stand, but I run around everywhere to fight for the best candidates," he said.
Trump kept going, "You can see this terrible, terrible group of democrats, you can see that it's happening right now.
And they're overestimated that they're definitely going to take back power, you see how bad they are, how bad they are.
They don't care who hurts, who they must run over to take power and control, that's what they want, power and control, we won't give it to them."
Democrats, he said, are on a mission to ‘revert and block’.
‘And you can see it based on the last four days,’ he said, calling the democrats ‘not bad and ugly and dishonest’.
He referred to the senator and democrat Diane Feinstein, who got his audience to bow.
"Do you remember her answer?
Was it you playing documents?
Uh, uh, what?
No, no, I'm waiting--it was really bad body language--the worst body language I've seen."
Labour is no longer tolerant.
They're intolerant to those who say what they mean.
When Momentum activists in my local party voiced to censor me, it was not surprising.
I'm the last in a series of Labour MPs that's been told I'm not welcome, just to tell you what I mean.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated in the same way because she protested against anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized for being incompatible with Jeremy Corbyn.
When it came to the importance of running responsible economics, national security, Europe, and other such themes as Jeremy ironically disagreed with previous leaders.
In the convocation to the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday, it said ‘we want to meet inclusive and productive’.
In the last eight years my Labour MP has had Friday meetings being just like that.
Unfortunately, today's meeting was not like this, and the promise of a "faster" policy has long been forgotten if it was followed at all.
It has become increasingly clear that different views are not tolerated in Labour, and that each opinion is judged by the leaders of the party.
This happened shortly after Jeremy became a party leader, when colleagues I used to agree with all of a sudden expect me to change my mind and agree on matters I would never agree on - whether it was national security or the internal market in the European Union.
When I speak publicly, there's nothing to say about what I'm saying, I'm always told about social media and people want me to go off while they criticise central politics and say I shouldn't be a member of the Labour Party.
And that's not just my experience.
I know that I am happier than some of my colleagues, because the comments against me are at least political.
I admire my colleagues who get the sexual discrimination and racist schikas targeting themselves every day, and who are still professional and do not go off.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this time period is how normal it has become to harass politicians.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour game should become more tolerant.
In fact, we're no longer a tolerant party that has something for everyone. Every mistrust proposal and every change in the rules of the parties, the party becomes narrower and narrower.
I have received a lot of advice in the last two years from people who have said I have to take it easy and not be so loud, so maybe people will "like me better."
But that's not why I chose to join in politics.
When I joined Labour, when I was still in school 32 years ago, it was because I was mad at thatcher and how the government failed the country. My classroom was falling apart, so I wanted better public services for those who need them most - if it was like local councillor or government minister.
I have never hidden my political meaning, nor in the previous elections.
No one in Nottingham East might have been in doubt about what I stand for and who of the current leaders I do not agree with.
To those who vote for the proposal on Friday, I can only say that when the country is heading towards a Brexit that will harm private, local businesses and public services, I don't understand why people care about throwing away energy asking questions about my loyalty to the Labour party leader.
But in fact, I'm not the only message I've addressed to Nottingham Momentum, but to the voters in the Valkrins, whether they're Labour voters or not: I'm proud to peek you, and I promise that no one can make me go off or change my policy and prevent me from gnawing down the way I believe is best for you all.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Invincible Ayr goes to the top of Scottish rugby
Two seine 'tries' may change the result a little, but there is no doubt that Ayr kept on winning in this very entertaining Tennent's Premiership match today.
They're now at the top of the pallet that's the only invincible piece of a total of ten.
It was their sovereign defense and ability to take chances that gave them the home team and coach, Peter Murchie, good reason to be sober.
"We've been tested in the last matches, and we're still invincible, so I have to be sober," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said, "Ayr fortens rose, they were better than us to take chances."
Grant Anderson had a ‘try’ for 14 minutes, where Frazier Climo tried a ‘conversion’ that put Ayr in front, but a yellow card from the Captain Rory Hughes of Scotland from Warriors Lot Melrose gathered, and Jason Baggot took an ‘unconverted try’.
Climo got a punishment just before the break, he scora and 'converted' a 'solo try' to give Ayr 17-5 before the break.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's "try," which was "converted" by Baggot, reduced the ringing mouth by five points.
There was a long break when Ruaridh Knott was seriously injured and laid on a stretch, and from the reboot Ayr passed forward through a ‘try’ from Stafford McDowall, as Climo ‘converted’.
The working captain of Ayr, Blair MacPherson, got a yellow card, and again Melrose tried an unconverted Bruce Colvine try, at the end of a series of aggressive games.
The home team played back, and then Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card to tackle Climo without the ball from the sentence line, scora MacPherson a ‘try’.
Climo «converted» again after Kyle Rowe took David Armstrong's box kick and sent Gregor Henry away from his fifth «try».
The stars from the Scottish series, Still Game, start a new career in the restaurant industry
The Scottish Still Game star, Ford Kieran, seems ready for a new career in the restaurant industry, after it was discovered that he is the director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC program, which he writes and plays together with the partner Greg Hemphil.
The duo has announced that the coming ninth season is going to be the last, and it seems as if Kluhren is planning life after Craiglang.
According to official lists, he is the director of Aktridmorn Limited.
The shooter will not comment on the matter, but a source from the avis Scottish Sun has suggested that Kühr would be involved in the “successful restaurant industry” in Glasgow.
«The sea is ours»: Bolivia hopes the court will open a waterway to the Pacific Ocean
Sailors patrol the Marine Headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings flags with sea blue flags.
The marine bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazonaselva are covered with the motto, "The sea is ours.
and an obligation to return to it.»
In landlocked Bolivia, the people can still remember a coastline of the country lost to Chile, in a bloody conflict about resources in the 1800s.
This hope may be stronger than in many decades, while Bolivia awaits the judgment of the International Court of Justice to come on 1 October, after five years of deliberation.
«Bolivia has drive, serenity and is ahead of her, and, of course, expects a positive result," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians come to look at the verdict of the International Court of Justice, hoping that the court of The Hague will support Bolivia’s claim, and that, after decades of negotiations, Chile will provide Bolivia with a self-sustaining exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic native president of Bolivia - who strives to be elected again next year - has good reason to hope for a positive result.
«Now we will soon be returned to the Pacific," he promised late in August.
But some analysts don't think the court's going to allow Bolivia access to the sea -- and that little would have changed themselves if they got access.
The Netherlands-based UN Court of Justice has no power to transfer Chilean territory to Bolivia and has determined that they will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the court's judgment comes only six months after the last hearing indicates that the case was 'not complicated', said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
For the last four years, far from bringing up Bolivia's cause, they've done the opposite.
‘The problem of access to the sea has been taken over by the current Bolivian administration,’ said Zárate.
Morales, with his contentious rhetoric, has killed what was that of Chile's goodwill, Zárate meant.
Bolivia and Chile will at some point continue the negotiations, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss the issue afterwards.
Ambassadors have not been exchanged since 1962.
The former president, Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, who is Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was unusually swift.
On Monday, Bolivia will have a ‘excellent opportunity to open new relations with Chile’ and a chance to ‘put a line at 139 years of inconsistency and rather benefit both,’ he said.
Calzadilla also rejected that Morales, which is still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, used this maritime issue to win voices.
‘Bolivia will never give up the right of access to the Pacific;’ he added.
"The judgment is a possibility to see what we need to do to forget the past."
North Korea says they won't abolish nuclear weapons if they can't trust the United States
The North Korean Foreign Minister, Ri Yong Ho, says that his nation can't be the first to abolish if they can't trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
He encouraged the United States to follow up on the rise they gave during the Singapore meeting between the American and North Korean leaders.
Ri's comments come at a time when U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pomepo, seems to want to start with his locked-in nuclear weapons diplomacy, more than three months after the Singapore meeting with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Un.
Ri says the United States has a false hope that North Korea will subdue itself if the United States persists in sanctions and opposes any statement of the end of the Korean war.
Washington refuses to agree to any statement of the end of the war, without Pyongyang removing first.
Both Kim and the U.S. president, Donald Trump, will hold a new meeting.
But many are critical of the seriousness of Pyongyang when it comes to degradation and that the country most likely sees its weapons as a guarantee of security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to lead the second Kim-Trump meeting.
Paris shows that massive headgear is the last fashion on the way to a handy near you
If you want to upgrade your hat collection or block the sun completely, you no longer need to search.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne have revealed a number of large and special main pieces in their SS19 collection.
The highest impractical hats can be seen on Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their shocking creations right on the catwalk.
The most magnificent garment was an elaborate, beige Valentino hat with a feather-like, brim that covered the models' heads.
There were also other oversized additions during the fashion show, including a jewel-prized watermelon, a trollman hat, and even a pineapple - but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a collection of bizarre masks - just in time before Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had lips that were sewn together and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One of the creations is similar to diving equipment, complete with snorkel and mask, while another looks like a melted ice in biscuits.
If you like this enormously dramatic fashion, you can just slip.
The fashion experts find that the huge hats come for the hall in a handy near you.
The over-dimensioned hats come right after the La Bomba, the straw hat with the 60 centimetre wide flame that has been seen on acquaintances from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind the highest impractical hat, which was everywhere on social media, has now sent out a new creation on the catwalk - a straw beach bag of the same size as the bikini-dressed model that carried her.
Strandveska, with color of burnt orange and frowning top with a white skin handle, was the most eye-catching part of Jacquemus's La Riviera SS19 collection under fashionveka in Paris.
“I expect to see big hats and beach bags in the fashion shops the next summer – the designer has made such a big impression that I doubt it is possible to ignore the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Global Citizens Need Language Knowledge
Private schools in Scotland are known to be at a high academic level, and this continues in 2018 with excellent examination results, which are only enhanced by individual and common success in sports, art, music and other social activities.
With over 30 000 students in all of Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Board of Independent Schools (SCIS), are working to provide the best services to students and their parents.
Self-reliant schools aim to lead their students to higher education, career paths and the role of global citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a tailor-made curriculum, we see that modern languages are popular choices in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, the message goes to his head.
If thou speak with him in his own language, go to his heart.
This is an important reminder that we can't only borrow in English when we want to build relationships and trust in people from other countries.
By looking at the exam results from this year, we can see that languages are at the top of the league tables with the highest characteristics of self-contained scales.
A total of 68 percent of the students who took foreign languages got A.
The data collected from SCI's 74 member schools shows that 72 percent of students received A in mandarin, while 72 percent of those who took German, 69 percent of those who took French, and 63 percent of those who took Spanish also got A.
This shows that self-rescue in Scotland supports foreign languages as vital properties, which children and young people will certainly need in the future.
Language as an evaluator is considered equivalent to STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the syllabus of independent schools and other places.
An investigation carried out by the UK Add & Properties Selection in 2014 showed that 17 per cent of employers struggled to fill settings due to the lack of language skills of the applicants.
It is therefore increasingly important for languages in the school to guide young people into working life.
With more job opportunities for linguists, these properties are essential in a globalized value.
Whatever kind of career a youth chooses, if they have learned a different language, they have a proper advantage in the future with such a property.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically give a multilingual person advantages in a competitive value.
According to a YouGov investigation of more than 4,000 adults in 2013, 75 percent could not speak any languages other than English well enough to keep a conversation going, and French was the only language that was spoken by a two-digit percentage, 15 percent.
This is why it is so important to invest in language training for our children.
Being able to use several languages, especially the languages used in developing countries, can give children a better chance of finding good jobs in the future.
In Scotland, each school is different when it comes to the language in which they teach.
Many schools focus on the classical modern languages, while others teach in languages classified as important in the United Kingdom when we look forward to 2020, as for example mandarin and Japanese.
Whatever your child is interested in, there will always be a lot of languages to choose from in self-employed schools, and teachers who are specialists in this area.
Scottish self-contained schools are dedicated and want to create a learning environment that will guide children and give them the properties they need to close, no matter what future outcomes.
One cannot refuse that in this global, business-oriented environment, languages are vital to the future of the country, so this needs to be reflected in the education sector.
Modern languages should be referred to as ‘international communication properties’.
Self-employed schools will continue to offer this choice, offering shortages and a high level of competence for Scotland's young people.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

LeBron debuts in Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
Waitetida is soon across from fans looking to see LeBron James debuters at the Los Angeles Lakers basketball team.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James is going to play in the pre-season game on Sunday, against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how long he's been playing hasn't been determined yet.
‘It will be more than one minute and less than 49,’ Walton published on Lakers’ official website.
The Lakers reporter, Mike Trudell, tweet that James most likely will play for a limited time.
After practice this week, James was asked about his plans for Lakers' schedule for the preseason.
"I don't need leading-time games at this stage of my career to get me ready," he said.
Trump's West Virginia Rally Time, YouTube
President Donald Trump starts on a whirlwind of campaigns tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
That's the first of Trump's five planned stop the coming week, including stopping in friendly places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmatory vote pending to choose to fill the Court's vacant post, Trump intends to build support for the upcoming mid-points since the Republicans are in danger of losing control of the Congress when voting is due in November.
How time should Trump be in West Virginia tonight, and how can you view it online?
Trump's meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 19:00 in the evening, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can see Trump's West Virginia collection online below, via live stream on YouTube.
Trump will probably take up this week's hearings of Supreme Court-nominated Brett Kavanaugh, who became excited about the guilt of sexual abuse, with an expected confirmatory voice from the Senate waiting for a week while the FBI investigates.
But the primary goal of this jacket of collections is to help the Republicans meet the November elections and get some momentum (drive).
This is how President Trump’s campaign says that these five collections in the next week are directed towards ‘encouraging volunteers and followers who the Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority of them in the Senate and the House of Representatives’, according to Reuters.
‘The control of the congress is so critical of his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible when we enter the busy campaign season,’ said one Trump campaign spokesman who refused to be informed to Reuters.
Planned for Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the collection for the evening can bring support from «Ohio and Pennsylvania and withdraw coverage from Pittsburgh media», according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state he won with more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is in demand in the polls.
'It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president must come and try to give him a raise in the polls,' said Simon Haeder, a political researcher at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows belly for battle to keep hope alive on singles on Sunday
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday afternoon's foursomes could only be what this Ryder Cup had to do.
The swinging pendulum of the moment is an entirely invented sports game, but one that players really trust, and never more than on competitors like these.
So where would they say that momentum is now?
"They had a six-point rental, and now it's four, so we take it as a little moment, I guess," said Jordan Spieth as he strolled off the day before.
Europe has the advantage, of course, four points lead to twelve more in games.
The Americans, as Spieth says, know they have a little wind in their sails, and they have a lot to encourage, not least shape to Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day, and each has three points from four.
Spieth has been mortal from tea to green and rents by example.
The guttural screams of the celebration were higher as his round continued, looking for an important putt to take match four all-squao.re when he and Thomas had been down two after two.
His well that won the game at 15, was met with a similar scream, the type that tells you he thinks the American team isn't out of it.
"You've only got to dig deeply and worry about your own fight," said Spieh.
There are all these players left now.
18 holes to create an emblem.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the invincible history of Ryder Cup.
Europe's strange, but cute couple are four from four and can't do anything wrong.
«Moliwood» was the only couple that would not shoot a booky on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nine (the last nine holes on a track with 18 holes) on Friday morning.
That race, and the way their energy seems to float both to and from this noisy, enthusiast audience, concedes that they're the players to hit on Sunday, and there wouldn't be any more popular players to seal a potential European saying when the sun goes down over Le Golf National, than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
Talk about European honours will be too early.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson did short work by Sergio Garcia, the morning four-ball hero, when he was the couple with Alex Noren.
A bowey and two doubles on the first nine, the rough Spaniard and the Swedish into a hole they never got near to climbing out of.
But on Sunday no one can help you out of your hole.
The fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to look at closely because of the interaction between opponents, the advice they give, and the advice they don't give and the way a strategy can change on an eye flash.
Europe has played better as a team so far and takes a significant lead in the last day, but this foursome session also showed that Team USA has the stomach for the fight that someone, especially Stateside, had doubted.
Europe takes the 10-6 lead in Ryder Cup final
Europe will have a healthy advantage in the last day of the Ryder Cup after coming out of Saturday's four-balls and foursome games with a 10-6 rental over the United States.
Inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two victories over a great Tiger Woods to take their fight so far at Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European side offered to keep the trophy they lost on Hazeltine two years ago, dominated a misguided American side tomorrow's fourballs, and took the series 3-1.
USA added more resistance in foursomes and won two battles, but they could not get in the underbody.
Jim Fury's page needs eight points from the 12 single matches on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row while he and Molinari, called 'Molliwood' after an eye-catching weekend, is only the second pair to win four points from their opening in four matches in Ryder Cup history.
After breaking Woods and Patrick Reed in fourballs, they looked so great to beat an exorcist Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with an even more coveted 5 and 4.
Woods, who roamed through two games on Saturday, showed sporadic brilliance, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in four-balls and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who lingered for the morning's fourballs, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in foursomes to a 2 and 1 defeat by Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - ranked one and three in the world.
Europe still didn't get everything they wanted on a pleasant, windy day south-west of Paris.
Three times big wins Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the reference to Americans with two points on Saturday.
They won a brave 2 & 1 says about Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourballs and came back later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 & 3 in foursomes when they had lost the two holes in the opening.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history, a layer has returned from a four-point layer and entered single, although as a holder, the Fury's page only needs to draw to keep the trophy.
After being the second best for two days, it still looks as if a Sunday campaign would be outside of them.
North Korea says it won't be worth trying to rust down one-sided without trust
North Korea's Foreign Minister told the United Nations on Saturday that if sanctions continue to increase the mistrust of the United States, and that the country would in no way give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the Annual General Assembly of the World Power that North Korea had done “significant measures” to improve the relationship in the last year, for example, they have stopped nuclear and missile tests, dismantled the nuclear test site and promise not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we don't get anything corresponding back from the United States," he said.
‘Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances it is not possible that we will disarm unilaterally first.’
While Ri, a well-known North Korean, has made several complaints about Washington's resistance to a ‘phasa’ approach to the abolition of nuclear weapons, where North Korea would be paid to take gradual steps, his dissidents proved significant in that he did not reject unilateral nuclear degradation, as Pyongyang has done before.
Ri referred to a joint statement published by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a first summit ever between a sitting American president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim promised to work for ‘reducing nuclear power on the Korean peninsula’, while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea’s security.
North Korea has wanted a formal end to the Korea War from 1950-53, but the United States has said Pyongyang must first give up his nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted conversations to facilitate tough international sanctions in North Korea.
"The United States insists on "reduction of nuclear power first" and increases the pressure with sanctions to achieve its purpose by coercion, and they oppose even the "Declaration of peace", said Ri.
"The belief that sanctions can break us is a false hope among those who are not interested in us.
But the problem is that when the sanctions continue, our distrust will only be greater."
There is nothing about the plans for a new summit between Kim and Trump, as the U.S. president stated earlier this week in the United Nations.
Instead, the minister wrestled three meetings between Kim and South Korea's leaders, Moon Jae-in, the last five months and added: "If the party in this appeal to the decommissioning of nuclear weapons was South Korea, and not the United States, the decline in the Korean peninsula would not have stopped as it has now done"
Nevertheless, the tone of Ri's speech was dramatically different from last year, when he told the general assembly in F.N. that it was not possible to stop North Korean rockets against the US mainland, after President Trump called Kim a rocketman on suicide missions.
Trump, who last year threatened to "total destruction" North Korea, ousted up Kim for his courage to take steps to disarm, but said that much work still had to be done and that sanctions had to remain in place to North Korea to disarm his nuclear weapon.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn't have a time frame for this, and said, "If it takes two years, three years, or five months, doesn't matter."
China and Russia claim that F.N. Security Council should pay Pyongyang for the actions that are being taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, told F.N.’s Board of Security on Thursday: ‘The sanctions for the Security Council must remain strong and without failing until we get the complete, final, verified liquidation of the nuclear weapons.’
The Swedish Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to scrape funds into Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile program.
Pompeo met Ri on the sideline of the F.N. General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare a new summit meeting.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times already this year, but his last trip didn't go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said that progress had been made, but few hours later he condemns North Korea to come up with ‘gangster-like demands’.
North Korea promised in a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle a missile site and also an atomic complex if the United States ‘appropriate measure’.
He said that Kim had told him that the "corresponding measures" he applied for were security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore, and stepped against normalizing the relationship with Washington.
Harvard students take courses in getting enough sleep
A new course at Harvard University has this year helped all the students get more sleep, trying to fight against the growing macho culture that goes out to study in caffeine all night. That is, one uses caffeine to stay up all night to study.
An academic found that high-level students often carelessly when it comes to the most basic -- how to take care of yourself.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed the course, which he thinks is the first of his battle in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after talking about the effect of lack of sleep on learning.
‘At the end of it, a girl came up to me and said, ‘Why am I being told this now, in growing age?’
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleeping--what surprised me, he said to The Telegraph.
The course, rolled out for the first time this year, explains what is important for how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, as well as enhance their general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and managing director of the health services at the university, said that the university decided to introduce the course after the students had a serious sleep disorder during the week.
The hour-long course contains a number of interactive tasks.
In one section there is an image of a dorm, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, coaches and books to be told about the effect of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by lack of sleep, and how important it is with evening routines.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of campus, with interactive icons, prompts participants to think about their daily routines.
'We know it won't change the behavior of students right away.
But we think they have the right to know-- just like you have the right to know, the health effects by choosing to smoke cigarettes, added Prof. Czeisler.
The culture of pride of dawning still exists, he said and added that modern technology and increasing pressure on students mean that lack of sleep is an increasing problem.
The assurance that you get enough sleep, of good quality, should be the student's secret weapon against stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said -- even to avoid getting up to weight, because lack of sleep puts the brain in swallowing mode and makes them constant soles.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old from California who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler develop the course, after having been a student with him last year, his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course had opened his eye and inspired him to press on to get a course for the whole campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all doctoral students to complete a similar study program before they start the prestigious institution.
Prof. Czeisler recommended that students consider setting an alarm when going to bed, and besides when waking up, and be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" coming from electronic screens and LED lighting, which can convert the internal clock completely, leading to problems in sleeping.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga targets give Gerrard's men a ride down
Rangers went on a new defeat along the way when Dolly Menga's post sent Steven Gerrard's outbound page to a 1-0 loss on Livingston.
The Ibrox page was looking out after taking its first story away since the 4-1st Triumph of St Johnstone in February, but made for Gary Holt springtime only Gerrard's second defeat at 18 matches as leader, and gave eight points, a round under the Ladbrokes leadership of the Premier League, Hearts.
Menga beat up to seven minutes before half-time, and a ranger layout with a lack of inspiration never seemed to be supposed to resemble.
While Rangers now fall down to the sixth place, Livingston climbs to the third and is just behind the Hibernian on the goal difference.
And there may be additional problems in stock for Rangers after the lineman Calum Spence had to deal with a wound in his head, after an object was apparently thrown from the other side.
Gerrard made eight changes to the layer as feia Ayr entered Betfred Cup semifinalane.
Holt, on the other hand, went with Livy 11 who took a point with a dream shot last week, and he would have been excited about the way that the fielder attracted his choker took the roof of his opponents on each shift.
Rangers might have had the ball the most, but Livingston did more with the ball they had.
They should have scora after only two minutes when Menga's first post sent Scott Pittman over to Allan McGregor's goal, but the midwayer failed in his combat.
A long free park from Keaghan Jacobs found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner, Alan Lithgow, could only shoot far on the retreat.
Rangers took control, but it seemed to be more hope than the threat to their game in the last third round.
Alfredo Morello's knowledge certainly meant that he would have punished the 20-foot mark when he and Steven Lawless collided, but Steven Thomson waved away the desire for the Colombian.
Rangers were able to target only two shots in the first half, but formerly Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was hardly concerned by Lassana Coulibaly's headar and a tame shot from Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi's opening at the 34th minute may have been against the player's eye, no one can deny that they only used it because of the "shot".
Once again, Rangers failed in handling a deep death ball from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher beat the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept himself fun to pick out Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard took the break as if he replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and replaced the spring break an immediate effect when the winger created a hatch for Morelos, but the impressive Kelly rushed forward to block.
But Livingstone continues to outsmart the guest team to play exactly the game they liked, with Lithgow and Halkett sending forward long shots on long shots.
Holt's teams could have increased the rental saying at the end, but McGregor liked to prevent Jacobs in it, until Lithgrow left a long post from the corner marker.
The reserve for Ranger, Glenn Middleton, had a new claim on punishment when he supported along with Jacobs, but again Thomson overlooked it.
Almanac: Geiger counter inventor
And now a page from our Sunday Morning Almanac: 30 September 1882, 136 years ago today, and WE REKNAR ... the day that he was going to become physicist Johannes Wilhelm «Hans» Geiger, was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as the Geiger teller.
As a scientific carrier since then, the Geiger counter was also a bearer in pop culture, as in the 1950 'Bells of Coronado' film, with seemingly improbable late cowboy researchers Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What in the world is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, it can be used to find radioactive minerals, for example uranium.
When you turn on these earphones, you can actually hear the effects of the radioactive effects of the atoms that come from the mineral radioactivity.’
Evans: 'Yes, no, it's coming!'
"His" Geiger died in 1945, only a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the invention that calls his name lives on.

A sample vaccine shows promising results in patients with a range of cancers.
A woman treated with vaccine, who taught the immune system to recognize red cells, found that the ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, changing them in the laboratory, so that they can “see” a protein common to many cancers, called HER2, and then reinjecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said, "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 ‘ drives the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, pulmonary and colorectal cancer, Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to extract immune cells from patients and ‘learn’ them how they target cancer cells has worked by treating a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West is offering a Pro-Trump-diatribe, wearing a MAGA-lue, after he's hosted the TV show Saturday Night Live.
It didn't go so well.
Kanye West was outping in the studio during Saturday Night Live after an amazing achievement in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump, and said he would set to election in 2020.
After taking his third song for the evening, called Ghost Town, where he was wearing a Make America Great-caps, he gave the democrats a tiger and repeated his support to Trump.
"How many times do I talk to a white person, and they say, "How could you like Trump, he's racist?"
Well, if I was concerned about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago, he said.
SNL launches the show with a number together with comicist Matt Damon, where Hollywood's star fooled Brett Kavanaugh's testimony in the Senate's court election on the guilt of sexual assault from Christine Blasey Ford.
Even if it was not sent, the recording to West's tirad was uploaded to the social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock tried to mock West with the article.
The West also complained to the audience that he had the difficult backstage because of his headgear.
‘They bullied me behind the stage.
They said, don't go out there with that hat on.
They bully me!
And then they say I'm in a submerged place," he said, according to Washington Examinor.
West continued: 'Do you want to see the submerged space?' said he would 'put on the superman caps, because this means you can't tell me what to do. Would you like the world to go forward?
Try to love.’
His comments led to ebbing at least twice from the audience, and SNL cast members seemed embarrassedly concerned, reported Variety, with a person there who told the publication: “The whole studio was dead still.”
West was picked up as a late replacement for the song Ariana Grande, when her former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days ago.
West confused many with a performance of the song I Love it, dressed like a Perrier bottle.
West received support from the head of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner as twitter: «To one of the most brave spirits: TAKE FOR YOU TO OPEN WITH THE PØBEL.»
But talkshow-vertinna Karen Hunter twitterra that West «likely was just like him and it's absolutely amazing.»
‘But I did NOT choose to pay anyone (by buying his music or clothing or by supporting his ‘art’) whom I fear embraces and ask for ideology that is harmful to my society.
He's free.
We are, too,’ she added.
Before the show, the rapper on Twitter announced that he had changed his name and said that he was now ‘formerly known as Kanye West’.
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Medrappar, Snoop Dogg has been named Snoop Lion and, of course, the last musical legend Prince, changed the name to a symbol and then the artist who was formerly known as Prince.

Game of Thrones Star Kit Harington goes against toxic masculineity
Kit Harington is familiar with the swordswing role of saying as Jon Snow in HBO's elective medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the shooter, 31, has gone out against the macho hero stereotype, saying that such roles on the screen often lead to young boys feeling that they have to be tough to be respected.
In conversation with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that he thinks something has gone wrong and asked how to tackle the problem of toxic masculineity in the #MeToo age.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones co-player Rose Leslie, also admitted 31, that he knows "very strong" to deal with the problem.
"Personally, I'm convinced that something has gone wrong with masculineity." he said.
‘What have we taught men when they grow up, when this is the problem we see now?’
Kit suggests that TV is partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculineity due to very human characteristics.
He continues: 'What is innate and what is taught?'
What's learned on TV and in the streets, what makes young boys feel like they have to be this special side of being a man?
I think it's really one of the big questions in our time-- how do we change it?
For it is clear that something has gone wrong for young men.'
In the interview he also admitted that he would not make Game of Thrones precursors or sequences when the series ends in summer and says he is ‘complete with battlefields and horses’.
From November, Kit will play in a new recording of Sam Shepard's True West, which is the story of a movie producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The shooter recently revealed that he is looking at the meeting with his wife, Rose, to be the best that came out of the Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in this show, so that way it gave me my future family and my life further," he said.
Rose played Ygrette, the decorator of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family property in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, says health supplement.
About 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the new cases were transferred through sex, and marked a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly through some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who had HIV in this way was reduced to almost zero, said Chinese health professionals at a conference in the Yunnan province.
From year to year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT environment.
Homosexuality was decriminalised in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT/HBTQ individuals is claimed to be widespread.
Because of the conservative values in the country, students have counted that 70-90% of men having sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the transfers of disease men come from improper sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicine as part of an attempt to tackle the problem.
Maxine Waters nectar to add paint information from the GOP senator, it explodes in dangerous lies and conspiracy theories.
The United States Rep. Maxine Waers condemned on Saturday claims that a member of her staff had posted personal information about three Republican American senators on the Wikipedia pages of the legislators.
The Los Angeles Democrats claimed that the claims were pedalised by extrem-rightflöh’s searches and web pages.
'Lugner, liar, and more contemptible lies', said Waters in a question on Twitter.
The published information included informational home addresses and phone numbers for the Americans Sens. Lindsey Graham in South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared on Thursday, was sent by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing on the debts of sexual assault against the Supreme Court Board Kavanaugh.
The leak came once after the three senators asked Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Poundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the post was associated with the Waters' office and released the information of a member of the Waters staff, Hill reported.
‘This baseless claim is completely false and an absolute lie,’ continues Waters.
‘One of my additions - who has been compromised by their identity, personal information and security as a result of these unreasonable and false claims - was by no means responsible for the leakage of this information.
This baseless statement is entirely false, and an absolute lie."
The questions to Water quickly got criticism on the web, among others from former press secretary of the White House, Ari Fleischer.
‘This denial is angry’ wrote Fleischer.
'This suggests that she does not have a temper to be a member of the Congress.
When someone gets into debt for something they didn't do, they don't have to be angry.
They don't have to be tough.
They don't have to ask questions about the motivation for the shoulder.
They must be calm and peaceful."
Fleischer proved to compare Water's reaction to the criticism of the democrats of the judges Kavanaugh, who was owed by critics to be apparent for anger during the hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who tries to take over Water's position in the Middle East, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Great if it's true," he tweeted.
In question, Waters said that her office had alerted "the right powers of government and the law enforcement units of these false claims.
“We will ensure that the perpetrators are revealed,” she continues, “and that they will be held legally responsible for all of their actions that are destructive and dangerous for each and one of my employees.”
Johnny English strikes again - spy tull of weak Rowan Atkinson
It's traditional to look for Brexit brands in all new films with a British twist, and it works for this revival of Johnny England's action-comedy spoof franchise - which started back in 2003 with Johnny English and was revived in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will self-ironic satire about how openly we are become the new export potential of the country?
In any case, the great-god, incompetent Johnny English with the rubber arm has for the second time been given his new permission to fuck things up -- his name signals more than anything else that he is a broad comic book for cinema scientists in non-English-speaking countries.
He is, of course, the foolish, secret agent who failed in his bizarre desire to spread some glamour has got a little bit of Clouseau, a dash of Mr. Bean and a portion of the guy who contributes a simple melody to the Firewagons, theme during the Olympic opening ceremony in London 2012.
He is also originally based on the traveling and international mystery man Atkinson once played in the now forgotten Barclaycard TV ads, something that left chaos behind.
There's one or two fine eye flashes in this last JE excursion.
I love Johnny English who approaches a helicopter while he was dressed in a medieval armor suit while the rotor blade beats his helmet.
Atkinson's gift to physical comedy is on the screen, but the humor is quite weak and strangely superfluous, especially since 'serious' film marks such as 007 and Mission Impossible even now safely offer comedy as an ingredient.
The humor felt as if he were targeting children instead of the vaccines, and to me Johnny England's noisy accident is not as inventive and focused as Atkinson's replicon noises in the person in Bean.
The current permanent premise is that the United Kingdom is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated the U.K.'s super-secret web networks of spies, which reveal the identities of all agents in the UK in this area, to the perversion of the agent at work -- a sadly little role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last straw for a prime minister who is a pompous and war hero figure, who already has a complete breakup of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does his very best with this quasi-Theresa-May character, but it's not that much in the script to work with.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that when each active spy has his debt, she must pick up someone who is retired.
And that means that the incompetent Johnny English himself, who works as a teacher of an elegant establishment, but gives unofficial lessons about how to work undercover: a few fine jokes here, since English offers a school of rock-type academy for spying.
English is sent back to Whitehall for a emergency briefing and reunited with his former understanding assistant Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, moving over to a submarine driver's job, an overestimating role where Vicki Pepperdine is a little wasted.
So Batman and Robin's ability to get things to become terrible mad in Hennar Majesty's Secret Services are back for full in the meeting with Olga Kurylenko's beautiful five fatale, Ophelia Bulletova.
In the meantime, the prime minister was dangerously under the spell of the charismatic technology of the billionaire, claiming that he could solve the UK's data problem: the creepy Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin to travel out of farse-like game: dressed as waitresses, set the guys at a fine French restaurant; they create chaos and smuggle on board Volta's pleasure boat; and English triggers pure anarchy as he tries to use a virtual reality headset to make himself familiar with the interior of Volta's house.
All stops are probably pulled out to the last sequence, but as loving and unexploited as it is, there's a lot of baby TV all over the place.
Quite moderate things.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I couldn't help but think: Can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really does justice to his talent?
The Labour Party is refusing to work out a plan for Englishmen to work for a four-day week, but to be paid for five days.
Jeremy Corbyns Labour Party is now considering a radical plan that wants the British to work for a four-day week--but gets paid for five.
According to the report, the party will send further savings made through artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to employees by giving them an extra day off.
Then it would be possible to use a three-day weekend - but still get the same salary.
Sources said the idea would fit with the economic agenda of the party and plans to increase the benefits for workers.
The change to a four-day week has been approved by the Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to benefit from the changed economy.
An older source from Labour told The Sunday Times: A policy message is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
'It does not happen overnight, but a four-day working week is a desire that fits into the approach the party has to balance the economy for the benefit of the worker, as well as superior to the party's industrial strategy.'
The Labour Party would not be the first to approve such an idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day working week in its 2017 election campaign.
The ambition is not, however, acceptable to the whole Labour party.
A Labour spokesperson said, 'One four-day working week is not party policy and it is not considered by the party.'
Shadow chancellor John McDonnell used the last week's work conference to reinforce his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said that he was determined to take power back from 'faceless directors' and 'profits' in rich businesses.
The plans of the shadow chancellor also mean that current shareholders in fixtures can't get back their full effort as a Work Government could do "reduction" because of perceived misbehaviour.
He also has confirmed plans to add 10 per cent of the equity of private sector shareholders and to create Inclusive Ownership Funds (including equity funds) to add 10 per cent of the equity of private sector shareholders, which would receive annual dividends of up to £500, about $5,000.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy, told the television program '60 Minutes' if the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh could change their minds
The FBI investigation of complaints against convictions Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his nomination to Supreme Court for at least one week, and it raises the question of what extent found to the Agency could affect some Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview sent on Sunday, correspondent Scott Pelley in '60 Minutes' asked the Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could discover something that would make them change their mind.
Kennedy seems more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Myself, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said on the way into the earring, I said, I have spoken with Kavanaugh's judges.
I called him after this happened, that statement came out and said, 'Have you done it?'
He was destined to be permanently and intentionally.’
Graham's voice nevertheless seemed to be seen in stone.
"I have made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh, and it would take a dynamite charge to change me," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly dismissed it, "let Graham to, and referred to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And all its names could not verify it.
It's 36 years old.
I don't see anything new."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday is New York's host to the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that has an enormously impressive layout of stars that act and an equally impressive mission; ending poverty in the world.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people flocking to the Central Park's large lawn, not only to enjoy watching Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes act, but also to raise awareness of the true goal of the event of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international support group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting it.
In order to get a free ticket to the event (unless you were willing to pay for a VIP ticket), concert hosts had to complete a number of tasks, or ‘actions’ as voluntary work; email a world leader, call a phone call or other meaningful ways to help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been with 12 years to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of paying people a free concert a real way to persuade people to demand a call for action, or just another case of so-called ‘clickivism’ - people feel that they make a real difference by signing an online appeal or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says that it has registered more than 19 million ‘actions’ from its support players and participated in and pressed for a variety of goals.
It says that these actions have helped world leaders to publish obligations and policies that amount to more than $37 billion, which will affect lives to more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group of 390 obligations and notices arising from their actions, at least $10 billion of which have already been paid or collected.
So far, the group estimates that the Sichera funds have had a direct impact on almost 649 million people around the world.
Some of the most important obligations are The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and employers who are obliged to ‘help children reach their full potential’; promises to give Rwanda 35 million dollars to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4700 tweets from global citizens.
‘With the support of the British Government, donors, national governments and global citizens, just like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history,” - told the ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, the audience during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after taking more than 5000 actions to demand that the United Kingdom improves nutrition for mothers and children, the UK government announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition treatment.
In answer to one of the usual questions on the website, they ask, ‘What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?’
Global citizens replied: "There will be a long and difficult road--some times we will fall and fail.
But as the major civil rights and anti-apartheid movements lead us, we will be happy because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among some of the actors who are taking part in this year's New York event, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furnesss and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Fleet as a block to prevent Russian energysports Secretary.
Washington may ‘if necessary’ resort to its fleet in order to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including in the Middle East, international secretary Ryan Zinke has revealed, as quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's involvement in Syria - especially where they operate at the invitation of the legitimate government - is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
‘I believe that they are in the Middle East because they want to distribute energy, just as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern part of Europe,’ he said.
And according to the official, there are ways and means to tackle it.
"The United States has this potential, with our fleet, to ensure that its waterways are open and, if necessary, blocked to ensure that their energy is not on the market," he said.
Zinke spoke to participants on the event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that presents itself as the energy consumer’s voice in the United States.
He compared Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, and noted that they are actually the same.
‘The economic solution of Iran and Russia is more or less to use and replace fuels,’ he said, referring to Russia as a ‘one-trick pony’ with an economy depending on fossil fuels.
The declarations, as the Trump Administration has been, are on the job of increasing the export of liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, the much cheaper option for European consumers.
In connection with this, officials in Trump administration, including US President Donald Trump, try to persuade Germany to withdraw from the inappropriate Nord Stream 2 tube project, which according to Trump made Berlin the 'capture' of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly underlined that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is set to double the existing pipeline capacity of 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's eager resistance to the project is only driven for economic reasons, and is a example of unfair competition.
‘I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a tool to exert pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers,’ said Russian Minister of Energy Alexander Novak after a meeting with US Secretary of Energy Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. holding company has withdrawn a setback from Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
The German Industrial Leasing Organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has encouraged the US to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
‘I have a big problem when a third country disrupts our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, leader of the German Industrial Federation (BDI) after a recent meeting between German chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren wants to "run hard" to act as Presidential candidate in 2020, says Massachusetts Senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would take a ‘beneficial look’ at being a presidential candidate after the mid-election.
During a Council meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider asking as a candidate.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our stupid government, and it includes a woman on top," she said according to The Hill.
‘After 6 November, I will consider in detail to be a President-in-Office.’
Warren addressed President Donald Trump during the town hall meeting and said ‘he is going this country in the wrong direction.’
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy," she said.
Warren has been crass in his criticism of Trump and his court-elected Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before the reconciliation."
However, a poll published on Thursday showed that the majority of Warren’s own voters do not think that she should be a candidate for 2020.
51 percent of the "probable" Massachusetts voters said the senator should not be a candidate, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Centre/ Boston Globe investigation.
Thirty-two percent support such a candidate.
The investigation showed more support for a round of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting a potential candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other highly profiled democratic names discussed with regard to a potential 2020 candidate include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
The bet said that he would decide officially in January, reported the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin argues for Track Palin's PTSD at Donald Trump Collection
Track Palin, 26, was a year in Iraq after being reverended in September.
He was arrested and accused of a felony in the world on Monday evening
"Whatever my own son goes through, what he goes through when he comes back, that I can relate to other families that are characterized by PTSD and some of the wounds our solar data returns with," she said to the audience at a collection of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said about his son and other war veterans that "they come back a little changed, they come back hard, they come back and wonder about the respect for what they and fellow soldiers and pilots and all the other military, have done for the country, exist".
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and was guilty of physical domestic violence against a woman, to have disrupted a report on the power of the home and storage of a weapon while he was rushing, according to Dan Bennett, spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. challenge to support new asylum policies
Eighteen states and districts of Columbia support a legal challenge to a new American policy of renouncing asylum to victims as refugees from repatriated or elected in the world.
Representatives from the 18 states and district submitted a friend-of-right on Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker who challenges politics, reported NBC News.
The full name of the plaintiff in Grace v. Sessions fits that the American Civil Liberties Union (American Civil Liberties Union) filed in August against federal policy has not been revealed.
She said that her partner ‘and the electoral gang members’ abused her, but American officials refused her application for asylum on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
The lawyers of the States supporting Grace describe El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, who produce a large number of applicants for American asylum, who are facing pervasive problems of gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision from the immigration law, which allowed illegal immigrants to flee from power in the world, to seek asylum.
District of Columbia Minister of Justice Karl Racine said on a Friday morning that the new policy "is ignoring many decades of government, federal and international law."
‘Federal law requires that all asylum cases be judged for the particular fact and circumstance of the claim, and such an obstacle to this principle,’ said the friend-of-court card.
Lawyers further stated in the summary that the policy of rennetizing access harms the economy of the United States, and states that it is more likely that they will become entrepreneurs and ‘provide necessary work’.
Advocate General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges no longer to grant asylum to victims of refugee abuse and repatriation in June.
‘Asyl is available to those who left their home because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political meaning,’ said Sessions in its publication of the policy on 11 June.
Asylum was never meant to alleviate all problems - even all serious problems - that people face every day all over the world.
Desperate rescue work in Palu while dead numbers doblast in the race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation was becoming more serious.
‘It’s very tense,’ said the 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, who comforted his feverish baby son at an evacuation centre in the ruined town of Palu.
‘Each minute ambulances come with bodies.
Pure water is difficult to find."
Inhabitants are observed on their way back to their ruined homes, as they search damaged parts and tried to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and the hospitals that were destroyed by the earthquake, which had a strength of 7.5, were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who had broken his back and shoulder, lingered outside of Palu's Military Hospital, where patients were treated outdoors due to still strong aftershock.
Tears filled his eye while he told him that he knew the heavy earthquake shook the hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter on the fifth floor.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was pushed into the ruins of the wall, I believe, 'told Haris to the Associated Press, and added that his family was in town for a wedding.
‘I heard my wife cry for help, but then it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
US Ambassador owes China for “mobbing” with “propaganda ads”
One week after an official Chinese newspaper conducted a four-page advertising in an American daily and highlighted the mutual benefits of trading with the United States and China, the American ambassador against China blamed Beijing for using the US press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to China Daily's paid advances in the Des Moines register - the state of Iowa's largest salsavis - after having owed China to try to interfere in the US Congressional elections on 6 November, a debt China nectar for.
Trump's debt that Beijing tried to interfere in American elections marked what American servicemen told Reuters was a new phase in an escalating campaign by Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign government powers to place advertising to support trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in an increasing trade war that has seen them increase taxes on each other's imports.
China's retaliation tariffs early in the trade war were designed to meet exporters in states such as Iowa that support Trump's Republican party, Chinese and American experts have said.
Terry Branstad, the American ambassador to China and the former long-term governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural product to China, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
“China”, wrote Branstad in a sentence in the Sunday’s Des Moines register, “dobbles no bullying by running propaganda ads in our own free press.”
‘In its dissemination of propaganda, the Chinese government benefits from America’s dear tradition of freedom of speech and a free press by adding a paid advertisement to the Des Moines register,’ wrote Branstad.
‘In contrast, by the newspaper newspaper down the street here in Beijing, you will find narrowing divergent voices and will see no true reflection of the different meanings that the Chinese people can have on China’s problematic economic path, given that the media is below the fixed inch of the Chinese Communist Party’ he shouted.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers declined the offer to publish" his article, even though he did not say what a newspaper.
Republicans forward female voters lead the midterm with Kavanaugh Debacle, warning analysts.
Since many top republicans are stand-by and defend the Supreme Court-elected Brett Kavanaugh in meeting with multiple sexual assault debts, the analyst has warned that they will probably see a setback, especially from women, in the coming midpoints.
The senses around this have been extremely high, and most Republicans have been registered that they already wanted to move on with a voice.
These things cannot be undone, says Grant Reeher, professor of state science at Syracuse University Maxwell School, to The Hill for an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he's doubting that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s last blinks press for an FBI investigation will be enough to calm angry voters.
"Women won't forget what happened yesterday--they won't forget it tomorrow, and not November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn on Friday. Washington, DC-avis.
On Friday morning, Protestants “November is coming!” while they demonstrated in the hall of the Senate when the Republicans, who run the court committee, chose to proceed with Kavanaugh’s nomination in violation of the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
‘Democracyal enthusiasm and motivation will be beyond the diagram,’ said Stu Rothenberg, a non-party political analyst, on the news page.
'People say it's already high, that's true.
But there may be higher, especially among female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18 to 29-year-olds, who, while not like the president, often fail to vote."
Even before Ford's public testimony that detailedly stated the allegations of sexual assault directed against the emerging Supreme Court, analysts suggested that a setback could be followed if the Republicans pressed for confirmation.
‘This has been a confused mess for GOP’ said Michael Steele, former leader of the Republican National Committee, early in the previous week, following NBC News.
‘It’s not just about the votes of the committee or final reconciliation or whether Kavanaugh is on the bench, it’s also about how Republicans have handled this and how they’ve treated it,” Guy Cecil, Director of Priorities USA, a group that helps to select democrats, pointed to the news channel.
But the Americans seem to be a little bit divided over who they should trust in in the wake of Ford's and Kavanaugh's testimony, with a little bit more siding with the latter.
A new opinion from YouGov shows that 41 percent of the respondents definitely or probably threatened Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they definitely or probably believed Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they believed that Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied under his witness, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the claims made by Ford, and besides at least another complaint, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford testifies to the Senate judicial committee during the last week that Kavanaugh completely attacked her at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the High Court nominee showed her sexual organs while they attended a party during the time they studied at Yale University in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to start a new Internet to meet Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a launch seeking to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The last project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company built by Berners-Lees open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where data is stored and which people have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee said that the meaning of Inrupt is ‘world domination’.
"We have to do it now," he said about the startup.
‘It is a historical eye flash.’
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own personal online repository or a POD.
It may contain contact lists, memory lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive; Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in a browser and all at the same time.
What's unique about the personal online store is that it's completely up to the user who can access any kind of information.
The company calls it ‘personal authority through data’.
The idea of Inrupt, according to the managing director of the company John Bruce, is that the company should include resources, process and appropriate capabilities to make Solid available to all.
The company consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM and some additional developers contracted to work on the project, as well as a community of voluntary encoders.
From this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralised apps using the tools available on the Inrupt Web site.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team don't talk to "Facebook and Google about not introducing a complete change where all their business models are completely turned on their heads overnight.
'We're not asking their permissions.'
In an article on media published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new network collection built on Solid.
In 1994 Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been a voice with great influence in the debate on net neutrality.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
‘I’m unbelievably optimistic about this next epoch online,’ said Berners-Lee ten l.
Bernard Vann: WW1 Victoria Cross divine celebration
The only Church of England who won a Victoria cross during World War I as a fighter has been celebrating in its hometown 100 years later.
Lt Col Pastor Bernard Vann won the prize on September 29, 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
He was still killed by a sniper four days later and never knew that he had won the highest British military honor.
A memorial was abducted by his two grandchildren on a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "brilly symbolic," that the stone would be drained exactly 100 years after his grandfather's award winning performance.
According to London Gazette, Lt Col Vann led his battalion over Canal de Saint-Quentin on September 29, 1918, ‘through a very thick shoe and under heavy fire from the field and machine gun.’
He later ran up to the front bar, and with the "greatest galananti", he led the line forward before he ran forward with a field gun and struck out three of the group.
Lt Col Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - a little over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said that the actions of his grandfather were "I know that I could never live up to, but something I am adorable for."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid a wreath after the parade, which was led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was very honored to play a role in the parade, and added that ‘the value of a real hero is shown by the support given by many people.’
The MMA fan was up all night to see Bellator 206, they got Peppa Gris instead.
Imagine this, you've been up all night to see a package of Bellator 206 but you can't see the main event.
The San Jose bill contained 13 matches, including six on the main card and was shown live through the night in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6 o'clock in the morning, right in the Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald, they were meeting each other, and the UK viewers were again stunned when the coverage changed to Peppa Gris.
Some were little impressed after they had stayed awake to the early hours especially for the fight.
A tab on Twitter described the children's comic book as "a kind of sick joke."
‘It is public regulation that at 6 o’clock if the collection was not owned, they had to switch to the program for the children,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president for marketing and communication, when he was asked about the transfer.
‘Peppa pig, ‘yes’.
Bellator Company President Scott Coker said they're going to work on planning to include British viewers in the future.
'I believe that when I think about replay, I believe that we can find out enough,' said Coker.
«But the time is six o'clock in the morning on a Sunday, and we can't figure this out before Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
True to me, when it went over, there were many texts that went back and forth, and everyone wasn't friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical mistake.
But it wasn't; it was a public problem.
I can promise you, the next time it doesn't happen.
We keep it to five games instead of six -- which we usually do -- and we tried to hand over to the fan, and we just went over.
This is an unfortunate situation.’
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley knew himself ‘understood’ because of sexuality
The Olympic diver Tom Daley says that in the uprising he felt worse than everyone because of his sexuality--but that's what motivated him to be a success.
The 24-year-old said he didn't understand until he went to the ongoing school that "not everyone is like me."
When he spoke on the first Radio 4 Desert Island discs presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about his gay dishes to give others hope.
He also said becoming a parent made him care less about winning the OL.
The permanent reporter in long-distance showa, Kirsty Young, has taken free several months because of illness.
What might look like a waste in Lavere's first program, Daly said he knew himself 'less than' all the others who grew up because 'it wasn't socially acceptable to equal boys and girls.'
He said, "From today, having a sense of feeling less than and different, are the real things that have given me the strength and strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "what," he said, so that he didn't disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The two-onger bronze Olympic medallion has been a professional LGBT campaign and used its appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to several countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said he spoke out because he knew himself lucky who could live up without dissensions and wanted to give others 'hope'.
The three-way world champion said that it was going to be in love with a man -- the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 -- "surprise me."
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than he, last year, but he said that the age difference would never be a problem.
"When you go through so much at such a young age" -- he went to his first 14-year-old OL and his father died of cancer three years later -- he said it was hard to find someone of the same age who had experienced similar heights and downfalls.
The couple were parents in June to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that his whole perspective had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, everything was about I need to win a gold medal," he said.
«You know what, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
Mi Olympic gold medal is Robbie.»
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after having been diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father did not accept that he should die and one of the last things he had asked about was whether they had tickets to London in 2012 - when he wanted to be in the first row.
"I couldn't tell him you're not going to be on the top row," he said.
"I kept to myself when he stopped breathing, and it wasn't until he had actually stopped breathing and he was dead that I finally recognized that he wasn't invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the OL in 2012 and at the water bronze.
"I only knew that this was what I had dreamed of my whole life--to dive into the front of a world audience in an Olympic game, where there was no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired his first song selection--proud of Heather Small--that had vibrated with him in the construction of the OL and he still gave goosebumps.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Out of form his Mickelson on the bench at Ryder Cup Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47. Ryder Cup match, but he must reverse the shape to avoid that there is an unhappy milestone.
Mickelson, who played in the two-year event for a record 12 times, was seen on the bench of Captain Jim Fury for the Saturday golf game in fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being in the middle of the action, as he has often been for the United States, the five times great winner split his day between being a cheerleader and working with his game within reach of the hope of correcting what bothers him.
Never the most competent long shots. Not one entry at the top of his career, the 48-year-old is best at hitting with the long shot on the throne, the French main course, where balls hit outside if the golf player is not exactly hit.
And if the course itself isn't scary enough, Mickelson meets in the ninth fight on Sunday, the precise British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has joined up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their matches this week.
If the Americans, four points down by starting the 12 single games, get to a hot start, Mickelson's fight can be completely decisive.
Fear expressed confidence in his husband, not that he could say much else.
"He totally understood the role he had today, gave me a clapping on his back and left his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," said Furyk.
‘He has great confidence in himself.
He is a Hall of Famer, and he has added so much to these layers in the past and this week.
I don't think he played two games.
I saw more for myself, but that's how it was, and that's how we thought we had to do.
He will be out there, just like everyone else."
Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record in most Ryder Cup games that are played on Sunday.
It can mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never quite matched the heights of its individual record.
Mikkelson has 18 victories, 20 losses and seven halves, even if Fury so that his presence added some intangible properties to the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, entertaining, likes to have fun with people and he's a nice guy to have in the locker room," he explained.
"I think the younger players had fun having a conversation with him too, this week, which was fun to see.
He contributes a lot more than just playing.”
Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a big lead can soon disappear
Thomas Bjørn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant rental on the way into the last single days of the Ryder Cup can easily be transformed into an unpleasant trip.
The Danish made his debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where a side captain of Seve Ballesteros held a five-point advantage over the Americans, but only came across the finish line with his nose leading with the narrowest margins, winning 141⁄2-131⁄2.
‘You kept reminding yourself that we had a big rental on Valderrama; we had a big rental on Brookline, where we lost, and on Valderrama, where we won, but only so far,” said Bjørn, having seen the Class 2018 win 5-3 both on Friday and yesterday to rent 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So history will show me and everyone on the team that this isn't over.
You're going to the full opening tomorrow.
Go out there and do all the right things.
This is not until you have the points on the board.
We have a goal, and it's trying to win this trophy, and that's where the focus stays.
I've said all the time, I'm focusing on the 12 players that are on our side, but we're so well aware of what's on the other side -- the biggest players in the world."
Happy about how his players have performed on a tough golf course, added Bjørn: "I would never take the saying in advance.
Tomorrow is another day.
Tomorrow, there's the individual achievements that come out, and there's another thing to do.
It's great to be out there with a partner when things go well, but when you're out there individually, you'll be tested fully out of your capacity as a golfer.
There is the message you need to communicate to players; get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner, and he must go and get the best out of himself too."
In contrast to Bear, opposite number Jim Fury will be looking out for his players to perform better individually than they did as partners, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who fetched three points out of four.
Fear itself has been at both ends of the spin-offs of the great last days, after being part of the winning team in Brookline before he ended up losing when Europe pulled off the 'Miracle in Medinah'.
"I think every fucking word of it," he said in response to being asked about how Ben Crenshaw, the captain of 1999, had gathered his players on their way into the last day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you want to get started with the quick start that you saw on Brookline, as you saw on Medinah.
When the moment passes a path, place a lot of pressure on the middle matches.
We set up our line-up accordingly and set the boys in motion in a way that feels good, you know, we're trying to do something magical tomorrow."
Thomas has been assigned the task of trying to lead the game and meet Rory McIlroy at the top of the game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter the other Europeans in the top half of the game.
"I went with this group of boys in this order because I believe it covers the whole way through," Bjorn said about his choices of singles.
Germany’s new warships once again
The newest frigate of the German Navy would have been ordered in 2014 to replace aging warships from the cold wartime, but it will not be there until at least next year due to faulty system and apparent costs, reported local media.
The launch of Rhineland-Palatinate, the ship for which they split the new Baden-Wuerttemberg class frigates, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit-avis, citing a military spokesman.
The ship was supposed to join the fleet in 2014, but the worrying problems after delivery plague the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships the Marine Defense ordered back in 2007, coming to replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
It is understood that they will hold a powerful cannon, a number of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some hidden technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important functions include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to deploy the newest frigates for up to two years away from the ports at home.
Nevertheless, continuous delays mean that the groundbreaking warships, which apparently allowed Germany to exercise power abroad, will already be out-dated when they enter the service, notes Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 freak made headlines last year, when the German fleet officially refused to accept the vessel and returned it to the Blohm & Voss yard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the German fleet returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
The reasons for the return were not known, but the German media quoted a number of important software and hardware failures that rendered the warship useless if they were placed on a combat mission.
Software failures were particularly important as ships in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class will be driven by a crew of about 120 seafarers - only half of the workers of older Bremen crews.
It also turned out that the ship is dramatically overweight, which reduces performance and limits the fleet's ability to add future upgrades.
The 7000-tonne 'Rheinland-Pfalz' is assumed to be twice as heavy as similar ships used by the Germans in other world wars.
Except for the wrong hardware, the price of the entire project - including training for the crew - will also be a problem.
It is said to have reached a staggering €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) - up from the initial €2.2 billion (EURO)
Problems associated with the newest frigates are especially important in view of the recent warnings that Germany's fleeting power is diminishing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament’s defence committee, acknowledged that the fleet actually ‘has almost an end to distribution-competent ships’.
The officer said that the problem has been built over time, because old ships were disbanded, but no replacement vessel was delivered.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class frigates were able to join the fleet.
National Trust Thieves on Secret Life to Bats
A new research carried out on a property in the Scottish Highlands aims to reveal how the bats use the landscape in the hunt for food.
It is hoped that findings will shed new light on the behavior of the unique flying mammals and help to guide future conservation activities.
The study of researchers at the National Trust for Scotland will follow common and soprano pipistrelles and besides brown langøra and Daubenton bat at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recordings will be placed in important locations around the property to track bat activities throughout the season.
NHS additions and volunteers will also perform mobile searches using handheld detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of the flag mouse calls and what kind does.
A habitat map and report will then be produced to create a detailed landscape scale image of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a scientific advisor to the NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which habitat, natural worlds, are most important to the bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management work such as purchasing meadows and how it is best to maintain the same forest area for bats and other associated species.
Flag musculoskeletal populations in Scotland and over the United Kingdom have decreased significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that has an impact on storage sites and habitat/site losses.
Wind turbines and lighting may also pose a risk, such as fly paper and some chemical treatments for building materials, as well as attacks on pet cats.
The bat is not really blind.
But because of their nightly hunting habits, their ears are still more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echo-location technique to detect faults and obstacles in their flight path.
NTS, responsible for caring for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, takes the bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who regularly conduct investigations, the place of sleep inspections and sometimes save lives.
The organisation has even created Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve on the Three Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
Ownership manager David Thompson says that the property is the ideal territory for them.
"Here on Threeave we have a great area for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, many veterans and all the good habitats.
But it's a lot about bats that are still unknown, so the work we do here and on other owner domains will help us to understand more about what they need to thrive."
He emphasizes the importance of checking for bats before performing maintenance within egg domains, since it is possible that infinite destruction of a single bow can kill up to 400 female bats and young people, and perhaps eradicate a whole local population.
The bat is saved and it is illegal to kill, plague or disturb them or destroy their sleep areas.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer for the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the audience to come in and help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and too many of our species, we don't know how dangerous their populations are."
Ronaldo rejects the charge of power in the lawyer suing the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has labeled ruling debts against himself as ‘false news’ and says that people ‘want to emphasize themselves’ by using his name.
His lawyers are set to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, who published the allegations.
Portugal and Juventus the forwarder have been obliged to elect an American woman, called Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is claimed to have paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the event, reported Der Spiegel on Friday.
In a live instagram video, Ronaldo, 33, says to his 142 million followers only hours after the debt is "false news."
'No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, fake news, says five times the Goldball winner into the camera.
‘They want to market themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
They'll be familiar with saying my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and all good, "let the player smile and smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are in the process of suing Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they have called 'an intolerable report on suspicions in the area of privacy', according to Reuters
Advocate Christian Schertz said that the player would seek compensation for «ethical damage in an amount equal to the seriousness of the breach of rules, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.»
The alleged event is said to have been found in June 2009 on a suite at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga withdrew to the room of the player, where a claim that he should have picked her anal, as follows the document submitted by Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knee after the assumed event and said he was "99 percent" a "good guy" and failed with "one percent".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was consent.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had photographed her injuries in a hospital, but later agreed on a settlement because she felt "feared by retribution" and was concerned about "being a public apathetic."
The 34-year-old says that she is now trying to change the dwelling as she continues to be traumatized by the alleged event.
Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer he moved to Italian giant Juve in a €100 million deal.
Brexit: UK 'will forever undo' to lose car manufacturers
The United Kingdom “would undo it forever” if it lost its status as a world leader before car production after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was ‘about’ that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if the United Kingdom left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop production at the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
'We need an appointment,' said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said the effect of frontier delays in case a non-contracting Brexit could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant - making Toyota's Auris and Avensis - produced almost 150,000 cars last year, where 90% were exported to the rest of the EU.
‘My opinion is that if the United Kingdom leaves the EU at the end of March, we see production stops at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s managing director at Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers have been afraid to leave the EU without an agreement on how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW says for example that it will close its Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns about what car manufacturers say are the risks of supply chains in the event of a non-contracting Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is driven on a straight-in-time basis, with parts coming every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the United Kingdom and the EU for cars ordered.
If the United Kingdom left the EU without an agreement on 29 March, disruptions can occur at the border that the industry says may lead to delays and a lack of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than one day's values of inventory at its Derbyshire factory, said the company, and thus the production would be stopped.
Mr Clark said that Theresa May's Checker's plan for future relations with the EU is «just calibrated to avoid border controls.»
'We must have an agreement; we want the best agreement that will allow, as I say, not only to benefit from success today, but for us to seize this opportunity,' he told the BBC Radio 4's agenda.
‘Prove from not only Toyota, but other producers are that we can absolutely continue what has been a very successful set of supply chains.’
Toyota could not say how long production would be stopped, but in the longer term they warned that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years, and is the Unite Union Association at the plant, said that his members are more concerned by: "By my experience, when these jobs go, they never come back.
One spokesperson to the government said: ‘We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.’
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, says White House
Donald Trump's high-ranking meeting with Vice-Chairman Rod Rosenstein could be 'pressed back a week' as the fight against the Supreme Court nominees Brett Kavanaugh continued, said the white house on Sunday.
Rosenstein supervises the work of Special Councillor Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian electoral interference, links between Trump helpers and Russia, and the potential obstacle to the President’s justice.
Korvitt Trump will cancel the general of the prosecutions or not, thus endangering Mueller's self-responsive, has fed Washington gossip for several months.
Earlier in the month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed a loan to register conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president by means of the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein refused the report.
But last Monday he went to the white house, and it was reported that he was about to say up.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the UN in New York City, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said he would 'prevent' not kick Rosenstein, but then the meeting was exposed to avoid crashing with the Senate commission's hearing how both Kavanaugh and one of the women who had accused him of sexual harassment, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, testify.
On Friday, Trump ordered a weekly FBI investigation of claims against Kavanaugh, which delayed full vote from the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
When she was asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said, "No date has been set. It may be this week, but I can see that it is delayed yet another week because everything else is happening in Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I always like to keep the press up to date."
Some reporters would say that Sanders hasn't held a press orientation for the White House since September 10.
The host, Chris Wallace, asked the queer.
Sanders said that the lack of information was not due to a dissatisfaction with the TV reporter's game for the gallery, even though she said, "I don't disagree that they do it."
She mentioned and that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
‘The President holds more press conferences than any president has ever done before’, said she - quite correctly without providing evidence of the claim. ‘We have looked at the issue’.
Sanders says updates are still going to happen, but ‘if the press gets the chance to ask the President directly in the United States, it’s much better than talking to me.
We've tried to do it this way, and you've seen us do it often in the last weeks, and it's going to take over instead of a press briefing if you can talk directly to the president of the United States."
Trump accepts questions when he travels from the White House or participates in open sessions or press conferences with visitors.
It's unusual for the president to hold press conferences alone.
In New York this week, the president may have demonstrated why, where he acted without shame to the reporters, and almost bizarrely.
Secretary of Health Rewrites Brexit Fear of EU Workers at NHS in Scotland
The Secretary of Health has written to EU workers working at the NHS in Scotland to express their gratitude and wish that they continue after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter even if there are less than six months left before the United Kingdom withdraws from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to addressing the costs of applications which have the status of EU citizens working in delegated public services.
In the letter, Freeman wrote: ‘During the summer, negotiations on withdrawal between the United Kingdom and the EU have continued, and it is approaching the expected end of the autumn.
Nevertheless, the British government has stepped up preparations in case there is no agreement.
I understand that this must be a difficult time for you all.
So I'm going to repeat how much I'm looking at adding the contributions to everyone, no matter what their nationality.
Colleagues from the EU, and elsewhere, have valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the health sector and are beneficial to patients and communities.
Scotland is perfectly clear, and we want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes acute surgery after head injury
The linebacker Christion Abercrombie, who plays at Tennessee State Tigers, went through an emergency operation after having contracted an injury in the head when the team lost 31-27 against Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, reports the newspaper The Tennessee.
The main trainer for Tennessee State, Rod Reed, told the reporters that the damage happened just before the break.
"He came to the sideline and collapsed, in a way," said Reed.
Coaches and medical personnel provided Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before they placed him on a stretcher and took him back for further evaluation.
An official spokesman from Tennessee State told WSMV that Abercrombie had completed surgery at the Vanderbilt medical centre.
There's no detail about the extent of the damage yet, said Harris, and added that Tennessee State was still trying to figure out when the damage occurred.
Abercrombie goes second year at university, and is in his first season after being transferred from Illinois.
He had a total of five tackles before he got hurt in Saturday's fight, and is now up to 18 in total this season.
Foreign buyers have to pay a higher document fee when they buy property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers have to pay a higher document fee when they buy property in the United Kingdom. The extra income will be used to help the homeless, according to the new plans for the conservatives.
Decides to neutralize the success of Corbyn in attracting young voters
The increase in the document fee will be added for those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
State Treasury expects an increase of up to 120 million pounds per year - to help the homeless
Theresa May will today announce that foreign buyers will have to pay a higher document fee when they buy property in the United Kingdom. The additional income will be used to help the homeless.
This decision will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success that Jeremy Corbyn has had in attracting young voters who tend to much, with the promise of offering decent dwellings.
The increase in the document fee will be added for individuals and companies that do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and the extra money will strengthen the government's desire to reduce the number of strippers.
The fee, which comes in addition to the current document fee, includes the higher levels that were introduced two years ago on the number two and rental locations, may be as much as three percent.
The Statskassa expects the decision to receive up to 120 million pounds per year.
About 13 per cent of new buildings in London are purchased by residents outside the United Kingdom. This means that prices will be higher, and first-time buyers will find it harder to enter the housing market.
Many well-being areas in the country – especially in the capital city – have become ‘ ghost villages’ because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time in other countries.
This new policy only wakes up after Boris Johnson cut the document fee to help more young people buy their first home.
He appealed to a large construction company to keep prices up by getting hold of property, but not using it, and asked Theresa May to give up the allowances on decent dwellings to fix the UK's "busy house house".
Corbyn has announced a series of pending proposals for housing reforms, including controlled rentals and the closure of exhibitions without a reason.
He wants and gives greater power to build new dwellings.
May said, "Last year I said that I wanted to dedicate my position to bring back the British dream - that life should be better for every new generation.
It means fixing the damaged housing market.
The United Kingdom will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
Nevertheless, it may not be right for individuals who do not live in the United Kingdom, or foreign companies, to buy dwellings as it is for hardworking British residents.
For many people the dream of their own dwelling has gone too far away, and the audacity of being a wanderer is real.
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate ambition is to lead Scotland'
The head of Sunderland, Jack Ross, says that his "ultimate ambition" is to be the manager of Scotland at some point.
The Scots (42) are looking over the challenge of revitalizing the club from the north-east. They are currently in third place in League One, only three points from the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer, after having led St Mirren back to the Scottish elite series in the previous season.
"I would play for my country playing.
I got a B-land battle, and it was," said Ross to Scotland's BBC Sports Sound.
"But I grew up watching Scotland at Hamden together with my father, and there has always been something that has dragged me back.
The possibility can only come if I have succeeded as a club manager.»
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland Manager include Dick Advocaat, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Alloa Athletic says he hasn't been anxious to come after so many established names in such a big club, since he has previously rejected approaches from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
'For the moment, success for me will be measured in whether I 'can get this club back in the Premier League.'
In view of the structure and facilities of this club, there is no doubt that they belong to the Premier League," he said.
'It's not easy to get them there, but I can probably only think of myself as successful if I can get the club back there.'
Ross is only three years into career as manager, after a period of assisting manager at Dumbarton and a 15-month period in the training apparatus of Hearts.
He then helped Alloa to come from the teardown to the third level, and turned St Mirren, who was on his way to move down, into the title winners of the championship series the following season.
And Ross says that he knows himself more comfortable now, than he ever did while he was playing in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkurk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a road barrier," he says, "to lead Alloa.
‘I honestly believed that being a manager would suit me much better than being a player.
It sounds bizarre, because I did it well, felt good and liked it relatively well.
But gambling can be tough.
There's a lot of things you're forced to come through every week.
I still notice when it comes to stress and pressure with the job, but it seems right to be a manager.
I've always wanted to be a manager, and now I am. It's the most comfortable I've felt in my own body in all my adult life."
Sunday, September 30th, you can right the entire Sportsound interview, Radio Scotland, between 12 and 13.
Research shows that the perfect time for a half-litre is 5.30 p.m. on a Saturday.
The heat wave of summer has led to an increase in the inflammability of stretching pubs in the United Kingdom, but also increased pressure on restaurant chains.
In July, the sales increased by 2.7 percent in the bar industry - but for the restaurant industry it went down by 4.8 percent, the statistics show.
Business consultant Peter Martin, who is behind the statistics, said: "The current sun, and the fact that England was in the World Cup longer than planned, means that July followed the pattern of June when pubs went up 2.8 percent, only that restaurants became even harder frame.
The 1.8 percent decline in the restaurant industry was only worse in July.
Pubs and bars that sell drink, made it significantly better and went up more than restaurants went down.
Pubs that sell food, got and noticed the fall in the sun, although it wasn't as dramatic as for restaurant owners.
It might seem that people just want to go out for a drink.
Among pubs and bars had the drinking room increased by 6.6 percent this month, while food had gone down three percent.
Paul Newman, a travel and leisure analyst at RSM, said: "These results are the continuation of the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The world, and the impact of a huge social or sports event, will still be the biggest factors when it comes to the hall in the outdoors industry.
It is no surprise that the restaurant industry will still wear out. A 4.8 percent annual decrease in the sales will be painful to get at the top of a running cost pressure.
The long, warm summer couldn't come at a worse time for food-powered operators. Time will show if the more moderate temperatures that have been in August can give a longer breathing room.»
The total salsaking across pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the downsizing in the release of branded products.
The Coffer Peach Tracker sales monitor for the UK pub, bar and restaurant industry collects and analyses the results data from 47 operating groups with a total turnover of more than £9 billion and is the established industry reference index.
One of five children has secret profiles on social media that they hide from parents
One in five children - some as young as 11 - has secret profiles on social media that they hide from parents and teachers, showing an investigation
Study of 20,000 students on ongoing reveals an increase in ‘false Insta’ profiles
This news has increased the fear that sexual content will be posted
Twenty percent of the students say they have a 'head' profile they show parents
One in five children -- some as young as 11 -- makes profiles on social media that they keep secret from the adults.
A survey of 20,000 elephants on a continuous scale revealed a significant increase in false Insta profiles - a reference to the Instagram image sharing platform.
The news has increased the fear that sexual content will be posted.
Twenty percent of the students say they have a sterile "head" profile that they refer to parents, at the same time as they have private profiles.
A mother who stumbled over the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who encouraged others to ‘elect me’.
The research, made by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters' and Headmitresses' Conference (HMC) at various schools, found that 40 percent of those between the ages of 11 and 18 had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having private users.
The head of HMC, Mike Buchanan, said, "It's surprising that so many teenagers are tempted to create places on the web where parents and teachers can't find them."
Eilidh Doyle becomes the voice of the athletes in the Scottish Peace Council
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Board of Scottish Friedness as non-administrative director at the Annual General Meeting of the Management Board.
Doyle is the most decorated librarian in Scotland, and director Ian Beattie describes the event as a great possibility for those who run the sport to benefit from her extensive experience at international level during the last decade.
‘Eilidh has a great deal of respect across Scotland, the United Kingdom and the world’s recreational society, and we are confident that the law of peace in Scotland can benefit from bringing it into the board’, said Beattie.
Doyle said, "I am eager to act as a voice for practitioners, and I hope I can contribute and help sports in Scotland."
The American, who has gold from both 200m and 400m in Atlanta in 1996 among its total four OL gold and now is a regular guest at the BBC, was unable to go after a drop.
On Twitter he wrote: "Today is a month since I got a hit.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said it was only time to tell me if I was going to be okay again, or to what extent.
It's been exhausting work, but I've been pretty good again, I've learned to walk again, and today I'm doing flexibility drills!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!’
Split online meanings about breast pump clips that compare mothers to dairy cows
A breast-pump company has split the opinion on the Internet with an advertisement that compares breast-fed mothers to dairy cows.
In order to mark what is described as ‘the world’s first silent, insidious breast pump’, the technology company Elvie released a small number of advertising inspired by music videos to demonstrate the freedom of the new pump giving mothers who extract milk.
Four real mothers dance in a tall-filled barn with cows, to a song that includes text that: "Yes, I'm milking myself, but you see no tail" and "In case you don't notice it, these are not tensions, these are my puppies."
"Pump it out, pump it out, I feed these kids, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my ladies."
The advertisement, which has been published on the company's Facebook page, has, on the other hand, created controversy online.
With 77 000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from the viewers, and many say it illuminates the "scream" of the dairy industry.
‘Very poor decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to become pregnant and fed to produce milk, only that the calf is trusted from the days after birth,” writes one.
Elvie breast pump is discreet in a breast-feeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment: «Understood enough traumatic for both mother and child
But yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their children?’
Another added: ‘For a remote advertisement’.
Others defended the advertisement, and a lady admitted that she seemed to sound ‘partylike’.
"I think this is a brilliant idea.
I would have had one if I still had an grandmother.
Pumping made me feel like a cow.
This advertisement is a little crazy, but I took him for what he is.
This is a brilliant product, wrote one.
Another comment: ‘This is a fun advertisement directed at mothers who pump (often at work or in the toilet) and feel like cows.
This is not an advertisement that boasts or condemns the dairy industry.’
At the end of the video, the group of women reveals that they all have danced with the disc-tree pump packed into their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women who pump are saying they feel like cows.
The Elvie pump, on the other hand, is completely quiet, has no wires or pipes, and is discreetly inside an breast-feeding bra, which gives women the freedom to move, keep their kids, and even go out while they pump.
Ana Balardin, partner and creative director of Mother, commented: «Elvie-pumpa is a so-called revolutionary product that it ensues a wave and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between mothers who extract milk and dairy cows, we want to place search lights on breast pumping and challenges attached to this, and at the same time demonstrate the incredible freedom of the new pump will bring, in an entertaining and recognizable way.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump has made headlines.
During the fashion week in London, a mother showed up to two on the stage for designer Marta Jakubowski, while she used the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children move in silence to tent camp on the Texas border
The number of immigrant children in prison has peaked even if monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, partly because the strict policy of Trump administration has made it more difficult to place children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors have undocumented immigrants themselves, and they fear that standing up and accepting a child may threaten their own ability to stay in the country.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other grown family members would be forced to submit fingerprints and that these data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week Matthew Albence testified from the Convention's Immigration and Customs Enforcement and said that the Agency has arrested dozens of people who have applied to be sponsors of single minors.
The Agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had nothing on its scroll.
"Almost 80 percent of those who are either sponsors or family members of sponsors are illegal in the country, and a large part of these are criminal aliens.
So we're going to continue pursuing these human beings," said Albion.
According to the camp's additions, new rules have now been introduced to deal with the children. The rules require some of them to be in court before a month has passed, compared to 60 days ago.
Many people will attend via video calls and not attend, to get the case if they tried to execute an immigration sentence.
Those who are not qualified for freedom will be deported quickly.
The longer the children are in charge, the more likely it is that the developers of anxiety or depression, which can lead to elective outbreaks or escape exemptions, say they are added to the camp. Reports that have appeared in recent months say the same thing.
Speakers say that these concerns are greater at large plants such as Tornillo. Because of the size of the plant, it is more likely that one ignores the signs that children are struggling.
They added that moving children to the tent camp without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally, or saying hate to friends, can strengthen trauma that many people are already struggling with.
Syria asks US, French and Turkish occupying forces to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also asked for Syrian refugees to come home, even though the country is now at war in the eighth year.
Moualem, who acts as Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, said that the emerging forces are preventing themselves from being illegal on Syrian soil, under the guise of fighting terrorism, and ‘will be dealt with from it’.
‘They must withdraw immediately and without reservations’, he said to the assembly.
Moualem insisted that ‘war on terror is almost over’ in Syria, how more than 360 000 people have lost their lives since 2011, and millions have been removed from their homes.
He said that Damascus will continue to “fight a holy battle all the way to all Syrian territories” for both terrorist groups and “illegal presence of the stranger.”
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly for training and counseling both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in the warlord of the country.
When the refugee problems were discussed, Moualem said it was safe for them to come back, and he blamed on 'some Western countries' for having spread irrational fear' of the environment that caused the refugees to stay away.
‘We have asked the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate the return,’ he said.
‘They are making policies out of something that should be a purely humanitarian problem.’
The United States and the EU have warned that there will be no help in rebuilding Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war is in place.
UN diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in Idlib, which is the last major insurrection, has made it possible to continue pushing ahead with political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement averts a great attack from Russian-stretched Syrian forces in the province where three million people live.
Moualem nevertheless stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action would be directed against jihadist, including warriors from the Nusra Front, who are associated with Al-Qaeda, who "will be eradicated."
The UN delegates, Staffan de Mistura, hope to soon gather the first meetings of a new committee consisting of members of government and opposition to prepare a post-war law for Syria, and to pave the way for the elections.
Moualem sets out the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that the work of the panel should be limited "to review the articles of the current founding", and warn against disturbances.
Kvifor Trump will win a term for
With that logic, Trump will win the re-election in 2020 if not, as many liberal seers probably hope, the presidency will end early because of scandals and national law.
It would no doubt be 'the most dramatic end of a presidency ever!'
At the time of writing, there are no characters to let go of the viewers.
Since 2014, CNN has doubled its rating in the best transmission time to 1.05 million, while the MSNBC almost has triple its to 1.6 million.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at the best time, up from 1.7 million a year ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has played at the top of the cable rating with as much as 3.5 million viewers on evenings with great news.
"This is a fire that people are being lured by, because there's something I don't understand," said Neal Baer in the ABC drama "Designated Survivor," which is about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the congress building.
Nell Scovell, an old comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Snowing Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
She thinks a cab ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver said he was going to vote on Trump.
She asked.
'Because he made me laugh,' he replied according to Scovell.
There's an entertainment value in the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the story that comes from Washington can decide for the future to Roe v. Wade, if the immigrant family gets together to be to hell with the global economy.
Turning off is a luxury that only most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet it goes further than being an informed citizen when you find yourself at six o'clock to see a panel of experts debate Bob Woodward's use of sources with "deep background" for the book "Fear," Paul Manafort's bombing of ostriches to $15,000 ("a piece of garment thickened by arrogance," said Washington Post) and the implications of Stormy Daniel's scary description of Trump's, eh, anatomy.
Personally, I'm never going to look at Super Mario the same way again.
‘Part of what he does that makes it feel like a reality program is that he gives you something every night’, said Brent Montgomery, daily director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creates by ‘Pawn Stars’, about the show that goes with Trump’s employees and daily disputes (go into a fight with NFL, rose Kim Jong-un).
You cannot miss a single episode, otherwise you will not be able to hang up.
When I hit Fleiss this week, it was over 25 degrees and sun outside his home on the north coast of Kauai, but he sat in and looked at the MSNBC while he took up the CNN.
He couldn't turn away, not when Brett Kavanaugh stood in front of the Senate Commission and the future of the Supreme Court hung in a thin thread.
"I think when we did all these crazy show before and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," said Fleiss.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right."

Money from the outside flows into the densest intermediate election match
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania’s 17th district sees an abundance of money, thank you for a conversion of Congress districts that led to two sitting members fighting for the same seat.
The recently converted suburban district of Pittsburg forwards Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district through a special election in spring last year.
Lamb is fighting against another sitting member, Republican Keith Rothfus, today a representative in the former 12th district of Pennsylvania, which largely overlaps with the new 17th district.
The map was redrawn after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decided in January that the old districts were illegally designed to benefit the Republicans.
The 17th District Competition has launched a weapons campaign on the financing of the campaigns, between the major parties its money arsenal, the Democratic Congress Committee and the Republican Congress Committee.
Lamb was a known name in Pennsylvania after a button says in a closely followed special choice in Pennsylvania's 18th Congress district.
The seat had listened to a republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district with over 20 points.
Political experts have given the Democrats a scarce advantage.
The United States considered punishing El Salvador on grounds of support for China, but withdrew
Diplomats note that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing without negative reactions from Washington.
Trump had a warm meeting with the president of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama to throw out the Trump organization's leader group.
The State Secretarys decided to bring back the American Chefs for Diplomatic Missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over the "last decisions to no longer recognise Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, the Department's spokeswoman, in an early announcement of that month.
However, punishment was only assessed against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in US aid in 2017, including for drug control, development and financial support.
The penalties imposed, which contained cut to financial support and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and their high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings developed, North American and Central American officials postponed a conference on security and economic prosperity to follow up a similar gathering last year that was seen as a step forward to prevent immigrants from coming to the United States.
However, in mid-September, the top administrators announced that they wanted the conference to continue, thus putting a stop to the assessment of the penalty for El Salvador.
It has now been said that Vice President Mike Pence will meet the conference, which has been planned in the middle of October, as a signal of the relevance of the administration to the collection, said the diplomats.
And the three American broadcasts returned silently to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new tough messages or punishments from Washington.
A Bolton spokesperson would not comment on the details of the debate described by the three American ministers, including two diplomats, who were some about discussing the internal considerations of anonymity.
Their description was confirmed by a non-comprehensive analyst who works closely with the administration and who spoke during anonymity.
Study History
One waits for Special Counsellor Robert Mueller's report on Trump's possible obstacles to justice, which are now considerable evidence of in the public protocols.
According to the reports, Mueller should have turned the focus of research into whether Trump's campaign was conspiring with Russia's attack on our choice.
If Congress were to change controllers, Trump would have to be prepared in this body, in which he is preparing to overestimate the voters and possibly a jury of his equals.
There's a lot about it, and I don't mean to suggest that Trump's fall is inevitable either for his counterpart in Europe.
It's a choice to take all of us on both sides of the pond, which will affect how long the battle can be.
In 1938, German officers were ready for a coup d'état against Hitler, only the West had opposed him and helped the Czechs in Munich.
We failed, and missed out on a possibility of avoiding the years of a bloodbath.
The course of history revolves around such turning point, and democracy's inexorable march is accelerated or postponed.
The Americans are facing several of these turning points now.
What will we do if Trump fires Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in deep water all because this newspaper revealed that last year he proposed to intercept the president in hiding, and wondered if he was unfit for his role.
Rosenstein says The Times' description is inaccurate.
‘How will we react if the recently requested FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair – or is accepted by the Supreme Court despite the threatening guilt of sexual assault, and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the middle of the election for a congress that keeps Trump responsible?
If we fail these tests, democracy will face a long winter.
But I don't think we're wrong, because of what I learned in Praha.
My mother was a Czech Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied the country I have my embassy in.
She survived, immigrated to the United States, and 60 years later she sent me off to light the sabbatical lights on the table asking the swastika.
When this is my legacy, how can I not be optimistic about the future?

Rangers Graham Dorrans is optimistic before the meeting with Rapid Vienna
Rangers welcome Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing to say about the Austrians, after an impressive draw in Spain towards Villarreal earlier this month, they will give a good starting point to qualify from group G of the European League.
A knee injury prevented midwayer Graham Dorrans from making his first performance this season before the 2-2 result against Villarreal, but he thinks Rangers can use this result as a springboard for bigger things.
'It was a good point for us, for Villarreal is a good team,' said the 31-year-old.
‘We went into the game with the confidence that we could get something, and came out again with a score.
Maybe we could take it towards the end, but everything at all is a draw probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half, and then we got out in the second half and were better off.
On Thursday there will be a big European evening.
Hopefully we can get three points, but there will be a tough fight. They got a good result in their previous fight, but with the audience behind us I'm sure we can run on and get a positive result.
The last year has definitely been tough, with everything that has happened to my injuries and changes in the club, but now everything feels good.
The stable is good and the boys thrive; the training is good.
Hopefully we can run now, put the previous season behind us and be successful."
Women lose sleep over this fear of pension savings
Despite the fact that participants in a study had clear thoughts about how they would be taken care of, there were few who talked to family members about it.
About half of those who participated in a study by the insurance company Nationwide said to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they were talking to their kids about it.
"People want a family member to take care of, but they don't take the necessary steps to have that conversation," says Vice President of Nationwide, Holly Snyder.
Here you go.
Talk to your spouse and your children: You cannot prepare your family to take care of yourself if you do not want to make your known good time in advance.
Cooperation with a consultant and your family to discuss how and where to receive care, as these options may be a major part of determining costs.
Download a financial advisor: your advisor may also help you figure out how to pay for these expenses.
The long-term care financing options can include a traditional long-term care insurance, a life insurance with cash value to help pay the costs, or that you provide yourself with your own wealth - as long as you have the money.
Create legal documents: Disable legal games before starting.
Get a health authorisation in place, so that you designate a person you trust to supervise your medical treatment and to ensure that professionals act in line with your wishes in case you can't communicate.
You can also assess a proxy for your finances.
You should select a person you trust to make financial decisions and make sure that your bills are paid if you do not have your own ability.
Don't forget the small details: See that your old parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Could you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Write all these details down in a written plan, so you're ready.
'It's not just the finances it's about, but who's legit?' asked Martin.
‘What kind of medicine is that?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Keep the plan clear.’
Man shots multiple times with guns in Ilfracombe
A man has been shot several times with an air gun in what he was on his way home after a trip to town.
The victim in 40 years was in the area around Oxford Grove in Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
Policy counters describe the shooting, which occurred around 02.30 local time, as an ‘accident action’.
The victim did not see the attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police are asking for a witness.
Soil and tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a powerful earthquake and a tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, says public service officials.
Without communication, no help workers have been given information from Donggala, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the quake, which had a strength of 7.5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster was a fact.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi Province, and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island. The estimated population in 2017 was 379 800.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the quake and the tsunami hit.
Donggala is an area which stretches over 300 km with a coastline northwest of the island.
The area, which is an administrative region lower than a province, had an estimated population of 299 200 in 2017.
Fishing and horticulture are the mainstay of the economy of the Central Sulawesi province, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is and is important in the province, but is mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the other side of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years, following the disaster reduction office in Indonesia.
In 1938 more than 200 people were killed and several hundred houses were destroyed by a tsunami in Donggala.
In 1996, the west side of Donggala was struck by a tsunami that killed nine people.
Indonesia lies in the seismic Age in the Pacific and becomes a smooth frame of earthquakes.
Here are some of the big tremors and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A large quake on the west coast of the Aceh Province in northern Sumatra on December 26, triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of large quakes hit the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and the beginning of April.
Several hundred died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A quake of strength 6.8 struck south in Java, the most populous island in Indonesia, triggering a tsunami crashing into the south coast and killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A quake of strength 7.6 struck near the city of Padang, capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people lost their lives.
2010: One of the Mentawai islands outside Sumatra hit a magnitude 7.5 quake and triggered a tsunami of about 10 meters, which destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A little shiver hit the Pidie Jaya area in Aceh and spring-like destruction and panic when people were reminded of the quake and the tsunami in 2004.
No tsunami was triggered this time, but more than 100 lost their lives due to buildings that crashed.
2018: Great quakes hit the tourist island Lombok and kill more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
Swiftly destroyed several thousand buildings and left several thousand tourists on a temporary beach.
The eldest son of Sarah Palin arrested and targeted for power in the world
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Governor of Alaska and Vice President Sarah Palin, have been arrested, aim for assault.
Following a report released by the Alaska State Police, Palin (29) was arrested after suspicion of domestic violence, involved in the reporting of domestic violence, and to oppose arrest.
Following the police report, he took the phone from a female acquaintance as she tried to call the police to report the crime.
Palin will be in custody in the Mat-Su prison, and will be held against bail $500, reported KTUU.
He showed up in court Saturday and declared himself ‘not guilty’ when he was asked, gave up the network.
Palin is facing three class A offenders, which means he can be imprisoned for up to one year and get $20,000 in fines.
He has also been targeted for a Class B crime, which can be punished with a day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
It's not the first time Palin has been charged with anything criminal.
In December 2017, he was charged with having attacked his father, Todd Palin.
Mora, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
The case is in Alaska's vetting court.
In January 2016, he was targeted at attack in the world, involved in reporting the power of the world and holding a weapon while he was drunk in connection with the event.
His sweetheart had claimed that he beat her in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups after linking the son's electoral behaviour to PTSD that descended from when he was serving in Iraq.
Soil and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of lives lost
At least 384 people have lost their lives after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The breach, with the strength of 7.5, triggered a tsunami and has destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are down, and number of deaths is expected to rise in the next few days.
The earthquake hit just outside the central part of Sulawesi, which lies northeast of the capital Jakarta.
Videos that show the dramatic moment when the quake hits thrive on social media.
Several hundred people had gathered for a beach festival in the town of Palu when the tsunami hit the shore.
Federal actors will rarely have the death penalty for suspects in New York terror.
New York federal actors will have the death penalty for Sayvollo Saipov, suspected of the terror attack that killed eight people -- a rare punishment that hasn't been committed for a federal crime in the state since 1953.
Saipov (30) must have used a rental car from Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bike path along the West Side Highway on the lower Manhattan in October, where he ran down pedestrians and cyclists on the road.
In order to justify a death penalty, the actors must be able to prove that Saipov killed the eight victims "with will" and that he "willfully" inflicted serious bodily harm on them, following a note filed in the southern district of New York.
Both of these events may be the result of a possible death penalty, as stated in the legal document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal jury handed over a list of 22 charges, including eight targets of money extortion, commonly used by federal actors in connection with organized crime, and a screening for the choice and destruction of motor vehicle wear.
The attack called for ‘essential planning and counseling’, said the actors and described the way Saipov carried out the attack as ‘disgusting, cruel and corrupt’.
‘Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov for the cause of injury and loss for family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco’, the note states.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been ten years since the last South District in New York has been sentenced to death on a case by case basis.
The aim, Khalid Barnes, was judged to have killed two baptismal suppliers, but eventually was sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time a death penalty was carried out in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to engage in espionage for the Soviet Union during the cold war two years ago.
On June 19th, 1953, both were executed in the electric chair.
Saipov, the author of Uzbekistan, showed a lack of regret in the days and months that followed, according to legal documents.
He told the detectives that what he had done was well known, said the police.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to perform the attack after watching videos from ISIS on the phone, it says.
He also asked to have the ISIS flag in the hospital room, the police said.
He has declared not guilty at all charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders who represents Saipov, says that they are «clear disappointment» with the decision to be the prosecution authority.
‘We believe that the decision to go after the death penalty, rather than accepting a declaration of guilt for life in prison without possibility of letting go, will only prolong the trauma of the event for all involved,’ said Patton.
The defenders of Saipov had previously asked the actors not to go after the death penalty.
Tory's parliamentarian Nigel Farage should lead Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to ‘mobilise the public army’ today, during a protest at the Tory national meeting.
The former leader of the British Independence Party said that politicians had to “feel the pressure” from the Eurosceptics – one of Theresa May’s MPs suggested that he should rent the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative, merciless parliamentarian Peter Bone told demonstrators in Birmingham that the United Kingdom «had been out» no, if Farage was Brexit's minister.
With the challenge May faces by reconciling its deeply divided rectangles has been underlined by a separate protest in the city, held by Tories who want to stay in the EU.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep the Chequers compromise on track after attacks by Brexiters, Remainers and the EU.
Allierte insists that she will press for an agreement with Brussels, despite the resignation – and force the Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose between her package and her 'chaos'.
Bone told the Leave Means Leaves group in Solihull that he liked to "reject Chequers"
He suggested that Farage should give us a decent rank and be given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had run, we would be out now," he said.
The Member of Parliament from Wellingborough added: 'I will fight for Brexit, but we must reject Chequers'.
To mark his opposition to the EU, he said: ‘We are not fighting world wars to be subordinate.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Bone rejects the claim that the opinion of the people has changed since the 2016 election: ‘The idea that the British people have changed their mind and want to stay is completely false’.
Brexit fighter from Tory, Andrea Jenkyns, also participated in the march. She told the reporters, "I only say, Prime Minister, listen to the people!"
"Chequers is not popular in the population, the opposition is not going to vote for it, it's not popular in our party or our activists who frequent the streets and get us chosen initially.
Please, drop Chequers and listen’
In a message directed to May, she adds: ‘State ministers keep their jobs when they keep what they promise’.
Farage said politicians have to get to know the heat if they're going to betray the decisions that were made in the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's about trust between us - the people - and the political class," he said.
'They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell them that 'we're not going to let them get away with it'.
In a message to the enthusiastic audience, he added: "I want you to get the political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit, to know the heat.
‘We are mobilizing the people’s army in this country that gave us word in Brexit and are not going to sleep until we have become an independent, self-governed, proud United Kingdom.
At the same time, Remainer marched through the streets of Birmingham before holding a totimar meeting in the center.
A handful of activists waved with "Tories Against Brexit" banners after launching the group this weekend.
Labour colleague Lord Adonis made fun of the conservatives for security issues they had with a party app during the opening of the conference.
"This is human beings who tell us that they can have all the computer systems in place and all the technology for Canada plus, for a friction-free limit, for free trade without frontiers in Ireland," he added.
‘It’s a total farce.
There's no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.

Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaching the world title after the stocks give says of Sebastian Vettel
It became clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the team orders from Mercedes came to have a major role in the course.
Bottas got a good start on the race, and let Hamilton take care of himself in defending his position the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack the teammate.
Vettel was first into the depot and sent Hamilton into the traffic at the back of the loop, which should be decided.
The Mercedes ran into the depot a round later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton ported front after some action side-by-side that made the Ferrari driver countervilleg have to leave the inside free in order to not be able to defend himself at the third corner.
Max Verstappen started, on his 21st birthday, on the back row and lay in the seventh place at the end of the first round.
After that, he led much of the race, passing for a quick finish with the goal of passing Kimi Raikkonen, who was in fourth place.
He entered the depot in the 44th round, but couldn't increase the speed of the last eight rounds while the Raikkonen got fourth place.
It's a difficult day, for Valteri did a fantastic job all weekend, and was a real gentleman who let me by.
The team has done an exceptional job that has both first and second," said Hamilton.
It was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump made fun of Senator Diane Feinstein at an election meeting on Saturday because of her insistence that she did not close the letter from Christine Blasey Ford where she appeals to the Supreme Court-nominated Brett Kavanaugh for sexual assault.
During a speech at a election meeting in West Virginia, the president did not mention the witness case of Ford had given the Senate directly, but also commented that what goes on in the Senate showed that people were ‘bad and bad and talk untrue’.
"The only thing that can happen, and the beautiful thing that has happened the last days in the Senate, when you see the mind, when you see people who are angry and bad and uncomfortable and talk untrue," he said.
'When you look at publications and leaks and say, 'Oh, I didn't.
I didn't do it."
Do you think so?
Dianne Feinstein, did you paint it?
Do you imagine her answer... close your document--"Oh, eh, what?
Oh, no.
I don't paint it."
Please wait a moment.
Lak me... no, we don't paint it,” he added, while he imitated the senator.
Feinstein received the letter with details of the charges against Kavanaugh from Ford in July, and it was played earlier in September--but Feinstein refused to play to get out of her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's advocates, I didn't finish her story," said Feinstein to the committee, according to The Hill.
‘She asked me to keep it confidential, and I kept it confidential, which she asked for.’
But her neckties did not fall in good soil with the president, who commented on it at Saturday's election meeting: "I say to you, it was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen."
While he persists in defending the Supreme Court nominee, who has been accused of foolish sexual behavior by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats used the charges for their own gain.
'They are determined to take power back in all ways they see necessary.
You see the ambiguity, the decency, they don't care who hurts, who they must run over to get power and control," said the president of the following Mediaite.

Pilots lose their lives to ensure that hundreds of aircraft escape earthquakes
A airliner in Indonesia will be hailed as a hero after he lost his life in what he continues to ensure that a multi-hundred-passenger aircraft got safely up in the air.
More than 800 people have lost their lives and many are missing after a large earthquake hit Sulawesi Island and triggered a tsunami Friday.
Strong aftershocks continue to disturb the area, and there are many who are trapped in wrecks in the city of Palu.
But despite the fact that his colleagues fled for life, Anthonius Gunawan Agung (21) refused to leave his post in the control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu, although it swinged wild.
He remained to make sure that the plane on the runway, Batik Air Flight 6321, took off safely.
He then jumped down from the control tower as he thought it collapsed.
He died later in the hospital.
The spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said that the decision may have scared hundreds of lives, reported ABC News Australia.
We send a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in a larger town.
Unfortunately, he went away this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
‘This is heartrending,’ he added.
In the meantime, authorities are afraid of a number of deaths will increase to thousands, while the country’s crisis relief agency says that access to the small towns of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is restricted.
"The number of dead people increases while we find bodies trapped under buildings. Many of them we can't reach," said the bureaucrat Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves of up to six meters have destroyed Palu, who is to keep a mass grave track on Sunday.
Emergency aid comes in with military and commercial aircraft.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, said to Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance comes with multiple bodies.
It's hard to find clean water.
Small shops have been robbed.’»
Jan Gelfand, the leader of the Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is trying to help the survivors, but we don't know what they will find when they arrive.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse."
The President of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, came to Palu on Sunday and said to the military In the country, "I'm asking everyone to work around the clock to do everything they can to help with the evacuation.
Are they clear?’ reported CNN.
Indonesia was killed earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok, and 550 people died.
Aircraft controlled in Micronesia: Air Niugini now reports man missing after lagoon flight control
The air carrier that operated an aeroplane that ran in a lagoon in Micronesia, the Pacific Ocean, reports that a man is missing, after having previously stated that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the aeroplane before it sank.
Air Niugini said that from Saturday afternoon they don't know where the human passenger is.
The airline said they work with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The air carrier no longer provided details about the passenger, and its age and nationality are unknown.
Local boat owners helped save other passengers and crews after the plane hit the water as it tried to land at the airport on the island of Chuuk.
The authorities stated on Friday that seven people have been sent to hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday, and everyone was in stable condition.
It is still unknown what the spring crash is and what actually she is.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon not far from the runway.
Some witnesses believed that the plane flew past the runway.
The American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was very low.
"That was extremely good," said Jaynes.
Jaynes added that he and other passengers were able to water through the water, which led them up to life, to the emergency exits on the plane before it sank.
He said the flight crew had panic and screams, and he incurred a head injury that was not serious.
The American Navy said that sailors nearby, working to repair a berth, also frightened passengers with a rubber boat that they used to carry passengers to land before the plane sank at about 30 meters.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network website shows that 111 people have died in the controls of PNG-registered airlines in the last 20 years, but none of those flights with Air Niugini.
Analysts make timeline overnight when women became burning alive
The prosecution authority presented all the evidence on Saturday under the anchor case for a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice's analyst Paul Rowlett testifies for hours as an expert witness in intelligence analysis.
He produced for the jury how he put together recordings from cell phones to find out what she was doing at night when Jessica Chambers (19) was killed by the accused, Quinton Tellis (29).
According to The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett said he used location data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was together with Chambers' evening she died, in contrast to what Tellis explained earlier.
When the location data showed that Tellis' cell phone was with Chambers' cell phone while he said that he was with friend Michael Sanford, the police pulled to talk to Sanford.
Sanford witnessed on Saturday and said he was out of town that day.
Then the prosecution asked Tellis if he told the truth when he said that he was in Sanford's car that night, said Sanford, "slaughter, because my car was in Nashville."
Another objection was that Tellis said that he had known Chambers in about two weeks when she died.
But their cell phone calculations showed that they only knew each other in a week.
Rowlett said that a while after Chambers died, Tellis deleted messages, conversations, and Chambers' contact information from his mobile phone.
'He deleted her from his life,' said Hale.
The defence shall close the case on Sunday.
The judge said he's expecting legal proceedings to go to the jury later the same day.

Another black person?!
New York Children's Passport sues couples for kicking for 'racial' text message
A babysitter in New York is suing a couple to fire her on the basis of discrimination after she got a misguided text message from her mother who complained that she was “only a black person.”
The couple have denied that they are racist and have compared the prosecution to ‘expression’.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two, was dissatisfied when she saw that the babysitter she had appointed, Giselle Maurice, was black when she got to work for the first time in 2016.
“NEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEY, ONLY A STARCH PERSON,” wrote the Plasco-Flaxman in a text message to her husband.
But instead of sending the message to her husband, he sent her to the babysitter Maurice, twice.
After realizing her mistake, the inappropriate Plasco-Flaxman fired the babysitter Maurice, and said that the previous babysitter, who was African-American, had done a bad job, so now she wanted someone from the Philippines, according to The New York Post.
Maurice was paid for one day's work before they sent her home in a Uber.
Now, Maurice is suing the couple for compensation for having fired her, and she wants $350 a day for six months for the job she should have had, even if it was without a contract, where she was going to be a job with the family.
"I'll show them that it's not okay to do this," she said to The New York Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple have denied that they are racists, and said that to fire Maurice was the only thing they could do after having offended her, because they were afraid she was going to take revenge.
"My wife had sent something to her that she didn't mean to say.
She's not a racist.
We're not racists," said the husband Joel Plasco to The New York Post.
'But would you let someone you've offended take care of your children, even if you didn't mean to insult them?
Your newborn baby?
Think about it."
Plasco compared the prosecution with ‘pressing’, and said that his wife was seven months pregnant and was in a ‘very difficult situation’.
‘Are you really going to take a person in such a situation?
It's not a nice thing to do," said the investor Plasco.
While the case is going on, the public has been quick to judge the couple on social media, criticizing them for their behavior and logic.
The publisher behind Paddington's books was afraid that people wouldn't like a talking bear, revealing a new letter.
The daughter of author Michael Bond, who was born shortly after the first book was accepted, commented: ‘It’s hard to see what it was like to read the book for the first time before it was published.
It is very fun to know now how successful Paddington was.»
Jankel said that her father, who worked as a cameraman for the BBC before he was inspired to write the children's book about the little teddy bear, would be optimistic even if the book had been rejected.
When it applies to Paddington, as she described as a “very important member of the family,” she added that her father was proud of the inside of his great success.
"He was a rather quiet man, and he never shrieked," she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having kids who got something: you'll be proud of them, even if you're not really behind it.
I think he saw Paddington's success that way.
Even though it was his creature and imagination, he always gave all praise to Paddington himself."
My daughter would die and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
When she landed, the daughter was taken to the hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice in all haste, where doctors work in vain to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to say that it was really bad, that they didn't think she was going to do it," said Ednan-Laperouse.
"So Nad called to say that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I'm so happy with you, dear.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be right there.
The medical doctors had given her to keep her heart pumping slowly out of her system.
She had already died and now the body was about to turn itself off.
I just sat there, knowing that this happened.
I couldn't cuddle or scream, because I was in a room surrounded by families and people.
I really had to keep everything.”
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, who was now making sure of the loss of her daughter, had to board the plane with other passengers who didn't know what she had just gone through.
"No one knew anything," she said.
‘I sat with my head bent while my tears fell.’
It's hard to explain, but it was on the plane that I knew how much sympathy I had for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how happy he was."
Suffering women hang on the bridge to prevent suicide
Two women who lost their loved ones who took suicide try to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have sticky notes on a bridge in Wales to inspire and get people who are going to kill themselves to change their mind and call the numbers on their notes.
Davis' son Tyler was 13 years old when he started struggling with depression and took his life when he was 18.
"I don't want any parent to know what I know every day."
Davis, who is 45 years old and caged in Lydney, said her son was a talented cook with a smile that infected.
"Everybody knew him because of his smile.
They said that his smile brightened up all the rooms."
But before he died he ended up at work, for he was at a "real dark place."
In 2014, the 11-year-old brother of Tyler was the first to find Tyler after he had taken his own life.
Davis said, ‘I am still concerned that the weasel brother may have been affected by Tyler’s death.’
Davis wrote the notes 'for people to know that there are other people out there who care and who they can talk to, even if it's a friend.
Not there alone – you need to talk to someone.”
Humphreys, who has been our friend of Davis for many years, lost her partner Mark after they had been together for 15 years and he had recently lost his mother's mind.
"He never told me he was tired or depressed or anything," she said.
«A few days before Christmas we noticed that he began to behave differently.
He was in the basement emotionally on Christmas 1st, when the children opened their gifts he didn't look at those entrances.»
She said that his death was very traumatic to the children, and they continued to work through the trauma: "There is a large void in our family now.
We're completely broken.
But we must all fight to live on."

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in a thin thread while the FBI starts the investigation
‘I thought that if we actually got something similar to what he asked for — a limited investigation — maybe we could achieve some solitude,” said Flake on Saturday, adding that he was afraid of the Committee ‘jointly’ in the middle of a partisan-backlock.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
They hesitate because of the timing.
The U.S. averages are only five weeks away, November 6, and if the Republicans don't do well, this will make it difficult for them to choose Kavanaugh in the U.S. Supreme Court.
George W. Bush has called senators to get them to support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House of Bush and was introduced to his wife Ashley in that way, then has been the secretary of Bush.
What happens when the FBI presents its report?
They're going to shake in the Senate, 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It's still unclear if Kavanaugh is able to collect at least 50 voices in the Senate.
Number of decapsulations in North Korea "decreasing" below Kim
The number of North Korean deportees to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, reports a South Korean legislator
Park Byeong-zeug referred to data from the South Korean Department of Association, and said there were 1127 dehoppers last year – compared to 2706 in 2011.
Park said that stricter boundaries between North Korea and China and more expensive smuggling charges are the main reasons why the number has fallen.
Pyongyang hasn't spoken publicly.
Most of the North Korean couples get South Korean citizenship.
Seoul reports that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed borders illegally since the end of the Korea War in 1953.
Most flights via China, which have the longest North Korea border and are easier to cross than the strictly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Korean countries.
China views depopulation as illegal immigrants and not as refugees, and often sends them back with coercion.
The relations between North and South Korea – which are still technically at war – have improved in recent months.
This month, the leaders of the two countries in Pyongyang met to negotiate the disarmament of nuclear weapons.
After the historic meeting in June between U.S. president Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, there were some of them working for an atomic-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho owed the United States not to achieve anything since then.
"Without being able to trust the United States, we cannot trust that our country is safe, and in such a situation we cannot disarm our weapons first," said Ri in a speech in the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh hysterical, saying he can't count in the Supreme Court
Minority leader Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh, who is nominate to the Supreme Court, "hysterical" and said he has too much temperament to tender in the U.S. Supreme Court.
Pelosi calls Kavanaugh hysterical in an interview during the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas, on Saturday.
‘I know that if a woman had behaved that way, she would have been called ‘hysterical,’ said Pelosi about the testimony to Kavanaugh in front of the Senate Court on Thursday.
Kavanaugh was emotional and refused all charges that he sexually harassed Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
In the opening speech of Kavanaugh, he was very emotional and yelled at times with lumps in his throat as he told about his family and years in passing.
He criticized the democrats in the committee, and called the charges against him “a grand and planned attack on his reputation,” organized by liberal politicians who were angry that Hillary Clinton did not win the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi added that she believes Kavanaugh's testimony proves that he can't count on the Supreme Court, because it shows that he's prejudiced against Democrats.
"I believe the way he behaved he disqualified, and what he said about the Clinton family and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi objected when she was asked if she would try to get Kavanaugh to leave if he was elected to the Supreme Court, and if the Democrats reach the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I can say this -- if he doesn't tell Congress or the FBI the truth, he can't stand in the Supreme Court, nor in the court he's now thinking," added Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is a judge of Washington D.C.'s federal appeal court.
Pelosi also said that as a democrat he is concerned about potential judgments from Kavanaugh against the law known as Obamacare and the case of Roe vs. Wade, because Kavanaugh is known to be a conservative judge.
In the hearings to confirm Kavanaugh, he did not answer questions about whether he was going to reverse certain decisions in the Supreme Court.
"It's not the right time for a hysterical, prejudiced person in the Supreme Court to expect us to say he's great," said Pelosi.
And women must swing the sword
It's a fair, bitter criticism, after months and years of rage, and she can't get it out without crying.
"We cried when we were angry," Steinem told me 45 years later.
'I don't think that's unusual, do you think?'
She continued, "I got a lot of help from a woman in a high company position, who said that she saw when she was angry, but developed a technique where she said to the person who made her so angry that she did, "You might think I'm sorry because I cried.
I am angry."
And then she just keeps going.
I thought it was brilliant.
Tears work as a way to get the mind out, but there are many who misunderstand.
In one of my strongest memories from a former job, where most of my colleagues were men, I was in a situation where I saw my mind, and a woman who was older than me took me to the neck – she was a cold leader for whom I had always been saved – and pulled me out at the same time.
'Never let them see you cry,' she said to me.
"They don't know you're furious.
They think you're sad and they won because they made you cry."
Patricia Schroeder, who at the time was a congresswoman, a Colorado democrat, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaigns.
In 1987 Hart was taken into account on a boat called Monkey Business, and withdrew from the campaign. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, thought that she could as well make choices as President himself.
"I had not really thought through it well enough," she said to me while she laughed, 30 years later.
‘There were already seven other candidates who made choices, and the last one they needed was another candidate.
Some refer to the situation as «Snow White and the Seven Dwarves».
Since the campaign had already taken a while, she had not collected enough money, so she promised that she would only be quiet if she could collect $2 million.
It was impossible.
She discovered that her supporters who gave $1,000 to men only gave her $250.
'Do you think I'm getting a discount?' she asked.
When she declared that she did not come to make choices anyway, she was so emotional and full of gratitude to those who had supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to collect money and aim for the smokers in the place of the shared streets, and anger against sexual discrimination, that she began to cry during the speech.
'You should have threatened me with a nervous breakdown,' said Schroeder about how the press reacted when she saw a branch.
"You should think Kleenex was my main sponsor.
I think I'm thinking, what are they going to write on my gravestone?

How the trade war between the United States and China can be good for Beijing
The opening salvane in the trade war between the United States and China was islandish, and while the battle continued, a rift between the two countries can be an advantage to Beijing in a long time, says experts.
U.S. president Donald Trump shot the first shot this year in taxing important Chinese export goods, including photovoltaic panel, steel and aluminium.
The battle escalated this week, with tariffs on articles worth over $200 billion, which in effect means that half of all goods from China to the United States are taxed.
Beijing has taken its backs and set a tariff rate of between five and ten percent on American goods worth $60 billion.
China has promised to respond to the United States every time they shoot the guys off, and the second largest economy in the world is most likely not to go down with the first.
To get Washington to stop, China has to do what the United States wants, but bowing to the United States is too embarrassed for Xi Jinping, president of China.
Nevertheless, experts say that if Beijing keeps its head cold, the US press can have a positive effect on the Chinese economy in the long term, by reducing the degree of dependence between the two economies.
‘The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can make both economies go under is more dangerous than people have the power to admit before,’ said Abigail Grace, a researcher who focuses on Asia at the Center for American Security, a think tanker.
Syria 'ready' for return of refugees, says the Foreign Minister
Syria says they are ready to accept refugees who will return voluntarily, and ask for help to rebuild the country that has been destroyed after more than seven years in war.
Speaking to the General Assembly of the United Nations, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that relations in the country are progressing.
‘Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure, thank you for the progress made in the fight against terrorism’ he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by terrorists in order to regain normal areas.
All provisions are now in place to allow refugees to return voluntarily to the country they had to travel in from the base of terrorism and unilateral financial measures that exceeded daily life and livelihood.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million acids have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
More than six million people in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government would like to receive help to rebuild the devastated country.
But he stressed that they were not going to accept assistance or help with conditions from countries that sponsored the rebellion.
Europe safer says in Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the Ryder Cup 2018 when they defeated the American team with a final score of 16.5 versus 10.5 in Le Golf National, except for Paris in France.
The United States has now lost six times in a row on European soil, and they have not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe took back the heads of the team of the Danish captain, Thomas Bjørn, reached the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, tossed most of the tournament. He hit the ball in the water from the tea by hole 16, par 3, and therefore gave the saying to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari did well in all his rounds and became one of four players who have ever got 5-0-0 since the tournament started its current format in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was turned off 5/4 by the player with the lowest ranking on the European team, Danish Thorbjørn Olesen.
Dustin Johnson, with the world's highest rank, was 2 and 1 by the English Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
The Spanish veteran Sergio Garcia, who has participated in eight Ryder Cupar, became the most winning European with 25.5 points in career.
'Of course I didn't cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a tough year.
So grateful that Thomas chose me and believed me.
I am so, so happy to get the trophy back.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I could help," said an emotional Garcia, following the European saying.
He passes the stick sticker to the compatriot John Ram, who beat the American golf legend Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in single games on Sunday.
"I know a tremendous pride in hitting Tiger Woods, I am raised to look at him," said Rahm (23).
Woods lost all four of his matches in France, and now has a 13-21-3 I Ryder Cup up through the career.
A strange statistics from one of the world's best players, who have won 14 big titles and are only turned off by Jack Nicklaus.
The American team struggled to find the fairway all weekend, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who impressed with high-level golf throughout the tournament.
Jim Furik, the American captain, spoke out after a disappointing show from his team. "I'm proud of these boys, they fight.
It was periods this morning that we made it hot for Europe.
I'm out of here.
Hats off for Thomas.
He's a remarkable captain.
All his 12 players played very well.
We're going to group again, I'm going to work with PGA in America and our Ryder Cup committee and get us on the move.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be captain.
One must take off the hat.
We were played around."
