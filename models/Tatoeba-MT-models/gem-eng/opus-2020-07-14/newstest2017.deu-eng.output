28-year-old chef found dead in San Francisco Mall
A 28-year-old cook who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stairwell of a local shopping mall.
The victim's brother said that he can't imagine anyone who'd want to hurt him, "Finally it went up again with him."
The body found in the Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning was identified as the 28-year-old Frank Galicia from San Francisco, and reported the forensics department in San Francisco.
The San Francisco Police Department said that death was classified as murder and the investigations are under way.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told the ABS Sender KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who worked as a chef in Boston earlier six months ago, had finished his dream job as a cook at the Sons & Daughters Restaurant in San Francisco.
A speaker of the Son & Daughter said that they were "shocked and destroyed on the ground" about his death.
"We're a small team working like a close family and we're going to miss him painfully," the speaker continued.
Our thoughts and our condolences are in this difficult time with Frank's family and friends.
Louis Galicia said that Frank was first living in hostels, but that, "the things for him finally went uphill."
"He found an apartment, he had a girlfriend," said Louis Garcia KGO.
Louis Galicia said he couldn't imagine anyone trying to hurt his younger brother.
He was a kind person with a big heart.
His way of connecting with his family was to always cook us something, prepare us dinner," said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to participate in any kind of conflict.
He was the brother who swam with the power.
"With everything that went wrong in the world, he was this uncut diamond, which brightly lit every day," he said.
Anyone who has information about the case is asked to call the SFPD's call number 415-575-4444.
Jennifer Aniston: I'm always stuck in drawers
Jennifer Aniston doesn't always have to be perfect or successful.
The Hollywood star has made this clear in an interview.
"I'll always be stuck in drawers or get stuck from outside label, which usually have little to do with me and reality."
"I myself do not want to be perfect and always successful."
"Truly, these things are rather clever to me."
Jennifer Aniston (47) can only laugh at the fact that she is considered "Miss Perfect", as she explains in the current "Cosmopolitan".
The actress prefers to spend her time at home, form television with loose dutt and Mexican food, says the magazine.
To the white glow, she asks the question about the child's desire: "We women don't have to be married or have children to be perfect," says the Hollywood star.
In her new film "Mother's Day - Love is not a children's game" Aniston can be seen as a single mother of two sons.
The film will be running with us from August 25th.
Golfer Langer receives the sport pyramid
His experiences on the horse are manageable.
At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer, with some colleagues, sought a little change with a ride on the beach.
It was a premiere for the 58-year-olds.
CHIO: "Golden Sport Pyramid" for Bernhard Langer
After a few minutes, the horses remembered their holiday evening, hunting home for food troughs in the fast gallop.
One kilometer at this pace, I was afraid.
"It wasn't a good experience," says Langer.
And then the riding career ended again.
On Saturday Germany's best golfer of all time - 101 tournament victory - was back in the vicinity of horses.
He was guided by his family over the ALRV plant, and on a horse he did not even swing for photo purposes.
Longer was the first time in Aachen and with it also at the CHIO.
The reason was quite convincing.
The German sports aid provided the golden pyramid to the man from Anhausen in the context of a small gala.
There is no shortage of awards to the sympathetic athlete.
Federal Cross of Merit, Silver Lorberblatt, Champions-Tour-Player of the year...
Even the British Queen raised him.
Langer is the 18th prize winner of the sports pyramid.
On Saturday he met Hans Günter Winkler, first prizewinner in Aachen.
"This award means a lot to me," says Langer, "because it will not only be awarded for sporting successes, but also for social engagement."
Langer has been promoting young people for decades.
And so he also passed on the prize money of 25,000 euros immediately.
With 15 other outstanding athletes, the two-time US champion was recorded in the "Hall of Fame of German Sports" on Saturday.
Among the outstanding are the athletes Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the Turner Eberhard Gienger, the Fechter Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the rower Peter-Michael Kolbe, Bob-driver Meinhard Nehmer, the Judoka Frank Wieneke, the jumper Alwin Schockemöhle and posthumous handballer Erhard Wunderlich.
Many of these sports legends had come to Aachen on Saturday.
After the official part, the illustrious society moved to the Spring Stadium, where the Lavazza Prize ran.
Bernhard Langer kept his distance from the big animals.
Clinton and Trump's economic policy compared: It's all about the money
Investing in infrastructure and preventing the trade agreement TTP - that is what Clinton as well as Trump want.
However, the two US Presidential candidates disagree on tax and energy policy as well as on a fundamental issue.
The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are based on a fundamental, rather philosophical difference.
The one about the role of the state.
Trump wants to keep them in doubt rather small and warns how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations.
Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate to death, he says.
He himself would be quite different, says Trump.
It will reduce regulation massively, and it will make it strong for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private individuals and for businesses.
Clinton, on the other hand, says: The state has certain tasks to fulfil, it has to open up disadvantaged opportunities and needs money for it.
That is why taxes would be increased for the rich, she says.
Interestingly, both are very close to the topic of infrastructure.
Trump and Clinton say almost literally.
The democratic candidate has even announced the largest investment in new jobs since World War II.
State investment programmes in infrastructure are classical democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the state-critical tea party wing of Republicans.
So Trump could still have some internal discussions.
The differences in energy and climate policy are more pronounced.
Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and raise coal production in the USA.
Oil promotion should also be possible in previously protected areas, and the Paris Climate Change Agreement will be terminated.
Clinton, on the other hand, wants to expand the renewable energies with its investment programme explicitly and demands: "A country will be the superpower of clean energies and create millions of jobs."
"It will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want us to be it."
But not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far apart.
TPP, the Trans-Pacific Trade Agreement, does not intend to sign both.
At the same time, however, both the US do not want to isolate from international trade - but simply better protect American jobs.
They should then also be paid better, calls for Clinton.
The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a hunger wage.
She wants to raise him to 15 dollars an hour.
What Trump wants to do in this matter is not quite clear: Once he says, the minimum wage has to be raised, he says he shouldn't be changed.
However, the major discussion of the coming months is likely to develop around the tax policy of the two camps.
On the one hand, Trump wants to relieve the economy and the citizens in order to stimulate growth.
His critics prevent him from making the budget deficit even bigger.
On the other hand, Clinton, who wants at least to demand from the rich that they pay more taxes, and whose critics say that more taxes are not the solution either.
Escape: "Every fledgling woman has experiences of sexual violence"
Sexual violence belongs to women who flee alone, almost to everyday life.
When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized.
A house offers refuge.
Four women sit in a large kitchen.
Everyone has a baby that is at least one year old.
One put her little son in her arm.
He looks curiously into the room with big eyes.
His mother stares at the tabletop.
Until she realizes she's being watched.
She smiles briefly and kisses the little one.
The scene is normal.
Until you talk to Katrin Bahr.
She is the district manager of Condrobs, a social assistance provider in Bavaria, and deals with women on the run, among other things.
The four women in the kitchen are refugees.
They live in the north of Munich in one of the few decentralized accommodations for women and their children in Bavaria.
In January, Condrobs opened the facility together with Pro Familia and Munich's women's aid.
She was recently officially opened.
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.
There are no men - neither as visitors.
The exception is a guard at the front door.
"It is not exaggerated to say that every woman who arrives here has had experiences of sexual violence on her escape," says Bahr.
"Men flee for wars because they are politically persecuted because they are suffering torture or death or because their families send them to Europe as a hope bearer," she says.
In women, other reasons for escape prevail: "Many secretly steal from it because they see no other way out".
In their home country they have experienced sexual violence, coercion, genocide, slavery, or forced prostitution.
That's what keeps her going.
On the run, this continues.
"For example, the fact that a bottle of water requires sexual action is not a rarity," says Bahr.
And the women are alone, they are not protected by their families.
Who thinks that the end as soon as they arrive in Germany is wrong, says Bahr.
Even here, single women in refugee accommodation would often be viewed as inferior and, in the worst case, abused.
This leads to the traumatisation of about 90 percent of women living in the accommodation in the north of Munich, she estimates.
"Some of the children are certainly not born voluntarily".
Many women are so used to saying nothing.
"Or they do not trust to speak openly about the experienced because the shame is too great".
Since they often do not know how to help themselves, Bahr demands more accommodation for them.
In Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees.
On the question of whether they knew of a similar project as in Munich in their area of competence, some respond with No.
For example, there is no such thing in government accommodation in the upper leg and upper forks.
Even in Schwaben only fled women are not accommodated separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, press spokesman for the government.
In Upper Bavaria, Lower and Middle Franconia there are floors or private houses in some community accommodation only for single women and their children.
The exception is Niederbayern, where there are two central accommodation exclusively for women.
The Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality in the European Parliament also calls for women to be accommodated separately from men.
In a study published for the Committee, it says: "It is very important that men and women are accommodated separately."
"If the privacy or if men and women are accommodated together, violence against women may occur - continually."
In particular, washrooms should be separated and easily accessible to women, see the study.
How much the women feel about this need for protection can be read at the rush there is on the house in Munich.
"Since we've been talking about it, we have a long waiting list," says Bahr.
You could easily open a second house.
Assistants strike: calls for new labour-related measures
Representatives of the assistants have called on their union to approve new labour-fighting measures in their disputes regarding a new contract.
The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has called on its entire Council to approve more labour-related measures from the beginning of September.
The JDC stated that ministers had failed to address the concerns about the treaty.
Assistant doctors and medical students voted in July on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BMA.
It was rejected by 58% of its members who voted in the elections.
In a letter to the members who were posted on Twitter on Thursday evening, the chairman of the JDC Ellen McCourt said that the government had remained "consistently calm" to problems, which led to the rejection of the contract.
She said: "In view of this, the JDC Executive Board has voted to reject the proposed new treaty completely and to request official renegotiations on all your concerns."
In response to the government's silence, the JDC Executive Board today made a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve an ongoing programme of escalating labour action beginning in early September.
The disputes led assistant doctors to strike six times this year, the first total failure in the history of the NHS.
The head of the BMA Assistant Doctor Dr. Johann Malawana retired after the election to reject the agreed contractual terms recommended by the BMA.
He informed BMA members during the meetings, which were held before the vote by 54,000 assistant doctors and medical students, that the contract should be advantageous and accepted.
After the vote, Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said that the contract for doctors would be introduced in England.
Russia and Turkey: An "Ally of Outsiders"?
It was a gesture that ended a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and to announce an official end to the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of the St. Petersburg Palace, I cannot deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most.
There was a handshake, yes.
But Putin's smiles seemed slippery and he barely radiated warmth, even for his restraining circumstances.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, spoke repeatedly about his "love friend" Putin - according to a report quite five times.
I couldn't count it anymore.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but will even improve.
The next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan had behaved as if nothing bad had ever happened.
His enthusiasm seemed to me rather the opposite.
However, one of Putin's exuberant, sustainable cooling showed that Russia's head of state had forgotten nothing.
Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduction words: the firing of a Russian fighter aircraft at the Syrian border through Turkey.
Moscow's reaction at the time was brutal.
Putin told us and accused Ankara of falling into the back of Russia.
The crime was even greater, as it was committed by a supposed friend.
Rebuilding the service will be difficult if not even impossible.
The public opinion in Russia has changed since November.
For months, the state-controlled media carried out a violent, unlimited attack on Ankara.
Suddenly it seemed that the Turks were to blame for everything.
The most serious were the allegations by senior officials that Erdogan's own family would have benefited from the illegal oil trade in Syria's territories controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He has disputed this vehemently.
But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.
Finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received the apology he wanted to hear from President Erdogan.
Russia could make a kind of victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of a ceasefire are clear.
Erdogan needs first of all all all the friends he can get after he was almost removed in a failed coup d'état last month.
Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.
But there are also economic motives.
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - in particular the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.
The number has fallen by almost 90%.
In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when the flights are resumed.
They count on a late-season storm on the Mediterranean.
This week the state television forecast cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again.
A report in Vedemosti put it this way: "Tourists there long, tomatoes long here."
But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry on the West because it regards its reaction to the attempted takeover of power as a weak response.
In addition, the continuing resentment over the snail pace of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is determined to take advantage of the cool mood and to reduce Turkey's relationship with the West.
The Russian head of state certainly won a bonus in Ankara for demanding support for the elected state agencies after the attempted coup.
This is a matter of course for Moscow, which itself has a deep-seated fear of regime change.
The summit meeting in this glamorous seafront palace allowed Russia and Turkey to present, as I once described, an analyst, "Alliance of outsiders": two countries that are in violation of the West and feel ill treated and now allied.
Nevertheless, despite public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two.
The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently played the role of peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.
It could be significant that after almost three hours of first talks, both presidents said at the press conference that they had not even addressed the issue.
The President of Turkey deliberately refused to answer a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasise them.
There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.
But after months of open hostilities - and given the potential for a complete disaster when NATO member Turkey shot down the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state at least talk to each other again.
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside Scotland no longer available
According to the CEO of the Bank, the RBS brand is only to be reduced to a back office roll.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan informed BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was connected to the Bank's global ambitions.
Since then, the bank has distanced itself when it had to be almost collapsed and rescued eight years ago.
During this time, brand strategies "RBS" used to protect other end-user financial brands.
She supported international sport with millions of pounds of sponsorship, from Six Nations Rugby to Wimbledon winner Andy Murray.
But now she has decided to focus more national brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland, but will not be initialized.
In England and Wales, all RSB references, the decentralised headquarters and the stock market listing will switch to NatWest.
The brand Ulster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller brands for the retail business that will gain more importance - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a visit by customers and employees in Inverness-shire.
He told the BBC Scotland: "The brand RSB will become our investor brand as well as the brand under which our employees will be employed as we become more a bank of brands."
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
I am now saying that we are not pursuing global goals but local goals.
Each of these brands will stand for something completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with customers under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will no longer continue its Six Nations sponsorship and that it will increase the perceptibility of the different brands in its sports sponsorship.
"It is time for us to develop into the Bank of the Brands, because how do we focus on making this a better bank for customers inside (we have asked)?" said the CEO.
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and would have launched these brands.
But with our work, the focus on customer needs and not our own, I think you will see many changes.
We can relaunch these brands, so I think the time has come.
Frankie Dettori wins his 3,000th prize at Newmarket on Predilection
Dettori sprays champagne after a double at Newmarket, which brings him 3,000th prize
The Jockey Frankie Dettori won his 3,000th British prize at Newmarket on Friday.
He put on predilection, trained by John Gosden, on his local race track with his second win of the night a milestone.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey that reaches the milestone in the flat race.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddry and Willie Carson.
The three-time winner Dettori, who won before on Ghayyar, said, "It's something special."
I'm very emotional because my family is here too
I'm very happy that it happened at Newmarket because I landed here 30 years ago.
It's not a big meeting, it's not Royal Ascot - it's a musical Friday night with 20,000 people.
I'm relieved and very modest.
Dettori picks up the jubilee when he brings victory to Predilection
Two jockeys have reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time winner Sir Anthony McCoy, who achieved more than 4,300 wins in a record-breaking career.
Lester Piggott, the nine-time Derby winner had 4,493 career victories
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of modernism and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone that only a few have reached before him.
It has style and is strong, but it is its tactical intellect that distinguishes it from the others in the weight control room.
He is a fantastic ambassador for racing, his enthusiasm and charisma have been inspiring fans for this sport for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that he had already made 6,000 winnings if he was not just a weekend and big tournament jockey!
Frankie's been in GB for almost 30 years, which is great.
He has a living personality, which is good for a British race, but in addition he is an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dismount
From Flying Finishes to Flying Dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the flagship of the British flat race for two decades.
It was nervous.
A whole series of big tournament winnings, including its famous "Glorious Seven" 1996 in Ascot, but he also survived an aircraft crash and received a drug ban.
Three years ago, he was in trouble when he returned from his six-month barrier, but he showed an impressive strength in defiance of his twins and returning to his best form.
And he hasn't ended for a long time - Dettori once said that he wants to continue in competitions until his 50th or more years of age.
Russia's Putin fired Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly dismissed his Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov was part of Putin's closest circle of trust for many years.
The 63-year-old was appointed Special Representative for Environment and Transport.
In a statement by the Kremlin it is that Putin had ordered "the dismissal of Ivanov from his duties as chairman of the Russian Presidency without stating any reason".
Anton Vaino, who has been Ivanov's deputy since 2012, was appointed as his successor.
Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in 1972 in the Estonian capital Tallinn, he graduated from the renowned Moscow Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Embassy in Tokyo.
On the Kremlin website (in Russian) it says that he was later Head of the Protocol and Chief of Staff of the Government Staff.
He said to Putin about his appointment, "Thank you for your trust."
I think it is the government's most important task to support your work as head of state on draft laws and controls to implement your instructions.
Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his post and had recommended Vaino as his successor.
Do the smiling faces convince?
This step has made Moscow a mystery entourage.
Sergei Ivanov was one of the closest trusted Vladimir Putins for a long time and works as he does for the Soviet intelligence service, the KGB.
As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, who was broadcast on television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff resigns at his own request.
But despite the smile for the cameras, there are few convinced here - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
So is this the result of some kind of power struggle?
Nobody knows that at the moment.
But the official claim - that a man who was once praised as a potential president would suddenly want to direct Russian environmental policy - was a big sceptic.
In his comments to Putin, quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said "it is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 to entrust me with these very complicated posts - you could almost say - difficult posts for four years.
As it turns out, I have been Chairman of the Russian Bureau for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took up the post in December 2011.
Previously, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, a former member of the KGB State Security Service.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed as his alternate.
When Putin came to power, he called Ivanov one of the five people he trusted the most.
It was once assumed that Ivanov could become President of Russia after Putin's second term, as a third term of office would have violated the Constitution.
But this post was taken by another close ally Putin's, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became Prime Minister before he became president three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds Star Thomas Gibson fired after he hit producers
Gibson was involved in a physical fight last month on the set of the series in Los Angeles.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, who produce the series, announced their termination in a joint opinion.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized publicly on Thursday before announcing his announcement.
On the set, there were artistic differences and disagreements.
I regret the incident," he said in a communication.
Details of how the character of Gibsons from the series that follows a team of FBI agents are expected to be published at a later date, according to the opinion of ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
The 54-year-old, who previously played in the Sitcom Dharma & Greg, has been on the show since the first season of the series in 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds and I've been in my heart's blood for the past twelve years," said Gibson in a Friday announcement.
I had hoped to be there until the end, but that will no longer be possible.
I would just like to thank the authors, producers, actors, our wonderful crew and, above all, the best fans you can only wish for a series.
The planned broadcast of the twelfth season is scheduled for 28 September.
Puzzles about fish that landed in the garden in Banff
A resident of Banff asked for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain thinks that the 75 fish could be sandals spewed out by a fountain.
Mr. Bain, who lives about 500 meters from the sea, published on Periscope a video of the spectacle in the hope that someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two-inch fish.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connected to Fife
The £1.35 billion expensive project will be completed by May 2017
Engineers have connected the northern deck of the Queensferry Crossings to the Viaduct - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.
It is the first of four closures of the "deck blower" that approach the completion around each of the three towers of the bridge.
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 screw ropes.
The £1.35 billion expensive project will be completed by May 2017.
Minister for Economic Affairs Keith Brown visited the construction site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge.
He said, "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of Queensferry Crossings.
We are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic measure in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity that requires extremely precise tolerances for the fit.
In total, almost 79% of the entire bridge decks are in place, and the last section of the deck today gets a concrete noise for the deck in Rosyth, which means that the entire deck is ready to be raised on the bridge to its place.
Michael Martin, project manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: "The first closure of each bridge project is a significant milestone.
In this fantastic project, the closure represents forward-looking construction of high and low buildings.
After the installation of the last road deck section and its connection with the Nordturmdeck in the extension, we then had to close the remaining gap on the north or country side.
This was reached by dragging the northern delivery bridge 700 millimetres south.
This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.
Solid, as the Viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at an increase of about 3%.
Heikel, since the tolerances the team was working on were tiny - they were only a few millimeters on each side.
Fortunately, everything went very well.
Salvation at Moelfre Bay: Three men have "Gluck to be alive"
Three men have "Gluck to be alive" after being thrown off their fishing boat in front of Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI Rescue Station struck on Friday at 13:20 BST Alarm after a crew observed the event in Moelfre Bay.
The three men had difficulties in swimming safely, while their boat moved out of their own strength.
"We saw how the boat turned around in its vicinity and imagined the worst," said Moelfre Vince Jones, head of the rescue station.
"Unfortunately, the strong winds have already weighed the boat beyond its reach until we left to water," he added.
Two of the men were rescued by a local fishing boat, while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and found hanging on a buoy without a life jacket.
They all boarded the coastal lifeboat and were taken back to the rescue station.
Mr. Jones said, "The three men who have been thrown into the water have no luck and are still alive.
Although the boat engine had an emergency stop line, it was released by the person who controlled the boat at the base of the boat.
Someone's been waiting for these men today.
Hardly injured - man leans on his ex-girlfriend
A man attacked his ex-girlfriend in Hamburg-Harburg with a knife and severely injured.
As the police reported yesterday, the 50-year-old had got the key to the apartment to get his personal things.
Instead, the alcoholics cut the clothes of his ex-girlfriend.
When she got to the apartment, he stabbed her twice.
The 44-year-old was injured by the hand and the body.
The police were able to arrest the perpetrator.
While the 50-year-old destroyed his ex-girlfriend's clothes, he called his mother.
He then alerted his sister.
Together with her partner, the 45-year-old wanted to calm her brother.
But she couldn't move him to leave the apartment.
That's why she left the house with her partner.
They met the man's ex-husband on the street.
When the two women entered the apartment again, the 50-year-old pushed his sister aside and attacked his ex-girlfriend.
Who builds Braunschweigs cheap apartments?
The SPD and Greens believe that investors will be much more obliged in the future.
How do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1300 cheap apartments in the next few years?
At the next Council meeting, the SPD proposes a "action plan for living".
But disputes are programmed.
First of all, it is a question of who is going to build cheap apartments?
There has been a lack of regulation so far.
Chairman of the SPD, Christoph Bratmann, says: "We agree with the Greens: Anyone who wants to build on urban areas will have to prove 20 percent of all apartments as social housing in the future."
However, the cheap apartments can also be built in stock.
However, the big issue in the town hall is, says Bratmann: "How do you deal with investors who want to build on private areas?"
"We want investors to build at least 10 percent on such areas, but as much as 20 percent of apartments as possible as social apartments."
A new urban housing funding programme, which will cost millions and still needs to be financed, will provide incentives.
The problem, says Bratmann: "There is currently no agreement between the political groups."
The CDU wants to make investors as few rules as possible.
The left one wants even tough demands for investors.
Despite this, says Bratmann, the situation on the housing market is exacerbated.
If the concept of action is implemented, it will provide additional tasks in the construction management.
More staff is needed.
It's unclear if we're going to get the professionals.
However, the program is not entirely up to date: the approximately 1260 new apartments that should be built anyway.
How, though, does one compare the loss of another 1,300 cheap apartments, whose promotion will end in the next few years?
There will be 500 apartments by 2020 alone.
In order to prevent this, according to Nicole Palm, the planning political spokesman, we should now purchase outgoing bonds from the city.
In addition, consideration should be given to getting apartments back into the price-fixing system.
This is possible in the West Town.
At one time the problem could be solved.
In the West Town, time limits will expire at the end of the year.
Around 1800 apartments could be brought back to the price association for cheap apartments.
Only: that's what the owners want, the housing companies don't.
The number of social housing units in the western city is being dramatically increased again, and the aim of the so-called mix-up is being removed.
There should be no more concentration of social weaknesses in just a few parts of the city.
The Greens expect there to be still movement in the discussion.
Holger Herlitschke, head of the group, says: "For a wide majority, the CDU must enter the boat."
They have concentrated on more construction sites for single-family houses.
What does not mean, however, that a compromise cannot be found.
Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that is worthwhile
It is fascinating to see how the world changes.
The fact that teenagers and children no longer go outside to play, but rather prefer to spend their spare time staring at screens, has been lamented by many in the last decade.
At Pokemon Go, it's about getting people off the sofa and getting active.
The time on the screen was initially limited to the TV, then to video games and last but not least to smartphones.
Therefore, it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not exclude each other.
I refer, of course, to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters that were first created for the video games in the 1990s (later a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs were created).
How many phenomena of pop culture did the interest drop before the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July.
The market launch in other countries has been shifted by the massive demand that overburdened the servers.
Within a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
How does it work?
In short, the players go out with their smartphones and search for Pokémons who are being tracked with a GPS and, once they have been found, "photographed" (via a screenshot on the phone) or "captured".
One generation who played the game when she was younger joined the madman and jumped for the search from the sofa.
In the U.S., the game led to a significant increase in steps that the "average" person spends every day.
Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch that tracks 35,000 users, recently told Washington Post that within two days of the launch of the game, the number of people who train 30 minutes each day jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company does not know who is playing Pokémon Go - it only sees the raw data to increase performance.
Many public health education campaigns that want to bring people to "take 30 minutes' time," "come from the sofa" and "be active every day" are coming across deaf ears, because many public messages are boring to health and come from people who look miserable.
Nevertheless, the importance of sport cannot be overestimated.
Those who regularly exercise reduce their chances of suffering from cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps to control weight, high blood pressure, diabetes, and a long list of benefits that is too long to be listed here.
But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it makes people do something outdoors that is fun for them.
Thus, three pillars of health are covered - exercise, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.
Some people even close new friendships on hunting.
As always, there are Moorish corrupters who always have to complain about something.
And yes, someone could walk against a door.
What's up?
It was a breakthrough.
Even though smartphone apps like Fitbit were able to track our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to play sports as it does this game.
The new will lose its charm and use will decline over time.
However, due to Pokemon's success, there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with becoming active in the real world, helping many people hunting to be more active, fitter and healthier.

Simone Biles creates gold in the Damenturnen
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is immune to all of this.
Dynamic on the jumper.
Hardly on the bar.
Breathing on the ground.
Brilliant on the whole line.
And now, finally, Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast climbed on Thursday to become a multi-combat title and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world before all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games.
Their total result of 62,198 was clearly ahead of the silver medal winner and final five teammate Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medal winner Aliy Mustafina.
The Americans Simone Biles will play on the hover barn during the women's solo multi-competition at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday.
Biles is the fourth heterosexual American who wins a multi-combat title and in total the fifth while strengthening her reputation to be the best of their generation or even even.
She broke out in tears when her final result was shown and her long journey at this moment ended.
This success puts her in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who have brought their sports to new heights:
For the past three years, Billes has dominated her sport, won 15 world champion medals - including 10 gold medals - with such amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton said about her that she is "the best tournament I've ever seen."
She expected a final test in Brazil, a competition that did not go so much between Blies and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a burden of oversized expectations.
Not with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, Texas, would be considered as disappointment.
The Americans Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman hugged themselves after winning gold and silver in the single mercenary finals of women in the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday
Biles got the first medal on Tuesday, while she served as an exclamation mark at the farewell celebration of the retired team coordinator Martha Karolyi.
Although Biles insisted on never having planned the future during their long journey to the top, this is not really true.
Part of their ground exercises - which contain their typical Tumbling Pass - is tuned to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympia Arena in Rio.
It's not a coincidence.
This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a small child and discovered by coach Aimee Boorman's mother during a school trip to the gym, in which Boorman trained, became powerful.
Since the summer of 2013, she has lost no more competition, a victory series that will last as long as it wishes.
Even if Mustafina led easily through two rotations, the image faded.
Swift beams and ground tournaments - in which movies hold the world title - lurked.
She again picked up 15,433 on the hover bar and put one on the ground with a 15,933 on it.
Raisman hugged her gently as she expected her end of life - a pure formality - and tears streamed on Billes shiny red, white, and blue eyeliners, when the vision she once described in her collection book became reality.
The performance of Raisman was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for third place, but the bronze medal in a Tiebrake went to Mustafina.
This time, the 22-year-old team captain, called "Oma" by the Americans, had a lead.
After her ground practice, she threw kiss hands at the audience, overwhelmed by a comeback that sometimes appeared doubtful.
As far as Biles is concerned, the rapidly expanding tweet of the 19-year-olds from the beginning of this week has a whole new meaning:
Police: 3 victims shot in serial killers while listening to music in the car
According to police reports published on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot and killed in one of the most deadly attacks in Phoenix's first serial murders for a decade, while they were in the car and listening to music.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot on June 12 while the car was parked in an entrance, the authorities said.
The perpetrator fired eight shots from a handgun while standing on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle, is to be read in the report.
The police reported that the triple murder did not seem to have been the result of a robbery, as the attacker did not take the purses or the $2,900 that were owned by one of the adult victims.
The police spokesperson of Phoenix Sgt. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting led the investigators to become a closer look at whether they were connected with four previous attacks.
In total, seven people were killed in nine attacks mainly in Hispanic residential areas within four months and two more were injured.
"It happens in a residential area in front of a house," said Howard of KHPO, a subsidiary of CBS, at the beginning of the month.
It is assumed that the suspect has used several vehicles, including a brown Nissan from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to disclose the evidence they led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized for her injuries and later died.
Liner, 31, and Elli's daughter Maleah still died on the spot.
One witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a parked car and hear music.
The authorities also published a police report on the shooting, which aimed at an empty pickup truck half an hour before the triple murder and is expected to be the work of the serial killer.
Investigators found cartridge sleeves and secured a ball from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine room.
Mother of a 6-year-old with microcephaly: "It will be better"
Like most 6-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But like the least of his peers, Edmund has microcephaly, the result of a genetic disorder that his mother Elizabeth Picciuto knew nothing about during her pregnancy.
When he first came home, my first thought was, I can't do it.
I can't do this.
I didn't get involved in that.
What's not right at all -- of course, you've let it go," she said.
Her husband Vincent and her were told that Edmund may never be able to recognize her and that he may not even survive.
Some doctors even went so far that they suggested institutionalizing him.
"My first answer was 'I didn't know that people are still doing'," said Picciuto.
Edmund can walk with the help of a walking aid.
Edmund could not sit or scratch until his third year of life and he still cannot speak.
But he's making progress slowly.
He can run with support and ride a bicycle.
He also loves to play and sing with his two brothers.
Elizabeth shows the sign language Edmund has devised for "Please sing me something"."
"We teach him sign language," said Picciuto CBS News.
But it's not a typical sign language -- she says. Edmund invented some signs alone.
Microcephaly has a variety of causes: genetics such as Edmund and infections with viruses such as measles or the Zikavirus during pregnancy.
Symptoms and prognosis may vary greatly.
It is still too early to say how it will affect the life that is infected with the Zikavirus.
Picciuto recalls the emotional price of an uncertain future.
I kept asking, what's going to happen?
What's going to happen?
And she still doesn't really know.
I haven't asked for the forecast for a long time, because I don't expect anyone to tell me.
But Picciuto has a hopeful advice for mothers of infants with birth defects caused by the Zika virus.
It's getting better.
You know it'll be better for you.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy rains, floods give rise to rescues in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rains and large floods in Louisiana forced the governor to call out the emergency on Friday. It is calculated all Saturday over with more rainfalls.
Numerous rivers in the southeast of Louisiana and south of the Mississippi flooded their banks and threatened with large floods after extreme rainfalls, reported the National Weather Service.
The Governor of Louisiana John Bel Edwards reported that government officials are in constant contact with the local authorities and that assistance to the communities concerned is already on the move.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness of the Governor, said that the requests for high-water vehicles, boats and sandbags increased.
Steele said that only the municipality of Tangipahoa had demanded ten thousand sandbags.
A flood warning system is used over many parts in the south of Louisianas until Saturday.
The weather service reported that there could be an additional 3 to 5 inches of rain in this area.
In the south of Alabama, a flood warning system was used on Friday, while it continued to rain in the Mobile area.
The river Comite near Baton Rouges and the river Amite near Denham Springs, both located in Louisiana, will most likely reach record levels over the weekend.
Metereologist Alek Krautmann says that both rivers can flood many houses in the suburbs near Baton Rouge.
He also said that a downstream flood in Ascension Parish poses a danger, as these will flow only slowly over the run-up rivers into Lake Maurepas.
The Tickfaw river, south of the Mississippi state border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest level at 9.00 on Friday, which was ever recorded.
Rescue teams were still attracting people from the floodwaters in the districts of Amite and Wilkinson in the southwest of Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and son-in-law, were among those rescued on Friday near Gloster.
Hansford, 62, says that water from Beaver Creek, which is usually more than 400 feet away from his house, rose strongly overnight.
He said that another stepson who lives nearby warned him.
"We woke up and the water was pouring and pouring in," said Hansford.
It reached my waist.
His wife told Hansford that in the 48 years she lived there, she had never seen such an uprising of the river.
Hansford said that he and his family members had all the disabilities and he was the only one who could swim.
Hansford said that emergency workers had saved all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Gloster, where they had been accommodated until Friday.
Krautmann said that the flood had spread "quickly" as there were still heavy rains and that the authorities were considering evacuation instructions.
According to Krautmann, an observer reported from midnight to Friday morning of 13.75 inches of rain near Livingstone.
Krautmann said that the soil has been covered by rains since Wednesday.
The authorities indicated that heavy rains and floods caused the rescue of residents from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and teaching failure in five school districts.
The CBS subsidiary WWL reported that a member of the Tangipahoa listed 200 flooded houses.
The inhabitants were evacuated into two churches, both of which were now flooded.
The head of the community of Robby Miller said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven pets washed from the flood.
Emergency accommodation was set up in the cities of Amite and Hammond to accommodate the evacuated.
"As soon as the water starts to return, they will be able to return to their homes," he said.
In Hammond, the municipality of Tangipahoa, almost two dozen streets were closed due to the flood and sandbags were provided for the residents who hope to keep the water out of their houses and shops.
"The last great flood we had was in March," said Lacy Landrum of the city administration.
This seems to be a similar incident.
In Mississippi, the emergency manager Rupert Lacy of Harrison County said it was still raining on the Gulf Coast.
According to his data, a handful of houses should have been reported as flooded on Thursday, but none have been reported until Friday.
Keith Townson, manager at Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has been living in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places I've never seen before," said Townson, "and it's still coming."
Mahaj Brown, 6, "cut by bullets", survives shooting in Philadelphia
The police announce that the 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, this week already the second time a 6-year-old child is shot.
The boys' grandparents identified him as Mahaj Brown for CBS Philadelphia.
The grandparents said that Brown suffered several gunshot injuries, including in the loins, legs, arm and abdomen, but that he was aware of the hospital during his transport.
"He's been through a lot, his little body was holesd by bullets," his grandmother Delores Melendez told the transmitter.
I just can't believe this.
The boy's condition was classified as critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations.
The boy's family told the station that he was expected to recover.
He should have started the first class in a local primary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in Germantown.
Three men were also shot: two at the age of 29 and one at the age of 32.
One of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition; the other two victims are in stable condition according to CBS Philadelphia.
The boy was shot on the front seat of a car together with the 29-year-old who is in a critical condition, reports the station.
The other two victims were not in the car and the police were just investigating whether one of the injured men could be among the perpetrators.
Investigators informed CBS Philadelphia that there appeared to have been a crossfire between several shooters.
Patron sleeves for storm rifles, which were traced back to various storm rifles, overlooked the scene.
It seems that this was clearly a continuing struggle.
On the road, on both sides of the walkway, there were Hülsen.
So there seems to have been several armed fighters here who were very actively involved," said police chief Anthony Ginaldi of the police in Philadelphia to the station.
Several houses and vehicles were also hit in the area.
There were no arrests and the police are currently reviewing reports of the surveillance video.
On Tuesday another six-year-old girl was hit by a crossbreeder on her arm when she played in front of her house in the residential area of the West Oak Lane.
She recovers and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why We Need Simone, Gabby, and Laurie
That's what I introduce myself to under the women's Olympic team in the tournaments and that for more than one reason.
First of all, I've been in every summer Olympic since 1984, and the United States has never been so dominant.
And second, this team has three tournaments, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, which inspired many young girls of other skin color.
The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, is Jewish, and round off Madison Kocian, who is Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This team finally reflects the United States.
It has fortified the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.
In the last four years, the number one among the female gymnasts was an African American.
Last year Simone and Gabby were #1 and #2.
This shows strength.
During the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and America cheered.
Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they provided unexpected but masterful gymnasium routines.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth heterosexual American who won an individual multi-combat event for women gold.
Team member Aly Raisman won silver.
We experience the tip of this sport, but that's not how gym classes look all over the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all took the same route as Aly and Madison to make it into the Olympic team.
They are the "last five" because the next Olympic team will have only four tournaments in the team. In addition, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a coach.
But the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport and gymnastics primarily occurs in private tournaments, which are maintained by parents for training, furnishing, travel, clothing, competition and hotel costs (for trainers and their gymnastics and families).
The majority of these tournaments are located in wealthy suburbs that can support the business.
In these clubs the tournaments get their entire training and that is an expensive and long-term commitment for the families.
Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, both trained their athletes since they started the tournament.
We must allow the communities of countless young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie to have a quieter and easier access to gymnastics.
I founded my 20-year gymnast.
At my events we have offered free and affordable tournaments in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youths (especially black and Hispanic) and trained national and international winners.
In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer young people high-quality tournaments that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Turnings develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.
This combination offers lifelong benefits for health as well as for school and professional success.
It's the inspiration of this team that makes thousands of young girls interested in the tournament and that's great.
It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.
This is such an exciting time.
Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real portrayal of "Girl Power" by getting the Olympic team gold and thank you, have motivated so many young girls with different backgrounds to begin their way, to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
Assistant doctors want to organize more strikes after they have rejected Jeremy Hunt's proposal.
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting a reformed treaty with the British Medical Association's officials, but 58 percent of the 37,000 assistants who voted against the election rejected him.
In July Hunt had revealed plans to enter the contract by necessity and said that the NHS was located in a "non-member country" and any further delay would be detrimental to the employees and patients.
The first assistants are expected to get a new contract, which includes changes to night and weekend work to improve care for the needs of the patient.
Last night, Dr. Ellen McCourt, Chairman of the BMA Committee on Assistant Physicians, said in a communication: "Assistants still have serious concerns about the proposed treaty, in particular that it will raise the current workforce crisis and fail to treat all doctors fairly."
In just eight weeks, which remain until the first group of doctors falls under the new treaty, progress has to be made and time is running out.
The BMA's efforts to resolve disputes through discussions were against the government's wish to participate and sometimes on deafening silence.
This was a promise that Jeremy Hunt had made only last month that his door would always be open.
"Jeremy Hunt must act now, lift the pressure and address the concerns of the assistants".
If he does not do so, the assistants have made it clear that they are ready to take further action on the labour market.
The last strike at the end of April saw a postponement of almost 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments, since nurses and specialists were involved in providing cover for doctors on the strike post chain.
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting the Reformed Treaty with the British Medical Association's officials.
The BMA wants a better weekly pay for the 54,000 assistant doctors who are subject to the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, Director General of the NHS Staff, called on the assistant doctors to end the strike.
Mortimer said: "Work struggles do not achieve anything but burden already overburdened teams and service providers and only provide the patient, caregivers and their families with concerns, distress and interruption."
In the last two months, we have been talking to the Committee of Assistants and we have responded positively to the concerns of the Ministry of Health and other ministries regarding the protection and whistleblowering.
Employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important issues - such as education, flexibility in training, additional training for those returning from a career break, training skills, mutual recognition of the curriculum, training leave and gender pay gap in medicine - was a sign of how serious it was for employers, health education in England and the Ministry of Health to comply with the agreements with the BMA in November, February and May.
The £2 per day medication that can reduce the risk of heart attack
Thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £2 per day drug after the authorities have advised to give this more people for a longer period of time.
The anti-emetic drug ticagrelor reduces the risk of recurrent heart attacks in people with heart disease.
The medicine is given for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a stroke or another heart attack.
The NHS Regulatory Authority has recommended a four-year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
The NHS Regulatory Authority has recommended a four-year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Some 140,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer another heart attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulations of fatty materials in the arteries walls that form surfaces.
If the coating breaks apart, it can cause a blood clot that clots the blood flow to the heart, causing a heart attack.
If the blood clot dissolves, it can flow through the bloodstream and clot the blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already had a heart attack are at higher risk of having another.
Ticagrelor, produced by the British company AstraZeneca and sold under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots more unlikely.
The guide draft of NICE, published today, recommends a 12-month intake of 90mg Ticagrelor, followed by 60mg with a twice daily intake of aspirin for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, Director of the NICE Health Technology Evaluation Centre, said: "Despite the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack, another heart attack or a stroke - often with disastrous consequences."
The fear of a renewed heart attack can have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person.
Experience shows that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
Through a preliminary recommendation by Ticagrelor, we are pleased that we are able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it.
The information on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor - particularly the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years.
Culture of Political Correctness makes electoral fraud flourish in Muslim areas
The former mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year on the occasion of a government report on corruption
A culture of political correctness has led to widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities being deliberately ignored as a devastating government report revealed today.
The former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles verbally attacks the police, election observers and town councillors for ignoring evidence of abuse of election due to "hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion".
The former Minister of Integration and Municipal Government, who is now an anti-corruption king, said that the intimidation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that police should be allowed to set up lock bands outside of polling booths in order to protect intimidated voters.
He recommends that voters carry an ID card to prove their identity in elections.
At present, a voters only have to name and address their names.
The report suggests that non-removable ink be applied to a person's fingers if they give their vote to prevent a person from choosing twice.
Whistleblower should be given more protection, says Sir Eric.
It calls for the press to have more access to community documents and decisions of non-official committees or working groups.
"This not only serves against electoral fraud, but is also intended to protect the municipal government from the broader culture of corruption and financial fraud that goes with it," he said.
The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of the Tower Hamlet election scandal in East London.
Last year, a Special Electoral Court decided that after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices, the mayor of Lutfur Rahman should be discharged.
The court found that Rahman had perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community "in a cynical way" and that he had silenced his critics with racist and Islamophobian accusations.
Rahman is said to "have led his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him."
Up to 300 votes were either doubtful or the result of imitation, in which one person chooses as someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud all over the country.
He expressed himself in particular alarmingly about the fraudulent choice of letters - with the elderly members of the Muslim community pressured people to choose a candidate of their choice.
Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clear the electoral system, including the conduct of identification to prove identity
His report states: "As evidence has been provided that pressure has been exerted on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, in particular women and young people, to choose according to the will of the elderly, especially communities with Pakistani or Bangladeshi background.
"There were concerns that... state institutions would have deliberately ignored such behaviour due to "politically correct" hypersensitivity to the ethnicity and religion."
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations to clean the system, including the ban on political activists working on electoral documents to stop "chosen".
The report, which is considered by Theresa May, also calls for stricter registration reviews to prevent the list of voters from being used for immigration and social fraud purposes.
Consider options to ask voters before choosing your ID card.
Use non-removable ink on a person's finger as soon as she has given her voice to prevent someone from choosing twice.
carry out systematic checks on the nationality of a person to ensure that they are eligible for election.
A three-year limit on applications for an automatic choice of letters.
Ban on political activists working on full choice of letters and envelopes of letters.
The police are empowered to lock-outs to set up electoral stations.
A change of law which facilitates an accusation of intimidation in accordance with the representation of the People Act 1983 (Volksvertretungsgesetz 1983).
Photographer ban in election stations.
Request that only English may be used in the election stations (with the exception of Wales).
Intensification of training to ensure that employees enforce the rule that voters go to the polling booth alone.
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it "astounding" that after Tower Hamlet's case no criminal charges were filed.
"The Electoral Court declared Lutfur Rahman and his alternate unfit for corrupt and illegal practices due to a litany," he said.
It has become well-known for a number of reasons, in accordance with the high requirements of criminal proceedings.
He also criticises the ineffective "abstinence controls" of the electoral registration departments of the town halls.
Sir Eric said, "The court ruling in Tower Hamlets last year was a warning signal.
Our country, as the mother of parliaments, bears a proud heritage, but the worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and denial by some authorities threatens this good reputation.
Crazy after Kate's Radler doppelganger and other famous double-goers of Olympic athletes in Rio
Fans of the 2016 Olympiad in Rio have this week come across the French cycling athlete Pauline Ferrand-Prevot except Rand and Band, who has proved to be an impressive double runner of the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympic woman is by far not the only athlete fighting gold this summer, who has his own famous double rider - at least not if you are allowed to believe the social media.
In honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that are currently floating on our screens, FEMIIL has created a list of Olympics that have more than a certain resemblance to Hollywood celebrities.
The hunter and the wolf: team member of the U.S. team in archery Brady Ellison, left, has been compared since childhood with Leonardo DiCaprio
Apart from Kate's double rider on the Internet, a lot of people on the Internet pointed out how a certain archer could be the twin of A-Promi Leonardo DiCaprio.
The team member of the U.S. team in archery, Brady Ellison, has caused an attack on Twitter after the pictures he sees the Wolf of Wall Street Star in an uncanny way.
In fact, the archer got the madness in the social media and admitted that he has been hearing since his childhood that he looks like Leo.
"I see no great resemblance to myself, except for facial hair," said Brady of the Huffington Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I guess I'll take this as a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons since London 2012 will undoubtedly become even more important this year: the striking resemblance between the British Widespring Greg Rutherford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
The Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina with her large, expressive eyes should be able to pass as a double walker for Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the swimming pool, the South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to the Glee Star Matthew Morrison for years.
One passage higher: This user believes that Nathan is the "athletic version" of the Inception actor
Another constant comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who has similar heavy eyebrows and lips.
The Russian silver medallion girl Yulia Efimova shows more than just the sun-brown skin and blonde hair like actress Annalynnne McCord, while American Nathan Adrian was certified by fans, a "athletical version of Joseph Gordon Levitt".
Strong women: football star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, right, have a similar face and eyes
Not the only one: A Twitter user was very happy that others have noticed the similarities too
Putting theory in space: According to this user there might be a reason for the similarity of the couple
A Twitter user explained their satisfaction that "the rest of the Internet thinks Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are almost identical."
In fact, the US football star Hope Solo and the Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter have an incredibly similar face and eyes.
Other popular comparisons included Kerri Walsh Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to that of actress Laura Linney as well as the gold medallion in the Gabby Douglas tournament, which has its own beautiful, broad smile, similar to that of Bring It On Star Gabrielle Union.
CBC commentator for the Olympics apologizes for his statement that Chinese swimmer "has died like a pig"
Byron MacDonald's analysis of the fourth place of the 14-year-old Ai Yanhan at the 4x200m freestyle swimstakes attracted viewers of the CBC live transmission of the Olympic Games on Wednesday
The Canadian broadcaster CBC had to apologize after one of his commentators said that the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "began as much" and during the race as "a pig died".
Commentator Byron MacDonalds thought that his microphone was turned off when he gave his own opinions at the end of the 4x200m freestyle swimsuit.
MacDonald, who had been brought on board the CBS commentator team to give more "color", could be heard saying, "This little 14-year-old Chinese woman has lost the connection, baby".
Too excited, went off like Mief, died like a pig.
Thank you for that.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the second stage of the 1:57,79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada's Taylor Ruck, allowing Canadians to unlock the gap to China.
Audiences all over Canada responded quickly online after they were shocked by the sound and the language
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted, "Did the CBC commentator just say that the 14-year-old swimmer from China "has died like a pig"???
The idiot didn't realize they were still on mission."
Ai Yanhan from China was described at the final 4 x 200m freestyle swim for women as follows: "This little 14-year-old Chinese woman has lost the connection, baby."
The criticism against Byron MacDonald on Twitter came quickly and hard, with many speaking to him
Twitter user did not hold back when they heard how insensitive Byron MacDonald was
Another Twitter user Sarah Paradis wrote: "Wow, #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and you make us all look like racists.
A short time later, Scott Russel, who moderated the CBC broadcast, apologized live for the MacDonald comment and said: "We apologize that the comment was broadcast about a swimming performance."
It was an unfortunately chosen formulation, we are sorry it happened."
CBC apologized at the end over 90 times to the people who responded to the remark on Twitter
Commentary colleague Scott Russel had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald
CBC copied and added its apology to more than 90 other Twitter users who had complained about MacDonald's comments
The network also quickly apologized and issued a message.
We sincerely regret that these statements were made and that it was possible for them to be broadcast.
We quickly apologized to our viewers on mission and to our followers in the social media last night.
To clarify one, Byron's comments related to the performance of the swimmer and not to her as a person.
Yet they were inappropriate and an unfortunately chosen formulation. Byron is very sorry about what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized in the broadcast and tried to justify his remark by saying that it was not his intention to interpret it as a personal attack.
"I would like to take a moment to apologize for the comment I made after the women's swim in the CBC Olympic show, he said.
"I was referring to the performance of the swimmer and not to her as a person."
Of course, no disregard was intended and I am very sorry."
Buyers in Primark indignant about women who try shameless underwear in the middle of the shop
The buyers didn't know where to look when a woman took off her clothes in the middle of a primark to try underpants.
To make the situation worse, she patterned what she looked like in it, pulled it out and put it back into the shelf.
She continued to browse and tried four pairs of underpants in a shop at Bouverie Place Shopping Centre in Folkestone.
The Primark Shop at Bouverie Place Shopping Centre in Folkestone, where the woman tried the underpants before putting them back into the shelf
A mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was in business at the same time, said that after the mysterious woman had tried the underwear, "she got dressed again and left the business without buying anything."
She said, "People couldn't believe what they saw."
In the middle of the sales area, she took a pair of underpants out of the edition, took off her own pantyhose and pants and tried them.
"She didn't even try to find a slightly more discreet place to do it - she just stood there, cheeky like Oskar."
"Everyone stared as they pulled out the underwear again, which obviously didn't like her, as she put her back into the shelf."
She repeated the same thing with three other underpants before she finally decided that she liked nothing, attracted herself again and went out.
"She didn't seem to bother that she was watching anyone - or thinking about the person who might buy the underpants she had tried."
Ms. Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent, said, "How disgusting to think that someone would take underpants home with someone who had another person and was not washed."
The incident happened on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms. Davidson added: "As I have received, the employees have tried to remove the clothes from the sale after she left - which is just as good."
"I would hate to go home with a new pair of underpants and find out that another woman was wearing them and going out again and they weren't washed."
A speaker from Primark said: "Primark is aware of the incident that took place on Tuesday, 9 August in our branch in Folkstone."
All products in question were withdrawn from the sale.
How to protect yourself from weapons attacks with Krav Maga
The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video of Dailymail.com could make it a little safer for you.
We talked to Rhon Mizrachi, a Grand Master of the Krav Maga Association in New York, to find out how to deal with armed robbers at a close distance.
Regardless of whether you are approaching you from the front or the back, this video will show you how to turn the spear for your robber.
When you approach you from behind, you should first turn around so that you can see your attacker and "get out of the shot line," says Mizrachi.
Then grab the weapon between your forearm and your shoulder before you hit it with your free elbow in the face.
Then hit him with the knee and twist and, while the attacker humps up for pain, the weapon out of his hands. Hit him with the run into his face and move backwards while she is pointing the gun at him.
In the case of attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot line, grab the gun and twist it so that the attacker cannot shoot.
At the same time shift the weight to the weapon and hit the attacker on the chest, then twist the weapon out of its handle before moving backwards and point the weapon towards it.
Does it sound difficult?
Look at the video to see exactly how Mizrachi is doing.
But remember, it's safest to hand over your money if you're not big masters of Krav Maga.
Traveler Ian Wright scales his tongue to the dirtiest places in Europe for a travel guide
A British traveller underwent a serious check on his immune system and the strangler flex by rejecting some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.
The moderator and traveler Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk scolded his steps on a Eurolight, a railing at Piccadilly Circus, a sink button for a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to demonstrate the resilience of his immune system.
Before licking each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he will get into.
But the experiment filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" brought some surprising results.
The idea of licking the sink button of a train toilet, which has already been used by thousands of others, may be completely repulsive, but in fact, there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.
On his journey through Europe, Mr Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria as well as about his own health.
Luckily, nothing left in his mouth what he rejected, more than a bad aftertaste.
Mr Wright became known for testing the resilience of his intestines by traveling through the world, eating strange and wonderful things.
From public countries at railway stations to sinks from toilets, the task of its immune system was definitely to test
In the film, he said, "I was relatively unconcerned when I was a child about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud."
In the film, he definitely met his call.
The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.
His sampling showed a number of luminometers of more than 4000 units.
In comparison, the luminometer number of freshly washed hands is less than 60.
But there was a Russian toilet that he refused to lick after its luminometer number was over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands had one of less than 60
Mr Wright and Finnish dairy manufacturers Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength", which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom
In the film he says, "This comes close to the worst of what I smelled in a toilet."
There's nothing more dirty than that!
I'm not gonna lick anything here because it's disgusting in here.
"The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in cooperation with the Finnish producer of dairy products Valio.
The company equips Mr Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamins C and D to support the development of intestinal bacteria and the immune system.
Valios Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something fascinating to look at and at the same time explain the benefits of probiotics.
We conducted crazy brainstormings that ended up saying, "Let's call us Ian."
They claim that the interest in intestinal health becomes a global phenomenon
Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of intestinal health and how it is linked to the immune system.
The growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information about it in an interesting way.
I also think that the movie shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who led the film's director, added: "Let me say it this way - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had licked some of the things I had ordered him to lick, like the disgusting Russian toilet that is shown in the movie."
Of course, there were things that made it easier to get Ian to lick them and others where this was quite difficult.
I'm glad we recorded some of these dirty treats on film."
In a 2015 survey conducted by Valio, 84 per cent of all lactic acid bacteria surveyed in particular with the well-being of stomachs and intestines and 58 per cent reported that they at least occasionally use products containing added lactic acid bacteria.
Associative family destroyed before social home in Saltash, Cornwall
An asocial family left their social home after a denunciation with a damage of £50,000 because she had terrorized her neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in Saltash, Cornwall.
After they were violently removed from their property, shocked employees of the housing cooperative found the property in an irreparable condition.
The walls showed clumsy holes, wooden sections were torn up, garbage was scattered on the floor and graffiti was lubricated on the walls.
The family was relocated and it is assumed that she now lives in a private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, who works for the house administration at Cornwall Housing, said that she fears that the apartment is no longer to be repaired.
She said, "It was an absolute nightmare for the people here, and I think people don't have to live this way.
There are many things to consider, as this property is probably considered not so nice part of Cornwalls.
The family is notorious and its reputation is so.
The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that had brought the family involved street fights with baseball fighters, intimidators of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive screaming, quarrels and curses.
In June, 47, whose name was on the lease contract, Skeldon received an order for antisocial behavior.
In some rooms of the house, which may be demolished, old garbage was found
In the estate where drugs have been dealt in the past, wood parts have been torn up
Neighbors said they saw her fighting on the street and had to be called the police regularly
Cornwall Housing and her partner forcibly debriefed from the property this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to withdraw voluntarily.
The denunciation was cheered by relieved neighbors who said their lives were made hell.
One of them said, "They didn't care about anyone."
We lived next to them for 20 years and it was always bad.
The countless times we tell the police here are incredible.
"Tomorrow we could not sleep."
We got up because it was so quiet here - we're not used to it!
Now that they're finally gone, it'll be beautiful.
Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighborhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said that it had been a failure for the family to cooperate with the local authorities.
The family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals for 20 years
On the overgrown side of the town hall, garbage and old toys were dropped
He added: "It is a shame that the tenant failed to accept any responsibility for their behavior and that of their family, since a delogation is always the last step that Cornwall Housing takes into consideration.
This was a very difficult case, as the behavior was extreme and their actions had to be awful for their neighbors.
I appreciate all the work my team, the police from Devon and Cornwall as well as members of the community who courageously approached us and gave us the information.
I hope that this development will bring consolation to a number of neighbours and that the message conveys that antisocial behaviour is not tolerated.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons lived in the house at different times, but that they were all over 20.
A dirty mattress left on the ground in one of the bedroom rooms of the house after the denunciation
Workers in the house administration will now have to clear the garbage dumps surrounding the house
In 2014, the police conducted a raid in the house and found over 70g cannabis as well as scales, paraphernalia and cash worth £1,700.
Skeldon received a fine after she was guilty of possession of a class B drug for commercial purposes.
She claimed that the money was for a tombstone for her son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After being without shelter, it is assumed that Tanya and her partner now live in a private accommodation in Plymouth.
Many of the walls of the house were covered with graffiti.
The police say they're going to denigrate tenants who don't comply with the house rules.
Angela Crow from the Devon and Cornwall police told us that the denunciation was a clear warning to the other tenants who did not comply with the house rules.
"This goes to those who think they can behave without self-despense and to those who have been harmed by such behavior," she said.
Devon and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and antisocial behavior, which will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal panicked after a deep-flying military jet crossed the beach
Sun worshipers in Aveiro, Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
A Portuguese P-3C Orion aircraft of the Air Force made an incredible crash flight
Air forces reported that it was on a training flight, but insisted that there was no safety risk
This was the moment when frightened tourists start panicking after a deep-flying jet crashes down over a full beach.
Dramatic video footage showed how the military aircraft flew almost in close proximity over the sun’s improvements on the beach section in Aveiro in northern Portugal.
The holidaymakers jumped up as they understoodably began to worry about the noise of the jet engines, without first seeing what was coming on them through the clouds.
The incident happened yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova, near Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the many holidaymakers who posted videos about the dramatic fly-by in the social media, said: "It flew twice really deep and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash."
Nuno Arroja added: "I was just surfing and it felt like the plane was falling down on me."
Tourists on the beach of Aveiro were in panic when the plane came out of the darkness and flew incredibly deep
The Portuguese Air Forces today stated that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and had to fly so deep that this was the only way to recognize them.
The speaker said that due to the poor visibility of the jet, surface fires near it flew a little lower than usual, but the air forces insisted that safety was not at all at risk.
This summer, fires destroyed parts of the mainland Portugal, killing four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese air forces today indicated that the pilot had to fly so low due to the conditions - strong fog and fire smoke - which reduced his vision
The aircraft was on a training flight in which the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise
Supercup: Barca with concerns about Seville
Seville - Barcelona FC is fighting for the first step on Sunday to win the first title in the new football season.
The Catalans take off in the duel around the Spanish Supercup against the FC Sevilla, the replay rises three days later at Camp Nou.
The double winner must refrain from Neymar, among other things, from playing against the Olympic Football Tournament with the low Cupinalist and ruling European League champion, who competes with Brazil.
Goalie also lacks Marc-Andre ter Stegen.
In training, the German suffered a knee-deep bending, which explains at least for the first time that Barca is in favour of Claudio Bravo.
The Chilean International and Ter Stegen have been competing for number one status in Barcelona for two years.
Coach Luis Enrique refrained from making a clear decision so far, leaving Bravo in the league, but Ter Stegen in most other applications.
Before the first mandatory game of the new season, there are doubts at the Spanish Master about the fitness state of the team, which was humiliated on Saturday in a 0:4 Liverpool test game.
Lionel Messi and Co. did not yet really know how to convince even at 3:2 in the test race against Sampdoria on Wednesday.
Seville, in turn, has lost the 2:3-low position after extension in the European Super Cup against Real Madrid and strives for the second triumph at the "Supercopa de Espana".
Barcelona is the record winner with eleven successes so far.
Ma Long in a private league at table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympic champion.
The 27-year-old defeated Zhang Jike 4:0 on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro in a one-sided finale.
This led the world rankings first to win the "Golden Grand Slam" with successes at World Cup, World Cup, World Tour final tournament and Olympia.
Bronze went to the Japanese Jun Mizutani.
The two Chinese made it into the end game as expected and made up the title among themselves.
This made it clear that for the third time in a row a Chinese would get the single title in the sign of the Five Rings.
The last non-Chinese on the top Olympics was the former SVS-NÖ-Legionary Ryu Seung-min from South Korea.
Ma and Zhang were left alone on the record, between the sentences and at time-outs they had no coaches with them.
They had retreated to the Tribune and had their defenders loosely in the fair competition alone.
"I've played the matches for my country so far."
"I'm playing for myself in the finals," Zhang said.
After the game, gold and silver medal winners posed with the China flag.
The match itself was unexpected one-sided.
Ma had to fight with his 28-year-old opponent only in the first sentence.
After that he set the pace on the record and left Zhang only a total of 13 points.
Because of Ma's superiority, the expected moving match did not develop.
However, there were still enough breathtaking ball changes to be seen.
Mizutani won the bronze match against the 40-year-old Vladimir Samsonow 4:1.
In his quarter final against the German European champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov, the Belarus had contracted a rib injury, after which was in medical treatment, "finally" had to be satisfied with sheet metal.
By the way, the Swedes Jan-Ove Waldner (38/2004) and Jörgen Persson (42/2008) had become the same high table tennis age in Olympia.
Donald Trump clears huge problems in the election campaign
The leadership of the U.S. Republicans is plagued by massive concerns, even in traditional conservative states, to lose their majority.
Presidential candidate Donald Trump now admitted weaknesses in his election campaign in the former Republican high-rise Utah.
A rare moment in which the normally large-scale and self-assured multimillionaire expressed such concerns as correspondents reported.
After throwing 16 rivals out of the race within his own republican camp, the doubts about his success are growing in the struggle for the White House.
"We have huge problems in Utah," said Trump to evangelical Christians who asked for support in important states such as Ohio, Florida or Virginia.
If false reports were about his candidacy, he again recorded his well-known media shells.
Republican Hochburgen Waltering
Utah is usually a safe bank for Republicans.
According to a survey conducted by SurveyUSA in June, Trump and his competitor from the Democrats, Hillary Clinton, were in the same position.
Other institutions, however, do not provide Trump with the distance that is usual for Republican candidates in the state.
Arizona and Georgia are also considered to be at risk.
In an interview by the channel CNBC, Trump answered the question as to how he wanted to stop Clinton's advance march: "Genauso, how I've done it so far".
And pushed afterwards: This will "either be successful or I will make a very nice, long holiday".
He's doing nothing but "telling the truth."
If it was not enough for him at the end for reasons of political correctness, it was all right, Trump continued to say.
Then I return to a very good way of life.
According to press reports, the party should have threatened to cancel funds to support its election campaign, and should not be able to present better survey values.
Instead, the Republican candidates for the Congress want to be more impoverished.
Olympia: Three-fifty fraud in doping testing
The IOC intends to set up a Disciplinary Commission in this case.
Kenya's athletes are threatened by the second Doping affair at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro Ungemach.
After an attempted fraud during a doping check in the Olympic village, Kenya sent a trainer home.
The International Olympic Committee informed that it would immediately set up a disciplinary committee to investigate the case.
A Kenyan operative had announced that the former Sprinter and today's Coach, John Anzrah, had given a urine sample in the Olympic village under the name of Ferguson Rotich 800-meter runner.
This had been reported by the Doping Controllers to Kenya's team lead.
The World Association IAAF has requested the IOC to provide information on the case in order to work on its own investigations.
"Depending on the results of the investigation and the subsequent measures of the IOC, the IAAF will carry out an assessment," said an IAAF statement.
"He (Anzrah) went to the doping control station and spent himself as Ferguson Rotich, gave the sample and signed it," said Kenya's Chief of Mission Stephan Arap Soi.
He was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete who was on the list for the training controls of the World Anti-Doping Agency.
Ferguson Rotich had become more than 800 metres in 2015 in Beijing World Cup 4.
Four days earlier, Kenyan Athletics Director Michael Rotich had been withdrawn from the Rio Games.
He is said to have informed athletes of upcoming doping tests against money payments from his country.
According to media reports, he should have been arrested on his return to Nairobi Airport.
Kenya has been under special observation for a long time at the IOC following numerous doping events.
In the announcement of the IOC's more than 2000 doping targets before the Rio games, it was unusually pointed out that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia are being taken in the sights.
Before the summer games in Brazil, the World Anti-Doping Agency had put much pressure on the African country to create an anti-Doping law and a functioning control system.
The law was passed a few weeks before Olympia began.
As a result, WADA took Kenya from the list of countries whose doping action is in accordance with the rules of the WADA.
Kenya is considered a large runner nation.
The country's athletes won most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing.
In a series of television reports by the ARD, it has been repeatedly accused of being easily accessible in Kenya, and of having a significant mentality of sports fraud.
IOC member Richard Pound recently called for a similar investigation in Kenya, as he had done in Russian athletics.
It was demonstrated that this type of sport was extensively and systematically baptized.
Russia's athletes were then excluded from the summer games.
Salzburger "West Side Story" with Cecilia Bartoli
In Shakespeare's year, the Salzburg Festival presents the "West Side Story" with Tony and Maria as a tragic couple of lovers, similar to Romeo and Julia.
With a surprising Cecilia Bartoli.
A musical conquers Salzburg: the "West Side Story", Leornard Bernstein's masterpiece.
The artistic director Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical to the classical temple and fulfilled a youth dream with the role of Mary.
In the orchestral grave of the Simón Bolívar Orchestra under the direction of Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel: "This music is full of rhythm", he swarms.
We always say she's very Latin American.
There are many Latin American ingredients in their pace and melody.
It is a wonderful mixture, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.
I would say that we really have Bernstein's music in our blood!
In this production Bartoli plays an older Maria.
She remembers her love with Tony with me, while the younger Maria plays and dances.
The role of Mary has always fascinated me.
First of all because it is musically extraordinary!
And then there would be Mary's personality.
She says it in her song: "I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty and witty and bright".
So she's smart, of course naïve, and very passionate.
"She is very similar to me, my Italian character, which I have as a Roman," laughs Bartoli.
Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist."
It's such an honor to work with her for us.
She's a very generous person.
And Bartoli returns the compliment: "Dudamel is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate!"
Conducting is a necessity for him.
One sees it in each of his movements, in his eyes, it's his life!
It is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him.
We both have a rather southern temperament, a fire, a passion and also a cheerful approach to life, which is very important at all!
For American director Philip Wm. McKinley, the "West Side Story" is highly topical: "In this piece it is about prejudices and fanaticism."
Today we have the refugees, then the Puerto Ricans went to New York, and the New Yorkers didn't want them.
These are the same issues, and they are as meaningful today as they were then.
59 years later the piece is still relevant.
London schoolgirl who joined the IS was killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join the IS, reportedly died in Syria.
Lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said that her family learned about her death a few weeks ago in Raqqa, Syria.
It was suspected that she was killed by a Russian air raid in Raqqa, the Bollwerk of the group in the country, reported ITV News on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and died shortly after she had planned to leave the war - torn country and return to England.
"One can only hope that the only good is in it - as a warning and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going to a war zone - to stop people from ever making this decision," said Akunjee.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other schoolgirls from East London joined a plane to Turkey and then entered a bus to the Syrian border.
Sultana's family was told that she married an ISIS fighter in Syria - and became a widow within a few months.
Reid says that Clinton will remain candidate for the Supreme Court in the event of a election victory at Garland
Harry Reid, leader of the Democrats in the Senate, is convinced that the presidential candidate of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton, will nominate Judge Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court.
The Republicans in the Senate have blocked Garland's confirmation since his nomination by Barack Obama in March.
The majority leader in the Senate Mitch McConnell believes that the next president will appoint the successor of the deceased judge to the Supreme Court Antonin Scalia.
Reid said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he expected Garland to select "with a certain degree of certainty".
A spokeswoman from Reid later said that he had not yet spoken to Clinton if she would nominate Garland and he speculate.
He praised Garland and said that Clinton's team wouldn't worry about a new candidate.
Garland is the U.S. Supreme Court of Appeal for the District of Columbia.
Raid said that Republicans blocked the Garland nomination, were Lakai and helpers of the Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He also noted that Donald Trump was unsuitable for the president's office.
Treats wants nude calendar for "Women and Men"
The treats magazine is working with photographer David Bellemere to produce a 1970s Pirelli-inspired calendar for 2017.
But instead of famous naked people, they want to find the next generation of top models for their NU Muses Calendar for 2017.
The editor-in-chief of Treats Steve Shaw told us at the beginning of this year that his nude magazine was different from Oldschool Playboys because "Playboy is for men".
I'm doing this for women.
Apparently, he believes that the calendar does too.
"We need to return to the portrayal of timeless and classic handicaps in which both women and men feel comfortable and are inspired by these images of a female body," said Shaw in a press release on the publication of the calendar.
Women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art.
Models can submit their images online or personally at open casting call in Los Angeles and New York.
Turkey: Kurdish municipality expects mass flight
"Whoever doesn't adapt and praise Erdogan sits on packed suitcases," says Ercan Karakoyun, president of the Gülen-near Foundation for Dialogue and the World.
In the short term, the Kurdish municipality of Germany expects tens of thousands of people seeking protection who flee from Turkey to Germany.
In the medium term, it could even be "a few hundred thousand," believes the president of the Federation Ali Toprak.
The Kurdish municipality of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany due to the hard action of the Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the coup attempt.
"In the short term, I am counting on tens of thousands, in the medium term, with a few hundred thousand people seeking protection from Turkey in Germany, when the Erdogan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition," says the Federal President Ali Toprak of the "World" of Friday.
Because the government had been transferring Kurdish strongholds with criminal action months ago, 500,000 Kurds were fleeing within Turkey.
After the spoiled coup, secular and oppositional ethnic Turks were added.
Many will want to start again in Europe if they continue to be oppressed in Turkey.
"It can't be that a state that takes up refugees itself produces refugees in its own country," said Toprak.
The head of the Association complained about the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish, but also in Alevian cities.
So Erdogan wants to increase the exit pressure on the remaining Kurds.
"They are the last great minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have already been exterminated or displaced in the past hundred years," said Toprak, who is also a CDU member.
The head of the Association demanded that the federal government "position itself as sharp as Austria against Erdogan and his followers".
Also in Germany a "Hexenhund" takes place against Erdogan critics.
I don't feel safe in Germany for the first time in the last few months.
The German branch of the Gülen movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad.
More Turks will look for asylum in Germany, especially Kurds and Oppositionelles.
The branding as a golden supporter destroys the professional existence of teachers and other academics.
"He who does not adapt and praise Erdogan sits on packed suitcases, by the way also the chemists and secularists," said Ercan Karakoyun, chairman of the Gülen-nären Stiftung Dialog und Bildung, der "Welt.
As the newspaper reports under appeal to figures from the Federal Ministry of the Interior, the Turks presented before the coup the largest group of the asylum holders recognised for political persecution in Germany.
On the 30th of June, this had been 11,386 people and thus almost 29 percent of all recognized as eligible for asylum (39,625).
This survey does not include those who fled from war, poverty, or perspective.
Asylum entitled under the Basic Law are exclusively politically, that is, by state, individually persecuted.
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: "Go where it hurts"
Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: The locals get nothing from the summer election with - and the vacationers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to choose the country.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, they understood.
In 2021 the Landtag elections will not take place again at the end of the summer holidays, the Parliament of Sweden has already decided at the beginning of the year.
Because it's not going to be stupider than it has been until now: summer holidays, heat and land day elections - that's eating up.
The locals who are supposed to be convinced by the electorate are on holiday.
Most of the holidaymakers who are in the country, traveling on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee, are not locals, so do not choose the country day.
There are also practical problems: during the holidays, help hang up the posters, blow up the balloons, distribute the flyers and count votes, only push up the posters effortlessly.
Until the 4th September 2016, the election and last holiday, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern must once again have an election campaign just past the people.
The hot phase, if you can say so at all, has just begun.
And it's also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of an SPD/CDU coalition, has to fear for his office.
The SPD, since 1998, the strongest party, is now clearly behind the CDU in polls.
Excitingly, how strong new AfD cuts off and what remains at the end of the coalition.
Sellering, 66 years old and since 2008 Head of Government, makes an almost unobtrusive election campaign, one looks at his large posters.
He travels through the country, distributes roses and chats a little with the people, just as his legendary wortkarger predecessor Harald Ringstorff did.
Otherwise, Seeelring got cold feet and blames Chancellor Merkel on the flowering of the AfD.
Your refugee policy, you "We can do this" has accelerated the rise of right-wing populists, which will probably cost him the beautiful office.
The CDU with its leading candidate, the Interior Minister Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced what it is like to make a campaign in the right place at the wrong time.
She has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to major competitions; Merkel Bundestagswahlkreis is located in the northeast.
But the target group was not right, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berliner and Saxony there than Mecklenburger and Vorpommern.
"There was probably the majority from other federal states," complained Vincent Kokert, Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in the NDR.
But it doesn't hurt anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel.
Otherwise, the North-East CDU largely refrains from the usual campaign on the marketplaces and from shopping centers with parasols and balloons.
This, Kokert says, only plays a "subordinate role".
The Union has also noticed that in the country you are breaking the ground that it has to make a lot of effort to find a wire to the people again.
You are like the left, the SPD, the Greens: hardly present in the far corners of the country.
The advice of the CDU election fighter Kokert to his fellow warriors, however, is also self-evident: "You must go where it hurts, namely where the people are: village parties, golden weddings, each birthday celebration must be used".
Because a lot is at stake, Sellering has now called his SPD to a particularly committed election campaign.
In surveys, the Social Democrats were last behind partner CDU (25) with 22 percent and only just before the AfD (19).
In the 2011 election, the SPD had clearly won 35.6 percent in front of the CDU (22).
The Green Party, with seven percent in the polls, is expected to make the leap into the Landtag.
They make a modern virtue out of the holiday note and put their election campaign largely into the Internet.

Otherwise, green electoral fighters go looking for local voters among the holidaymakers.
Silke Gajek, the leading candidate, just bends through the mecklenburg lakes with a houseboat and also finds it beautiful.
Her impression: "Walk leave in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is no punishment".
B27 refurbishment: restaurants suffer from lockdown
At the speed with which the B 27 is refurbished, there is nothing to mercenary.
For those responsible for the construction work, which starts at 5.30 a.m. and ends only at about 20 a.m., there is a total of praise.
"They've made everything pretty tough," says Elvira Tetzlaff of the Jet Tanking Station.
That's a superteam.
There's no delay either.
The construction site was scheduled to be moved south at the beginning of the week, until the end of October.
It is also a tribute to the escape of those responsible for the construction work, for example, when it comes to the establishment of entrances for assistance.
Since the construction site has migrated to the south on Monday and the barrier of the Aspergstraße has also been lifted in Ofterdingen and thus the connection to Rottenburg also exists again, the traffic situation within the place has relaxed.
Citizens can now travel from the B 27 to the B side again.
There seems to be a decline in the way out of town.
"There were some significant complaints," says Florian King, Deputy Head of the Department of Transport Management of Rehabilitation.
The residents of Bachsatzstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise, because many tow paths were looking for and rather familiar to their navi than the signage.
Which led to some trucks being twisted in residential areas.
Since the speed limits were not respected, the municipality also urged the measuring vehicle from Mössingen.
"There were considerable exceedances," says King, who once made himself known on the spot about the situation.
There's been a flashing of two to three a minute.
The fastest one was on the road at 77 km/h in the Tempo-30 zone.
Since the construction site moved on, however, it has become calmer.
For the businessmen at the B 27, it is only a small comfort that customers from Rottenburg now have the street open again.
Businessmen don't like looking into the cards.
But that the B 27 refurbishment has led them to sales breaks, lets anyone you ask see through.
However, some are more and some are less affected.
Those who have less to do with the "end customers", i.e. produce for other companies, for which the renovation has little to do.
Thomas Sulz also speaks of a "highly slight decline" at Maier car house, but he also admits that of course "the running customer is missing".
The locals along the road are the strongest.
J. Albert Göhner, owner of the Steakhouse, formerly Krone, finds clear words.
This is threatening to exist.
Not only he, but all the restaurants have "hardly met it".
The customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil were missing.
We must be happy about every euro of sales.
The loss of sales is calculated as "wide over 50 percent".
The refurbishment of the road has been "rejected for two years".
Half of his employees had to get rid of him.
If I had a company with 4000 employees and half of them had been released, politics would have reacted differently.
Instead, government president Jörg Schmidt replied to a request from Göhner whether there could be a financial compensation, with the indication that the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the benefits of the situation at B 27. Now it must also bear the disadvantages resulting from the renovation.
Göhner knows about other districts where such a more generous handling was done.
In all complaints, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will remain.
Finally, the family business has been located here since 1715, he points to the long history.
He can understand that other regulars are now less often passing by because of complicated traffic management.
If you can't drive here, it's nice somewhere else.
That his clientele returns after the completion of the renovation work, Göhner has no doubt about it.
Despite the crises with BSE and bird flu, Göhner maintains the impact of the B 27 construction work on his clientship for the biggest crisis that his restaurant has experienced in its long-standing history.
Six months of construction work, that's already brutal.
Constantly, in the name of the fight against terrorism, laws are being scrapped.
After the recent attacks, Minister of Interior de Maizière now presents a thick security package.
But what does a tolerance status have to do with terror?
And what does the coalition partner say about all this?
Thomas de Maizière gives the reconciliation.
All of his proposals were "politically reasonable" to the coalition partner, the Federal Minister of Interior said in presenting his new security package.
They don't charge anyone.
Other, further points would initially be discussed within the parties.
I'm part of it too.
As Minister of Interior, however, he was on the verge of results and an "alternative consensus" within the coalition.
After the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, De Maizière has allowed a little time before presenting his conclusions on security in the Republic.
But they are now all the more likely to do so.
Some things are already known, announced, pointing out: that a new security authority should take care of cracking encrypted communication is not new.
Nor does Germany need to implement several EU regulations on passenger data and arms law.
The call for more video surveillance and security personnel is also not surprising.
In part, de Maizière starts a second call for proposals that have not yet been dealt with with with the SPD: He wants to impose punishment on jihadists with double citizenship on the German passport.
"These will be difficult points for the SPD", the CDU man admits.
He still thinks this is reasonable and does not demand anything, which the coalition partner has no chance at all.
A few new ideas will also be presented by de Maizière.
They have it in themselves: He plans quick procedures for deportations and more possibilities for detaining people before deportation.
Refugees who are targeted to be taken to the country should have their smartphones checked before and disclose social media accounts for a security check.
In the case of tolerances for rejected asylum seekers, he wants to make some even worse than before - for example, those who commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers in order to conceal their identity.
Some of them are politically and legally delicate.
Some also seem unexplained and leave questions open.
And on some points - for example, the unequal treatment of the patient - the question arises: What does this really have to do with security and terror?
Yes, says de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the issues of refugees and terrorism.
But it can't be said that the assassins of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.
In addition, many people were concerned about security in view of the high number of refugees.
And things that were deeply occupied by the people were not allowed to fade away even in election times.
Internal security has become enormously focused.
Only the attacks in the neighborhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.
Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.
The uncertainty is great.
And yes, there are elections.
The Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly in favour of internal security.
In recent days there has been a high trend between the two parties.
Only a ghastly dispute over the armaments of the federal police, then a security policy idea collection of some EU ministers, in which the heads of department also demand a ban on Burka and a departure from dual citizenship.
De Maizière also strives for conciliatory tones.
From a departure from the double pass, he'll keep nothing.
We have satisfied the discussion in Germany.
They're opening up, don't make sense.
And in the case of a Burka ban, he has constitutional concerns.
Whether its own package is constitutionally strong at all corners and whether it is actually "acceptable" for the coalition partner, it has to show itself.
There's a lot in there that could cause a fight.
But the SPD is also currently trying to profile itself on the topic of internal security.
The party leader Sigmar Gabriel gently signals the willingness to talk and says, "The SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to increase security."
Volkswagen is still passing through.
Despite diesel scandals, delivery figures worldwide are rising.
But not all markets are running around.
When the recall action is taken, there is a vortex around a term.
Volkswagen starts with deliveries of performers in the second half of the year.
Although Europe's largest car manufacturer has been able to show an increase in its many brands and some of its well-running markets in spite of the diesel business in the past year.
In July, however, the core brand VW weakened mainly in Western Europe and thus re-expressed the total sales, as the company listed in the Dax announced.
In July, the VW brand sold 1.8 percent less cars in the world than in the previous month, with 449100 cars.
Only in Western Europe, according to China the second most important market, sales were 14 percent below the previous month.
In the home market of Germany, deliveries were down by almost one-sixth.
Brand Sales Manager Jürgen Stackmann brought down the weaker figures from July, mainly on two days of sales less in Europe.
In addition, there has been a buy-back in some core markets through "changed economic conditions".
In addition to the situation surrounding Turkey's coup d'état, the British vote on withdrawal from the EU also stressed a spokesperson.
In the U.S., where the exhaust gas business first escalated, there is also a minus to beech.
Large support for VW is the Chinese market.
In total, the mainly affected house brand of the Lower Saxony comes through the diesel scandal.After the first seven months, only a delivery cut of 0.9 percent to 3.37 million vehicles is available.
From January to July, Group Sales Manager Fred Kappler continued to show a sales price.
About 1.3 percent more vehicles delivered Volkswagen at this time, 5.904 million worldwide.
Volkswagen had manipulated with a software exhaust test.
In Germany alone, VW calls around 2.5 million cars for refurbishment to the workshops.
In the course of the upgrade, VW confirmed that the conversion of the cars did not have any negative effects.
After the refurbishment of the vehicles, there is no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine power.
After the upgrade, the car builder issues the customer a "guarantee equal" certificate, but do not refer to a "guarantee", as it was called on Friday in corporate circles.
Reasons were legal subtleties.
The "Focus" had reported that Volkswagen now provides its German customers with a guarantee for refurbished diesel models.
This would have been confirmed by VW representatives at the Federal Ministry of Transport last Monday.
The Ministry of Transport confirmed that there was this meeting.
"VW has to fully comply with the requirements of my investigation committee and the KBA."
"Derogations are not accepted," said Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), according to the Ministry.
VW has assumed the guarantee that there are no deteriorations in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine performance after the upgrade and all vehicle type-approval-relevant values remain unchanged.
Volkswagen itself does not use the term "guarantee" as it was called in corporate circles.
In the broad term "guarantee", Volkswagen sees the possibility that, for example, half a year after refurbishment, customers will come to a workshop with a motor damage - and this could be traced back to the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do with it.
In the interest of customers, it is also important to avoid any other damage that has nothing to do with the exhaust gas scandal becoming an uncertainty about possible warranty arrangements, as it was called.
This is why VW does not use the term "guarantee".
The Raiffeisenbank Gmund am Tegernsee requires rich savers to pay fines in future - as the second institute in Germany.
Bank manager Josef Paul said on Thursday: "It is only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on giro or daily cash accounts".
The Bundesverband Deutscher Banken speaks of a single case and sees no signal in it: Normal savers should "not be afraid to pay for their savings gross penalty".
If banks store money overnight at the European Central Bank (ECB), they must pay their 0.4 percent penalty interest.
As of September, the Raiffeisenbank Gmund will charge private and corporate customers for deposits of more than 100,000 euros on giro or daily cash accounts.
"The first 100,000 euros are free."
"The next 100,000 costs 400 euros a year in the future," said Paul.
He has for some time been keeping 40 million euros, which could be lifted from one day to the other and which he could not use.
"They are in my bank account and 0.4 percent cost," said the bank manager.
"I can't spend 4,000 euros for every million."
The cost is now passed on to the polluter-pays principle.
Simply leaving the cash in the stocks of the Raiffeisenbank would be far too dangerous: "I've already experienced four attacks, I don't like the fifth one!" said the bank manager.
Most customers had understanding and changed to other forms of investment.
Few migrated to other banks.
The Bayern Cooperative Association stated: "The ECB's extreme monetary policy rate is causing considerable costs for all banks".
To carry them alone is "not possible on a permanent basis".
Some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account management, credit cards or transfers.
The Thuringian Volks- und Raiffeisenbank Altenburger Land had made headlines with its 2014 Skatbank-Filiale with fine interest for deposits from three million euros.
Michael Kemer, Managing Director of the Banking Association, said: "We do not expect private customers to have to pay a comprehensive fee for deposits, the competition in Germany among banks and savings banks is far too strong."
A banker said that at Lake Tegern it gave "a client who is somewhat more sophisticated from the fortune".
"This can become a problem for a small bank" if they keep money free of charge.
Founded in 1911, Gmund has branches in Bad Wiessee, Rottach-Egern, Kreuth and Tegernsee.
In the region there are well-known actors, athletes and entrepreneurs.
"There are currently no other banks known to the Bayern cooperative association, which calculate an allowance for deposits of private customers," said Spokesperson Ernst.
At the end of June, the President of the Bundesverband of the German People's Banks and Raiffeisenbanks (BVR), Uwe Fröhlich, had declared: "The threshold of going to the negative towards the private customer is very, very high".
The competition is hard, and it threatens the emigration of investors to competition.
The customers in Germany will not be able to fall in width.
Destination Plates: Who actually buys records?
Lonely men of middle age love plates.
Before you jump to the comment part to overlook it under the pseudonym NotAll Single MenMean Ages with rough insults, this statement derives from current data.
According to YouGov, the highly discussed resurgence of records is not a boom in millennials that wants to welcome the news of physical objects, but a result of midlife nostalgia.
Those who recently bought a record are in all probability between 45 and 54.
In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely buyer group.
It is also not a horde of hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older record buyers keep their feelings rather for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).
But are the results of YouGov correct?
If this blog were a news report on TV, the camera would follow me while I was walking in the middle of a busy street in Soho, wearing a modest gray suit and stealing wildly before I stood still, holding my hands and saying something decisive like, "So, let's take a closer look at it."
So, let's take a look at that.
Even though the heart of Soho is slowly losing its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where once independent sellers were located - there is still a handful of fantastic record specialty shops.
I would probably ask the cameraman to turn off the camera for the next part, where I am standing in the immediate vicinity of different men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind by observing.
Stuart from Glasgow, 55, followed by Sister Ray (data count: two young women, three middle-aged men) to the Reckless Records (data number: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably around 20), is one day due to a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.
Is he a collector?
"I guess so," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I did not follow him home), undress the walls of his living room.
The reason why he owns such a large number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records that he could not afford when they appeared and to buy again items he sold when he was young and plowed.
"Many things I buy are from the late '60s, early '70s, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. Things I was probably too young to buy them," he says.
He agrees that those who buy plates are more introverted and like to spend time alone, adding: "I don't smoke and I don't drink very much.
That's my vice.
Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many customers he meets meet the YouGov profile.
However, he has also noticed a new wave of people that are influenced by the media hpe, people who have heard about the comeback and have been prompted to buy their old records again.
Of the conversations I've been conducting, people usually got rid of their collection around 1998 or 1999.
Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again," he says.
This would explain the boom to supporters of the record revival of a certain age.
But what about the supposed emotional meaning of records?
It only takes a few seconds in a business like Phonica to realize that record stores offer a calming community of like-minded people.
According to Wez, some of the older customers were inciting the contactless payment system.
Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar record covers, from objects that wake up happy youth memories.
"I think sometimes it can be the filling of an empty or the possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort," says Wez.
It's like this with me as a collector, and I think it's like that with a lot of people.
It is an easy way to engage spiritually.
"We're like their social workers!" a staff member floats out of a pile of records.
A survey by the ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of people who bought a record last month have not heard them yet.
The survey also found that 41% have a record player that they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record do not have a record player.
At this point in the news report, I would probably look very concerned as I browse through a stack of Bossa Nova compilations.
Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (data number: three men of middle age), has noticed a "trophy aspect" of the Revival.
"Someone just came in here and said, "I don't own a record player, but I would like to buy a radiohead record so I can put it in the shelf," he says.
This is not a large percentage, but it definitely happens.
More product-intensive, less music-intensive.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player."
These are younger people, not older ones, who just come in slowly.
Fopp, who dedicated almost an entire floor to the records, has a colorful audience when I go in.
There are couples around 70, tourists taking photos, teen boys and middle-aged women.
Although the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - Wild Beast's newest synthesizer and sex-packed pop instead of experimental jazz sounds from the speakers - it is good to see such diversity among the customers.
None of them look particularly lonely, but nagging psychological traumas are difficult to detect when standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been running around in business for a few minutes and looks at the variety of records for sale.
She's more of a windowbug than a big one.
It doesn't deserve much, so collecting records isn't a real option, she says.
It costs a lot.
It is easy to hear music from a computer or in other ways, but the beauty of records is..." it drives off with a falling sigh.
I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.
My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: Urban Outfitters.
While I seem to sample the Jeans Hotpants, I watch a group of young teenage girls who group for a moment around Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter consider buying a Crosley record player.
On the left is a stairwell, a wall full of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.
No one looks at them - perhaps because they are purely decorative, some so far up that it is impossible to touch them.
It's pure "platting".
But in view of the fact that any attraction for these items means more money for the industry and could send some customers to the depths Sohos for more, there is nothing to complain about.
It is no surprise that a population that has more time and money than others is also the one that spends the most on luxury items like records.
Even though my research revealed that the results of YouGov are correct, they do not take into account, at least in record stores in Soho, the large number of female collectors and record lovers who exist in reality, record stores and online forums.
These people are probably working hard at school or in offices.
They certainly don't spend their Thursday morning strolling through record shops on Berwick Street and the leaves through plates, while avoiding the staring gaze of an unsightly, 30-year-old false moderator who's not raising men of middle age on the shoulders.
The Greenland shark is the longest living vertebrate - video report
Scientifically say that the Greenland shark has the longest life span of all vertebrates on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who examines sharks, says that the record was in a female that assumes that it is between 272 and 512 years old and five meters long
French court refuses offer of demolition of shops in the jungle refugee camps
A French court has rejected an offer from the authorities in Calais to tear down dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, where thousands of refugees live.
In a court hearing this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the State should be empowered to tear down 72 provisional shops in which persons inside the warehouse sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer hairdressing services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants.
The prefecture of Calais argued that these places should be demolished because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which pose a fire and sanitation risk.
Humanitarian groups informed the court that the shops and restaurants were important because the free meals offered by the state-supported association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.
They also stated that the provisional shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.
A court in Lille decided that there was no legal basis for the expulsion of people who did the 72 provisional business, but admitted that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais "are clearly understandable."
Judge Jean-François Molla said that the food shops, cafes and restaurants would play a much greater role than just feeding people who "live in extremely precarious conditions."
He said that the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers.
One of the places threatened by the low-rise was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the Camp, which is operated in a non-profit manner and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes, as well as advice on asylum cases for hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed the petition to preserve the Kids' Café.
In a letter to the Guardian, it was said that the closure "was a disaster for these children, the youngest of whom are eight years old."
The two relief organizations Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle had risen to over 9,000 - the highest number so far - after a steep increase of new arrivals during the summer.
Despite Olympia's disappointment: Martin remains fighting
Despite his disappointing appearance in the Olympics, Radprof Tony Martin does not want to be defeated.
"I keep looking at the World Cup, stay confident and fight ahead," wrote the 31-year-old on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro on Facebook.
He has no explanation for his miserable twelfth place at the sugar hut.
"I honestly find it hard to comment on yesterday's time trial," said Martin.
He had to analyze in silence what reasons had led to debacle.
At the time trial World Cup in October in Qatar Martin actually wanted to compete for the title.
"I'll look at everything we've changed lately."
"This also counts as my position," wrote the three-time world champion who had lost more than three minutes on Wednesday on the 54,5 km Olympic champion Fabian Cancellara (Switzerland).
Olympia: Tennis pro Siegemund missed semifinals
The victory march of Laura Siegemund ended in the quarter final of Rio: The world ranking list 32. from Metzingen missed by a 1:6, 1:6 against Monica Puig (Puerto Rico/WTA-Nr.
34) the semifinal of the Olympic Tennis Tournament.
Siegemund, who was plagued by back problems, was able to carry out her appeal only once and seemed powerless compared to the previous rounds.
On Thursday, Medaillenhoffnung Angelique Kerber (Kiel/No. 2) had the chance to jump into the lead round.
The Australian Open winner met the British Johanna Konta (No. 10).
As the last German tennis pro, Tommy Haas had won a medal (silver) in Sydney in 2000.
Two German DTB starters in the quarter finals of summer games had last been held in 1992.
Never before was a German duo standing in an Olympic solo semifinal.
Group is increasing on start-up for live video game transfers
While watching other people playing video games, it's a giant trend - Microsoft also wants to benefit from it.
The technology group buys the start-up Beam, which specializes in this hobby.
How much money flows for the takeover, Microsoft did not announce on Thursday.
Beam started with his offer only in January and already has more than 100,000 users.
You can watch others play, but you can also intervene yourself.
For example, they can give up missions to players and confront enemies as well as provide equipment.
The player's activation Blizzard launches a new HD video service for the booming world of e-sports.
On the way to the global media event, Facebook should help.
The advertising industry is already watching.
The employees of the start-up, who so far have their headquarters in Seattle in the US state of Washington, will move to the Microsoft headquarters in the California Redmond, as Beam co-founder and Chief Matt Salsamendi announced.
Therefore, the takeover is not intended to change anything for customers.
According to Microsoft, Beam is integrated into the video game department around the Xbox console.
The market of live streaming of video game activities is growing rapidly.
Known platforms are Twitch and YouTube Gaming.
Twitch was purchased by Amazon online dealer in 2014 - for almost a billion dollars.
YouTube Gaming belongs to the Google Mother Alphabet.
Here comes the Enforcement Trailer
Germany's Raser needs to adjust to the next generation of speedometers: In various federal states, including Hessen and Brandenburg, new flash devices are being tested, which are intended to transfer tempo sinter particularly effectively.
For example, the futuristic Enforcement Trailer of Vitronic from Wiesbaden can be used at accident focuses where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police.
For example, at motorway construction sites or to refurbishments with temporary speed limits, there is often no infrastructure needed to ensure compliance with speed limits with a stationary flashlight.
However, permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or excessive.
The Enforcement Trailer is authentic: its battery lasts five days for continuous measurement, the case data is encrypted via a modem.
Laser measuring technology also allows all vehicles to be recorded over multiple tracks at the same time.
Variable speed limits as well as traffic bans according to time, lanes and vehicle class can also be monitored.
You can move the trailer in its state, according to the manufacturer, with each car with trailer coupling.
In order not to be easily stolen, it is lowered in the measuring operation, so that the wheels disappear in the armored and, by the way, also bulletproof outer shells.
In addition, a built-in alarm system is intended to protect the lightning device from vandalism.
Since 2015, the trailer has been tested according to Vitronic in various federal states and is now also used.
Also foreign authorities flash with the new technology: Recently, France ordered 100 pieces after an order of 150 pieces last year.
Great Britain gets silver in the 7th rugby after Fiji masterclass gets gold
The impressive performance of Great Britain at the 7th Rugby came to an abrupt halt at the last hurdle in the form of Fiji on Thursday evening, when they were beaten with a result of 43-7 at the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji awarded a master class in handling, side-stepping, reversing, line running and raw force to win gold - its first Olympic medal of any color.
The defeat was sweetened by the not too bad consolation price of the silver medal - Britain's fourth on that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The clear defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-final on the same day, could fall back on them in the final.
But no matter what, Fiji would have beat a 15-man team in the best form in this form.
It could be a comfort to GB - but it probably won't - that at least one Briton will have a gold medal hanging around his neck tomorrow: Fiji's Chief Trainer Ben Ryan, the former head of England from Wimbledon.
GB had a difficult way behind it.
Eight years ago, they lost every game in the Adelaide Sevens under Ryan.
Here they just lost one.
This slap is gonna hurt, but progress is amazing.
Fiji began wonderfully and had the attacks of GB sprang out of fun.
It felt like the captain Tom Mitchell and Co. were running in driving buses. World Series winners went up 5-0 when Osea Kolinisau crossed the corner.
With four more minutes of playing time, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner, which he transformed.
12-0 and GB have hardly touched the ball.
A hevvorgängen tackle of Mitchell stopped reaching the mountain of Man Leone Nakarawa a third goal, but it just stopped Fiji.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua took a touchdown in the right corner and it was 0-17 for GB.
Nakarawa added a new one since the rebuff and there was still over a minute of playing time ... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravousu talked through other weak branches of the GB team and stormed up to the line to make a goal.
The conversion resulted in a 29-0 until the break.
It is as if Fiji was born to play the 7 while GB is still learning.
That's the way it is.
GB made fundamental changes to the half-life and closed the Fijian gap...for four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time until Joshua Tuisova went through after a brilliant interplay by Fiji.
Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game has long been in favor of the South Sea Insulars, whose fans sang, fangs waved and danced on the Tribune.
It was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fiji.
Mata Viliame put the i-dump with another try in the last seconds.
The piff sounded, the Fijis hugged themselves, and GB kicked to annihilation hit the lawns.
Earlier in the day, Fiji had defeated Japan in the semi-final with 20-5 and Britain pushed South Africa in a short semi-final match from the race - Great Britain's conversion of the difference.
Kyle Brown brought the boxes in the first half forward, but Dan Norton broke through the line with an impressive footwork and scored a gate under the posts in the second half.
A brilliant late tackling by Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-Aside Team, secured the prize - and with it the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by struggle with the cancer of the coach to row victory
There won't be any emotional gold than in these games and that's what's going to be called.
From the first rowing stroke to the last, 220 hard Hieve, which goes into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.
Although there were only the two sitting on the rower, there were three voices in the boat. The echo of the coach Robin Williams, was omnipresent when they rowed to the second Olympic gold in the two consecutive without a tax lady, the first women in the history of British sports who set such a scale.
Her dominance was absolute, at least her 39.ter unbeaten bet, which is also unprecedented.
What we see are two brilliant athletes who glide across the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not reflect the type of triumph to goose.
Behind every gold in the row is a battalion of willing helpers who contribute to the incremental progress that makes the difference and it was no one more helpful than the coach who didn't know 30 months ago if he would ever survive that day than he was diagnosed with cancer.
Like he said, he was a little risky.
I had bladder cancer, which is operable, and they did.
If you don't do that, he'll spread everywhere.
It would have been a pretty bad situation.
It changes the view a little.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio was lucky that he was being treated at the beginning of 2014, outside the season, which kept the interruption to a minimum, if that is at all the right term under such circumstances.
I needed money, so I had to get better soon.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suffice.
That's how it starts.
Rowing itself is already a challenge, but that makes it even bigger.
In the instantness of the victory her first thoughts went on Williams, who spent a nervous morning talking with him a little more than usual, trying to process his own fears.
Stanning, who was a captain of the Royal Artillery regiment in an operation in Afghanistan, said, "I was an emotional wreck this week. That might be a bit extreme, but it means so much."
It only repeats how much that means to me how much I and Helen and Robin have worked.
It was three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin we wouldn't be anyone, so a massive thank you goes to him. He's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have wished for a better person to train or a better coach.
Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a race in the last five years.
The couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up with.
Even in the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to join, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.
We were very caught right now.
Helen called "keep in the process, stay in the process."
It's really important not to be caught.
We had a good start and at the same time we didn't want to do something great.
We didn't want fireworks today, we just wanted to get a good result, go out and win the race, whatever we did.
The couple will take a break for a year before it will make decisions about its future.
Glover must appear at a wedding next week, her own with Steve Backshall's TV adventurer.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean to say this was my last race.
That would have meant too much pressure.
In London it took about six months to understand that I am an Olympic champion.
It was all so new to me and I was so stressed.
Here it took about four minutes.
It feels so much better," she said.
For 31 years modelled for clarity
The managing director of the "Veitensteingruppe", Ruppert Göller, is retired.
The association is regarded as a "bay-wide model".
A small Franconian drinking water pool as a model for the large water producers.
So it was called in the original tone some time ago in a contribution of the Bavarian radio.
Little later, the Water Forum of the Government of Unterfranken acknowledged the purpose of the organization.
The work of the Veitenstein group was "bayernwide as exemplary".
Behind all this is Rupert Göller, who was a member of the Touchverband for 31 years, of which 28 years is a managing director.
He was now retired at the age of 65.
The Veitenstein group's drinking water association, based in Kottendorf, Breitbrunn, promotes about 150,000 cubic meters of water each year and supplies 32 places and hamlets with about 5500 inhabitants.
The municipalities are Kirchlauter, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the city of Baunach.
There are water supply contracts for other cities and municipalities.
The current chairman, Breitbrunn's mayor Gertrud Bühl (FW), recalled that Rupert Göller was appointed waterguard in 1985 and was appointed managing director of the Touchverband in 1988.
"His tasks have been very diverse and extended from water pipeline construction and maintenance work to office and organisational activities, budget planning, calculation of fees and contributions to emergencies on weekends," said the president.
As outstanding events, it named the start-up and launch of the new wells (1994), property purchases in the area of the new well (1998) and compensation for farmers, the renovation of the high tanks (1999), the re-acquisition of a central computer control (2004) and the partial renewal of water pipelines.
There has been no stoppage and there have been repeated innovations, because water means life and drinking water is the most important food.
In her laudatio she praised Göller's faithful, reliable and correct service for over 31 years.
He has used a lot of heart blood for his body of water, and he has lived the body of water as if it were his own company.
A few weeks ago, as a real practitioner, he had been allowed to present the success concept of the Veitenstein Group on nitrate lowering in front of the Water Forum of the district of Unterfranken.
He has received a great deal of recognition and praise for this.
On the other hand, Rupert Göller praised Alfons Griebel's Waterwart, who had worked with him for 28 years.
He is the best waterguard and he was a faithful button.
Together we were an unbeatable team.
As highlights from his point of view, he referred to the Brunnenbau and the re-structuring of the purpose association.
However, the biggest challenge and the most difficult use were the tube break at the high tank at Kirchlauter on January 3.
Here, work will have to be done at minus 17 degrees throughout the night, so that the villages could be supplied with water.
Even the supply of Neubrunn could only have been maintained once because the high tanks of Pettstadt were filled with hoses.
The management of the drinking water association was handed over to Daniel Stürmer from Lauter, who takes up the succession of Rupert Göller.
Soprano Anna Netrebko openly changes her son Tiago's autism - and turns to other affected parents: "You must have the courage to talk about it."
"The medicine has made great progress," said the 44-year-old of the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera.
When the illness had been recognized by her son, she believed that she had to die.
Meanwhile, the eight-year-old Tiago has progressed well and is now learning privately in New York, where there are the best therapists.
"To give an example, if I ask him something that goes back two years when I sang at the Milan Scala, he doesn't remember anything," said Netrebko.
But he is the happiest person on earth.
Tiago comes from Netrebko's association with the bass baritone Erwin Scratt.
She is now married to the tenor Yusif Eyvazov.
Country of relationship in Bargteheide - Man shoots at companion
A 35-year-old man shot his partner at a multifamily house in Bargteheide (Kreis Stormarn) on Friday around 10.45 a.m. and killed her.
"The man himself called us and indicated that he had shot his partner," said a police spokesperson.
The perpetrator was on the run, after which he was publicly given.
Meanwhile, because Sven S. could be on the road by car.
The man is about six feet tall, muscular, brownish and has a smooth.
Meanwhile, the police have published a photo of him.
It is, however, a few years old.
Meanwhile, the man wears a glass.
The man is not to be addressed directly.
He could still carry the gun with him, the police said.
Anyone who sees Sven S. should call the 110.
The police are talking about a "relationship state".
The victim was in 1988, the perpetrator in 1981.
The responsible police in Lübeck did not want to make information about the tattoo or the relationship between the perpetrator and the victim, but she confirmed that a person had been killed.
"It's a death penalty."
"We don't say any more at the moment," said a police officer in Lübeck.
According to eyewitnesses, a special operation command (SEK) was at the scene of the crime.
Steel - Lighting view for the German steel industry
The crisis-affected and energy-intensive German steel industry continues to be spared from additional costs in millions.
Financial burdens threatening the sector from eco-energy funding are on the table.
It remained during the liberation of the renewable energy environment at existing plants to the so-called own electricity production in the German steel industry, said Federal Minister for Economic Affairs Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" (WAZ, Friday issue).
"I'm really glad we could finally achieve this after two years of tough negotiations."
The European Commission had therefore initially planned to request the steel producers to use the gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption.
According to the German industry association, the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year.
Gabriel told WAZ that there was now a general agreement with the EU Commission following discussions with Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.
Only when the generators are replaced in the steelworks will an EEG conversion of 20 percent apply.
But these too will not be raised in the steel industry.
The IG Metal welcomed Germany's agreement with the EU Commission on electricity generation.
This will largely determine the status quo of the previous regulation.
The successful efforts of Gabriel have a special significance for the steel industry.
"In terms of our steel campaign, this is a first step."
"Further must follow."
"Emissions trading reform also considers climate and employment goals," said IG Metall-Chief Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt.
The steel industry in Europe has been suffering from overcapacity and significant price pressure since the financial crisis in 2008.
Last year, the situation continued to deteriorate as the world's largest producer country, China, was casting massive steel on the world market in the face of weakening domestic demand.
European manufacturers propose price dumping for Chinese steel companies.
During this spring the situation has relaxed somewhat.
On the one hand, duties imposed on imports have an effect on imports, and on the other, the economic outlook in China has become more pronounced.
It is unclear how sustainable the price recovery is.
The German industry primpus Thyssenkrupp remained cautious on Thursday.
Last time the prices had stagnated.
The industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.
Thyssenkrupp did not want to exclude the closures of individual works.
In the German steel industry, around 86,000 people were employed at the end of 2015.
In July, despite rising prices and increasing orders, German steel producers remain cautious.
At 3.4 million tonnes, they produced over six percent less crude steel than in the previous month, as the Economic Association of Steel announced on Friday.
After a short increase in May, the produced quantity now declined the second month in a row.
Since the beginning of the year, production has fallen by two per cent below the previous year's value.
In the coming months, thanks to an improved order situation, the association expects an increase in emissions.
Community, spirit, health: singing does seniors good
The singing has already accompanied Ursel Kipp her whole life: As a young girl she was in school choir, in the teaching department she occupied the subject of music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a senior chor.
"Singing moves me - emotionally and physically," she describes.
After a test, she feels more balanced, happy and alive, she says.
By the way, she does something good to her health and mind.
Because Singen is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler of the Deutsche Seniorenliga.
Most seniors sing in the choir and share with like-minded people the joy of the music, says Hackler.
Through regular association, seniors can establish and maintain social contacts.
Because often social and family structures resolve at old age, then a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.
This experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir: "Speaking and organizing, being able to rely on and learn from the others - a choir is a very special form of being together".
Singing can be strenuous in the positive sense, says Hackler.
Because seniors train a deep and controlled breathing.
Anyone who regularly demands his lungs does not rush out of the breath so quickly even in everyday life.
Even if it is about maintaining the sound of the voice in old age, Singing is an optimal hobby.
Singing often has a very special effect on older people," says Ursula Lenz of the Federal Labour Community of the Senior Organizations.
In the older generations the joint singing had a much higher status, it was a daily part, both in school and in leisure time, she explains.
Lenz frequently observes that singing or listening to songs in older people arouses many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth.
Through lyrics and especially melodies, even people with dementia escape from long-standing events.
In singing, the head is also demanded a special performance, explains Lenz.
At the same time, focus on your own voice and on a given rhythm and adjust yourself to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.
Especially older people who live alone do so not just focus on themselves.
Another positive aspect is the recognition given by singing in the choir, says Hackler.
An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.
The self-esteem also grows through singing in the choir.
To show myself: If I practice for a long time, I will be better and grow beyond myself - this experience strengthens.
So good reasons to start singing are enough.
If you want to try out a new hobby, don't hesitate - even if he thinks he has little talent, Lenz guesss.
You don't sing alone - in 50 singing people, who hears when a sound goes next to it?
Looking for the right offer, seniors have different possibilities, says Hackler.
If someone from the circle of acquaintances sings in a senior choir, you can simply join them.
Many cities also offer overviews of the choirs in the surrounding area.
Anyone who wants to sing in an ecclesiastical choir can contact the church or the head of the church directly.
Many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet.
If you don't have access to the Internet, the family, friends or neighbors can ask for help in the Internet search.
Anyone who wants to sing should definitely join a choir, advises Hackler.
Singing does the soul well and has something liberating - that applies to every age.
Cats respond more sensitive than cats to the cries of the young
Biologists in Hanover have investigated the effect of calling cats babies on adult animals.
To her surprise, the Miauen also did not leave the males cold - but they were always the same in contrast to the females.
Female cats can see the excitement of cat babies at the mites of the little ones.
They react by ten percent faster to sounds of kittens who are in great need, such as scientists from the Veterinary University and the Medical University of Hanover (MHH).
Cats also respond to the calls of kittens - but always the same.
"The acoustic differences between the mites of less and more excited young animals are obvious for the males either undetectable or not significant," said biologist Wiebke Konerding of the MHH.
She is the first author of the study to be published this Friday in the "BMC Evolutionary Biology" magazine.
In a previous study, the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the kitten screams differed from the urgency of their need for help.
A total of nine adult cats and eight kittens from the MHH's animal husbandry were observed.
They were played for one call by little ones who were taken out of the throwbox for three minutes and separated from mother and siblings.
On the other hand, they were confronted with screaming by more excited kittens, which were additionally raised.
Despite the small sample, the researchers consider their results to be meaningful.
"All the females, even those who had not yet their own offspring, responded differently to the cries," Konerding said.
They turned to the loudspeaker more quickly when this cry of the very excited kittens was played.
This ability may have been inborn or developed with sexual maturity.
"A surprise was that the males have responded at all," said the biologist.
In the past, scientists have studied the reactions of women and men to baby noise several times in humans.
Also, some studies showed that women responded more sensitively to infants, regardless of whether they were mothers or not, the biologist Marina Scheumann reported.
Podolski goes with "Gala" to Supercup
Hakan Sükür is a football legend in Turkey.
In Turkey, an arrest warrant was issued against Hakan Sükür, a former football star.
He is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
An important football game will be held in Turkey for the first time after the coup attempt.
Before the duel of the archivals between Besiktas Istanbul and Lukas Podolskis Galatasaray Istanbul around the Supercup in Konya, the official line is clearly: "Business as usual" is announced.
Even when the state of emergency was being imposed after the July fall-out attempt, the government claimed that the everyday life of ordinary citizens should not be affected.
This does not apply, however, to those who are suspected of belonging to the movement of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, who are responsible for the coup attempt.
This is not done even before football.
The former Starkicker Hakan Sükür was arrested by the Prosecutor's Office.
Thus, the currently living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
Sukür is supposed to be a follower of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, who is held responsible by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for the coup attempt.
Although the state of emergency imposed for 90 days is still valid until October, this actually has virtually no effect on the lives of most Turks.
The nightly "democracy guards" on public squares throughout the country declared Erdogan to be finished on Wednesday.
The sport, like the whole country, is divided into followers and opponents of Erdogan.
Especially fans of the work club Besiktas are traditionally not friends of the president.
But what the big of the Turks agree with in the face of dramatic experiences in history is the strict rejection of military coups.
There even the fans agree - no matter whether their heart beats for Galatasaray or Besiktas.
With cup winner "Gala" it will be particularly back on Lukas Podolski.
In the end of the season, the Cologneer proved his sporting value: With 17 goals and nine templates in all competitions, the 31-year-old finished his first season as the top scorer of his club.
In the final game against Fenerbahce he scored the 1:0 victory match.
The newspaper "Fanatik" cheered him: "He was the best in the place."
He finished the season in an excellent way and secured his team the cup.
Thanks to "Poldi", the disappointing season for the record champion found a conciliatory conclusion.
After the pre-run K.o in the Champions League, the "Löwen" also shoot out early in the Europe League.
In the Süper Lig it was only six.
The season wasn't good.
The Cup was the only way to win something.
"We did this and that's the most important thing," Podolski said.
For Master Besiktas, the game year ran better.
Especially thanks to Mario Gomez, who founded the 14th title with 26 season hits as Süper-Lig-Torschützenkönig.
This is also the reason why the fans continue to hope for the return of the 31-year-old.
In doing so, the Gomez loaned to the AC Florence under contract and to Besikdas only announced after the attempt to avoid returning to the country due to the political situation following his EM holidays.
"If Mario wants to come to us, he just has to say it," said the specialist magazine "Kicker" Club Manager Fikret Orman.
For this, however, the storms would have to be prepared to give up about one third of their estimated annual salary of €7.5 million, Orman made it clear: "We can't pay his salary in Florence".
Despite Doping: These athletes still have medal chances at Olympia in Rio
The 34-year-old Justin Gatlin was already blocked twice for dopings (2001 and 2006).
Rio de Janeiro - Whistleblowerin Julia Stepanowa must not start in Rio.
Other transferred athletics singers can only laugh at it - they fight for medals in Rio.
The topic of doping continues to determine the headlines at the Rio Olympics.
The Russian swimmer Julija Jefimowa, who after a doping lock had sued her right of departure just before the games, was mercilessly impaled and bent out at her start (100 meters breast).
There was a scrupulous scene: With a smile set up, she was still stolled in the hall and had provoked her appearance.
When it was found that they were not going to get gold, the audience broke into a cheerstorm.
However, there are still many other athletes who, despite the doping past at the Rio Olympics, are taking off.
Here's an overview:
Justin Gatlin (100, 200, 4x100-m-Steffel/USA): The 34-year-old is one of the most controversial figures in athletics.
He had been blocked twice for dopings (2001 and 2006 to 2010).
Since his bann, the 2004 Olympic champion and ex-world champion run even faster than before, he is over 100 m in 9.80 seconds the number one in the world and is considered the biggest challenger of Usain Bolt.
Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce (100, 4x100-m-Staffel/Jamaika): The two-time Olympic champion and seven-time world champion had to remove a six-month lock in 2010 after demonstrating the use of Oxycodon.
She had severe dental pain after surgery, the 29-year-old defended herself.
Sandra Perkovic (Diskus/Croatia): In 2011, the Olympic champion of 2012, World Champion of 2013 and European Champion from 2010 to 2016 was tested positively on the forbidden stimulance medium methylhexanamin.
Perkovic contests the knowledgeable intake and was shut down for six months.
The four widest bets this year go to the account of the great gold favorites.
LaShawn Merritt (200, 400, 4x400-m-Staffel/USA): The Beijing Olympic champion and two-time world champion over 400 m, had been tested positively in 2010 and was blocked for 21 months.
A tool for penis enlargement had been responsible, claimed Merritt.
This year the 30-year-old is over 200 and 400 m the fastest man in the world to date.
Ivan Tichon (Hammerwurf, Belarus): Hardly a athlete was able to win so many medals afterwards.
Tichon lost his 2005 World Cup title nine years later after Testosterone doping was established.
The current 40-year-old also had to give Olympic Silver 2004 because of steroid-dopings and the 2006 EM title due to testosterone abuse.
He also received the bronze medal at the 2008 Olympics on the basis of a judgment of the International Sports Court CAS.
At 80.04 m he ranked two of the world's rankings.
Liu Hong (20 km Go, China): The World Recorder and Gold Favourite were only tested positively in May, but may still start in Rio.
The 29-year-old world champion found evidence of the use of a prohibited food supplement, the block of the World Anti-Doping Agency WADA dropped out mildly and ran off already on July 13th.
Bomb terror in Thailand - Austrian injured - Multiple deaths
The Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman, said the speaker of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Thomas Schnöll, Friday morning.
She had suffered cut wounds and had been treated in the hospital, but she had already been able to leave.
She planned her home trip for the beginning of September.
Whether the further explosions on the holiday island of Phuket as well as in the southern cities of Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon have affected Austrian citizens is still unclear.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities, according to Schnöll.
Located about 200 kilometres south of the capital city of Bangkok, Hua Hin was first exploded on Thursday evening in an outing district of two bombs.
According to the police, a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured, including the Austrian woman, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.
On Friday morning another two blasts went up, and according to the authorities another human being was killed.
A bomb explosion was also reported by Phuket in the early days.
A taxi driver was injured in the detonation near the beach Patong, popular with the holidaymakers.
In Surat Thani on the southeast coast of the country, another bomb exploded, killing an urban employee.
According to the authorities, the bomb has gone into the air in a flowerbed in front of the Coast Police Department.
Finally, detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the south-west coast as well as in Chumphon on the southeast coast called for several injuries.
One goes from a connection with the explosions in Hua Hin, it was called.
"The bomb attacks carry the same handwriting," said army general Danai Kritmethavee Friday morning before journalists.
"We assume this is a coordinated attack."
It is too early to comment on possible motives - probably, however, it is about the actions of Muslim rebels.
Thai media also wanted to recognize a pattern typical of the Muslim separatists bombing in the south of the country.
The Thai police, on the other hand, stated that the attacks were not related to the Islamist uprising movement or to international terrorism.
"This is only local sabotage, which is limited to limited areas and provinces," said a spokesman in Bangkok.
Rather, it is assumed that the bombs were laid by opponents of the ruling military junta.
In recent days, the authorities have received classified information on imminent attacks in the south of the country, but they have not been informed of the exact time and places.
I don't know which group was behind the attacks.
The police instructed their officials throughout the country to strengthen security around important government buildings, airports, railway stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts.
In Thailand there are always smaller bombings, but they usually do not target tourists.
In Hua Hin lies a palace that was used over years by Thailand's king Bhumibol Adulyadej.
Following the multi-bomb explosions, the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends, on its homepage, that the instructions of the Thai security authorities be followed.
High safety risk (Safety Level 3) applied to the provinces Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla as well as Preah Vihar and surroundings.
After conflicts between security forces and Muslim sections of the population, no necessary travel to these provinces is recommended.
Increased safety risks (Safety Level 2) apply to the rest of the country.
The attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drafted by the military junta.
This gives the military a great deal of influence in the coming years.
Junta Chief and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said that the bombs had been an attempt to cause chaos, while the country was moving towards stability, an improvement in the economic situation and tourism.
The militaryunta, who had taken power in 2014 after a period of bloody unrest, is of its own good as having brought the kingdom back to stability and order.
However, the military has not managed to deal with the revolt of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country for years.
More than 6,500 people have already been killed in the conflict.
Nearly a year ago, 20 people had also been killed in Bangkok in an attack on a popular Hindu scream - most of them foreign tourists.
It was the most bloody attack of the recent history of the country.
The right "Identitarian Movement" has entered the vision of the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection.
After several national offices, the constitutional guardians in the Federation have also placed the group under observation.
"We see clues in the 'Identitarian Movement' to efforts against the democratic principles of freedom," said Constitutional Protection Director Hans-Georg Maaßen of the German Press Agency in Berlin.
Thus, immigrants of Islamic faith or of the Middle East are defamed in an extremist way.
That's why we're watching the movement now.
The "Identitarian Movement" is a group of French roots that has been active in Germany since 2012.
It is opposed to "multicultural madness", "uncontrolled mass migration" and the "loss of one's own identity by alienation".
Constitutional Protectors in nine Länder - Bremen, Bavaria, Hessen, Berlin, Baden-Württemberg, NRW, Niedersachsen, Saxony and Thuringia - already observe the "Identitarians".
Maaßen said that his authority was in close agreement with the state offices in the decision.
"Groups like the 'Identitarian Movement' are trying to pick up their target group where it stands," said the Head of Constitutional Protection.
Generally, extremists try to talk to them with youthful language, often with poppy music.
They did Islamists as well as right-wing extremists.
This is not an important advertisement for one's own business.
The propaganda is supposed to appeal to the people emotionally.
Young people are especially vulnerable.
That's dangerous.
Finally, there had been reports from several federal states on contacts between "Identitarians" and AfD politicians.
Maßen said he had no knowledge of this.
For the protection of the Constitution, possible contacts of this kind would only be relevant from a certain point of view.
It is important whether the respective party - in this case the AfD - changes its objective by certain people who are extremist and becomes so extremist.
It is therefore crucial whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party.
This is not recognizable.
In view of the significant increase in legally motivated crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee accommodation, Maaßen said that he would not yet speak of new right terrorism in this context.
But we have noted in recent years that there can be legal terrorism structures.
There was the group 'Old School Society' or the Freitaler Group.
It may well be that other right-wing terrorist groups or microgroups are planning attacks against asylum seekers, refugee homes or attacks from other extremist motives.
However, legal terrorism cannot be controlled across Germany or across Europe.
The previous groups were created at regional level or on social networks.
Concerned, Maassen stated that many abuses went to the account of people who had previously not appeared in the right scene.
This is the worrying thing.
Many of the suspects in attacks on asylum accommodation had not previously been known as criminal, politically motivated criminals or supporters of the right scene.
"Many people have committed crimes that previously had nothing to do with right-wing extremists, who may have been politically different or, for example, have opted for CDU, SPD or left, but who then radicalized themselves through the right-wing extremist mood."
Rio 2016: Robel Kiros Habte becomes internet hot
Not always do the Olympics or world records determine the headlines at the Olympics.
This shows the courageous appearance of Robel Kiros Habte at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro.
In the Aquatics Center, the slightly overweight swimmer from Ethiopia swam so slowly that he was temporarily no longer visible in the TV images.
He simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut-out was selected.
In the social networks, Habte became a viral Internet hit.
In fact, the 24-year-old finished his lead with 48 seconds and finished 59th place of 59 runners.
But it was rather his not exactly sporting figure that attracted the attention of the international media.
Why is the 24-year-old still taking part in the Olympics?
The Ethiopian got a special start right from the international swimming club.
This is distributed to make swimming in underrepresented countries more known.
Since most athletes run in Ethiopia, Habte just wanted to do something different.
Preparation is everything: Robles Kiros Habte is ready for the big race.
Soon the first nicknames made the round.
Some media called him "Robel of the Whale".
The English boulevard magazine "The Sun" made fun of him with "Dad Bod".
His time, he only struck with one minute and nearly five seconds over the 100 meters freestyle, played no role.
Comparisons with "Eric the Eel" were also made.
At the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, the race of Eric Moussambani attracted media attention.
The appearance of the swimmer from Equatorial Guinea was unforgettable when he had to perform alone in a lead course of more than 100 metres freestyle.
At that time Moussambani was fired in French.
The 22-year-old at the time learned to swim eight months before Olympia and had never completed such a long distance before the competition.

Geretsried - The owner of a store at the New Square has been stolen.
According to the police, 67-year-old Geretsrieder had left her business on Monday at 5:30 p.m. and forgot to close a window on the ground floor.
When they arrived the next morning at 8:15 p.m., they had disappeared from the cash register around 250 euros.
Traces of the perpetrator could not be found.
There is also no video surveillance.
Trump sees the threatening election defeat not so narrow
The Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at an election campaign event in Florida.
Should there be no choice for the U.S. president, Donald Trump already has an alternative idea.
He's going on vacation.
Donald Trump loses the U.S. presidential elections in November, it doesn't matter to him: "Recently it will either work, or I have a very, very nice, long holiday," said the candidate of Republicans in a telephone interview with the US television station CNBC.
If it was not enough for him at the end for reasons of political correctness, it was all right, Trump said.
Thus he called the US President Barack Obama and the candidate of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton, the founder of the terrorist militia Islamic State (IS).
Within his party there was more and more resistance.
Post enters the trade of electric transporters
An electric delivery vehicle of the German Post in action.
The interest of other companies in the company seems to be great.
The post office is planning to sell their electric vehicle StreetScooter.
The Group will soon start trading with the transporter.
The post will also offer its electric transporters on the free car market as of next year.
"We want to get into the sale to third parties," said a post speaker on Friday.
The company has been testing for months whether to sell its own developed StreetScooter, with which letters and packages are delivered, also to other companies.
Post-Chairman Jürgen Gerdes had said that there were always demands, such as from craftsmen.
According to information from the news magazine "Der Spiegel", the Bonn Group is about to enter the mass production of the vehicles.
The company plans to build up up to 10,000 cars per year and shift in its own production.
Gerdes had announced that the Group wanted to expand its fleet of electric cars significantly and in the long term it was looking forward to a complete transition to environmentally friendly vehicles.
"We will take a very, very robust step towards 2020," he said at the end of July.
I can imagine changing the whole fleet.
The StreetScooter has been active on Germany's streets since 2014.
GfK management resigns after disappointing business figures
The consumer research company GfK is replacing its head Matthias Hartmann.
The resignations came suddenly - but not quite surprising.
The difficult situation of the market research company GfK suggested that the chair of CEO Matthias Hartmann will be all the more uncertain, the longer his promised achievements will remain.
Turbulence at the top of the Nürnberg market research company GfK: After once again disappointing business figures and the withdrawal of corporate governance, the world number five of the industry is ahead of a new staff start.
GfK CEO wants to leave the company at the end of the year.
With effect from 12 September, the Chairman of the Supervisory Board Arno Mahlert is already resigning from the Supervisory Board.
As of 1 September, the Management Board member Gerhard Hausruckinger informed the company.
He should officially assume the function of a "Chairman" until a successor for Hartmann is found.
As a reason for the resignation, the company called "different views" a long-term policy orientation.
Details didn't want to call a corporate speaker on Friday.
Who will be the leader of the market research company in the future is still unclear.
In investor circles it was said on Friday that the shareholders were most recently disappointed by the continued success of the restructuring initiated years ago.
Mr. Hartmann has been at the GfK Peak since 2011.
"But the fruits of the restructuring are still not to be seen after 5 years," it said.
In view of the last bad GfK business figures, each shareholder would be worried at some point.
"If this were the case with BMW, it would also make the quints so," it said.
The company had not been able to stop its loss drive even in the second quarter of 2016 after setbacks in the previous quarters.
At EUR 361.2 million, turnover was 6.1 per cent below the level of the comparable quarter of the previous year.
Compared to the first half of the year, sales decreased by 3.4 percent from 721.2 million euros.
Profits in the second quarter have been particularly negative in view of the difficult economic situation of the company.
The company value depreciation of 139 million euros, which became necessary in the Consumer Experience division, resulted in a loss of 148.2 million euros to the group under the line.
In the second quarter of 2015, the GfK had generated a consolidated profit of 19.7 million.
Accidents - Bus slides in krummhörn in graves: Eight injured
In the event of an accident involving 43 seniors as passengers, eight people were injured on Thursday in Krummhörn (Landkreis Aurich).
Two of the inmates suffered serious injuries, the police reported.
The 66-year-old driver on the bus of a travel company from Eisenach had to avoid an accompanied truck that was partly on the anti-road.
The bus came to the right from the street and slipped into a grave, as a police spokesperson Aurich/Wittmund reported.
"Because of the location of the bus, people could not leave the bus on their own," she said.
The fire brigade freed the inmates.
Six rescue cars and an emergency car came to the accident location on Landesstraße 2.
The uninjured travellers were taken from a bus back to the Krummhörner district of Pewsum.
There they should wait for a replacement bus from the travel company.
The investigators asked the trucker and possible witnesses to report to the police.
The fees per cubic metre of waste water are from 1 October 2016 for the area of the wastewater treatment plant Neudorf/Reuth/Welschenkahl 3,44 instead of 2,10 Euro; for Zultenberg/Lindenberg/Lop 3,36 Euro (up to 2,26 Euro) and for Azendorf 3,64 Euro (up to 2,18 Euro).
At the plant in Azendorf, the waste water charge will be increased at the latest if appropriate improvement measures are needed.
After an overcrowded calculation, the waste water price in Azendorf will then be at EUR 4.37 per cubic metre.
As Mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, during the approval of the household by the Landratamt Kulmbach, it was found that for these wastewater treatment plants undercovers surface.
The Kasendorf market was obliged, on the basis of legal bases, to operate the facilities in a cost-effective manner.
From 1 October 2016, the citizens as well as the commercial and industrial companies from Welschenkahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to take a deeper look at the money bags.
The increase in fees is between 48 and 67 percent.
As Managing Director Herbert Schmidt pointed out to the Board, a recalculation of fees was necessary for the wastewater treatment facilities of the market community.
In the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over- and under-covers from the previous calculation period would also have been compensated.
The serious increase in fees caused Schmidt to find that all three wastewater treatment plants are relatively small facilities with a very small wastewater attack, between 6800 and 12000 cubic metres per year.
Thus, due to the low distribution base, for example, expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious effect.
In addition, the waste water generation in all three plants was slightly declining.
Furthermore, in the remaining calculation period for all three plants, not least due to their age, recovery and repair costs had been significantly incurred.
The plant in Azendorf was almost 30 years old, the plants for Welschenkahl, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp almost 20 years old.
Schmidt pointed out that in the waste water plant Azendorf the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to damage.
At the Welschenkahl pumping plant, the nearly 20-year-old conveyor systems had to be overtaken from the ground to the ground and the Lopp pond had to be excavated after nearly 20 years of operation, the sewage sludge was disposed of and an additional ventilation facility was installed to meet the water requirements in the future.
Schmidt: "These extraordinary expenses were borne by the continued care and maintenance costs, which must be taken into account accordingly in the new calculation period."
The same applies to electricity costs, which were significantly below the current level when the previous calculation was made in 2011/2012.
Stone houses made it clear that in the three plants, in the case of the low wastewater, the costs for the operation and maintenance "are fully permeable".
In addition to Schmidt, the market community had been spared from major entertainment costs at wastewater treatment plants over the past 20 years.
In the view of Steinhäuser, the situation for these plants will continue to be precarious in the long term, especially since the area of supply of the Friesenbachtal sewerage plant could not be extended because of the lack of facilities.
Bulgaria booked for the first time in 8 months inflation
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1% on a monthly basis in July.
This is the highest value (since June 2012) and the first over zero since October last year, when positive 0.2% were booked.
The average annual inflation rate over the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was -0.8% according to the CPI.
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101.0 %, i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0 %.
Inflation since the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) was -0.2% and annual inflation in July 2016 was -0.2%.
In July 2016, a price increase was observed in the following groups of consumer goods: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%); transport (1.8%); leisure and culture (6.3%); restaurants and hotels (1.2%); various goods and services (0.3%).
Prices were lower in clothing and shoes (2.2%); furniture, household appliances and routine expectations (0.5%); health (0.1%).
As in the previous month, prices remained for alcoholic beverages and tobacco; apartments, water, electricity, gas and other fuels; communication; and education remained unchanged.
Snapchat "anime" effect criticized as Asian caricature
Snapchat says that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it is insensitive to race.
With its filter tool, Snapchat enables around 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in such a way that is already limited to absurdity.
You can turn into an pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Lichtenstein painting.
The filters are unblemished, properties distorting tools that produce more than 30 million improved selfies per day.
All missteps come to the public.
Snapchat filters have been criticised in the past in which they were accused that the app Blackface would promote or promote white skin as a beauty ideal.
When some users proposed a filter that gave them slit eyes, false teeth and bloated cheeks this week, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asians - "Yellow face".
They wondered whether these repeated controversys pointed to a major problem that the company has diversity.
The news and indignation were widespread on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, one day after Snapchat informed that it had disabled the feature.
The company apologized: The filter was intended as tribute to anime characters and not as a caricature of Asians.
But outsiders who have experienced racism reminded the filter of hurting clichés.
Others rejected the Anime comparison.
In an e-mail, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student, whose tweet was widely spread over the photos, wrote that the filter "was inconvenient to say the least."
She added that "it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very disgusting Asian caricature and the filter effects.
It shows that the filter is not yellow-faced, but that the yellow face has been drawn to the depreciating extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural ostrich wire.
American culture seems to be involved in an endless struggle for diversity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in our hands.
And Snapchat's large audience of young people - who are in the race of different people than their older counterparts - could rather expect sensitivity.
If one of Snapchat's filters creates an image that is offensive to a user, "it is much more difficult that such things remain unnoticed than they were before," said 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.
On Thursday, Zhu, who works as a product manager and engineer for medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account, and asked others to do the same.
In an essay for medium and in a phone interview she said that she believes that race-related controversy reflects a lack of diversity in the recruitment practices at Snapchat.
Zhu criticised the much white, only male leadership and ended her essay with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
"They neither have a different representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce, so that they can make such decisions," said Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colors who work there, but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say something about it."
Others share their opinion, a complaint that has largely left Snapchat unanswered.
The company does not publish any figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the cultural backgrounds of his employees, but according to one speaker, the company has recently employed a staff manager who focuses on underrepresented populations and on internal integration efforts.
Zhu said that she will close her Snapchat account and added, "I wonder if they need more users like us to say that this is not OK."
Military leadership falsifies ISIS intelligence information, states Congress Committee
Military members of the United States Central Command changed intelligence information to draw a more optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic state in Iraq and Syria when it allowed the actual conditions on the ground, a Congress Committee reported in a report on Thursday.
The preliminary report, prepared by a Task Force of the Republican members of the Armed Forces Committee, the Secret Service Committee and the Military Budget Committee, reports of great dissatisfaction among Central Command intelligence analysts who reported how superiors changed their estimates of American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State.
The Central Command, briefly Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"Nachrichtendienstlicher Information, which was typically cut off by high-ranking Centcom commanders, regularly drew a more positive picture of American efforts against terrorism than it would have allowed the actual conditions on the ground and were more consistently positive than analyses of other intelligence services," said one newspaper article in the report.
"What happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," said Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives.
The leadership errors in Centcom reach the top of the organization.
The ten-page report presents detailed and consistent problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of the American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces.
Although there is no direct indication that government leaders under Obama have given instructions to change the reports, it shows how analysts were subjected to pressure from their precepts to draw a more optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic state, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
"During the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and statements before Congress were significantly more positive than they are in keeping with the facts," the report stated.
For example, a Centcom member publicly announced that a Mossul military retreat could begin in April or May 2015.
Mossul, second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"After months of investigation, so much is clear." said Mike Pompeo, Republican congressman from Kansas, in a statement.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the Central Command's tops changed intelligence reports to reduce the risk posed by ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans called the Task Force into life after they were played out that analysts were concerned about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State.
The report published on Thursday will be completed with more detailed findings during the investigations.
In addition, further investigations of the Centcom reports are under way by the Secretary General of the Ministry of Defence.
Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday, which coincided with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.
"In the years 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an excessively restricted process for the preparation of intelligence assessments on ISIL and the Iraqi security services," announced the highest-ranking democracy in the Committee, member of the Adam B. Schiff representative house, in an opinion.
This process, says Mr. Schiff, "has delayed the publication of intelligence reports," damaged morals among analysts and "has given excessive room for diverging opinions."
But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats indicated that they had not found any evidence of a White House intervention with the Centcom analysts regarding a "certain political opinion".
The preliminary results of the Congress investigations were published on Tuesday by "The Daily Beast".
Last August, the New York Times reported on investigations by the Pentagon's general inspector, who was admitted after complaints by Centcom analysts.
Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon press spokesman, stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on congress reports while the investigations of the inspector general were still under way.
But he also stated that "experts sometimes have quite diverging opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defence welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence."
The investigations have repercussions on the question of a successful air campaign under the leadership of the United States in Iraq and Syria (a claim made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence).
However, the allegations of last year raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest judgements of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.
The criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State reminds of the difficulties of more than ten years ago, when a Centcom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a document on how the then government under George W. Bush, in contrast to the recommendations of many analysts, provided only a small crew in Iraq and spent little time thinking about the consequences of the 2003 invasion.
Mr. Hooker also played a key role in rebelling against the current reporting on the Islamic State.
Last year, the team of Mr. Hooker, according to government agencies, notes that, contrary to the government's statements, air strikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State would have no significant impact on the terrorist group's financial situation, as these provisional refineries would have put into operation to sell oil on the black market.
However, this finding was not published, the Times reported in September.
Centcom's then commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the legislature for his excessively positive opinion of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel at the Central Command.
The U.S. wins fourth match in the women's field hockey, a showdown with the UK is ahead
One day after she had shot three goals during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two goals for the American field hockey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3-0.
Five goals in two games should actually be a memorable performance, but Bam (27) said they couldn't remember ever doing that.
"I have no idea." she said.
I'm not one of the people who keep their gates in mind.
However, she knows this: The Americans are at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are equally in their group with the British in the first place, who remain unbeaten after their 2–0 victory against Japan.
The UK and the United States will meet on Saturday at the last game of the first round.
Both teams have already qualified for the quarter-final, the game will decide which of the two will gain the first and second place within their group from six teams each.
The first place will take the strong Dutch women a little longer out of the way leading the other group.
Whatever the game may turn out on Saturday, the Americans have caused a surprising twist due to their success story, four years after they landed at the last London Games on the last of 12 seats.
Bam was part of this team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had a hockey bat in her hands for the first time at three years (their two older sisters played the sport at Drexel University), at 16 years she became a U.S. national player, the youngest in the team's history.
She missed the Olympics in 2008, because she could not qualify for the cadre.
Then came the year 2012, where everything went wrong for her and her team.
In the following year, Craig Parnham, an Englishman, became a coach of the national team and thus began to turn things around better.
"A cultural change, a mental change and a physical change," said Bam.
We didn't have the work syllabus in London that we have now.
We've been able to pull the rudder completely.
On Thursday evening Bam opened the Torreigen in the first half of the game with a handshake from the nearby area.
India had gone into the game without victory in the tournament, but the team turned out to be surprisingly tough and held the score from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into her hands.
She performed a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved into the middle and slipped the ball into the gate to give the Americans a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter.
The Shutout was the first of the entire tournament for the US goalkeeper, Jackie Briggs, who had to book one goal in each of the previous games.
She's got a run.
Just like Bam.
"We are in a good position" said Parnham, but how well will depend on the result of the next game on Saturday.
Amidst the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the Trampoline
Wherever you are, however late it is, it is the Olympic Games.
The events in Rio de Janeiro are constantly and inescapably felt, a raging season between competition and pursuit.
It's as if the Olympic torch itself was a burning staff, which is handed from the arm chestguard to the swimmer to the gymnast to the triathlete.
You can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor in the queue in the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Blies, Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, who is at the Olympics for the first time and a female black with dimples, could have been among these well-known names sent to Prime Time, built up by sponsors and well-being TV advertising, if he were a swimmer, a gymnast or even a fencing.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for gold in the Olympics.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event the same.
Further from the center, partly in the shade, there are the sports that are not generally recognized: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
We'll always have the breasts swimming and can rule it for a long time.
But if I should modestly make arguments for my particular lover, then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.
Although the jumping of the trampoline has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, it has been so perceptive over the past 16 years that many of them, I had questioned, did not know that it was an Olympic sport at all.
This could also be regional ignorance.
Although the USA sent athletes to the competition, it has never won a medal in trampoline jumping and by 2012 had an athlete who made it to the final round.
The Chinese and Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians who for the women.
Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.
The trampoline jumping has a certain external charm, partly because it sounds more suitable for the unexplained ear for a clown school than for the Olympic Games.
At this point, I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a ground-bound enthusiast.
It has humorous potential - the cartoony trembling of its never to end the impact - but also the grace of the tournament and diving, which combines two sports which essentially it.
The word "Trampoline" comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, which means as much as "Splashboard."
Achieving victories jump on a giant trampoline, shoot almost 30 feet into the air and need a series of falling movements (pures, hedges and salttos) before they land on their feet.
They are assessed according to the official Olympic program according to their performance, difficulty and "flight time".
Twenty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women will compete against each other in Rio.
The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.
Medaillenhoffende must continue in their quest for gold, faster, upwards and beyond, sometimes to the destination, sometimes back and forth, up and down on the playground.
They hunt not only the target line or the starting wall, but in television transmission also another chicken destination: the world's or the Olympic record.
The goal-oriented pursuit is noble, admirable, even fanatical - and it is enough to even stir a audience to tears.
But it's also what I feel myself when watching these games as something tiring.
The trampoline offers a breather.
The vector of the trampoline jumper is above.
A forward movement is not the goal.
He or she blows off, apparently unhesitating like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly up again.
Here too there is a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity.
It's as Zen as the competition at the Olympics can only be.
The women's qualification and final rounds will take place on Friday afternoon, during streaming around 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00.
NBC will broadcast the final rounds as part of an afternoon block on both days starting at 14.00.
In the middle of the Olympic Mania they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is probably overlooked in general Tumult.
If the raising of awareness can only be achieved through the provocation and objectification of male athletes - as the male U.S. towers suggested in the The Wall Street Journal recently - then Mr. Dooley expects his new catch community to be ringing for air.
"A generation protested" in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the United States
Violent Protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrators calling for political change in Ethiopia encountered violent opposition from the government.
Witnesses say that tens of protesters were killed during the clashes with the police during shooting.
Is Ethiopia breaking up right now?
Over the last ten years it has been one of Africa's most stable countries, a solid ally of the West with a fast growing economy.
But in recent months, protests against the government have shaken the country and spread in more and more areas.
Last week thousands of people stormed the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.
According to human rights organisations, the government's response was unmerciful.
Witnesses reported that police shot and killed dozens of unarmed demonstrators.
There are videos in circulation about the protests that are probably from last year or early this year, showing how security people beat young people with sticks, while they were forced to make a handstand against a wall.
The head of the UN Human Rights Authority is now calling for an in-depth investigation.
"It has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, project manager of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group.
Ethiopia, according to Nigeria, is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is appreciated by the West.
American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terrorist threats beyond the region, especially in Somalia. Only a few countries in Africa, if at all, receive so much Western aid.
Ethiopia's economy expanded at a considerable pace.
His infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa.
The streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
Although Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continually led the repression by the government - opposition in the country has been restricted, with dissidents effectively silenced.
Many were sent to exile or prison, killed or driven to the far desert.
But that could change.
"If you suppress people and these have no other options except to protest, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopia.
The whole youth protests.
A generation protests.
There are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to wickering in terms of power of the ruling coalition.
After a widely criticised election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now controls 100 percent of Parliament.
At the same time, tensions rise along the border with Eritrea; a struggle for this delicate, controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatists such as the Oromo Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogade, who have been defeated more or less in recent years, could exploit and rearm turbulence.
Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness are now exploding under the surface after years of subsoiling.
The first one seems harmless: smartphones.
Only in recent years have many Ethiopians been able to communicate through social media, as cheaper smartphones have become more and more frequent and Internet services have improved.
Even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, which they do at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people can still communicate via Internet proxies that hide where they stop.
Several young Ethiopians reported that they gathered in such a way as to protest.
The second factor is that there is more solidarity between Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.
Since eons, the Amharas, who come from Ethiopia's predominantly Christian highlands, have been working in politics and economy, while exploiting the Oromos, many of whom are Muslims and live in flatlands.
But that, too, is changing.
"We are coordinating under a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of Oromos.
The biggest protests took place in areas of the Amhara and Oromos.
Many Amharas and Oromos feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tigray, who make up about 6% of the population and who are dominant in the military, in secret services, in trade and politics.
The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was the prime minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until his death on an unpublished disease in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could think about corners.
Analysts say that he was particularly excited to perceive early signs of dissatisfaction and to use special agents to process opponents and make them harmless.
"The present regime lacks this basic skill," said Abdi, a conflict analyst.
Ethiopia's new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was selected for relatively opaque reasons to take Mr Meles's position.
Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemiariam comes from the south.
Analysts say that he does not enjoy the trust of the security services controlled by the Tigray.
Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such an uproar in 2005, after thousands protested against elections, which, according to analysts, seemed to have been neglected by the government and subsequently stolen.
During the subsequent raids, many protesters were killed, even though it was less than in the last months and this period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts praised Ethiopia's leader for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, and for their measurable progress in combating poverty.
But obviously this did not prevent the intensification of the internal displeasure of the Ethiopian government.
And she takes a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month protesters in Gondar, an amharic city, attacked businesses run by Tigray and hatred of the Tigray is becoming increasingly common in social media.
Analysts say that the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position.
The U.S. government used Ethiopia as a basis for drone flights over neighboring Somalia, although it recently announced that it has concluded this base.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volatile area.
"This," said Mr. Abdi, "is a very thin walk of gratification."
Donald Trump declared his claim Obama had ISIS founded was "Sarkasmus"
Donald J. Trump tried on Friday to disperse the last controversy surrounding his campaign by stating that his repeated allegation, President Obama and Hillary Clinton, would not have been the "founders" of the Islamic State Terror Group.
This clarification raised new questions about the communication capabilities of the Republican presidential candidate, whether he was able to communicate with the American public clearly and intelligibly.
It also brings his associates who are trying to protect him during an eventful phase to the peculiar position of having to explain statements that he could not have meant at all.
After he had made the point at an election campaign on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump returned with regard to the claim on Thursday and insisted in interviews that he really did not intend to suggest that the President and Mrs Clinton had created ISIS.
But in an early morning tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was just sarcastic.
The tweet was the contrast to the previous day when Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews that he meant the accusation completely serious.
When conservative radio moderator Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr. Trump weaken the statement somewhat by reminding him that Mr. Obama ISIS wants to destroy, the Republican presidential candidate wanted nothing of it.
The last storm of criticism hails Mr. Trump as he tried to direct the focus of his campaign to the economic situation because of falling survey values.
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton held speeches on the economic situation in Michigan this week.
On Friday Mr. Trump tried to return to this topic again.
He warned himself about Twitter that Mrs Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he had found her speech boring.
Mr. Trump has already brought Sarkasmus to his defense.
At the end of July he drew strong criticism when he said that the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but later he said, "Of course I meant that sarcastic."
This method allows Mr Trump to move the linguistic boundaries of politics and then to row back as needed.
"I think it is one of his methods to test how certain messages are received by his fans, how they arrive, and then, if necessary, to "explain" depending on how the reaction turns out." said Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who watches the language of both candidates.
But I also think he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.
Instead of deflecting the tone for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump has adopted an even more corrosive tone, as his survey values have continued to decline.
A new survey by NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist, published on Friday, showed a guided tour of the states of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-on race in Florida.
While Mr. Trump generally tries not to apologize for his provocative statements, he often accuses his critics of distorting his statements or misunderstand his humor.
But while he is in the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump's joke has brought his loyal associates into the uncomfortable situation of having to stand up to him, no matter how provocative his statements may be.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trump's most prominent advocates, made great efforts today to defend the candidate in a Thursday's CNN interview.
"I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments," said Mr. Giuliani, asking about the accuracy of Mr. Trump's statements as to whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State.
It is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown little organization, he called it hindquarters, completely wrong and that is why it happened because he withdrew the troops from Iraq.
Most mainstream Republicans try to argue that under Obama, where Mrs Clinton served as Foreign Minister, the government allowed ISIS to expand by avoiding aggressive control of the situation in the Middle East.
Before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of riding around on each of his words and being biased against him.
He mocked the "poor, miserable" television experts who tried to understand him and said, "You can't do it!".
Some of the Democrats scoffed at Mr. Trump's apology as just another proof that he was unsuitable for the presidential office.
Once the price is pushed away from the market, Café comes back in Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a shaky café in Williamsburg, where you could only pay cash that didn't have a Wi-Fi, but served good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, prices were pushed out of its Bedford Avenue Ladenfront.
The Soap Cherie business, which replaced the verb in the summer of 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.
Locals entrusted it as the last loss in a gyrifying city.
The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know New York is a change, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel is excluded and verb is now a soap shop."
But if there's a change in New York, it's a new invention.
A revitalized verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same employees and a similar simple atmosphere.
The coffee is still good.
The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the old café, who is the owner and managing director of the new café.
He started working at Verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end.
When a client offered him money for a new outpost, he was excited to do it, he said.
Rodriguez, 36, contributed a lot.
Verb uses the same distributor for the bagels bought the same espresso machine model.
It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.
But Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment.
He introduced new ingredients.
There are sandwiches with bacon and cheese on the menu and there are yarns such as capers and sautéed onions.
There are nature travel bowls.
The café no longer serves beer, there are fresh juices for it.
After nine months Rodriguez said he noticed a steady stream of old regular customers.
"Many old customers were also displaced by prices from Williamsburg," he said.
Recently on a Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer.
Oliveira, 34, lived earlier in Williamsburg and visited the verb regularly.
Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she'd take her way.
After the verb had closed, she gave up the coffee for a while, she said.
"I realized that I liked coffee and culture," she said.
Now she drinks coffee again, even if on that day she ordered a Blended Chai Tea instead of her usual Iced Coffees, which is another new addition.
Tom Rosenthal has been another long-standing and loyal customer since the beginning of the verb in 2003.
He went there before work and inevitably always ordered the same thing.
"I came quarter after seven, every day, like a Swiss pocket watch and they're preparing my Everything-Bagel with butter," he said.
Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and include new ingredients in the menu.
Today, Rosenthal still receives his usual order, but sometimes he changes his Everything-Bagel with bacon, egg and cheese.
Rodriguez said that he had no idea that the soap business had taken over the old business.
In fact, the owners of Soap Cherie offered to make a special soap for verb with the cold-brown coffee of the café as an ingredient.
"I think we're still going to go into her offer," said Rodriguez.
And the traditional Polish inhabitants of Greenpoint also accepted the café.
A new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodriguez said that he plans to exhibit it soon so that his new neighbors feel welcome.
The site also has further advantages.
A local juice room would like to fill and sell the cold-brown coffee in the bottle.
There is a chance that the café will expand to a neighboring building.
For many customers a new verb is enough to get their old favorites.
Joseph Witt was a regular student and said that he was destroyed on the ground when the café closed.
When the new café opened, Whitt said that entering the room and ordering a new coffee felt like a return home.
"I had to smell that," he said.
The depressing food of the economic crisis in "a plentiful meal"
In March 1933, shortly after his accession to the president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch at the Oval Office.
As a fine taster, President Roosevelt had a failure for refined delicacies on Fifth Avenue such as Pâte de foie gras and Maryland water turtle soup.
His menu on this day was a bit more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, potato purée and a plum pudding as dessert.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband added Andrew Coe, "It was also a message to the Americans as they should eat."
The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.
Coes last book "Chop Suey" was about Chinese cuisine in the USA, while Ziegelman in her book "97 Orchard" tells about living in a residential building on the Lower East Side from the food perspective.
Her latest collaboration, "A decent meal", which will appear in the Harper publishing house on Tuesday, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.
They showed culinary solidarity when they met with a reporter at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small, snorkelless snack in the Flatiron District, which has been in business since the Stock Exchange crash in 1929.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces, while coe, 57, turkey with potatoes and vegetable blend ate.
When the reporter ordered hackbread, this couple found it appropriate to discuss the food in the Great Depression era.
"Retained food was very popular," said Ziegelman.
There was peanut bread, liver cheese and beans.
They were prepared from an ingredient and something cheap that stretches the ingredient.
Imagine eating so many peanuts that they serve as dinner.
Coe laughed.
"It must have put itself in the stomach like lead," he said.
In the years before the Great Depression, the table was in an American household, especially in rural areas, an all-you-can-eat buffet.
Teams of women cooked for male field workers and freshly baked pastés were served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to hungry Europeans during the first world war. "A Square Meal" records the ways with which the land was surrounded to be no longer the land of slippers.
"It was a time when food for Americans became a central, tense topic," Coe welcomed why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
The new budget diet was just as tense: mysterious food such as bread and cashrolls became a staple food, the cashroll was "wonderful way to recycle food residues," noted brickman, as chefs could hide inescapable ingredients under a creamy sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
Meat, which was the center of American cuisine for years, became a rarely served luxury.
Unique mixtures were tried out, as a high-calorie and nutritious satisfaction prevailed over taste or even healthy cuisine.
During her research for the book, which includes recipes, brickman prepared a dish from this era, baked onions with peanut butter.
"There was no popular addition to lunch," said Coe.
Ziegelmann continues: "It was surreal."
Peanut butter and baked onions do not match each other.
It was typical of many of the household economic recipes.
As never before or ever since, budget economists - including Louise Stanley, director of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - promoted the country's eating habits in this way.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "housewives" and the challenge of turning pamps like creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals to be true.
"A Square Meal" is a festival of historical treats.
In particular, the reports on the government's response to the starving citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's Lass-mich-kuchen-essen-Haltung, are tasty.
While publicly praising the simple Iowa farmhouse kitchens of his kitchen, he fed like the millions of heavy men of the world to whom he has become.
"He liked continental cuisine like fish with cucumber sauce," said Coe.
He ate in an almost gilded dining room and wore a tuxedo.
He was a wonderful stranger to reality.
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had not asked him to set an example with his stomach.
As described in the book, housing a housekeeper with no interest in tastes by Mrs. Roosevelt led the White House to produce the most boring food in Washington, but also one of the most consolingly prepared."
Many of the species from the era of Great Depression to deal with food were discarded as soon as the country got back on its feet.
The legacy lies on our continued focus on calories and food, said Ziegelman, as well as on how science was applied to food.
When writing the book, the couple indicated that they understood the eating habits of Ziegelman’s mother - in - law better — for example, how they could not throw food away.
"She had a real fear of wasting food," said Coe.
Ziegelman remembered: "She actually made people sick."
There was the windbag incident.
After the plates had been cleared off at Eisenberg's, they and Coe produced a dessert that they had prepared at home: the plum dessert, the President Roosevelt ate at noon.
"It is called Prune Whip," said brickman and added that it was a common trick to miss modest recipes a chic name.
There was no beaten cream, only plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone reluctantly plunged a spoon into the tough, brown glibber.
Surprisingly, it didn't taste bad.
Coe got a review three times.
Like a can-do pet, he said to his wife, "Some hacked walnuts would help."
Killed by bombing: He was the hero of Aleppo
He put his own life on the line to help others: Khaled Omar.
He was the hero of Aleppo: Khaled Omar dedicated his life to the people of Syria.
He risked everything to save the lives of others.
Now the 30-year-old himself died in a barrel bombing of the Assad regime.
Omar was a member of the "White Helmets", a civil protection group that, according to picture newspaper, so far saved almost 60,000 lives.
2900 volunteers put their own lives at risk to pull people out of bombed houses and to provide first aid in the war zone.
They are the heroes of the war in Syria.
Omar was the face of the group: A video of the civilian protector who showed him in an 11-hour rescue of a infant from the ruins of a house, went around the world in 2014.
It made the Syrian a shining symbol in the horror of war.
But as a hero, he never saw himself, so imagery said, "For me, this is the real jihad."
"When I die saving lives, I think God sees a martyr in me."
Shortly before Omar himself fell victim to an attack, he had spoken in a video about the last bombings in Syria.
The helicopters dropped four barrel bombs over the Alzadia district, one filled with chlorine gas.
One woman and two children died, seven people suffer from shortness of breath.
"We now eliminate the toxic remains of the bomb so that children don't play with it," the picture quotes his last words before he died.
The Assad regime's deadly bomb was supposed to have hit terrorists.
Greenland shark: The oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old
Rare sight.
Greenland sharks usually only come to the surface in winter.
This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the research ship Sanna.
He was born in 1624 and swims with a good 1 km/h through the North Atlantic to this day.
Greenland sharks only grow at 150 years of age.
The Greenland shark usually swims along the bottom of the North Atlantic, an average of 1,220 meters away in an hour.
Only when it comes to it, the five-meter-long animal accelerates to deep 2.6 km/h - and at this maximum speed is half as fast as a seal.
However, this lifestyle of slowness seems to be a patent recipe for a high age.
Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal "Science" at least of a Greenland shark that could be 392 years old.
"Insanity", Alexander Scheuerlein of the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock commented on this life span, which means a world record for vertebrates.
Although the evolutionary biologist has long suspected that Greenland sharks are being stoned.
Only the evidence was missing.
Greenland sharks are difficult to observe, after all they live mainly in the Eisma in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitzbergen.
Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they appear on the surface usually only in winter.
Researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland sharks.
They measured their pace of time when they equipped six animals with a transmitter in front of the peaks.
However, prey do this shark: In the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear.
They may hunt sleeping animals or patrol at the bottom of the ice cream and search for cadavers drying from higher layers of water down.
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues have now investigated 28 Greenland sharks, which had taken fishermen from the depths of the North Atlantic in front of Greenland or Spitzbergen between 2010 and 2013.
The smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the largest size was 502 centimeters.
To determine the age of the animals, they analysed the lens nucleus of the shark using the carbon-14 method.
This centre of the eye lens is created before the birth of sharks, the proteins contained in them are no longer renewed.
The two smallest sharks had a striking amount of carbon-14 in the lens nucleus.
Her birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s, when nuclear tests carried out on this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.
In the third smallest animal with 220 centimeters in length, the lens core, on the other hand, contained a small excess of carbon-14 from the nuclear tests, so it should have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012 in its investigation.
All larger Greenland sharks, on the other hand, had normal carbon-14 amounts in their lens nucleus, resulting from cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.
In fact, the carbon 14-hour for a 493 centimeter-long Greenland shark showed an age of 335 years, while the record shark with 502 centimeters should be even 392 years old.
The fact that Greenlandhai weeds only get young when they are longer than four meters was known.
Now the researchers of the length were able to assign an age.
Since one of the animals with 392 centimeters was probably on the threshold of sexual maturity and its age was determined at 156 years, Greenland sharks with the multiplication can obviously be at least one and a half centuries.
This too is likely to be a world record for vertebrates at present.
That such methuseums live mainly in icy waters is no coincidence.
The previous record holder, a 211-year-old Greenland whale, in whose bacon on the neck had a 120-year-old harpoon tip, was also caught in front of Alaska.
Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there often runs on a fungus flame.
So they mature later - and age slower.
In addition, to keep warm in the cold water, the animals often become particularly large.
Because the volume grows much faster than its surface through which the animal loses heat.
The heat loss of a gram of mouse is therefore much greater than that of a gram of elephant.
Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.
"A smaller animal thus lives more dangerously and should concentrate on having as many offspring as possible early as possible," explains evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein.
A very large animal, on the other hand, should invest its resources in a long life.
Building floor in double packing
In the recent meeting, the municipal council has focused on construction issues.
With ease, the panel took up the announcement by Mayor Robert Putz that "the marketing of the recently designated residential areas can finally begin".
After the land, parceling and development issues have been clarified and the applications for measurement have been made, the sale of the land in the residential areas "Straße" and "Schönau-West" (Bereich Binderstraße - Ausbauschnitt 1) is nothing further in the way of interested parties.
The municipal council is convinced that the buildings in the rural and quiet residential community of Schönau address young families and noisy seniors alike.
As it was called, construction volunteers can immediately report to the town hall, and the municipal council is expected to advise on the granting of the parcels in its September session.
In order also to be able to respond to requests for the resettlement of other commercial enterprises associated with the creation of jobs, the municipal council decided to amend the land use plan in sub-areas, which was only created in spring of this year.
In the field of Unzeitlarn, the commercial area already designated there is extended by two parcels towards Staatsstraße 2112.
Frankfurt benefits from Brexit
The city of Main thus has the best chance of attracting jobs and companies transferred from London in competition with Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg.
"It is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Brexit vote," says Michael Voigtländer, Head of the Competence Field Financial Markets and Real Estate Markets of the IW.
After the Brexit referendum, it is uncertain whether money houses may continue to operate from London from financial operations across the EU.
For the so-called EU passport, they have so far been approved in the UK.
It's using big US banks.
Several banks have already announced to shift jobs.
The lobby association "Frankfurt Main Finance" expects 10,000 new jobs on the Main within five years.
For Frankfurt, the IW, the seat of the European Central Bank (ECB), discusses the responsibility for monetary policy and supervision over the largest banks of the euro area, as well as other important authorities such as the European Insurance Supervisor EIOPA and the ESRB Risk Board.
Although in Paris the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has its head office, it is less important for the financial sector than the ECB.
"The proximity to the music bank is important for banks, as they can communicate directly with the supervision," says IW professor Voigtländer.
Luxembourg, although home to a large fund sector, cuts down poorly in infrastructure as well as Dublin.
Frankfurt was much easier to reach thanks to the large airport.
In addition, point the city with easily available commercial properties.
"It's not that easy in Paris to find free high-quality offices," Voigtländer says.
On the Seine, the rents for first class commercial properties were also 50 percent higher than on the Main.
In addition, Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime.
In a ranking of Mercer's corporate consulting, the city is ranked seven, Luxembourg ranked 19, Dublin ranked 33, and Paris ranked 37.
Although quality of life is a matter of preference: "With its already strong position as a financial location for the European internal market, Frankfurt could attract other banks and investors," says IW.
However, despite Brexit-Votum, London will remain Europe's most important financial centre, the economic researchers believe.
Power ratios also speak for this: In London, according to figures from the Landesbank Helaba, around 1,400 people worked in the banking industry at the end of 2015, in Frankfurt there were 62500.
Gilead receives legal fees from the Hepatitis C patent dispute with Merck
A U.S. judge decided that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to reimbursement of the legal costs incurred by it from the Hepatitis C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was released from a $200 million damages payment for the violation of two patents by Merck, which were associated with the blockbuster drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni from Gilead, after a US judge discovered a pattern of misbehavior by Merck, including the Myth and other unethical acts.
At the hearing on Thursday, U.S. magistrate Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead is entitled to the costs incurred during the defense of the case.
Merck is trying to get along with Gilead, which dominates the market for a new generation of hepatitis C medicines that can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other and claimed property for laboratory work based on Sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in Gilead medicines.
U.S.-supported troops say they have regained full control of Manbij from the Islamic State
U.S.-supported troops have recaptured full control of the northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border after the last IS fighters in the city have left them, said a spokesman of the group on Friday.
The Democratic Forces of Syria (DKS) are sweeping through the city after the withdrawal of the remaining group of fighters who have buried themselves within the city.
They freed more than 2,000 civilians who were held hostage by the fighters, Sharfan Darwish told Reuters, the manbij Military Council, who was allied with the DKS.
"The city is now under complete control, but we're just doing cleanup," he told Reuters.
Clintons earn 10.75 million in 2015 and pay 34.2% federal taxes
Hillary Clinton published its 2015 tax statement on Friday, which resulted in a USD 10.75 million income and an effective federal tax rate of 34.2% for the presidential candidate of the Democrats and her husband.
In 2015, Clinton's USD 1 million donated for charitable purposes, mainly to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton generated almost USD 5.3 million in speech fees; the former Foreign Minister gave a USD 3 million income from publishing house Simon & Schuster for her book on her term in office in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Clinton's candidate for the Vice-Presidentship, Senator Tim Caine from Virginia, together with his wife Anne Holton, published his tax returns over the last ten years.
They paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3% in 2015.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency," said Clinton's campaign assistant Jennifer Palmieri in an opinion.
In a sharp contrast to this, Donald Trump is hiding behind false excuses and withdrawers regarding his previous promises to publish his tax returns.
It is common for U.S. presidential candidates to publish their tax returns, although they are not required by law to do so.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers have indicated a tax audit by the tax authorities as a reason for his refusal.
"They're on the train," wrote Clinton's election helper Ian Sams on Twitter, regarding the publication of the presidential candidate of the Democrats.
On Thursday, Michael Cohen, Trump's Special Advisor, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish anything before the tax audits are not completed.
Trump's critics, including the Republican presidential candidate of the year 2012 Mitt Romney, have already made it clear that his refusal raises issues regarding wealth, donations for charitable organisations, his business-like and various other connections, especially with Russia.
Clinton has already crashed on the topic and released a video on Friday on the Internet, in which high-ranking Republican Trump asks to publish his tax return.
On Thursday she also spoke on the subject during a speech on the economy in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what every other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and to publish his tax returns," she said to the crowd.
Politico has reported that during the 1990s Trump paid no or very little taxes for two years, and a New York Times economic journalist quoted a number of tax attorneys and tax advisers on Friday indicating that this could still be the case.
Federal taxes have become a topic in the campaign.
Clinton supports a scheme named after the billionaire and investor Warren Buffett, which would ensure that people who earn more than USD 1 million pay a tax rate of at least 30%.
President Obama also supports the proposal.
During a election campaign for Hillary Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska demanded Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway Industrial Conglomerate has its seat here, Trump for a meeting to exchange their tax returns.
Buffett said he was also subject to a tax audit of the IRS and Trump had "anxious" before the voters and not before the tax authorities.
Clinton's campaign published tax returns back to 2007.
The Clintons, now living in Chappaqua, New York, paid on average an effective federal tax rate of about 32% between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 40.5%.
The Clinton tax declaration of 2015 showed that they only received USD 100 of their income as wages, unlike most of the Americans.
Its main investment was a cost-effective index fund, from which Clinton’s dividends and revenues taxed USD 109,000.

Condoms with chilipuders, fireworks bodies promote Tanzania’s elephant protection
Nature protectors in Tanzania use an unorthodox way to stop elephants from going into inhabited settlements - they throw condoms on them that are filled with chilipuders.
The method has proved to be effective and the Honeyguide Foundation, which had the idea to do so years ago, together with the US's natural protection system, has intensified its support by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non-violent four-step method to protect their homes and crops without harming animals.
Previously, many spears used to defend themselves.
Friday is World Day, dedicated to animal welfare.
"Since we have developed the toolkit, we have been able to observe within these communities a change in their attitude, being much more confident that they can keep the elephants away from their fields without harming the elephants," said the manager of Honeyguide Damian Bell in a communication.
The first two steps include lighting the elephant with a torch and blowing into a horn.
If it is not deterred, a so-called "chili cloud" is thrown.
Chilipuder mixed with earth is packed together with a fireworks body into a condom, the end of which is turned all the way to the ignition cord.
When it is lit, the condom bursts with a bang and sprays fine dust into the air at Chilipuder.
A touch is usually already out to chase the elephants.
One last possibility is a thrower that shoots a gold rain fireworks into the air, causing a loud, bright explosion.
City council unanimously decides: No kioskneubau on the St. Goarer Rheinifer
Normally, the St. Goarer takes on investment projects by businessmen with kiss hand - especially the retail trade in the core city is considered to be clearly expandable.
However, the City Council has now unanimously rejected the request for the new building of a sales kiosk on the Rhine in the immediate vicinity of the Rhine balcony in construction.
"In principle, we welcome new business operators, but this kiosk does not fit in with the exposed location on the Rhine in this location," said Michael Hubrath for the CDU faction.
Jewish director smashes Berliner Hotel because Israel's pre-election was removed after "Arab" request - RT News
A French director with Jewish roots unleashed a media riot after he had betrayed that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin had not listed any Israeli pre-elections, as it had "requested" Arab guests according to an employee.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentation "Shoah" released his anger at Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his last stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the hotel's pre-election list.
However, the country was not listed between the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, that Israel was eliminated and deleted?
Lanzmann wrote.
Instead, the Kempinksi Bristol offers an opportunity to choose Israel via its own call center.
Looking for an explanation, the director turned to the hotel reception.
The answer he received there was "shocked him," as Lanzmann wrote.
The hotel staff said that the measure was "an intentional decision of the management of the Kempinski hotels."
The reason behind this caused even more anger in the director.
"The majority of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre-election be deleted," the staff member was quoted by Lanzmann.
The Israeli ambassador in Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called this a "great shame," reports the Süddeutsche Zeitung.
We were terrified and disturbed by this event.
That's really embarrassing.
The fact that this has taken place in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even more disgraceful.
That doesn't require any explanation.
We expect the hotel to draw "the right conclusions," said the official.
The incident triggered a pretty big response on the Internet, where people called the whole thing a scandal.
Some assumed to the Kempinski Hotel that it would have "refused" the alleged demands of Arab guests.
In another article, it said that the hotel, located on the noble Kurfürstendamm, is close to a synagogue.
The hotel quickly dismissed all allegations and called the incident a "accident" and "explained" at Lanzmann, says Der Spiegel.
"There was never a direct instruction", Israel was not included in the Quick Dial list," said the Süddeutsche Zeitung, a spokesman for the Kempinski Hotel.
It adds that the country pre-election has now been added.
Police use tear gas & rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students
On Thursday, students met with the police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo to demonstrate against government reforms in the public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the demonstrators.
The difficulties began when police officers tried to disperse the students, causing the police to use rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students participated in the demonstrations to express their dismay at the plans.
According to the proposals of the Governor of the state of Sao Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, a little less than 100 public schools are closed, while 300,000 students are implemented to save money.
Some of the protesters were seen spraying graffiti on walls against the provisional president Michel Temer.
The most recent protests took place a few days after protesters in masses went on the streets to support the suspended president, Dilma Rousseff, who had been expelled from office by a Senate vote.
Trade between Russia and Iran suddenly rises to 71% - RT Business
According to the Russian ambassador in Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan, the trade turnover between Moscow and Tehran grew by 70.9 percent annually.
Since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted, the interest on the part of Russian companies has grown in business in the country, the ambassador announced.
Russian companies enter into existing links with Iran while new companies are ready to access the market.
Of course, the further expansion of trade is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," Dzhagaryan said.
He noted that trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent in the first five months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $856 million.
In particular, Russian imports in Iran rose by 91.5% and amounted to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $158 million.
The trade upturn was achieved by supplies of machinery, land vehicles and weapons," said the ambassador.
Dzhagaryan expects a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia for this year.
Last year, the Russian Foreign Office issued around 35,000 visas, primarily travel visas, to Iranian citizens.
Iran also reached the top 20 of the countries with regard to the number of tourists in Russia.
It could be said that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia were broken last year," he said.
At the same time, relatively few Russians visit Iran, something the ambassador hopes it will change.
"I personally can recommend the visit of the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd to receive the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in a good condition," he said.
Witnesses Searched: Drinking Market Invaded in Waldbröl
A robbery was committed on Thursday evening on the beverage market of Rewe XXL on the Waldbröler Gerberstraße.
Subject to a gun, three darkly dressed persons who had disguised their faces demanded the issue of cash from the beverage market staff and then fled on foot and then probably with a silver VW golf.
How much money has been spent, the police don't tell us.
The perpetrators are said to have been between 1,60 and 1,70 meters tall, that is, relatively small.
The beverage market is directly accessible from the park deck of the Rewe market and is poorly visible.
After the attack, the perpetrators must have run towards Gerberstraße, Friedrich-Engelbert-Weg, and fled from the gravel car park opposite the car entrance with the silver car, possibly towards B 256 (Schlädernring).
Anyone who has made observations at the time of the robbery (at 7.45 p.m.) is to report to the police urgently.
Nagold: fun and play at summer leisure
Eight nice and happy days the children and young people spent the social education group/social group work of the Children's Protection Association Nagold with their caregivers during their summer holidays in Nussdorf, near Mühlacker.
In the quiet leisure home Hardtwäldle was the life-friendly group quarted during the first week of school holidays.
Several full-day trips were on the program.
On the one hand, it went to boards with the visit of the petting zoo.
On the other hand, after Maulbronn, where there was a special child guidance in the world-famous monastery.
The third trip led to Pforzheim.
In the Keltenmuseum in Hochdorf, the group learned a lot about the everyday life and the food of the Celts.
On the hot days, the group enjoyed the deep sea in Maulbronn, which invited them to jump, swim and plan.
Culinary children and caregivers were spoiled with their self-prepared meals such as the Sauren Spätzle, the Seebronnner Pfännle, Iselshauser-Bloff, the English Breakfast and Tübinger Bologna.
In workshops were built, beautiful jewels made of pearls and stones or made of wood a Roman mill game.
Other highlights of leisure were fishing in a nearby pond, the evenings at the fire and the final "Bunte Abend".
On the day of the journey home, the sun laughed, and the children and young people returned home happy.
Haigerloch: Pilgrims for the Gate of Mercy
The ministers from Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna were traveling on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.
Four stages were taken together.
In order to bridge the time to the next Roman pilgrimage of all ministers in expected two years, the St. Anna's Chief Ministerial Round has decided to prepare and carry out a multi-day pilgrimage.
Various pilgrimage goals have been examined and a final decision has been made for the Bishops' City of Freiburg, where this year, on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy, a special pilgrimage was offered with the opened gate of mercy at Freiburg Münster.
16 Minis of bitter-brown, gravel, shark hole, and holy rooms made their way.
The evening before, Father Storost sent out the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the cross of pilgrims and gave the pilgrims a blessing.
From Horb, the starting point of Villingen was taken by train, where also a Münster of Our Lady stood and the pilgrimage of the Münster was started.
The individual day trips were framed in the morning and in the evening by a short impulse with various prayers, songs and scriptures.
But also along the way, the minis at field crosses, chapels or churches repeatedly rested in order to sing a song of their own collection of pilgrim songs.
The local parishes were at the disposal of parishes for the nights.
At the milestones Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller provided a tasty as well as strengthening dinner and breakfast.
On the second day, Furtwangen went on to Gütenbach.
On the next day, one started the stage after St. Peter, which was the most strenuous route, but in the event of a cool heat, about 500 metres in height had to be climbed and then climbed again.
The deserved reward was a common barbecue at the bath bay in the evening.
After the morning impulse on the fourth day of pilgrims in the imposing monastery church of St. Peter, it went on the final stage to Freiburg.
Apparently relieved and happy, the minis met later in the afternoon at Freiburg Münster and passed through the gate of mercy.
With a small impulse, God was thanked here.
In the evening fair in Münster, the Minis arrived at the pilgrim destination were welcomed by Cooperator Markus Obert.
After the divine service, the pilgrims could visit the Sacristy and the High Altar.
The next day was still time for the Breisgaumetropole.
In the afternoon it went back to Horb by train.
In conclusion, all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were marked.
Schotte Callum Skinner storms home when Brite is ringing Gold for cycling
Scotland's Callum Skinner raced for fame last night in the men's team-sprint in the Velodrom in Rio, when the British team defended the title of London 2012.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor roll that his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy had made himself his own. The boy pound made the legend proud when he stormed home to return to a victory of the favorite New Zealand.
England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic gold medals.
They repeated the trick after taking only a modest sixth place in March at the London Railway World Championships despite Hoys' resignation.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.
They did this in time as a hinds.
Hoy's retirement created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.
Skinner was the man they stayed with when they saw potential in the Scots that has now unfolded.
Hindes, Kenny - who won with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner set an Olympic record in the qualifying rounds, but in the standard rounds the New Zealanders won in the first round.
And the British trio won the duel with gold.
Hindes was barely back after his round, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it.
A change of strategy made up a large part of the transformation, during which Hindus went in a higher corridor to slow him down and allow Kenny and, above all, Skinner to keep the pace.
Hoy looked out of his position as a BBC expert and fell on Skinner, Kenny and Hindes as they climbed on the podium.
The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said, "It's a flattering comparison."
I'm just here to do my best and make a name for myself.
We set up an Olympic record in the final round and defeated the World Champions.
It was just incredible.
There is no better way to win this.
After the 2012 Triumph on the Kennys and Hoys side, Hindes admitted that after a weak start he deliberately fell on the track.
He withdrew this statement later and there was no objection from England's rival.
This time, there was no such problem with such an outstanding victory.
Hindes said, "It feels like the whole GB flag on the stands like London."
We've been together for the last three months as a team.
We got away so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win back at the Olympics.
This is an event, a gold medal for the nation, won seven out of ten titles both in Beijing and in London.
If this is a barometer of our progress in the last five months, we expect successful five days in the Velodrom.
With the form Kennys it is possible that he repeated Hoys victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.
This would mean for Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (a seemingly sacred date for British sport; also born on the day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - an proceeds of six gold medals and a silver medal.
That would be Hoy's.
Kenny will take part in the Sprint next, which will start today and go over three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said, "I only enjoy this for the moment."
The team event is always best.
You can win it with your colleagues.
It feels a little lonely to win alone.
Hintes said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight."
It was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England.
Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doul qualified with the fastest performance in the four-kilometer race.
They arrived at the finish in 3:51,942.
The world record won in 2012 in London Gold was 3:51,659.
The first and final round (22.42) will take place today on the second day of the bet, where Wiggins will certainly be in the focus.
Yesterday, he had fought with staff before the qualification, when officials called him to measure his height.
In the corresponding women competition, which continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie advanced in the world record time in 4:13,260.
The GB team relies on its strong team to dominate the middle period of the Olympics and to bring a crowd of medals.
After a truly extraordinary representation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were dropped.
Dramas played in the background, so the technical director Shane Sutton retired in April in the midst of sexism and bullying accusations as well as the retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, if you look at the first evening of the competition in Velodrom, it looks as if the now legendary reputation of GB, which has reached its peak at the perfect moment, could be repeated.
The future of Portland melting due to the repeal of the Energy Treaty
The future of Portland's aluminium melts in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workers' jobs - are at stake, as the plant operator terminates the energy supply contract and thereby cancels all supply contracts as the supplier announced.
This step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year not to grant any further subsidies for the operation of the plant.
A 20-year fixed subsidy will expire in November.
Up to 2000 jobs in the Alcoa plant in Portland are at stake.
Not less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk of closure.
In addition, there could be domino effects, as the melting industry consumes about 10 percent of the total electricity produced by Victoria.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry melting mill, which led to a closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
Alcoa's meltdown in Portland loses money and risks closure.
This step follows the many years of speculation about the future of the plant, originally due to the strong Australian dollar and most recently due to the electricity price of the plant.
AGL, which supplies the large aluminium melting plant with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, reported that it is expected that three other owners will terminate their contracts.
The facility is in the majority possession of a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp have smaller shares.
"AGL assumes that the plant in Portland will continue to operate, which means further physical demand for electricity through the melting industry," the company announced.
AGL continued to announce that the contracts were so-called "security transactions" which were due to enter into force as of November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month notice period, so that they will end in 2017.
"That is why AGL expects the contracts to contribute to revenue in fiscal year 17," said the electricity supplier.
All potential impacts on AGL revenues from the year 18 onwards are currently limited by forecasts of strong forward-looking markets for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL announced that it had already written off the value of the contracts in its year-end amount of $187 million in "expected of a termination".
Alcoa said that the decision to book the contracts does not affect the "ability of Alcoas... to operate the melting industry or to ensure the power supply to the melting industry".
The US company said that it had concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which was supposed to enter into force from November this year, even if it is still due to an explanation why it has resigned from the contract.
Analysts warn against the possible closure of the Portland melting plant in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to the poor economic conditions of the industry.
In reference to the analyst's statements at the beginning of the week, the Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland consumes about 600 megawatts and tomago about 900 megawatts of electricity annually.
Should both plants disappear from the market, this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the [power market].
And it wouldn't be good for us as a power generator," he said.
More than just a Kardashian reality TV star, Kendall is on the cover of the September edition of Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kardashian-Jenner Clan Kris is on the cover of the coveted September issue of the US Vogue.
Kendall, the brand ambassador for Estee Lauder, who ran on the Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
"In a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover made me cry," Kendall wrote.
The disclosure of the cover followed a bizarre (or simply keeping up with the Kardashians similar?), scripted reality video showing the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (with the exception of the problem cases Rob and Caitlyn as well as in the presence of the ever-popular showbiz uncle and producer of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest), as she forgot the cover of her sister and ended with a classic turn: they all planned a surprise party.
This represents the cliché action of almost every birthday episode of a children's show (Seacrest brought the sentence, "You thought we'd forgotten you?" with the honesty of a cartoon rabbit on a radio station at 8 a.m.), but Kris had to have her other girls participate in this publicity somehow.
With regard to the September edition of the Vogue, a new era of Kardashians has certainly begun.
Kendall's great sister Kim likes her beating on the Vogue cover (she and her husband Kanye West were on display in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for themselves.
The September issue is the most sold edition of the year for Vogue.
With a volume that resembles a tape rather than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a large number of advertisers (Laut Fashionista were advertising from the 832 pages of the rolling miller 615 pages).
The disclosure of his coverstar is expected so longingly that in the last two years pictures of the magazine have been leaking before official announcement.
Women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have been clearly more "famous ones" than "models who are celebrities" on the cover.
Oscar award winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013 one year after Lady Gaga was honored.
But even at the low chance that Ms. Jenner - described by the magazine as the "breakthrough model" of her generation - falls under the previous category, she is in good company.
These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or youths of today who know how to make a good Snapchat video (even if it all applies to Jenner).
They're really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry.
Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the publication of Lemonade.
Of course Jenner's success does not everyone like.
With their reality TV story Jenner's position in fashion was always a bit tense.
In June, the former Victoria's Secret Model, Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague, Gigi Hadid, criticized her and called her "the bitches of the moment."
These feelings boiled up again when the news came out with Jenner's appearance on the Vogue Cover.
But riding around on mischief seems to pass the point.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September edition of Vogue.
She is a supermodel in the truest sense of the word.
She's running for Marc Jacobs.
She makes advertising for your founding of Estee Lauder.
She and all her sisters sell you pictures of themselves on their respective Paywall apps.
She sells her pictures from Cindy Crawford's daughter to the magazine LOVE.
And in her spare time she can be seen on reality TV. Probably only to see her sister Kurtney and her children.
Municipal rights centres reject 160,000 people per year
More than 160,000 of the country's most in need of assistance are rejected annually by the community rights centres, while the sector is concerned with the impact of further cuts on already overburdened transactions.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly elderly people, immigrants, workers in need of help, victims of violence and those who do not have funds for unjust debriefing and similar - are already refused to apply for free legal advice and legal assistance.
Legal services of the community, which have already been overexposed, are ready for further cuts.
As of June next year, these legal centres will lose another 30 percent of their federal funds.
The director of the common law centers of Queensland James Farrell said that the last survey of the National Association of Municipal Law Centres revealed that thousands of people are already being rejected every year.
Farrell said that the situation would only get worse without an end to the federal government's decision.
"Queensland's community rights centres are chronically underfunded, which means that thousands of people are rejected by important services you need," he said.
People who leave violent relationships, people with insurmountable and oppressive debts, families who go through separations, workers who have been unjustly released - all these people have problems of a legal nature and this survey shows that they can't get the help they need.
As of June 2017, the Federal Government will cut the funding by 30 percent, which means that thousands of more needy people from Queensland will be forced to deal with their legal problems without any help.
We call on the Federal Attorney General and Minister of Justice as well as Senators of Queensland George Brandis to remove these cuts of funds immediately so that people can get the help they need in the event of legal problems.
Last year, the state government fulfilled its promise to raise funds for legal aid to the national average.
It is now time to look at the needs of the community rights centres and their customer communities and that the government of Palaszczuk is investing in this important work.
Donald Trump's election campaign after employees allegedly pulled the gun
New York: Donald Trump's campaign has been charged with alleged inactivity after she was told that her campaign leader for North Carolina had directed a gun to an employee in February while they were on their way in a jeep in February.
The incident is described in a bill filed by Vincent Bordini in Charlotte's State Court on Wednesday, a former software programmer for the campaign in this state.
Bordini said to have waited for months that the matter would be settled internally before he realized that "that would not happen."
The campaign leader, Earl Philip, " drew a gun, put his right index finger on the trigger, and hit the race in Vincent's knee hole," said Bordini in his charge.
After complaining with the local and regional campaign management, Bordini found that at least four more people had already had the same experience with Phillip, he stated in the indictment.
"Weapon don't have to be fired to cause damage," Bordini said.
The charge comes only two days after the Republican presidential candidate triggered a riot when he told a crowd in North Carolina that the "Second Amendment people" - gun owners and weapons friends - should take action if his rival Hillary Clinton is elected and judges should be appointed.
Trump's campaign made it clear that the media had ripped his words out of the context and that he would not incite him to violence.
Bordini's complaint demands damages from the campaign for breach of due diligence and from Philip for bodily injury and permanent mental damage.
Trump's press speaker Hope Hicks was unable to reach an opinion.
Trying to contact Philip also failed.
WCCB, a local news station in Charlotte, reports that Phillip is no longer a member of the campaign.
Calls to his consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services, have not been responded.
The Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has previously led a controversial campaign.
The procedure is Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, Supreme Court, County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Berlin/Schwerin: Survey before country elections: Losing SPD and CDU
In the upcoming elections in the Federal States of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (4 September) and Berlin (18 September) there are significant losses for the government parties SPD and CDU.
This resulted in representative surveys of the INSA opinion research institute for the "picture" magazine (Friday).
While the red-black government coalition in the north could barely continue to rule, this is not possible according to the survey values in Berlin.
In both states, however, the SPD would be the strongest party and would have a good chance to continue to present the head of government.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the SPD dropped from 35.6 percent five years ago to 24 percent.
According to the survey, the party was only just in front of the CDU, which could return to 23 percent.
The third place is disputed between the Left and the AfD.
The left was 19 per cent (before 18.4 per cent), the AfD would be represented for the first time in the country day at 19 per cent.
Despite minor losses, the Greens regressed to the heavy land day with 6 percent (before 8.7 percent).
NPD and FDP would not be represented in the country day at 3 percent each.
According to the survey, the SPD would only reach 23 percent (election 2011: 28.3 percent).
The CDU reached only 18 percent after 23.4 percent.
It was still behind the Greens with 19 percent (2011: 17.6 percent), but before the Left with 15 percent (previously 11.7 percent).
The AfD would be represented for the first time in the House of Deputies at 14%.
By 5 percent, the FDP could hope for a return, but the pirates would miss the move in in contrast to 2011.
Nokia 9000 Communicator: The first smartphone
E-mail and Internet in time loop: 20 years ago, the Nokia Communicator came to the market.
The successors dominate the world today - his manufacturer experienced a disaster.
The device weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.
It was thicker and bigger, therefore it was also not well in hand.
On the contrary, it was quite clumsy.
The built-in memory was initially eight megabytes, which would today reach about two selfies with high resolution.
An iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gigabytes.
The Nokia 9000 Communicator came into business exactly 20 years ago, August 15, 1996, and it was the first smartphone.
For a few euros, lovers can still buy the devices on the Internet, but they kind of come from the Stone Age of the Internet Age.
20 years ago, however, the Communicator was a sensation.
The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair Cebit in Hanover as a "office in the West pocket format".
In fact, the new mobile phone could be sent and received a lot for the standards at that time: SMS and e-mails could be sent and received, also by fax was the Communicator to reach.
Even access to websites was possible via HTML browser, though painfully slow.
A pocket calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.
There was a small antenna, and the phone could be folded up like a laptop.
Then there was a small keyboard and a black and white screen.
The price was pretty proud: 2700 D-Mark, i.e. about 1400 euros.
The average retail price of a smartphone in Germany was EUR 392 in 2015.
No one could have imagined in August 1996 that the Communicator would become the beginning of the smartphone era.
Since then, everything has been different.
The smart phones are a success story, though not for Nokia.
The Finns' cell phone division experienced an unprecedented disaster, was finally sold and processed to Microsoft.
Today, the market is dominated by suppliers, all of whom came much later than Nokia.
Always and everywhere to be online, that is today for a lot of people everyday life.
In 2015, there were almost two billion smartphone users worldwide.
About 1.4 billion devices were sold, of which only 555 million are sold on Samsung and Apple.
Worldwide sales with the devices are around 400 billion euros.
In addition, the well-running business of the countless app providers and the telecommunications companies.
A whole industry has been created around the smartphone.
The crucial breakthrough to the mass market was only in early 2007, when Apple Chief Steve called on Mac World to launch the iPhone.
He promised three devices in one: a music player, a phone and an Internet communicator, to easily operate everything via touch screen.
Apple’s winning train began, and today the iPhone is the company’s most important product.
Nokia, Motorola and Blackberry, who dominated the market, had the oversight.
They finally disappeared, Blackberry has to fight.
The story now has Apple and Asian providers like Samsung.
The smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after its invention.
On average, every German in the meantime looks at his cell phone 88 times a day.
"We all need to learn to remove the smartphone," said Janina Kull, in the Siemens Executive Board responsible for staff.
Permanent accessibility is now regarded as a curse and blessing at the same time.
England must steer the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London, but throughout the country.
For me, this was the biggest attraction of Heathrow, just like back in 2012 in London, when we were doing a huge effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games.
The Olympics brought great benefits to Stratford and the East End.
And this will be achieved again by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near Heathrow.
For our local communities, we will create 10,000 new teaching places, 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment.
Just as they were ahead of us in London 2012, there will be those who will think that the challenge of enlargement is too big.
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be blaming ourselves on the world stage.
The doubters were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong at Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers every question he asks.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is for many and not for individual infrastructure projects.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 billion of scientific growth and a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and throughout the UK.
We have a great team in Heathrow, which has implemented a £11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget, from the T5 - which was selected five years in a row as the world's best airport terminal, up to the T2 built in the middle of the two most frequented stages of the world.
Now they are ready to deliver a third rung, which is supported by £16 billion in private investment.
The 2012 London games were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of Heathrow will also be one.
It is time that we steer this Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow, securing our future trade and creating a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is Chairman of the Heathrow Board and former Commercial Secretary to the Treasury
Adblock Plus, Facebook in "Katz- und Mausspiel" related to Adblocking
For companies that earn money online, according to one of the software manufacturers, attempts to bypass ad blockage are equivalent to a "catz and mouse game".
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced that it would block display blocking on its desktop page, Adblock Plus posted a blog post informing users that their filters could be updated in the program to block advertising on the social network again.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that its desktop page would change the coding regarding its ads to make it difficult to recognize display blockings about which part of the site advertising is.
But Adblock announced that it has found a new way to bypass the new codes.
In a blog post, the speaker of Adblock Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of hin-and-her-campf between the advertising blocking Open Source Community and the surrounding community has been in progress since the invention of display blockers," and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution.
The fact that the world's largest social media company has joined the fight is a strong indication of how worrying advertising blockers have become for the industry.
According to a study by Pageair and Adobe last year, around 200 million people use display blockers; almost four times as much in 2013.
With 1.03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook via their mobile devices, mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of Facebook’s advertising revenue.
The company has ignored advertising blockers on desktop PCs, as mobile advertising blockers have no effect on Facebook's mobile app for the social network and Instagram, one speaker announced.
Advertising on desktop PCs makes a sufficient proportion of the revenue, so Facebook appears to invest such a step as worthwhile.
On Tuesday Facebook announced that it would update its "advertising preference tool" to give people more control over their targeted advertising.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblock's new filters would be worrying because they would also block content on the site that is not advertising.
"This is not a positive experience for users, so we plan to address the problem," said a Facebook speaker in an e-mail message.
Adblockers are a muted tool, which is why we have focused on developer tools like Ad Preferences instead to put more control into the hands of people.
In case of suspected suicide, cross the Swiss motorway
The victim was on the highway in the middle of the night.
The police are calling witnesses after a woman in the early morning hours of Thursday was hit by a suspected suicide of several vehicles on a highway.
The incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in Canton Vaud shortly after midnight.
A woman laid herself on the street in the dark "in an act of despair" and was hit by several cars, the police said in Vaud.
It is obvious that a Swiss woman at the age of 49 who was driven by several vehicles, including a truck, wanted to kill herself.
She died on the spot.
Several drivers have already been heard, but some have still not been identified, said the police who asked these and every witness of the incident to report.
It opened an investigation procedure, which is a "logical" step in such a situation, and Gilles Hofstetter told the Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be shown.
Was a clash avoidable?
This is something the prosecutor has to decide," said Hofstetter.
Two similar cases in the last five years show that drivers are not being held responsible.
In each of the two cases - in which one person ran on the highway in the dark - it was decided that the drivers should not assume that a pedestrian runs on the highway in the middle of the night as it was called in the newspaper.
Last year, a police officer was released from the negligent killing after crossing a man and killing him who was on the A1 near Payerne one night in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had drunk and became unconscious on the street, the court heard.
The court found that the police officer -- who had responded to an emergency call -- was running in a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was a "perfect extraordinary and unpredictable situation", the judge said.
Anyone who has further information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should report to the police under number 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus was once habitable
According to the projections of a new NASA climate model, Venus was probably once habitable.
Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies at NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those of climate researchers.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus with its hot, waterless surface and CO2 dense atmosphere could once have demonstrated similar conditions.
Scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, earthlike atmosphere and, nevertheless, turned around slowly.
The model also illuminated the topography of early Venus.
The planet probably grew more dry areas than the Earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to accommodate life and protected it from rapid evaporation.
The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent matte.
"In the GISS model simulation the slow rotation of Venus exposes its day-to-day side of the sun for almost two months," said GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release.
This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the sun's heat.
The result is average temperatures that are a little bit cooler than the Earth today.
The model produced a story of Venus that resembles evolution, which was previously suspected by planetary researchers.
Although she was once probably habitable, Venus -- over billions of years -- was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light.
Their oceans evaporated and their water vapor was burned away by ultraviolet light.
When her hydrogen escaped, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect remained behind -- the Venus, as we know it today.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus Climate Model in the Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy retires as coach of Avalanche
Patrick Roy resigned on Thursday as coach and Vice President of Hockey Operations of the Colorado Avalanche and led too low a right of codecision in the team's decision-making process.
Alternative President/General Manager of Colorado Joe Sakic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will immediately seek a new trainer.
"In the last three years, I have fulfilled my duties as Chief Trainer and Vice President Of Hockey Operations of the Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination," Roy said in a statement.
Over the course of the summer, I have been thinking a lot about how I could improve this team to give it more depth, it needs it and bring it to a higher level.
To achieve this, the vision of the coach and Vice President of Hockey Operations must be perfectly aligned with that of the organization.
He must also have a right of codecision in decisions that influence the performance of the team.
These conditions are currently not met.
Sakic, who had hired Roy on 23 May 2013, thanked him for his contributions to the team.
"Patrick informed me today about this decision," said Sakic.
We all appreciate what he has done for our organization and wish him the best for the future.
Roy was awarded the winner of the Jack Adams Award at Avalanches 2013-14 during his debut season.
He led the club to 112 points and to the first place in the Central Vision, but Colorado was beaten in the first round of the Minnesota Playoffs and missed the postseason in each of the last two years.
The Avalanches recorded a 39-39-4 brand in the 2015-16 season and fell behind the game for a second Wildcard Spot in the Western Conference by five points.
As Hall of Fame Torwart, Roy won four Stanley Cups -- two pieces with the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche.
North-sea oil workers resume talks, strike off
Labour struggles on remuneration for North Sea oil workers are being suspended, while all the parties to the dispute stand for a new round of talks, said the negotiators.
Strikes against the oil field service provider Wood Group were carried out sporadicly on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group as well as the Unite and RMT trade unions can confirm that we have agreed to re-start the settlement process of the current dispute," says a joint statement.
We will hold several full-day meetings in the next few weeks, which will begin at the beginning of next year to tackle the problems again.
The trade unions said that their last strike, the first one in more than 25 years, was a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent.
This year, Wood Group cut its rates to its North Sea contractors by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure.
The company's rate reduction is followed by a 10-percent decrease for onshore contractors in 2014.
The company said that additional cuts give the company the space needed to get through the market downturn.
Shell has for its part dismissed thousands of people and announced plans to give up its oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries, since it rationalizes its business activities as a result of its mega merger with the UK energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure as a result of the lower Rohelpreise, an economic situation which the British decided to leave the European Union in June.
Scottish parliamentarian Dave Anderson met with workers leaders at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the biggest labour disputes that have been taking place in the North Sea since one generation.
The North Sea is important for the regional economy, he said.
"In the North Sea and throughout the country we need an economy that works for many and not only for a few," he said in one statement.
In 2016, less than $1.4 billion in spending on new projects in the North Sea is expected to be around $7 billion on average over the last five years.
Kepler measures the rotation rate of stars in the cluster of Pleiades
The latest mission with the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers to collect the most complete catalogue of rotational rates among the stars of the cluster of Pleiades.
The new data helps astronomers to understand why stars rotate at different rates in the cluster of stars and in what context the rotation periods are associated with the formation of the planet.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other star clusters, we will learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age, and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.
The cluster of the Pleiades is located 445 light years from Earth.
Many stars in this cluster of stars, which emerged some 125 million years ago, now reach adulthood.
They're spinning the fastest now.
At peak rotational rates, these rippling stars emit large amounts of star winds.
As these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a braking effect on the stars.
When a star ages, its rotational rate begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognizing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- like sun spots.
The latest catalog of rotational rates indicates that more massive stars rotate slower than less massive stars.
Rebull compares the stars to dancers, with larger stars spinning slower pirouettes than smaller ones.
"In the "Ballet" of Pleiades we see that slow rotors tend to be more massive, whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," said Rebull.
Since the cluster of the Pleiades is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities like rotational rates.
"The cluster of the Pleiades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions, younger and older," said Rebull.
There is still a lot ahead of us about what we would like to learn more about how to slow down their rotational rates when and why stars hang up their "dancing shoes".
Rebull and her colleagues have reported in detail in three newspaper reports their latest analysis of the rotational rates of Pleiades, which will soon appear in the Astronomical Journal.
A contentious Baseball Star Departs
The tears ran faster with Alex Rodriguez than the US Baseball Star on best days from Base to Base.
After his emotional resignation, the 41-year-old professional will be wearing the jersey of his New York Yankees on August 12 against the Tampa Bay Rays for the last time.
"I love this game and this team."
"I say 'Goodbye' to both," explained the 14-time all-star game player of the Major League Baseball (MLB).
Rodriguez was elected the most valuable player in the league three times, and won the World Series in 2009 with Yankees.
His signature under a ten-year contract has given him $27 million a year since 2007.
Until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017, he will act as a consultant and youth coach at full pay.
As a player it paid Rodriguez back long time with performance.
With 696 homeruns, 3114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ("Runs") for the Seattle Mariners (1994 to 2000), the Texas Rangers (2001 to 2004) and since 2005 the Yankees he made some milestones.
With the Hall-of-Fame members Hank Aaron and Willie Mays, only two more baseball players have similar values in the main statistics.
However, the 41-year-old should not be admitted to the hall of fame of the baseball.
Because Rodriguez - nickname "A-Rod" - was so successful in the field, so controversial is his appearance outside the square.
Already in 2009, the superstar admitted to "ESPN" to have taken out forbidden steroids between 2001 and 2003.
In August 2013, he was blocked for 211 parties due to a wrap in the so-called biogenesis scandal until the end of 2014.
Rodriguez is considered to have been the main suspect to have received performance support for years through an anti-aging clinic in South Florida.
After a lawsuit, the lock was reduced to 162 meetings.
"The league could even have done me a favor for 2014 because I played 20 years without a break," Rodriguez said Suffisant at the time.
Even his farewell days do not go silent.
While many baseball legends get the big stage again in their last games, Rodriguez often had to sit on the bank.
"My job doesn't include a farewell tour."
"My job involves trying to win every game," Yankees Coach Joe Girardi ate.
After all, Rodriguez, who was married to actress Cameron Diaz and told of the relationship with popstar Madonna and actress Kate Hudson, got sympathy from fans of Yankee-Erzrival Boston Red Sox.
"We want A-Rod", the followers sang at the 4:9 defeat against the Rodriguez team.
Olympia 2016: Chen Xinyi, Silwia Danekowa and Adrian Zielinski are first doping cases
Acquired: Due to a positive doping sample Adrian Zielinski, weightlifter from Poland in Rio must not start.
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are overshadowed by the first official doping cases.
A captured athlete would have almost won a medal.
Before the seventh day of the competition, the first official doping cases have become known for the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
The Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 3000-metre dog runner Silwia Danekowa from Bulgaria and the Polish weightlifter Adrian Zielinski were positively tested and excluded in Brazil - just before the start of the already critically sighted athletic contests, these messages are coming to an end.
At Chen last Sunday, the diuretics Hydrochlorothiazide had been proven, which is used as a masking agent for doping substances.
The International Sports Court, CAS, confirmed its exclusion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon.
On Sunday, the 18-year-old took the fourth place in the final over 100 m of butterfly, only at 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal.
On Friday Chen should have taken part in the courses of more than 50 m freestyle.
Chen requested the opening of the B-probe and a hearing at the International Olympic Committee (IOC).
The National Association took the matter "very seriously and demands Chen's full cooperation in the investigations," Xinhua said from a communication: "We will cooperate with the International Sports Court and accept the verdict".
For the first time in history, the IOC is no longer responsible for sanctioning the athletes with positive cases.
Also in the night of Rio, the news of the positive test was passed at Danekowa, the 33-year-old went to the offensive himself.
"I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," this was "an incredible shock," she said to the Bulgarian TV station BNT.
She was innocent, "the only explanation could be food supplements," said the athlete.
According to the report, the prohibited substance should be the blood doping agent EPO.
Danekowa was temporarily suspended, according to BNT the B-probe should have already been positive.
Bulgaria's Prime Minister, Bojko Borissow, immediately spoke with criticism of the athlete.
"I don't understand why the athletes don't draw the right conclusions," he said, "We Bulgarians are under observation, so many have been excluded."
For example, all weightlifters from the chronic doping-blasted nation must not participate in Rio.
On Friday the case "Adrian Zielinski" was also known, and the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested positively three days earlier like his brother Tomasz on the anabolic steroid Nandrolon.
Both contest the intake, but both are not allowed to start in class up to 94 kg.
Before the launch of the athletes, the Danekowa case in particular is another heavy blow for the reputation of the entire sport.
The IAAF World Association had banned the entire Russian team until an exception due to systematic dopings the start, also the Laufernation Kenya produces numerous bad news in Rio.
In swimming, the previous crimes in China had also caused violent clashes between athletes.
So the Frenchman Camille Lacourt attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang Harsh.
"Sun Yang Pinkelt purple."
"When I see the podium over 200 m freestyle, I want to surrender," said Lacourt on the French radio.
Sun was also at the heart of a battle with the Australian Mack Horton.
"I have no time and no respect for doping frauds," said this one.
Sun had been tested positive for the Stimulan Trimetazidine in 2014 at the Chinese Championships, but only a three-month lock had to be removed.
Data Claw: As perfide, hackers blackmail their ransom
Programmers of extortion malware currently attack targeted companies - and are successful in doing so.
According to a recent survey of malware defense specialists malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America, the UK and Germany, 40 percent of the companies surveyed have been at least once in the past 12 months, partially victims of an attack with blackmail software.
In Germany, almost 20 percent of companies were once targeted for Ransomware extortion.
40 percent of the victims willingly paid the ransoms demanded by the perpetrators in order to re-use the affected systems and data.
The perpetrators specialize in their extortion software according to the observations of malwarebytes on attacks in corporate networks.
If they are successful there, the potentially extorting ransom is significantly higher than for private users.
"We are currently observing an alarmingly fast evolution of malicious software," explains Marcin Kleczynski, head of malware, in conversation with the "world".
In 2008, most malware programs were still designed to send advertisements.
Then the perpetrators discovered extortion software for themselves.
Only private users were the target, but the switch to company attacks has taken place horrificly quickly in recent months.
Ransomware works on a simple pattern: Once active on the victim's computer, it searches specifically for recently modified files such as Word, Excel or Database files as well as for archives of images and videos.
These files encrypt the Ransomware and delete the originals sustainably.
The software then presents the demands of the extortioners.
In order to get the encryption code to the files, the victims must transfer money - usually in the form of bitcoin cryptocurrency.
However, where private users play the personal photo database, companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases without stopping production.
Accordingly, the damage occurs when a Ransomware strikes.
22 percent of the German companies concerned reported loss of revenue from Ransomware, 13 percent even had to stop business completely, in one case people were at risk of life.
In Germany, many hospitals were already victims of attacks, whose patients can be acutely threatened by the loss of medical records.
"We always say to the victims, 'Don't pay, you only promote the problem,' explains Kleczynski.
However, 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay get their data back.
For managers, it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpetrators given the downtime in the operation.
The hackers, in turn, know this and try everything to build a good reputation.
In a recent study, F-Secure security researchers have investigated the user interfaces and contact with the extortioners and come to the conclusion: The perpetrators are actually trying to build up a kind of customer service to take more money.
They explain to their victims via chat how they can pay via Bitcoin, set up free-access support websites or decrypt any other example files.
And if private individuals are redeemed after payments of a few hundred euros, companies have to negotiate hard and pay five-digit sums to get their data back unencrypted.
Given the potentially high and relatively riskless gains from the Ransomware extortion, the hackers are becoming more and more professional and share the work, explains security expert Chester Wisniewski of the antivirus provider Sophos: "An individual person can write a Ransomware about within a week."
However, it is more likely that these are three or four persons.
The programmers then sell their malicious software in the form of a software builder to the actual extortioners.
The previous malware kits were created by buying the malware itself, consulting and additional tools for a unique, fixed price between $1,000 and $10,000.
"A customization tool is included in the delivery so that smaller configurations, appearances and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.
The extortioners then seek further hackers to spread the freshly purchased software among the victims.
We live in a service industry.
So you log into one of the forums in the underground, buys the set from a criminal and commissions another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.
The payment is made per infected computer.
"Of course, the criminals then order spammers with the spread," explains Wisniewski.
The risk of Ransomware is now known to many companies that better secure their data.
Over 50 percent of company IT managers in the malwarebytes survey rely on being able to defend Ransomware using file backups and scanner software.
Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.
"If the encryption of data alone is no longer a sufficient threat to successful digestion, the perpetrators are threatening the release of sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations," explains Malwarebytes Chief Marcin Kleczynski.
Thus, depending on the type of data, the damage potential is still much higher than before.
In future, the perpetrators could also take on board completely new goals on the Internet of Things.
At the hacker conference Defcon, security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the Internet under their control.
In the middle of winter, the release of such a blocked heating could be worth a ransom to some victims.
If the perpetrators then block an entire production road in a factory instead of heating in the future, Ransomware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0.
One for all cases
HONDA HR-V is flexible and everyday
In the small HR-V Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupé and also the versatility of a minivan.
The HR-V, which was designed on the same new platform as the new jazz, sounds rather overcharged, actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life.
Although the HR-V is only 1.60 m high rather small, the passengers have a lot of space in the first row as well as in the fund, it doesn't seem tight at all.
The materials of the interior are well processed and seem pleasant, only the cockpit top falls slightly down there.
The HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles in the storage room.
There is not only a trunk room of 453 l at elevated and 1026 l at folded backrests available, but there are the "Magic Seats".
This is less magical than it sounds: The back bench seats can be folded up like a cinema chair and thus provide storage space that is 1.24 m high from the floor to the ceiling.
The trunk can be loaded well, but the loading height at 650 mm is slightly higher than the corresponding Peugeot 2008.
The 1,6-l diesel with 88 kW/120 hp tested accelerates the HR-V very forcefully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.
He should, however, do a little bit quieter.
Enjoys the daily consumption of 4.7 l/100 km.
There is another motorization: a 1.5 l gasoline with 96 kW/130 hp.
An all-wheel drive is not offered.
The driving behaviour is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort.
However, the steering should be a little more direct.
The equipment leaves no request in the tested top variant "Executive".
Safety systems include the City emergency brake assist (working up to Tempo 32), the collision warning system and the track retention assistant.
The collision warner is sometimes irritated because he values many obstacles as "coming objects".
The remote light assistant works very reliably.
And the intelligent speed controller reacts to the traffic sign identification and threatens the speed as needed.
The full connectivity, however, is only available for the top equipment: 7-inch touchscreen, navi, app integration and more.
Two USB and one HDMI jacks are under the armrest and are therefore a bit incomprehensible to achieve.
The around 29000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are all right.
If you don't want to invest so much, you will receive the gasoline from 20000 euros, the diesel from 23000 euros.
The engines meet the Euro-6 emission standard.
With the HR-V, Honda offers a versatile and everyday car.
Airline is not liable: Fall on passenger bridge
An airline is not liable for the overthrow of a passenger on the passenger bridge.
The Oberlandesgericht Düsseldorf (Az.: 18 U 124/14) argued that liability is only possible in the event of dangers typical of air transport.
The plaintiff had broken a kneecap at the crash.
However, the accident could have happened anywhere - it was a general risk of life, the court said.
The airline didn't have to pay the man any compensation.
Disease: When does the organizer pay?
Sick holidaymakers get money back after their journey only when the cause of the illness is undoubtedly found in the hotel.
But that is only the case if more than ten percent of the guests have proven to show the same symptoms.
In the negotiated case, a family was severely affected by diarrhoea and vomiting on the second day of their Turkish leave.
She spent almost the whole vacation in the room.
Their illness led the vacationers back to a defective sewage treatment plant, which allegedly had polluted the seawater.
The family felt that the journey was thus defective - and complained against the organizer.
The plaintiffs had no success in court.
Although the sewage treatment plant was in fact defective.
However, the organizer only learned about it shortly before the plaintiffs left.
He had to assume that the sea water was fine by then.
So he did not violate his information obligations, according to the judgment.
No contaminants were found in the water samples.
The illness of several hotel guests - possibly through infection among themselves - is a general risk of life.
Of 691 guests only 38 were ill.
De Maizière said that after the acts of violence committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ansbach in July, many people were concerned about further attacks.
At the same time, the state had to respond to terror threats.
Our country will not respond to the violence of the perpetrators with hatred and division.
We won't like this triumph to the terrorists.
If criminals had to leave the country more quickly, this would increase security and also strengthen the support of the population for refugee policy.
De Maizière wants to achieve the implementation of the proposals up to the 2017 Bundestag elections.
He also announced further strengthening of the security forces, "in the medium four-digit order over several years".
Sympathy advertising for terrorism must be punished again.
Video surveillance is to be improved, arms law is being revised in such a way as to make the purchase of weapons on the Internet more difficult.
The most recently discussed duty of silence for doctors is to be observed according to the words of de Maizière.
However, in dialogue with the medical profession, he wants to look for solutions to reduce the risk to citizens, he said with a view to, for example, mental indifference.
In order to counteract the radicalisation of refugees, the Minister considers that better social care is necessary.
Teachers should be better prepared for dealing with traumatized people.
To persecute criminals in specific areas of the Internet (Darknet), de Maizière plans to use hidden investigators.
SPD Chief Gabriel said, "The SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to increase security."
It was important that the Minister of the Interior made a clear statement against actionism.
"This was an earlash for the sharpeners in the CDU/CSU," said Gabriel to the newspapers of the Funke Mediengruppe (Friday).
De Maizière had rejected calls from the Union after a Burka ban and the abolition of double nationality before.
A general ban on full veiling, he considered constitutionally problematic.
You can't forbid everything you refuse, and I refuse to carry the Burka.
Rules can be discussed, for example, in road traffic or in court for witnesses.
Green Chief Simone Peter suggested to the Minister that he would simulate with ever-new anti-terror packages the action force and ability to act.
Left party manager Bernd Riexinger said: "Flotty sayings and aggravating the right of residence no longer bring security to people in this country".
Better traffic flow on the motorway carrier
It regularly stands on the bypass road - here is a picture of November.
But this is to be changed: the right-hand turnout is to be extended.
This is a good news for all drivers who are standing in traffic on the surrounding road every night in a jam when they drive over the motorway (A 43).
The country's road construction company extends the right turnout track by 700 meters in the area between Hammer Straße and Weseler Straße on Tuesday and Wednesday (16/17 August).
Motorists can then paddle directly from the Hammer Road to the right.
The great advantage: the traffic splits up early, thus improving the overall run on the bus section of the federal road 51.
The idea with the extended exit had the CDU faction in the district representation of Münster-West.
The roadway narrowing on the delivery system is especially annoying for drivers between 17 and 19 o'clock.
On working days, the back standing reaches to the bridge over the Albersloher road and sometimes beyond.
The needle tube on the B 51 is due shortly before the exit Weseler Straße.
From here, the traffic is only intrigued by the motorway bridge.
The second track had to be rebuilt well four quarters years ago.
The reason: Static calculations had revealed that the bridge no longer had the required carrying capacity to take two-track traffic, in particular heavy load.
How long this congestion and the associated day-to-day stagnation will last can the responsible state operation not say.
However, it is possible to expect years: because the bridge has an official remaining useful time up to the year 2034.
For the extension of the right turn-off track, the country company has consciously chosen the less busy time in school holidays because of the possibility of disability.
The traffic is occasionally passed by the construction site on Tuesday and Wednesday.
Intercultural Travel: Cultural Offers for Schools
The international class of the forest school attended the play "The Invisible House".
The club Nima's and the Young Theater are planning a music project now.
The Nima's association enables young people with migration and refugee backgrounds to visit cultural institutions in Münster.
The "Class International" of the Waldschule Kinderhaus has visited a performance of the award-winning piece "The Invisible House" of the Young Theater Münster.
In the context of the "Intercultural Journey" initiated by Nima's association, 19 students from eleven to 15 years of age attended the production in the small house.
Since the beginning of the year, the association, which has set itself the goal of cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee backgrounds, offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster as part of this project.
Most of the students in the class had come to Münster from Afghanistan, Iran, Serbia and Syria between September 2015 and March 2016 and speak little German.
Thanks to the choreographies, the scenical images and video animations, they were able to follow the course of action, according to the press release of the Young Theater Münster.
The association Nima's, founded by Dr. Tannaz Westerberg from Talgel, and the Young Theater will work together in the next season as part of a music theatre project.
From October to December, young people between 14 and 20 years of age will have the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the fields of singing, dance, acting and music, with and without escape and migration background.
Offers for children and families in the field of play and theatrical language communication are in the planning.
The Intercultural Journey project continues.
In view of the increased number of refugees, the association expects many classes to participate.
Rain instead of starlings: hope for weather improvement
The weather has made the star-scrapers in the southwest of Germany a strike on Friday night - but there is still hope.
The night was badly suited for clouds and rain to observe the celestial spectacle, said the chairman of the Observatory Welzheim, Hans-Ulrich Keller, on Friday morning.
Our hope is on Saturday night.
The weather is supposed to be good, then we'll see a lot of starlings in the sky.
The star scales are Persians, which are among the fastest star screws at 26,000 kilometers per hour.
They have their name because they seem to come from the constellation Perseus that rises in the northeast.
Relaxed night: Tips for Sleep Disorders
In the evening you roll around forever, at night you lie awake for hours, in the morning there is no longer any sleep to think about in the morning before the alarm bell.
It's anything but relaxing.
After all, you have such problems in good company: According to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults have sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep often or permanently than not.
How do sleep problems or sleep disorders appear?
There are several forms of sleep disorders, and there can be many causes behind them, emphasizes Hans-Günter Weess, board member of the German Society for Sleep Research and Sleep Medicine.
What you understand by land, however, is the insomnia, i.e. a sleep disorder.
Especially sleeping through do many people feel unsatisfactory or inadequate," says Jens Wagenknecht, Executive Board member in the German Association of House Doctors with practice in Varel, Lower Saxony.
What about sleep disorders?
The causes of sleep disorders are complex.
Behind it can include organic, psychological or behavioural factors, but also medications.
Sleep disorder is not uncommonly expressed as another condition.
"Very early awakening is common especially in the case of depression," says Weess.
And it can be that different factors depend on each other.
For example, if you have a tape disk incident, you may find it bad, wake up every two to three hours, and perhaps start to grumble about everyday problems and care, then Weess gives you an example.
This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.
From when should you have trouble sleeping to the doctor?
If you do not sleep well in at least three nights a week for a period of one month and are impaired on the day, go to the doctor, advises weeds.
The impairment may look quite different: one is depressed, tired, unsleeping, has difficulties with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical discomforts such as stomach or headache.
In order to alleviate sleep disorders, it is important to identify their causes.
Treatment options include behavioral changes, cognitive behavioral therapy or even medications - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks.
There is hardly any doctor in sleep in Germany, emphasizes Prof. Ingo Fietze, Head of the Interdisciplinary Sleep Medicine Center of the Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin.
Therefore, in case of sleeping problems, you should first turn to the doctor, counsels Weess.
It can explain with investigations whether the problems have a physical cause.
Who should go to the dormitory, and what happens there?
For example, doctors advise on snoring with atemaussezers, on sick day fatigue, sleepwalkers, or if you do not find the cause of sleep disorders, says Fietze.
You really don't have to prepare for the investigation.
You should spend the day normally.
"Just don't sleep at lunch," says Fietze.
After cabling you go to bed at his normal time.
In addition to the electrodes on the body you wear a nose goggle, a chest strap and a feeler on your finger.
In addition, a camera on the ceiling records the sleeping end.
How can those affected deal with the problems?
There are quite a lot of screws you can put on for a better sleep.
Weeß counts on: Regular bedtime and bedtime, not too long in bed, not sleeping on the day, not watching for sleep, not avoiding alcohol and not looking at the clock at night - then you start to count immediately, and this is completely unfavorable.
What the jungle camp has to do with missing medals in swimming
The former German swimmer Markus Deibler has spoken on Facebook to disappoint the DSV team at Olympis.
In December 2014, he made his first gold debut at the Doha World Short Track Championships and made his first world record at the same time.
Now, the former DSV athlete Markus Deibler has made himself protective via Facebook against his former teammates in criticism.
"In a country where an Olympic champion gets 20,000€ prize and a jungle king 150,000€ nobody should wonder about missing medals," wrote the 26-year-old on his Facebook page on Friday night.
The conveying system in swimming was bad, but the doping controls were very good.
We cannot therefore compete with countries that promote a great deal and do not look closely at the issue of doping or even operate it.
"I'm not saying that controls should be stopped here," he continued.
If he wanted to start a comeback, Deibler would have to be reported nine months before his first launch of the National Anti-Doping Agency Germany (NADA).
The same is the case with countries.
"If it is not possible to control WADA/FINA independent controllers a certain time before WM/OS, it is not allowed to take part," calls the Hamburger, who now operates an ice-cream.
Airport: Baggage robberies arrested
Professional Diebe at Düsseldorf Airport
On Thursday, two women and two men between the ages of 50 and 61 were arrested by the Düsseldorf police.
As gangs, the suspects had committed several bag and luggage thefts.
At 9:30 p.m., civil officials in the area of Düsseldorf Airport recognized a band known to the policemen from past theft.
The two women and two men had committed several crimes since mid-July of this year and had been committed jointly, part-time and particularly professional.
The specialists of the Criminal Commissariat 34 are able to prove four acts to the thieves, who had specifically come to Germany to commit crimes.
They had taken over 15,000 euros in total.
Altbauten, a few lindenbäumchen, in between still a remnant of cobblestone pavements: Rigaer Straße in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not seem like this at first sight, but the police are among the "dangerous places" of the city.
Walk along the street from east to west, you pass playgrounds, a freshly painted kindergarten and a organic shop.
Someone sprayed at the facade of a grey house.
Opposite to a Lidl, which is to be demolished soon, is already being built: until 2017, a house with high windows and 133 new rental apartments will be built here.
In recent weeks, however, articles on this "trouble district", as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain calls, are best illustrated with burning cars.
Reason is the house with number 94: Once occupied, the residents now have leases, but on the ground floor are still occupied spaces and are used for events.
Since the beginning of the year, especially the Berlin interior senator Henkel had repeatedly advocated a tough police action against the project, called the area "No-Go-Zone" for police officers and 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.
After the premises on the ground floor, the Katterschmiede, had been cleared with 300 police officers on June 22, the police patrolled official statements for three weeks with 30 to 40 officials and three local team cars, blocked parts of the street and stopped visitors from entering the house with number 94.
Meanwhile, on behalf of the unknown houseowners, construction workers renovated the rooms.
On July 13th, a Berlin administrative court decided that the room had been illegal, and one day later, police and construction workers went off under the cheer of sympathizers and residents.
This summer afternoon the road works peacefully: parents go walking with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others talk about late.
In the immediate vicinity of the house projects are a primary school and kindergartens.
Left violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in Kiez since 1999, and Jana*, who brings up three children here, are especially generous by the police presence.
With the residents of the house projects, they share the concern about increasing rents and gentrification.
It doesn't sound like a kiez who wanted police protection from vandalizing left.
The grave, which the Berlin inner senator and the police open between housekeepers and their neighbors, does not exist.
Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working-class district, which today also has a low average income and high risk of poverty compared to the rest of the city.
In 1990, numerous houses in the former GDR were occupied, including almost the whole of Mainzer Street near Riga. In 1990, many houses were occupied in the former GDR.
While the Mainzers had been cleared in a real street battle under a large police charge, many of the projects in Riga were legalized and are sometimes still inhabited by the people they had occupied 26 years ago.
At the same time, the district has become increasingly magnetic for tourists and pollinators from all over the world in recent years: with them inhabitants from GDR times and former houseowners are now sharing their Kiez.
This is also evident in the rentals, which have increased by almost 60 percent since 2009 at new rentals.
Many of the new buildings in the Riga are attacked as symbols for this development: one recognizes them on thrown discs or freshly painted facades, which have been thrown with coloured bags.
No other road was so often mentioned this year along with the words "left autonomous violence".
One reason why not all neighbours view this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: according to statistics, crimes such as physical injury are almost exclusively against policemen.
Most of the crimes involve damage to property, which tends to meet the newly built and newly renovated houses.
For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in a rental house next to the controversial 94 years, there can be no uncertainty.
As for violence, it is daunting: The people in 94 are their neighbors, who have certainly not been.
Also, the famous burning cars have not given it directly in the Rigas anymore.
For the studied architect her street is not a criminal focus, on the contrary: "Here you help each other, live together on the street and get more from each other than elsewhere".
New builders are consciously drawn to Riga street - and remained.
Therefore, it was also so important to her that the residents got back to their streets: from the police, the politics and the media, all of which suddenly claimed the high level of interpretation over the district in July.
However, in the eyes of women living in the area such as Neugebauer, the road continues to be taken away: by sightless new buildings in former buildings that drive the old inhabitants away.
"These are, in the end, condos that are not interesting for many people here - rather, people who are not so well accommodated here," she says.
"I absolutely cannot approve of violence and destruction."
But what if someone never listens to you?
There is frustration on all sides, including the police and the residents.
Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding for those who are attracted to color bombs: The house projects and the left scene were part of Kiez.
Anyone who moves should be aware of this - just as someone who moves into a pub district can complain badly about noise there.

Urbach: Annika Deuschle is a new refugee officer
Annika Deuschle is the contact person in terms of integration and organizer.
She is also a social worker on the ground.
Since July, Annika Deuschle has been the refugee officer for Urbach.
The social educator supports the management team around Achim Grockenberger.
She sees herself as a contact partner for all stakeholders: refugees, working group for refugee assistance, administration, authorities and anyone else involved.
Regine customer from the work group indicates that the honorary staff are more than grateful that Deuschle is now there, the egglegging wool milk sauce, which has a problem above all.
For example, some, less scoffing than rather referring to the large number of desired areas of activity, had meant that the administration wanted to sign the office.
An administrative skill was sought with a talent for languages and people, associated with a long-standing experience in social work, just an egglegging wool milk sauce.
But administrative work is not their central area, says Annika Deuschle.
Above all, it is about organization, working with people on the ground and also behind the scenes and networking.
The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.
She has a 50 per cent salary for three years.
"It was high time," says Regine Kunden, who supports Annika Deuschle's honorary and major actors.
There are big and small problems, organizational, human and understanding problems.
New containers will soon be standing in the water road
It has been a serious problem for some time to find homes for the connexion refugees who have been recognized.
The municipalities are responsible for the connection accommodation.
They must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented homes.
The costs of the construction, rental or renovation of these properties must be borne by the municipalities themselves.
The responsibility shifts from the Landratsamt to the municipality and the job centre.
Problem: There are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.
The search has been very difficult for some time.
De facto the administration does not find private apartments.
It doesn't work until now, according to Deuschle, depending on private homes.
Therefore, community apartments need to be refurbished, as it says so beautifully.
So soon new containers will be set up in the water road.
But it is not done only with apartments.
Perspective is the keyword, Regine Kunden and Annika Deuschle agree.
In addition to a permanent stay, there are traineeships, training places, school places, one-euro jobs and support activities for refugees and migrants who need to be found or established.
"More places would be good," says Regine customer.
Many work in the building yard or help housekeepers, do non-profit work - and this is motivated and very tidy, as Annika Deuschle reports.
It hopes that work for the community will lead to a positive outcome.
That's "no employment therapy."
Activity, however, does not mean just work.
The day needs a firm structure, say Deustle and customer.
People should develop a sense of belonging.
So it takes offers such as sports, contacts with locals and, above all, language courses.
Professional courses are nice.
So here you also jump in administration and honorary.
It is central that the refugees get the feeling that they were wanted and welcome in Germany.
The length of the procedure was a problem.
They must explain to the refugees that it takes just now and that they can bridge time meaningfully, for example with language courses.
If you ever develop the feeling, you can't help anyone in Urbach, you can't work and you're useless, you'll never get involved.
The clear majority was motivated.
But there are also problems, says customer honestly, "people who don't have anything to do with it." The work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always to motivate others.
All of this was a "mammute task".
A difficult question: are the two afraid of radicalization, even in a small community like Urbach, after recent incidents?
"No," says Regine customer very clearly, "what some might call naive." A residual risk can and would not exclude them.
However, the helpers are sensitized.
These incidents were also the subject of refugees.
They'd be afraid that the assassins would totally call them in.
"They want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regine Kund.
Many would like to stay in Urbach.
Therefore, the main and honorary officials on site and in the region must keep an eye on activities.
They always have in the background that soon a new bump of refugees and migrants could come to Urbach.
Does Germany need an upper limit?
To answer this question clearly, politics is shirking.
Actually, it's unfair to put them on the spot.
"We haven't arrived in Urbach where we were able to go," says Annika Deustle.
No new refugees, that would relax the situation.
Regine customer also makes it clear that the Urbachers have already been burdened out with integrating the people of the past reasonably.
These are currently around 100 people, mostly young men.
But when people are in need, you have to help them, both women agree.
The political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers.
Schorndorf: Intruders searched with helicopter
The police helicopter flew out of various areas for about an hour - unsuccessfully.
On Friday morning, around 8.50 a.m., two unknown men were forced into an apartment in a multifamily house in Lindenweg.
The resident surprised the two and beat the prisoners into flight.
The two men were about 1.65 to 1.70 meters tall, probably masked, both wore bluejeans and black hoodows.
They fled in the city center.
The police used several strip crews as well as a police chopper.
The flag went off without success.
Anytime before the act, the unknowns fell near the apartment or when they fled.
