A Republican strategy to counter the re-election of Obama
The Republican leaders justify their policy with the need to combat electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Center considers the latter to be a myth, confirming that election fraud in the United States is less than the number of people killed by lightning.
By the way, Republican lawyers reported only 300 cases of electoral fraud in 10 years in the United States.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on the vote.
In this sense, these measures partially undermine the democratic system of the United States.
In contrast to Canada, the US states are responsible for the conduct of the elections in the individual states.
In this sense, the majority of American governments have announced new laws since 2009 which make the registration procedure difficult.
After the November 2010 elections, this phenomenon has gained in importance, with 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
As a result, 180 draft laws were introduced in 2011 alone, limiting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states.
The new electoral laws require voters to present a photo ID and proof of US citizenship.
Moreover, these laws also reduce the time-limits for early voting, declare the right invalid to register as voters on the day of the election, and refer citizens to the right to vote for which a legal act is available.
Prior to the 2006 elections, no US Member State requested voters to present a photo ID card.
Indiana was the first state to make such a claim.
The United States Supreme Court confirmed the constitutionality of the law of Indiana in 2008.
The Republican authorities are hurrying to extend this practice to other States.
Over the last two years, they have been promoting legislation in 34 states that force voters to present a photo ID.
It is important to note that, unlike Quebec, US citizens do not have a universal ID card like the health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of US citizens, i.e. 21 million eligible persons, do not possess a photo ID issued by a government authority of their state.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such a certificate.
However, often more than a hundred dollars are to be paid to obtain the necessary ID card.
Young people, minorities and people with low incomes are disproportionately affected by the new constraints.
Indeed, 25% of African Americans, 15% of people with income less than $35,000, 18% of citizens over 65 years and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 years of age do not have the necessary photo ID.
That's enough.
The students who are regarded as voters, who increase their vote for democratic candidates, are not allowed to use their photo ID issued by their institution in several countries.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of fishing or hunting associations who choose more for the Republican side to use the cards issued by these associations for elections.
Before 2004, no state called for a proof of citizenship for the election.
Arizona was the first state to introduce such a claim.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws calling on voters to prove their US citizenship.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting the Hispanic votes.
It is obvious that two out of three Hispanic voters prefer the democratic party.
In addition, Republican legislators in 2011 promoted laws in eight states that abolished the registration of voters on the election day.
In addition, you have limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to those voters who wish to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, campaigns to register voters contributed to the 2004 general elections to register some 10 million citizens.
The measures adopted since 2009 have reduced the proportion of new voters' registration by 17% compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican legislators have passed laws in five further states aimed at shortening the period for early voting.
For example, in the 2008 general elections in Florida 33% of the voters who chose in advance were African-Americans, although they make up only 13% of the voters of the state.
The same applies to the Hispanic population.
The latter represented only 11% of the voters, but 24% of the citizens who chose in advance.
In contrast, the whites, representing 76% of the voters, represented only 46% of the voters who chose in advance.
Of course, democratic legislators and their supporters have strongly opposed the adoption of laws restricting the registration of voters.
Several draft laws were blocked by the vetos of democratic governors.
The US Attorney General has intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
They could partially limit the damage.
For example, only 16 of the 34 states have passed laws requiring the presentation of a photo ID.
However, the newly introduced rules in 2012 will undoubtedly make the exercise of the right to vote difficult.
The democratic critics advocate the party political nature of the passed laws and see in them as a clear goal the influence of the results in the 2012 decisive states.
A 2011 report from the Brennan Center shows that those states that have passed these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes required by the electoral panel to win the presidency.
It is too early to confirm with certainty that these legislative changes to the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on the vote.
In this sense, these measures partially undermine the democratic system of the United States.
Prostatic seed detection: should the test be performed or not?
In fact, the PSA test shows sometimes erroneous results, with false negative or false positive results that lead to unnecessary medical interventions.
This leads to greater hesitation on the part of the already undecided men for carrying out early detection tests.
Should the test be done or not?
We've got the opinion of two specialists.
In the studies conducted in the USA, there were numerous disruptive factors between control groups, making it difficult to interpret these data and to make clear recommendations.
A further study, this time from Europe, concluded that there is a difference in the mortality of patients with and without early recognition.
This study has also shown that if no early detection has been performed, the likelihood of metastases occurring after 12 years is 30 to 40% higher.
Therefore, I recommend the test from 50 years of age or 40 years, if you have a direct relative who has already been infected with prostate cancer.
In men of African-American origin there is also a higher risk.
The most important thing is to make the right decision as soon as a cancer has been diagnosed.
There are cancers that are aggressive and others that are indolent.
The patient must really understand the extent of the risk of his cancer by showing the possible options in which prostate cancer can remain untreated if it does not affect the quality of life in the long term, and in these cases it is more likely to be actively monitored.
Today, many men in whom cancer has been recognized do not receive treatment because their cancer is not aggressive and does not pose a threat to their lives.
They are suggested to be actively monitored and offered treatment when the disease progresses.
With increasing accuracy, the criteria for deciding who should be treated and who should not be.
That is why I still recommend carrying out the test.
The most important thing, however, is to talk to your doctor to determine whether or not he should be performed.
In cooperation with the international Society for Urology, Movember has developed an instrument that allows it to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of the PSA test.

Prevention of the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle cure for cancer.
Despite the progress made in research, adopting a healthy way of life remains the best way to reduce the risk of being ill with it.
It is estimated that 30% of cancers could be prevented if all would eat well and move sufficiently.
"If there were no more smokers, this value would increase to at least 50%," says André Beaulieu, spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
However, around 10% of cancer is expected to be caused by inheritance.
Several also remain completely unexplained.
The fight against tobacco addiction remains a priority for the Canadian cancer society, despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Smoking is responsible for 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for several other cancers.
It greatly harms the health of people.
"Today there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec", regrets the speaker André Beaulieu.
Encouraging data: 10 years after the cigarette release, the risk of dying of cancer is reduced by half.
The weight
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, obesity and obesity also promote the outbreak of the disease.
They appear to increase the risk of breast, Grimma, gastrointestinal, pancreatic, abdominal and uterine cancer.
"Research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against Grimmdam cancer," he adds.
The diet
The organization also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In too large a lot, it increases the risk of developing a cancer of a Grimm or of a mast.
Sausages should also be avoided.
The preservation of meat by smoking, drying or salting may lead to the formation of carcinogens.
"The latter can damage the body cells and lead to the development of cancer," he explains.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have investigated the relationship between vitamin additives and cancer.
However, their investigations are not conclusive at the moment.
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, the studies on vitamin E are contradictory.
While one study has found that the risk of prostate cancer has been reduced, another has shown an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has not yet been clearly demonstrated.
In addition, Mr Beaulieu stressed the importance of talking to his doctor about his concerns and his family preoccupation.
"The conduct of an early detection test does not lead to cancer."
The Higgs Boson analyzed
The announcement of the probable discovery of the Higgs boson has caused a certain appearance last summer, and this for good reason.
In fact, it is believed that this boson is involved in nothing less than the mechanism responsible for the mass of all objects in the universe.
And finally, it is the last particle whose existence is predicted by the standard model - our best or "at least false" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter - but has not yet been empirically observed.
But for the physicists, it's not completely certain that it's really the Higgs.
Without the shadow of doubt, we know that we have a real new particle, and that it is very similar to the standard model called Higgs Boson.
In addition, this seems to be confirmed by new data presented this week at a major physics conference in Kyoto, but there is still no data to be absolutely sure about it.
Nevertheless, we assume that this is actually the Higgs, since there seems to be only a small risk of being deceived, and let us look at what it is about.
There is a mandatory law in this world that does not allow two objects to be present in the same place at the same time.
It is not possible to violate this rule - and try it not too strong as you will hurt yourself.
Because even if particle physics is a really strange world, it turns out that such a law also applies to them: the Pauli exclusion principle, which means that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time, if they are in the same "quantity state", where this "state" consists largely of some of their characteristics.
From this the physicists divide the particles into two categories.
In one corner there are the good citizens who are called Fermione and who obey the Pauli principle in a similar way.
And in the other, the Bosons, a bad band of anarchists, who are nothing sacred, do not in any case move this principle, which means that they can actually be in the same place at the same time.
These bosons are divided into two groups according to the website The Particle Adventure of the Berkeley laboratories (which by the way is absolutely amazing): the mesons that we will not treat here and the "powder particles", through which the great forces of nature spread and with which the Higgs boson would somehow be related.
But it must be stressed here that these bosons are not all such exotic creatures as you might think.
If you are able to read this chronicle, then only thanks to a boson of exceptional banality: the photon or the "light particle", which is the "bote" of the electromagnetic force.
If a particle speeds up with an electric charge or changes direction, the electromagnetic field is "disturbed" exactly at this place, like a pebble thrown into a pond.
This "disruption" creates an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon and thus one of the bosons "brains of force".
More Stable Field
The same applies to the Higgs Boson, with the difference that another field, the Higgs field, must be "disturbed" to show this Boson.
However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the pathogen must reach very high energies, a little comparable to a frozen pond whose surface could only be torn by a very large rock.
That's why a huge particle accelerator like the CERN is needed - the Large Hadron Collider is a ring of 27 km! - to achieve such energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again helpful in explaining the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
In fact, they are not all particles and not all materials interacting with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do this, but others do not - for example, a sheet of paper would never keep itself on the fridge.
And equally, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those who do have a mass, while the others (as well as the photos) have no mass.
For what can all these research be "good", Mrs. Plamondon asks?
For science, they are used to verify the standard model (SM), and they also enable physicists to investigate carefully all deviations between the observations and the predictions of the SM.
By the way, there are numerous physicists who hope that such deviations will be found, as the slightest difference could open a door to a "new physics" and stop some holes in the model.
One has to say that the latter still has great defects, as it does not explain the gravity (ups!) and the dark matter that makes up about 80% of the material of the universe (new ups!).
However, such deviations have not yet been found at CERN.
Effects
The impact of these research on the general population is more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there was no such thing.
By the way, in the early 1960s, the pioneers of the laser in the Bell labs did not suspect that their works would trigger such a revolution.
They saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle - who worked in the Bell Labs, in which the laser was invented in the 1960s, and who himself developed the first permanent laser (the first were pulses) in 1962 - has already said that the laser was regarded at the beginning as a "laboratory machine".
Imagine...
In addition, applications can also result from all the instruments that surround research.
For example, in 1969, Willard Boyle developed a small light sensor during his work in the optics.
Although it was not the original purpose, this sensor today serves all digital cameras worldwide as an "eye" and has introduced the Nobel Prize for Physics to him in 2009.
Of course, this does not mean that the activities of the LHC will inevitably change our lives, but it means that you really can never know...
Palliative Care - the best way to die...
Quebec recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life with its committee on "Deaths in Dignity".
The debate will have to be resumed shortly, although a draft law will be prepared.
However, much remains to be done in this important topic.
Le Devoir has tried to look at this in more detail.
A few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that tormented him had left him a period of two years.
"They gave me five years to live, I made seven years," he said half-heartedly, lying in his bed in the house of Palliative Care Victor Gadbois in Beloeil, where he arrived the day before.
"However, it's always a shock, you can't be prepared for it," he says.
The disease makes her work: an immeasurable weakness prevents him from going to the toilet alone and even eating himself.
Sitting at the table in front of a delicious lunch, he willingly resigned to help himself with the food.
Courageously, he even manages to smile and talk to the strangers who are busy around him, bring him his medication, and offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My biggest wish is to heal my diarrhea, as this is humiliating," he says.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this evil.
"In the course of our lives, we learn that a man is peeping in the standing," says Pierre Brodeur, psychologist at Victor-Gadbois.
Returning to the childhood phase is unacceptable humiliation for certain people.
"This depends on the person's ability", taking a step back, he notes.
In the view of several people working in palliative care, major events take place in the midst of these retreats.
The patients who are assigned to the home for Palliative Care Victor Gadbois all suffer from cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this stage, they will no longer be overwhelmed by the doctors and nurses who care for them with so-called "healing" care.
For Mrs. A., 89 years, the worst fear is to die "consciously and through suffocation".
But the illness really made me know my children.
"I have good children," she adds.
"I don't have any more wishes in life," she says, before she accepts putting on a mask that helps her breathe.
She is still expecting her son's last visit from Italy in the next few days.
At the home Victor-Gadbois you can offer a group of voluntary body care and assistance in the taking of food.
Palliative care is used if there are no other options.
To make dying more pleasant.
In Quebec there is a bed for palliative care on 11,700 inhabitants.
That's very little if you consider that one day we'll all die.
Here life is continued under the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the home.
Both at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
Depending on your wishes, you give the dying mouth care with Brandy or Pepsi.
Diabetic patients will no longer have to control their blood sugar levels.
And death is part of everyday life.
Last night we served Mr. X a beer that died in the course of the night.
This morning his son will drown out the beer at the feet of the deceased.
"We help relatives and patients alike," says Nathalie Savard, Director of Care.
At home Victor Gadbois is no day like the other.
In addition to an old man of 93 years, who enjoys the last family meeting in the courtyard and is well supported by his pillows, while in his honor, a young man of 36 years, surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two little children, dies tragically after he has tried everything to survive.
"For six months three to five beds have always been occupied with cancer patients less than 45 years old," says Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of the patients admitted to the home Victor Gadbois come from their residence, 47% come from the hospital.
The problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, i.e. to care to relieve the suffering of patients when the latter have reached the end stage of their life, both at home, in hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the Victor Gadbois home and the Society for Domestic Palliative Care in Montreal, specialize more or less exclusively in the care of cancer patients.
Just this great inadequacy in Quebec’s health care ensures that several doctors specialised in palliative care face the adoption of a law regulating death assistance and assisted suicide with concerns.
Since the month of October, a manifesto has been in circulation, signed by prominent personalities of palliative care such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe to demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Quebec health system is not powerful enough to ensure that everyone has a right to high-quality palliative care before accepting to go to death aid.
Recently, she says, I saw a patient who was 14 days of great pain in the emergency room without taking measures to relieve them.
I fear that patients only want to die because they do not receive adequate health care.
And at the same time, several oncologens treat their patients with fades to the last day, despite the worst predictions.
The chances of survival of Hélène Richard were minimal when she stopped a difficult chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was going to stop the treatment, she answered me that she regrets that I quit the fight, she told me.
However, she had told me that I was finished!
No omnipotent care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who have asked to die thank the nursing staff that it has not allowed this request after their pains have been eased by a team of palliative care.
However, it must be clearly stated that palliative care during pain treatment is not omnipotent.
According to Elsie Monereau, Head of Palliative Care of the Society of Home Palliative Care of the Montreal metropolitan area, 8% of patients do not speak of pain treatment.
Thus, at the very end of life, doctors often resort to the terminal sedation, which requires either sporadic or permanent intervention of the patient up to the time of his death.
We can no longer pretend that we do not perceive this side of suffering.
Patients without pain relief will be more and more likely to resort to this terminal sedation.
Patients whose pains are not eased all say the same sentence: "I want to die."
But that doesn't necessarily mean, "I want you to put me to sleep," but "I want my pain to be eased".
The implementation of this report was possible due to a journalism scholarship from Canadian health research institutes.
Real estate scandals in Quebec
Officials of the Road Construction Office, construction chief executives, political parties' money creators and specialists of the Italian Mafia tell every day what they know about a great "system" in which construction industry, officials, politicians, trade unionists and Mafioso are swept away.
An "industry" which was very expensive for Quebec's taxpayers, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It is strange how the system has broken down since drastic measures have been taken," said Jacques Duchesneau, Quebec MP and former director of Montreal Police.
The scandal was revealed by him on the basis of an in-depth investigation of the irregularities associated with the contracts for road construction in Quebec, which the Prime Minister at that time had only agreed reluctantly.
The "Duchesneau Report" established a direct link between industry, secret financing of parties and bribery of officials.
"Since the start of the investigation in 2010, he emphasises that "the Ministry of Transport alone had saved a billion dollars from the contracts," because some people used their instincts to get their share!
The Charbonneau Commission "has already brought two mayors down," he adds, hoping that you will succeed in "showing the tactics behind the individuals".
A 2011 established, permanent anti-corruption unit
The permanent anti-corruption unit set up in 2011 is also making great efforts with its troops to the government's auditors, investigators and analysts.
In addition, the police officers of the "Marteau-Truppe", which has since 2009 caused Montreal's "channelling cartel" to be more restrained in the artificial outburst of the contracts...
In recent weeks, she has conducted a series of house searches and has filed accusations of fraud and corruption against local authorities such as Frank Tampino and Richard Marcotte, the mayor of a suburb.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his office as mayor of Laval, the third largest city in Quebec.
He is suspected to have repeatedly received lubrication money in exchange for public contracts.
By the way, engineers of the Montreal Road Construction Office, as well as entrepreneurs of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambia, were explicitly accused.
The latter has aroused concern by explaining to the Commission the functioning of the "system" for the award of public contracts.
For several years he himself paid 3% of the value of the contracts received in Montreal to one of the brokers associated with the Mafia, who transferred the money to the Union Montreal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
In the 2000s, Mr. Zambia had his hand everywhere in play by giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially to the liberals who were in power at that time.
He also managed to organise an illegal procurement for former liberal vice-president Nathalie Normandeau.
sewerage contracts whose costs were artificially blown up by him
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked smoothly.
The former construction engineer Gilles Surprenant described this in detail before the Commission: in ten years he received gifts from the construction company, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants and ice hockey games, as well as bribes of 736,000 dollars in return for sewerage contracts whose costs he artificially blew up.
Other officials of the road construction office admitted that they were lubricated by artificially blowing up invoices with false additional benefits by 30-40%.
In addition, an organizer of the mayor's party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay of deliberately looking away over a shadow budget that filled his checkout with black money.
As a result of these revelations, Mr Tremblay resigned at the beginning of November, which plunged Montreal into a serious crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first Montreal MPs to call.
As mayor of the Rivière-des-Prairies district, in the east of the island, she resisted the sale of a municipal plot from 2010 that was purchased for 5 million dollars and sold for 1.6 million to builders in the booming real estate market.
70% Black Money in Election Campaigns
From the investigation, which is carried out in the end, she says that she is "drawing on a thread that allows the way the ants' system is working, to stop the evil and to bring the culprits to justice".
She says that the procedure is "painful but positive".
We are in the process of cleaning up the wounds, however, need only a unit of inquiry for Montreal, as well as a supervision to prevent the return of questionable practices.
How to clean.
Regular.
Jacques Duchesneau notes, on his part, that "often hundreds of millions of dollars have stolen", but, above all, is concerned about the role of "mandate carriers who are about the tactics in the picture" if they were not involved in the fraud!
Based on a share of 70% black money in financing the election campaigns in Quebec, he joked: "I was told that this was only a weak blow to reality."
The government of Quebec proposes to limit the donations made to parties to 100 dollars, according to which nothing would change the situation: "As long as election expenses are not strictly limited, black money will be in circulation in politics."
He recommends a complete revision of the system for the award of public contracts and the financing of the parties: "We cannot fall deeper; by going down the ground with courage, we can rebuild the house on a more solid basis with more controls and laws."
If this story damages the international reputation of Quebec and that of Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau asks those who laugh at taking a look at their own backyard...
"PSG is not the FC Barcelona!"
This season you have adopted a new size with PSG.
How do you explain this progress?
It can be explained by a personal insight, but also by the new dimension of the PSG.
Great players have come.
Every day I make progress on their side.
The technical staff also gave me a lot.
These elements encourage me to improve my game level every day.
And in a game, this is even easier.
In football everything is very fast.
But I'm not enthusiastic about it.
Since my beginnings in the center of the preparatory training of INF Clairefontaine up to my playing time at Saint-Etienne, I have always made progressive progress.
They thus take advantage of the competition introduced by Carlo Ancelotti...
The new arrivals of this summer are used to carrying out very high levels of games.
You also know that every training unit is decisive.
This leads to a player like me who has to offer forehead and give his best.
By the way, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot in terms of my playing position.
It is supported by co-trainers like Claude Makelelele, who played in the same position as I did.
Is Ancelotti the right person for the task?
Of course.
Ancelotti is a respected technician.
In Ligue 1 there is currently no comparable person, and he is one of the best trainers in Europe.
He looks back at a rich experience and has won many titles with respected clubs.
He was in contact with big players.
I think he'll win more titles in Paris.
In January I had a encouraging conversation with him.
At that time I had just recovered from a series of injuries.
The confidence that he has put in me is also an explanation of my achievements.
What do you think about the first part of the PSG season?
In Ligue 1, Lyon took us to the top rider's seat.
But we're lurking in ambush.
One of our most important goals is the Champions League: we have qualified for the eighth-final in this way.
What is the aim of the association in this competition?
We will try to get as far as possible.
From now on everything is possible.
However, we will have our word against very good European teams.
First of all, we want to become the first of our group before Porto, so that we can play the eighth-final back game as a home game.
Can the PSG become a major European association in the short term?
He already has the budget for...
In order to become a large European association, Paris must win the title and make a name for itself in the long term.
This is not the case today.
In financial terms, the PSG will provide the means for this project to take concrete forms.
Would it be a great failure not to win the title in Ligue 1, as this was the case in the last season?
Of course this would be a great disappointment.
This year it is really our heart to dismiss this title.
Last season we were close.
In May we were disappointed because we were strong enough to take the victory away.
We finished the season with a very strong performance.
We concluded with 79 points.
Normally you should be master with 79 points...
But another team, that of Montpellier, has achieved an even better season.
I think this year is the right one.
Even though the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are ringing the title, I believe we have the means to win him.
Do you think the media expect too much from the PSG?
In view of what has been invested and the players we have, it is normal that much is expected of us.
We fully accept that.
However, if we win at a home game against Troyes 4-0, and you still find something that you can throw at us, that is certainly a little frustrating.
People wonder what people are waiting for.
We could never win with 4-0 every weekend.
We're not Barcelona FC!
We're trying to set up a game concept.
A team builds up over time.
We have proven strength in the Champions League.
Consider Manchester City, an association that has not managed to qualify for the eighth final for two seasons, and which has also done huge expenses!
With regard to the invested sums, you were believed to have the game break with 15 points lead!
This was said to mean that our opponents and the French championship would be disregarded.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not good in the last season, were "boosted" by this new PSG.
This shows that the Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope that in the month of May we will be the smiling winner and tell us that we have finally won them despite all the difficulties.
The PSG seems to be entirely dependent on the performance of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
The better you talk about a "Zlatan addiction."
That means Ibrahimovic is powerful and shoots many gates.
That's why he came and he proves he's the star of Ligue One.
Wherever he played, he showed that he was a great player and a world star.
Within the team we respect both the player and the person.
He also respects the people who surround him.
What he has done is truly extraordinary.
This encourages the others to improve their game level.
Thiago Silva, one of the world’s best defenders, also enables all others to make progress.
How did you experience the 2012 EM with the French national team?
It's like a disappointment.
It was my heart to participate in this EM.
Unfortunately, my injury has prevented me from hitting out a bit of playing time.
I've seen things that I've been strengthened from there.
Today I manage to achieve good games in the national team.
This has been my hope since my baptism with the "Bleus".
From what has happened in Ukraine, we have drawn our teachings, and today we have to show exemplary behaviour.
What do you think about the first months of Didier Deshamps at the top of the "Bleus"?
He has achieved promising results.
We have a good position in the qualification group for the World Cup.
The national coach is strict, stands close to the players and appeals to victory.
As was Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to make a comparison.
Blanc had achieved his goal by qualifying us for the EM.
I hope Didier Deshamps will lead the "Bleus" to Brazil.
Is this a forced decision-making game in Spain on 16 October (1:1)?
This game has given us confidence.
Everyone used to work for everyone else.
Before this meeting in Spain, I have never experienced a similar game in my career.
With Bitcoin it is possible to pay and sell without bank
The opposite of the current monetary exchange on the basis of central banks, identified transactions and processing fees between the parties.
In addition, as often happens in these technologies, there is a political vision: the conviction that the current monetary system, designed by bank monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, the bitcoin invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) is both a virtual currency (but convertible into dollars, euro, etc.) and a protocol for safe exchange such as BitTorrent, which allows for the direct exchange of files.
With 15,000 computers on the network, some 200,000 transactions have already been recorded.
Some thousand websites accept Bitcoin as a donation or as a means of payment.
After the price of Bitcoin reached a peak of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, he fell five months later to 2 dollars before he recovered on about ten dollars today (the rates are listed on the bitcoincharts.com website).
Nothing particularly impressive compared to world trade in real currencies or financial products.
Nevertheless, the European Central Bank (ECB) has shown interest in this in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
It describes Bitcoin as "the virtual currency with the greatest success", "in competition with the dollar or euro" and "similar to the conventional currencies".
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currencies such as the "Credits" used to advance in a video game that you can win or buy through games (and sometimes even switch back).
The social network Facebook has also developed such a system.
However, trade is monitored and processed by a central authority each time.
With Bitcoin, all network nodes are simultaneously accountants, auditors, money issuers, buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users actually takes place between two e-mail addresses in the form of an e-mail.
With the difference that the user can choose a different address for each payment, which ensures the anonymity.
A series of related data transactions is electronically signed by a double encryption system.
In this way, the network can check the authenticity of the transaction.
The content of the file also makes it possible to ensure that the traded bitcoins are present in the public accounts, which are distributed throughout the network.
The crucial step is to enter this new transaction into this book.
This is done through a mathematical task that is started on the computers, with the winner, who is a kind of provisional central banker, having the privilege to add this additional line.
It is a crucible of the file, i.e. the conversion of a large file into a shorter and unique electronic fingerprint.
The computer "take" the new transaction and add a number to it before the whole thing is "cracked".
The goal is to find the number that gives a special fingerprint (many zeros at the beginning).
If this number has been found, the other nodes can effortlessly check if it is the right number.
The transaction is thus permanently linked to the chain of all other transactions, and any modification would change the fingerprint.
If one user wants to pay twice very quickly (less than 10 minutes) with the same money, only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network and the other would remain unconnected, as both have different fingerprints.
The computer that has solved the task gets 50 bitcoins.
In order to prevent inflation, this reward is regularly halved, probably before the end of 2012.
The bitcoins in circulation are thus limited to 21 million, but can be divided up to one hundred million pieces, leaving a certain margin of play...
In addition, the difficulty of the task with any improvement of the computing power is increased.
The life of the network has already had heights and depths.
The sites that provide Bitcoin services were attacked and the bitcoin deposits stolen.
"The used vulnerability does not concern the actual protocol," says Pierre Noyzat, who just introduced Paymium, which is a company for paying with real money and uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reports on the possibilities of money laundering through this anonymous service.
However, cash also shows these shortcomings.
Important actors like Wikipedia refuse donations of this kind.
They are accepted by others like the blog platform WordPress.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron from the Weizmann Institute in Israel analyzed the invoice and showed that almost 80% of the bitcoins are not in circulation.
In November, a "Mega Locks Sale" was launched.
"Three thousand dollars have been exchanged," says Jon Holmquist, who works for the company Coinabul, who converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noyzat, who is also the author of a book about this currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
Its Paytunia system corresponds to a credit card (with real money) or a contactless payment with a mobile phone, but uses Bitcoin to validate the transactions that are thus cheaper.
In addition, the holder manages his identity and can therefore remain anonymous.
The system can be easily implemented by dealers, and the latter do not need to install new terminals or computer programs.
You just have to specify an address that can be "photographed and recognized" by a phone, Pierre Nouzat, who assures that he has thousands of users.
It is a general trend in which hierarchical systems are reviewed in favour of more horizontal systems.
"It will take some time until bitcoin gets through, but 2013 could be a turning point," he predicted.
By the way, in its report, the ECB envisages re-evaluation of the various risks, today considered to be high, in the event of the success of this currency.
We're out of Afghanistan.
And after that?
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the USA are expected to follow at the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain the possession of its territory, and for the Afghan people to decide their future without expecting everything from us.
In particular, we have punished Afghan farmers by viewing them as terrorists.
And ourselves with our 88 killed soldiers, as well as the injured and wounded.
The Taliban consist of foreign extremists, former leaders who have fled to Pakistan, but often also of peasants who refuse armed foreign presence, as at the time of the Soviets.
They want to defend their centuries-old and archaic traditions, even though jihadists, Pakistani, Arabs, Uzbeken and Tajik have joined them.
Tolerated, sometimes supported by local insurgents, the latter will no longer be there when the Western countries become more discreet.
The French troops were removed from the base in Nijrab, which I had observed from a hill planted with almond trees, which was financed with the aid of French loans.
The truck and tank convoys that were flooded by helicopters have reached Kabul without being attacked.
There will be no more inflows of the Taliban in Kabul from the end of 2014.
Since its irresistible advance from 1994 to 1996, the conditions have changed.
At that time Kabul was empty and the country was overtaken by war because of the fights of the various intrusive groups.
Their takeover of power was then seen as a kind of liberation and return to security.
Afghan women have paid the price for obscurantism of the overwhelming farmers of the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation has not improved so far.
Former Mujaheddin, the Afghan government and the current Taliban have a common desire to keep women in a subordinate position.
The most important personalities of the anti-Soviet war have regained power in 2001.
They have turned into businessmakers by confiscating land from the government to sell it as a building land to refugees from Iran and Pakistan and thus benefited from the massive American subcontracting of sub-contracts.
Most of them were not involved in the fights themselves.
As I have heard in the campaigns, people want a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave the country, as were those who could take advantage of American grants: capital flight is considerable.
The young people are tired of the war and its ideologies.
During their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they have had contact with the modern world and enjoyed its benefits.
About 65% of the population is under 25; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, which is one-fifth of the total population.
In the cities the state schools are full of girls like boys.
These young people, who do not want to return to the obscurantism of the former parties or to the corruption of certain leaders, will have to provide jobs.
All, including the armed parties, are possessed by mobile phones; television with its Turkish series, which represent a modern world, is viewed everywhere.
An army is now in place.
Are the authorities under whose command it will be considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already trying to restore the militias in the province, which will withdraw from the power of central government.
Afghanistan, the country of the mountains with strong local identities should have benefited from a certain decentralisation on the example of the Western nations, but by abolishing the office of the Prime Minister, which existed since the Constitution of 1964, the US wanted to make it a centralized state with a strong presidential force.
President Karzaï does not want foreign controls, particularly on the April 2014 elections.
However, his country has been dependent on foreign aid for the 1950s and a long time before.
Industries have not been rebuilt, functional dams are not available and important irrigation systems have not been repaired.
Everything is imported; except for fruit and vegetables nothing is produced.
The private initiative is given priority.
In a country based on war for 30 years, a state control of infrastructure would have been necessary.
The rumor has been spread that Afghanistan owns immense land treasures.
This reinforces the impression that the Western countries were only on the ground to empower themselves to do so.
Without energy to process the iron ore on site, or without means of transport for an export over the mountains, no mining is possible.
The Chinese have almost left Mes Aynak's copper mine, allowing international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to dig their excavations at the huge Buddhist site and remain the most important employers in the province.
One day it will also be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan, largely dependent on imports and exports, to restore normal relations.
The withdrawal of the French fighting forces was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the continuation of traditional assistance: girls and boys, French Institute for Universities, French Institute, Military, Legal, Medical and Agricultural Cooperation, Support for the Archaeological Delegation.
Since 2009, a service "civil-military action" of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic) has been stopped in 2012 to carry out numerous non-profit activities and measures for the restoration of agriculture in dozens of mountain villages and by a small French non-governmental organisation to try to win the "hearts and spirits" and to achieve the impossible task of reconciling aid and offensive actions.
These works, for which numerous local workers were required, have helped to suppress the uprising: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increased agricultural areas.
What souvenir do we leave behind after military spending of two billion euros?
A much more modest budget will help to improve local living conditions, which are often very hard in these valleys at a height of more than 2000 meters.
The embassy received dozens of written requests for small agricultural projects from the municipalities of the province of Kapisa.
In order to free farmers from the uprising led by foreign groups, which is their own wish, the continuation would be necessary for their benefit of less, well controlled and directly related civilian aid.
A Constitution with the Breaking Bar in Egypt
It is a new poker game by President Mohammed Mursi.
While Egypt remains more divided than ever in relation to the declaration of constitution, which temporarily grants it unlimited authority, he has decided to put everything on a map.
To the surprise of all, he announced on Wednesday that the constitutional assembly would adopt its final text on the next day.
Just a week ago, the Head of State had granted this plenary two additional months for the completion of his work.
Egypt has been relying for almost two years on a provisional, multi-modal text, which weakens institutional stability and leads to legal confusion.
This new initiative has only led to an even stronger division of the country.
For his opponents, the president persists in his "autocratic delirium" by continuing to "break his word" and "step right".
On the side of its supporters, it is assured that it is a way to end the institutional and political crisis as quickly as possible and accelerate the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 14 days.
A very short period of time, which forces the brothers to refrain from their intention to explain to the Egyptians section by section.
For the President, it is also a way of rediscovering his public and democratic legitimacy, while the protest persists throughout the country.
After confirmations in an interview with the American weekly show Time, Mohammed Mursi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote well.
In particular, with this withdrawal from an overcrowded vote, the Egyptian people are asked to put an ultimatum: "You either vote for my draft or I keep the unlimited power of attorney," the latter should supposedly end after the Constitution has been adopted.
85 most Islamist members of this constitutional assembly adopted the text yesterday in a strange atmosphere.
The majority of Liberals have not responded to the call.
Shortly before the Constitutional Declaration of mid-November, they have turned away because they believe that they have not been able to bring their views into effect.
Representatives of human rights organisations, religious minorities or civil society have acted equally.
In order to reach the quorum, 11 people, alternate members, were added yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim brothers.
It is not surprising that the articles were mostly adopted unanimously.
By the way, the commentators found it entertaining that the only difference of opinion of the day... was expressed in time for prayer, as some members of the panel felt that the pendulum of the constitutional assembly was not accurate.
The text, which was adopted last night, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, which drew all attention to itself, remains finally identical with that of the 1971 Constitution and states that "the principles of Sharia are the main source of law".
The Salafist parties, for which the establishment of Islamic law is an important demand, had the hope of replacing "the principles" with "the rules" which would have made stricter application possible.
For the Islamists, the fact that this article has not been amended is proof of its good will and respect for the other members of the Egyptian society.
"Pleasant Holiness" is a response to the Liberals, who regard it only as a propaganda strike.
Because they believe that the Constitution is being Islamized about other articles.
In particular, they have Article 220 in mind, which gives the University of Al-Azhar an advisory function, particularly in relation to the verification of compliance with the laws of Sharia.
According to the Egyptian specialist Sophie Pommier, this is alarming, as "those who are invited to an opinion have not been elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
One can see in this the first signs of a theocracy".
The fears of the Liberals are also fueled by the fact that the next rector of this university is likely to be far less moderate than the one we are now experiencing.
"There is currently no concrete religious commitment.
With this Constitution we remain within the framework of the bourgeois state.
Most lawyers who have worked on this text are not Ulema, but academics who have been trained in part in the French system," Alexis Blouet, who writes a doctoral thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
He admits, however, that "in the context of Article 220, there may be a ambiguousness, as the terms used are devoid of the religious vocabulary.
It refers in particular to the "Fiqh" [Islamic case law, note d. Red.].
And in the future, the question could be raised about the extent to which civil judges are competent to decide."
In addition to its religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday is strongly criticised for the wide-ranging powers it grants to the President of the Republic.
The Moslem brothers argue that these are significantly reduced compared to the former regime.
Another issue: the powers of the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the examination of the defence budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a national Defence Council.
Similarly, there will be no ban on civil proceedings in military courts, as requested by the human rights defence associations.
The latter also share their fears regarding the text they consider to be a threat to freedom.
The reality of the Blasphemy is being maintained, and insults are now banned, which could have serious consequences for the right to free speech, especially for the press.
Furthermore, no more article refers to the protection of women, emphasizes Heba Morayef from Human Rights Watch.
In your opinion, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by Article 36.
This word was not included in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian president had to express himself on television last night, demonstrations are scheduled for this afternoon.
The supporters of the Head of State will march on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists expect holy places, the navel of the world and a sea of sole
The Promised Land unites in itself the glory of Bible truths, modern comfort and unspoiled nature.
AIF identifies you as the five main reasons for a visit to Israel.
Prostrate before the Holy Places
Visit the Jordan River, where Jesus was baptized.
It is said that all who bathe in this river receive God's blessing.
Galilee is the place where Jesus performed his miracles: the transformation of water into wine at a wedding feast, walking on the water, the closure of the sea tower and the fishing.
Jesus also appeared to his disciples after the resurrection.
Most sanctuaries, however, are found in Jerusalem.
Here, believers take the path of suffering or the path of Jesus Christ's cross (in Latin: Via Dolorosa).
The path begins at the Roman fortress Antonia, Pretoria, where the court was, and leads through the streets of the old town to the Graves Church on Mount Golgotha, where the crucifixion site, the anointing stone and the tomb of Jesus are located.
Here is, in the Christian view, the navel of the world, symbolizing the salvation of mankind.
The monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem stands at the place where, according to a Christian legend, the tree from which the cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus grew.
In Jerusalem is also the most holy place of the Jews - the wall of Lamentations, the remains of a temple that was destroyed by the Romans in 70 C.E.
Traditionally, people of different denominations leave notes with wishes that are then fulfilled.
A trip to the heights
The ruins of the fortress Massada form the remains of the secret hiding place from enemies, which Herod the Great built for his family in 25 AD.
They are located on a rock wall in the mountains at 450 meters above sea level.
Only climbers can reach the ruins of their own strength.
All others take an air cable car to this historic summit.
In the north of the country, from 1600 to 2040 meters high, there is the famous Hermon ski area, which attracts countless tourists in the winter months.
From the foot of the mountain you can get there with a shuttle bus.
The ski slopes have a total length of 45 kilometers.
According to an old legend, allegedly pagan gods lived on the mountaintop.
Visit Unique Museums
In this country there are almost 300 museums.
On a trip alone, not all can be visited.
But at least the five most interesting of them should be paid a visit.
Among them is the Israel Museum not far from the Knesset (Parliament).
There, ancient Qumran manuscripts or scrolls of the Dead Sea, found in caves in the Judean desert, and about 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological exhibits are kept.
The Museum of Art in Tel Aviv is also worth a visit.
There the collection of works by Impressionists and Expressionists Monet, Pissaro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso is exhibited.
In Akko you can visit the Museum in Bad Al Basha, which houses several rooms of old Turkish baths with sculptures of the visitors and bathers at that time.
In Caesarea you should visit the unique private Ralli Museum, where you can admire sculptures of Dali and Rodin.
There are neither museum guides nor souvenir shops there.
Entrance is free, and donations are generally rejected.
The fifth museum, namely the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, tells of one of the most shocking chapters in history.
The most comprehensive department is the memorial for the children built to commemorate the 1.5 million children destroyed in the concentration camps and gas chambers.
When entering the room there is complete darkness.
The stars sparkle.
And the names of the Jewish children and the countries in which they died are heard.
Ukraine is also mentioned there.
Doing Something for Health
The three main recreational areas of Israel lie on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
Each of the three places has swimming pools, water parks, dolphins and oceans.
Surprisingly, the Red Sea also bathes in the winter months, as the water temperature does not fall below 21 °C and the air warms up to 23 °C.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and it is bathed all year round.
By the way, this unusual sea with a position of 417 meters below sea level is the deepest sea in the world.
Its turquoise blue water has a high salinity and thus carries even non-swimming on the surface without any problems.
The surrounding landscape is indescribably beautiful.
Visitors come here for treatments using salt water (natural salt sun) and sludge as well as for treating inflammation of the skin, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes, and for the calming of tightened nerves.
Touch the Secrets of Ancientism
These secrets cover the old town of Tel Aviv, namely the city of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
Through this city, the famous maritime route, Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia were connected.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian legends.
According to tradition, Noah built his ark right here, and here Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda with which he led a long and happy life.
Tourists like to stroll through the narrow streets named after the constellation.
Fortuna shall be the legend according to all the team that touch the walls of the street with their constellation.
In Jaffa you can find remarried couples from all over Israel and even other countries at photo dates.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can walk through the Roman theatre and conquer the fortress of the Crusades.
In Roman times Caesarea was the most important city of Judea and the residence of the Roman governors, including Pontius Pilate.
Today, evening concerts and operas are performed in the carefully restored theatre.
Favourites for tourists
If you're going to Israel, don't worry about your poor English skills: about 30% of the Israelis speak Russian.
The money in the journey you prefer to take in no euros, but in dollars that can simply be exchanged in shekels (current exchange rate: 1 dollar to 3.8 shekels).
In the city you usually get on the bus, but in Jerusalem there is also a highway and in Haifa the only underground line of the country with six stations connecting the Lower Town with the Upper Town.
In fact, it is an underground runway.
A journey within the city costs 6 shekels regardless of the means of transport, which is sufficient including switching for a journey of up to 1.5 hours.
According to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is celebrated in Israel on Saturday.
From Friday evening to the sunset on Saturday, markets and shops are closed, and public transport rests.
And on Sunday morning the working week begins.
In many cafés, restaurants and restaurants only food is served, which excludes pork, seafood, fish without sheds and foods containing both milk and meat products.
Instead, you have the choice between various dishes with hay and beef, soups and desserts (prepared with coconut milk), traditional Jewish humus paste, various sauces, fried balls made of pure beans and peas (falafel) as well as fruits and vegetables.
There are no dogs on the streets of Israeli cities.
For this there are many well-nourished cats that stroll comfortably and unspoiledly through the streets.
In the evening you can even see them sleeping on the roofs of parking cars.
The cats like lively places and don't say no to treats.
Depending on the brand, a car costs between 37 dollars per day (Hyundai Getz) to 188 dollars (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
The insurance costs an additional 15 dollars a day.
And bike rental costs 15 shekels a day.
Tickets for museums cost on average 30 shekels.
In figures
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
Most adventurers and rest seekers came from Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England, the United States and Ukraine.
From January to October 2012, 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists came to the Promised Land, which corresponds to an increase of 51% compared to the 2010 comparative period, before removing the visa obligation on 9 February 2011.
"The Great and Powerful" leads to Moscow: Migrants save money for language
While MEPs and citizens' lawyers are discussing the benefits of the law on mandatory language tests for migrants, criminals are already dealing with counterfeit certificates
Every year, 13 million guest workers come to Moscow, St Petersburg and other cities in Russia.
Most of them are the citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Its only goal is to earn money for the maintenance of the families remaining in the home.
On 1 December, a law came into force which states that every migrant worker must pass a test certifying the knowledge of the Russian language.
So far, this scheme applies only to migrants who wish to work in the services sector, in the municipal housing sector and in retail trade.
However, in the future, the tests will become mandatory for all guest workers, according to the Federal Migration Authority.
In doing so, one must not only test language, but also test Russian history and the foundations of legislation.
Language skills must be demonstrated for both the maintenance and the extension of the work permit.
Exceptions apply only to citizens of countries in which the Russian language is the official language.
It also excludes persons who received their training certificates and diplomas before the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
Purpose, problem and protection of rights
The totality of the exams will be under the aegis of the Puschkin Institute for Russian Language, the Russian University of People's Friendship, the Moscow State University, the St. Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
Migrants can take the tests in all cities; already more than 160 centres have already been opened in Russia.
The initiative to introduce the tests was supported by members of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Authority.
On the other hand, before the entry into force of the law in the press, citizens’ lawyers asked the following questions several times: What does this really mean?
What changes does it make to the requirement to have language skills for both Russians and guest workers?
Above all, against speakers from the Migration Authority, it is important to reduce the number of forced labour.
"Many people now talk about protecting the rights of migrant workers," says Viktor Sebelew, Head of Representation of the Federal Migration Authority in Tajikistan.
However, their rights must be protected before they leave.
Only an organized recruitment will solve 90% of the problems of foreign workers.
Problems arise for migrants without work, education, language skills and medical evaluation.
Sebelew is convinced that a future migrant without language will inevitably encounter people with evil intentions, who will put him under the pretext of help in a dark, narrow barrack, where he will endure with dozens of his like months without food and documents and create 12 to 14 hours a day.
Many complaints from our migrants reach us.
"In your home country, the one is promised to you, and upon arrival you will be betrayed, their passports will be removed and not receive the promised wage," confirmed the head of the Tajikistan Migration Agency, Tolib Schwaripow.
Don't humiliate, boss!
Nevertheless, many citizens of the Central Asian republics who want to earn their money in Russia admit that they cannot only master the language of the target country but can hardly express themselves in writing in their own language.
Of course, this is not so much their fault as the evil: only a few Turks, Uzbeken and Tadschiken can afford a reasonable basic education.
For in their families there is not even money to feed the children, let alone to buy them decent clothing, shoes and school stuff.
As a teenager, these children immediately seize the first opportunity to earn money.
"It's difficult without language skills," they admit.
"You feel humiliated and inferior."
Citizens stress the following important aspects of the law.
The test only needs to be carried out by legal migrants.
If you do not have this status, there is no exam and therefore no official work.
Meanwhile, most of the guest workers remain illegally in Russia.
"Welcomed heartily" or "No access for unauthorized persons"
Many migrants confirm that it is not easy to get an official status in Russia.
The reason is bureaucratic hurdles and, of course, linguistic difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money: 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
A fake registration can be made quickly and only for one and a half thousand.
The staff of the Russian police know that our documents are mostly faked and we are not registered, and then cases of extortion arise.
"They want one or two hundred rubles for cigarettes and tea," says the Tajik Umed Huschkadamow to journalists.
"Just don't spare costs for wrong papers"
Already on the day the law came into force, it turned out that not only the registration documents of migrants could have been falsified.
Some fake certificates that certify the completion of the language test have already been confiscated by employees of the Federal Migration Authority.
The falsified papers were printed with an ordinary color printer.
Of course, the new owners did not receive it for nothing: Every migrants who hoped to save themselves the tests paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
This is more than twice as much as the cost of the official test: this costs a migrant worker three thousand rubles.
The fact that the most important direct task is to protect the system from corruption in order to prevent the simple purchase of the certificates is that both officials and civil society lawyers agree.
At the moment, the authorities can only promise guest workers who fall through the test for the first time that they are given time for a language basic course.
In addition, new arrivals without language skills are offered places in areas where there is no need for active communication with people.
Interior Ministry Ignored Illegal Arms Market
Share of legal weapons in crimes extremely low
The Russian Ministry of the Interior plans to tighten up the Arms Act for private arms owners.
The authorities thus respond to recent events: injured at shootings at weddings and seven dead at the Amok Run of Moscow's lawyer Dmitri Winogradow.
The police want to ban the wearing of non-lethal weapons in public and raise the age for possession of firearms from 18 to 21 years.
The proposal was supported by the Chairman of the Duma Committee on Security and Corruption, Irina Jarrowaja, and promised that the amendments to the Waffen Act will be presented shortly to the Duma.
Not all are satisfied with the Russian authorities wanting to fight the problems by attracting screws.
An open letter was published on the Internet, whose author - representatives of various arms associations - calls on the authorities to refrain from "senseless sharpening".
The percentage of crimes with registered weapons is very small, said the criminal justice officer, Wasilij Lesnikow, the Russian service of the BBC.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, 142 crimes involving the use of registered weapons were committed during the course of six months in 2012, while a total of 1,168 thousand crimes were recorded for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that tightening the law for private arms owners will not prevent criminals from serving on the black market.
At present, according to the authors in Moscow, every weapon can be found for little money.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of the Interior stresses that the spread of illegal weapons is under control.
Supplier: From the factories to the officers
The weapons reach the black market through several channels.
There are five such main channels, tells a former Colonel Viktor Baranez, who worked in the Ministry of Education and the General Staff for ten years.
Screenshot of a website that accepts gun orders
The first channel is the army or the military, i.e. weapons stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were stolen by both the Russian officers and the Caucasians themselves," says Baranez.
In the second channel, illegal weapons are being stolen from criminals.
Baranez explains that this includes weapons stolen from both the police arms chambers and directly from law enforcement personnel.
Other illegally sold weapons come from military weapons camps.
Many military camps have experienced explosions.
"There is evidence that in some cases it was arson to hide the lack of weapons," says the former military member.
According to Baranez, weapons manufacturers also contribute to the black market.
"Today, there are countless private arms companies that do not withstand international competition and therefore the weapons under the hand on the black market, for example in Moscow," says the expert.
Another channel of the black market is the smuggling.
Many pistols and rifles come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is an own, sometimes craft production, as well as a mafia that organizes the smuggling," explains the former military member.
Where did the weapons come from?
Experts calculated the proportion of each of the five channels involved in supplying the black market with illegal weapons.
In 2011, a report was prepared by the Problem Analysis Centre and the State Administration.
The experts analysed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and the Federal Service for State Statistics, criminological literature and publicly available data in portals on weapons.
According to the investigators, the majority of the illegal weapons originate from the army and the law enforcement authorities.
Half of all the weapons on the black market were there because of "the guilt of those responsible who have come to deal with weapons in their work," says the report.
According to the researchers, 17% of the weapons come from conflict areas, 14% come from thefts in the production of weapons, and 5% come from illegal excavations.
A sales consultant of a gun store who does not want to be named, ensures that weapons found in illegal excavations have been bought for a long time because they are outdated.
According to him, it is more often for dealers to obtain the supply in a stock exchange.
A gun, for example a TT gun, is purchased via a fan.
The weapon is displayed and handed over by the fence.
"The dealer brings the gun to the city and sells it there for 900 euros per piece with two magazines," he says.
"The police, of course, are aware of everything and therefore, if they cannot comply with the crime detection plan, they will periodically buy control at dealers who offer illegal weapons," the sales consultant adds.
"Like in the luxury store"
Buyers and sellers find most often about acquaintances with each other.
I had looked at websites and blogs when someone became aware of me and suggested that I come to the "Begowaja" station, where a person would wait for me to break me to a certain place, where we could then negotiate the price.
The price for the gun I only received there
Military commentator Viktor Baranez
"To get a gun, I need a friend who has contacts," says the sales consultant. "I have such a friend, but I don't trust him."
There are dealers in the markets, but you have to go there and meet with a code like "by Ivan Ivanovich, who can arrange for the daughter to lose a tooth".
At present, I even come to some punching rings about a friend I trust.
He's also just giving me the punching rings because he knows I'm not giving him a whipping.
Newcomers are looking for weapons on different paths.
Former military member Viktor Baranez tried to buy illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he wrote an article on this subject.
According to him, the schematics have not changed.
He was given a photo album in which "everything possible" was depicted.
"I felt like I was in the luxury shop," the military member recalls.
According to Baranez, the buyer does not get the cat in the bag, but can try everything out.
As a potential customer, I don't just buy, but go to the forest with the seller, and there we set up a target.
"I can then shoot there, and if I am convinced that the weapon has a good shot, we negotiate with each other," the expert describes the procedure.
Shopping from the sofa
Internet search engines show search results for websites and groups in "Vkontakte", where weapons are offered "for various purposes".
There is no need for any papers or there are personal meetings.
"You only need the right amount of money," says the advertisement on the website "Buy a Gun or Gun".
There users place your orders and make inquiries.
Are minors also sold?
"Of course without a license", prompts user "Iwan" (literal quote).
"Buy a TT. Moscow", is the laconic request from "Fedorenkow".
The Federal Security Service recently switched countless sham websites, and buyers who want to acquire weapons go up into the network.
People come like hungry fish when feeding and then land in Siberia and may shovel coal
Military commentator and former military member Viktor Baranez
I have heard of the following scheme: The website is usually registered abroad, and Russian laws do not apply.
The parties responsible accept the orders.
The buyer transfers the money via a cash machine.
"As an answer he receives a photo and a description of the hiding of the weapon," reports the press spokesperson of the non-profit organization "Pravo na oryzhie" Dmitrij Kislow.
Viktor Baranez stresses that you can also go out empty and get behind bars when you place a request on a website.
The Federal Security Service recently switched countless sham websites, and buyers who want to acquire weapons go up into the network.
"People come like hungry fish when feeding and then land in the Siberian labour camp and may scoop coal," he says.
A Makarov for $100
According to experts, when buying illegal firearms, prices are between USD 100 and US$ 900.
According to Dmitry Kislow from the organization "Pravo na oryzhie", you can buy a gun of the type Makarov for between 100 and 300 dollars.
You have to wait up to one and a half months.
The weapon is issued in military weapons camps by middle rank overseers.
According to the official statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, the number of crimes involving illegal weapons throughout Russia declined by 7% to 22.9 thousand between January and October 2011, while the number of cases of theft and extortion related to weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosives dropped by 7.8%.
Fast food and supermarket workers strike in the USA
Every fourth American youth is at some point behind McDonald's checkout
In recent days there have been massive protests across the United States against low wages in Walmart branches and restaurants of popular fast-food chains such as Mc Donald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
No one can yet predict whether the protests will continue to swell or whether they will soon go out again.
The protests are supported by trade unions and several left-wing non-profit organisations.
In addition to increasing modest wages by simple Walmart and Fast Food workers, protest organizers pursue the goal of founding trade unions.
So far, this sector of the economy is hardly organized as a trade union.
46 cents a year?
The protests started last week after Thanksgiving, at the so-called Black Friday, where sales in the United States attracted millions of customers, which sometimes led to handcuffs.
On this day, some Walmart employees, of whom there are 2.2 million worldwide, laid down their work and strangled along with trade unions and left activists branches of the chain, whose target group are people of low and medium income.
Walmart sells all products, from diapers to hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The goods in the Walmart file are on average between 8 and 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
This is why many of the small-paid Walmart workers buy only at their own workplace.
The prices and product range made Walmart one of the largest companies in the USA.
According to critics, Walmart can often only sell the goods so cheaply because the employees are poorly paid.
The latter also complain about difficult working conditions, such as missing forklifts or hand scanners.
The protesters at the Black Friday demanded wage increases and expressed their annoyance that the contribution to the company's health insurance had increased from 30 to 100 dollars per month.
A typical Walmart employee, who earns $9.5 an hour, could not afford this increase, they said.
Researchers from the California University in Berkeley prove that if the company increased the average wage to 12 dollars an hour, it would cost Walmart 3.2 billion dollars.
That's about 1.1% more than they're donating for pay now.
If Walmart were to apply the wage increases completely to the customers, each purchase cost them only 46 cents more in the future.
For them this would be $12.39 per year compared to today's additional expenditure.
Proponents of Walmart are pleased to note that only nine states have protested and they have not given any losses to the company.
The Black Friday took the next day in its store from 8 a.m. on Thursday to midnight, and during this period Walmart sold about 5000 items per second.
In total, the Walmart cashier carried out nearly 100 million transactions on Black Friday.
The spokesperson of the company, Dan Fogelman, claimed in an interview on the website of the left-wing Huffington Post that overall "less than five" Walmart employees had done the job and the protest action had only been "a further PR trick" of the union that organized the protests.
"Free cashier!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where their goal, however, was not Walmart-Filials (which are not wanted in this advanced city and are therefore not yet present), but McDonald's and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's says the company sells billions of portions, and yet you don't get sick days, and you won't be paid for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, New York City Council member
At present, the minimum wage under federal and New York legislation is $7.25 an hour.
In fast-food restaurants, the minimum wage is gradually raised, but not too strong, and on average their simple employees in New York get $8.90 an hour.
Less than she deserves nobody in this expensive city.
As it is possible to get out in New York with as little money as possible, I am incomprehensible.
There was a time when almost a quarter of American youths were behind the counter after McDonald's school, but the young people still lived with their parents.
Almost one saw the main source of income in it or planned to stay there longer.
Now, during interviews with McDonald's employees, I meet people who are constantly complaining that they have to cope with this pay and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, there is a comment in the Forum of the Wall Street Journal, whose author notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know how to feed them.
The protesters who started on Thursday at 6.30 a.m. in front of McDonald's in 40th Street and Madison Avenue demanded that the cashiers and cooks of Fast Food restaurants receive a minimum wage of $15 an hour, which is more than a double of the current minimum wage.
They continued to demand the formation of trade unions in the fast-food industry.
The U.S. law prohibits corporate governance from getting in the way of this goal and dismissing or dismissing trade union members.
On the other hand, management does not make it easy for them.
The establishment of trade unions in the fast-food industry is however also difficult for objective reasons.
The most important reason is the high personnel fluctuation.
Unsatisfied
There were loud protests this day before many other fast-food restaurants in Manhattan.
The highlight of the protests was a meeting at lunchtime before McDonald's at Times Square, where some local Democrats spoke, including City Councillor Jumaane Williams, who said, "McDonald's says it sells billions of portions, and yet you don't get sick, and you won't be paid for your honest work!"
The demonstrators were also supported by other prominent New York Democrats, for example, mayor candidate Bill De Blasio, who said that "we should jointly support the fast-food workers so that they can get a fair wage and reach the economic prosperity that every New Yorker deserves!".
According to the New York Times, this was the largest action of its kind in the history of the US fast-food industry.
However, there were only a few hundred people on site, not all of whom work in the fast-food industry in which tens of thousands work in New York.
It is not yet clear whether the spark of these protests will mobilize all the masses.
"To date, the brain can only be slightly overestimated"
The topic of extended reality, popular with modern technology supporters, has recently been usually perceived by the lens of a special spectacle.
At his annual conference, Google first presented a working model in the summer, and in November it became known that Microsoft had also filed an appropriate patent.
In conversation with the head of the Group for Interactive 3D Technologies at Microsoft Laboratory in Cambridge Shahram Izadi, however, it becomes clear that the glasses for the company’s scientists were only a gateway station.
It stimulates the ability to manipulate virtual objects in the air with bare hands and create virtual spaces.
- Please briefly describe what research your group is doing.
- We are dealing with the interaction of man and machine, but we want to expand the limits of this interaction.
So far, mankind has mostly been stuck in the phase, in which it is worked with pixels on flat screens, which are sometimes also touched.
However, we want to look ahead for 5-10 years and anticipate the radical changes of this interaction.
For example, the Xbox consoles and the Kinect sensors are progressing, and nowadays no more Xbox is sold without Kinect since everyone is interested in motion control.
What do we expect in the future?
- Although Kinect has brought the interaction to a physical level, many things still play on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information (the system receives more data) could be improved, the output has not yet been decisive.
We try to change this, work on real three-dimensional display systems based on different technologies, including projections.
We have to release the computer world into our physical world and make it more fascinating.
However, it is necessary not only to recognize the user, but also its environment.
Then we could complement the real world much easier by virtual objects.
And first of all, we should get rid of these stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think about speech control?
She's popular, but isn't she overrated?
- It is certainly not an all-purpose solution, as it raises questions about privacy, because one does not always want to inform everyone about its actions and intentions.
Actually, any type of interaction with computers is good, but each in its particular niche.
For example, in the area of controlling objects on public squares, we worked on a project where we experimented with short and buttoned gestures instead of with unloading gestures.
The gestures were recorded not by the object camera, but by a bracelet that recorded the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is still relatively large, but theoretically it could be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
But overall, the future belongs to mixed types of control, such as gesticism and language.
- How's that?
- We'd ask you, for example, to supply you with this sprudeldosis?
They say it and at the same time interpret it.
- Normally I'll just say it.
- Oh, that would be very hard to recognize.
- Does that mean that you want the user to adapt to what a machine can do at the time and what doesn't?
- Not necessarily, but this is about mutual rapprochement.
I think that we will have to work in the next few days primarily on developing new sensor types, which will enable people to understand reactions more precisely.
These can be laser sensors, for example, as they provide a good resolution in depth, which is very important.
- What are your demands based on your work with the Xbox Kinect sensors on modern cameras?
Does it lack resolution, depth, or anything else?
- The current generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the field of three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, 8 megapixels at a speed of 1000 fps would not be bad.
But the main thing is not the megapixels themselves, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
So seen all current technologies are not good enough for us, as the developers of the algorithms have more work.
It must be taken into account not only the resolution along the X and Y but also along the Z axis.
The speed and number of images per second are also important.
The human movements are extremely dynamic and openly said, the present 30 fps are particularly too little for gestures.
In our Redmond laboratory, Stephen Betishes developed a touch sensor with a adjustable processing delay between 1 and 100 milliseconds, with today's commercial sensors closer to the second value (60 to 100).
Not everyone understands how much this affects the interaction between man and machine.
For my work I needed just such a device, only without touch control and with more images per second.
- Shouldn't the number of cameras be increased?
- Kinect currently works with three "Cameras", one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the other a receiver for the reflected signal.
And the third camera is actually an ordinary RGB camera.
It is not used to calculate the depth of the object.
More cameras might solve the problem...
Or reinforce the problem, as more calculations would be necessary.
It would be nice to have a flexible, Kinect-like system where we could play with different camera inclinations to see how this helps us to determine a position in three-dimensional terms.
- If I remember correctly, Microsoft did not present its glasses to the public as opposed to Google.
Don't you think the glasses have the best prospects with regard to the application of advanced reality technology in everyday life?
- Of course, it is not pleasant to always keep a smartphone in the raised hand, but I think the following: The best option would be a "changing" extended reality in which we could switch over a cloud from glasses to smartphone,
The glasses are a personal gadget in which their strength (private can only be seen), but at the same time their weakness, because an extended reality with glasses prevents you from working on virtual objects together with others.
- Let us imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holograms in the air is accessible not only to Tony Stark from Iron Man, but also to normal mortals.
There is a problem that critics often point to this idea: there is no noticeable reaction!
Hands don't feel anything at all!
What answers does your group want to give to this objection?
- In my lectures I often speak of the expanded reality as the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth breakthrough could well be the integration of tactile perception.
An interesting method is currently the use of the second hand as a somewhat unusual projection material.
She's got pressure!
But there are also technologies that are actually focused on giving the "pictures in the air" something hand-resistant, for example, the interference of some directed ultrasound rays at a certain point where the finger is located creates a feeling that is still so weak at the moment as someone breathed over the handballs.
There are also bands for the wrist that affect the nerve endings in the fingers, also this is a potential direction.
- Have you tried to outsmart the brain?
It makes me think that it feels what it should feel when it sees something?
- That's a good idea, so we haven't tried it yet.
Here is another task with which we will have to fight for a long time, namely to believe a person who is physically located in a closed space, he is located instead in an open, practically infinite space; here we are working on concepts with treadmills (other than in gyms), mobile platforms and large balls.
So far, the brain can only be slightly exceeded, and there are many years of work ahead.
This is precisely what makes work in the field of virtual reality attractive to a researcher: we are only beginning on many issues.
Own taste instead of culture - rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt continues the project "Petersburger Avantgarde", dedicated to city dwellers who form the avant-garde of art and culture.
On the read list, already high-ranking representatives of the Petersburg art scene landed, whose successes go beyond the borders of the city and often find recognition in Europe, without being known in the rest of Russia.
Rosbalt's new hero is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, the red-dressed beards, once at the Russian Museum, sometimes at the summer garden, sometimes at a scene meeting or at a vernissagen.
Wherever the pictures of Kirill Miller are displayed, they attract large masses of people.
Kirill Miller is one of the typical Petersburg socio-philosophical artists who create new myths.
Kirill Miller is a shining personality of the Petersburg avant-garde at the end of the 1980s and early 1990s.
He is also a man of the city and, through his presence on the street, enchants his fellow citizens with a smile in their faces and gives them good moods.
A short time ago he grabbed a rotating organ and became a Petersburg rotary organ player, as he finally felt ready for this difficult role with regard to his artistic presence, his philosophy and his image.
- Kirill, why are you always in red and not, for example, in yellow or turquoise in the city?
I chose the color Red as a fashion designer that deals with the optics and the image.
In this world, Red is the compromise between artists, image consultants and society.
In society, everything that deviates from the norm, causes aggression and bad behavior.
But I want to talk to people through my provocations.
Each of my previous provocations was an invitation to talk.
- When did you know you had to be a painter?
- At an exhibition in the Newskij Cultural Palace, where my works were exhibited.
I understand I have to go this way.
Then the time of the old free but not officially recognized painters ended then, and new and free painters like me were incomprehensible.
I made friends with the painters of the new generation, that is to say with the representatives of the "Gazonewschina", from which "Pushkinskaya 10" was born, and then it was over.
It draws me to the theatre, to the fashion, to the music, actually to everything except literature.
It was important for me to be at the heart of Petersburg's culture, where the best creative artists should gather.
In 1995 I occupied a room in the Puschkinskaya 10, and there, until the renovation work, there was a musical-artistic club for the Bohemian, the house of the Petersburg Bohemian Bohemia.
Many were born there: N.O.M., Tequilajazzz, and I also remember how Schnur came there with his project "Ucho Van Goga".
Schnur and his friends sang simple songs to play-back, wore tight jerseys and belonged to them too, today's hip composer Igor Wdowin.
When the group began to play live, it became "Leningrad".
Trachtenberg moderated many programs before the time of "Halli-Galli".
We gave them Trachtenberg, and it began his great career, but he learned the basics with us.
The gallery "D 137" or the club "Griboedov" also originates in the art clinic.
Our staff and regulars went there.
I'm a hero of the past century, when culture meant something.
In 2000, there was a survey in the press about the award "Personalities of Our City".
I won in the category "Artists of the Year", and that's how I got to the top.
It is not easy to work in new times according to old rules; I am a person of truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
In modern times it is easy to become famous, but culture and popularity are not the same: you can be famous without making a cultural contribution.
- Your work has an unmistakable style.
- Many of my pictures are real pearls and clearly express the topicality and sharpness of thoughts.
I will have an exhibition with the theme "The Russian Museum as Clowns".
Clowns are timeless.
I used to be social, but now it hurts and causes fear to be like that.
In a clown, it blurs everything and loses its tragedy.
I love the grotesque, and I have grotesque ideas.
Let us save the world, for example, by prescribing that everyone has to dress up completely.
Now everyone pays attention to the clothes and is oriented to the outside and not to the inside of man.
But maybe you can't give a man a hand, but you should spit in his face.
The deception disappears through disguise.
- Recently we saw you in the role of the urban rotary organ player.
Who, if not me?
- Can commercial art also be beautiful?
- Nowadays, commercial art must be careful, considerate and flattering.
We see the decay of cultures.
People used to form large groups: Bohemia's loved one and the simple people loved the other.
Now there are micro-communitys, and it is difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a one-hundred dollar note everyone likes.
Now you have to think about who you're gonna like.
Now every cult star has about 100 followers.
- At the performances of Stas Michailow come several thousand!
- Left-wing women come to him, there the sexual-social sphere plays a role.
For cultural reasons 300 people come and not 10 thousand, so there is less management, money, and everything goes down.
I have followers, and the most important thing is not to cheat them and not to destroy the achievement.
In my youth I painted such pictures that even in a collector hung in a series with the works of Falk and Larionow.
I started with pictures that usually come only at the end of my career.
Nowadays, there are often misunderstandings.
It means spiritual culture and consumer culture.
Konsum doesn't have any culture at all, that's something else.
I am a person of the past culture and grew up with artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty and refused money to paint.
This is the culture I advocate.
- Kirill, what's missing from Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
They say: servants of culture.
But not every one of them can deal with culture.
With the real tsars it was different, because the tsars may not understand much of culture, but they understood that right experts are necessary.
There are currently good consultants in Moscow.
In Petersburg we have which, the experts might be, but they are blocked by the way, as it takes higher-ranking experts who judge the first correctly and clear the way for them.
Now only your own taste counts.
The same applies to the Erarta, but with the difference that they honestly say that they do not accept all contemporary art and therefore some painters have to look for other museums.
- What's Petersburg for you?
- Petersburg is not the cultural capital; in Moscow there is much more culture and a corresponding breeding ground.
Art can only grow hard on our stones.
We need a cultural breeding ground, for for example, we now have more writers than readers, and that is not right.
In Europe there are many curious people who visit exhibitions or concerts.
It's a lot less for us.
Art has to be modern again, as at the beginning of the last century.
The project is financed from subsidies from the city of St Petersburg
Birth in the World
Earth in danger.
Earth warming or colliding with killer asteroid.
Caravans of spaceships with Earth's inhabitants on board are looking for a replacement planet.
In order to save mankind, is the important question of how to reproduce in zero gravity or on the substitute planet?
In my opinion, there are not many choices.
De facto there are only two real planets that we could at least hypothetically inhabit.
"Relating to Mars and Venus," says the scientific assistant of the Astronomical Sternberg Institute Vladimir Surdin.
While the conditions on Mars are comparatively life-friendly, on the surface of Venus there is a temperature of 500 degrees.
Life would only be possible at a great height or in the orbit of Venus, i.e. in space.
The researchers first dealt with the question of reproductive growth in all parts of the world in relation to flora.
Already half a century before, experiments were carried out with plants.
The fourth generation of orbit-bred peas did not differ in the least from the earthly species.
It followed the breeding of insects, more precisely of tiny fruit flies (Drosophila), in the orbit.
In 1979, Watchmen were sent to the world to investigate how the weightlessness affects the development of Embryos.
It develops a normal chick.
But then the problem begins.
"The problem is that the chick must find hold; it must be able to stand on its legs and start moving," explains Vladimir Sychew, head of the Institute for Medical and Biological Problems.
Without a solid background, the chicks crossed wildly.
Ten hours later, the instincts of the newborns collapsed completely.
The chicks did not react to light and sounds.
Four days later, they just died.
"Twice we let chicks slip and then put the whole thing in, because it's simply impossible to work with them there," Vladimir Sychev notes for the failed experiment with the chicks in space.
The last cage with animals flew into the orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in spring 2013.
However, only gender species will be found on the biosatellite "Bion".
There was an experiment with rats that were already fertilized into space.
In principle, nothing specific has been identified.
"This was precisely with the biosatellites, but again it was just a single experiment, and the research needs to be continued," says Vladimir Sychew.
After the landing, the Space Councils grew up.
The problem of reproduction directly in space has not yet been solved.
The task is difficult.
Animals that are torn from their natural habitat simply cannot follow their reproductive drive.
Unlike animals, man could do that in principle.
The homo sapiens is capable of abstract thinking and can create a similar emotional background.
For ethical considerations, such experiments are not carried out.
But women have been flying into space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was with Tereschkowa.
The most valuable possession of mankind is the female organism.
Our gulls flew from it, and no one on earth could have answered this question: Do they survive the space flight?
Will she be able to bring a child to the world after this flight?
"Finally no one answered this question," says Raumfahrtveteran Wachtang Watschnadse.
In June 1964, only one year after her space flight, the first female Cosmonautin, Valentina Tereschkova, had a daughter.
The child's father, Andriyan Nikolayew, was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988 the second woman in the All, Svetlana Sawizkaja, who was twice in the orbit and even performed work outside the spacecraft, bore a son.
Nevertheless, there is still a risk.
We have very few cosmonauts, where after long flights everything went well and they got healthy young.
"The more, the more dangerous it is even for flights into the Orbit," concludes Cosmonaut Waleri Polyakow, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of the Russian Federation.
Yet mankind must seek new ways in biotechnology, radiation protection and artificial gravitation.
Hydrolabor in the Cosmonaut Preparation Centre is a mandatory station during flight preparation.
Here in a state of suspendedness, the cosmonauts win routines for working in open space.
The water represents the weightlessness.
Even though adults feel that water is pleasant, it is a foreign environment; but infants feel water as a natural element.
It is as if the little Ictyander bear witness to the fact that life on the land emanated from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that a child is about 9 months in the belly of the mother in the fruit water, and that it can then more easily get used to water.
In principle, it is logical, since from birth until the first swimming only lasts 2 weeks.
"It's too little time to forget something," says baby swim teacher Marina Aksenowa.
While for a newborn child the weightlessness is a much more natural condition, the woman does not come out without gravity.
In the state of weightlessness, the abdominal and pelvic muscles are rapidly reduced and the ability to squeeze out the child also decreases.
All right, let's deal with birth control.
For example, the birth could also take place in a special room to squeeze the child out.
"But what happens then?" is the not insignificant question of Waleri Poljakov.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without feeling the education, the organism cannot train the skeleton and the muscles.
A newborn child cannot be put into a load suit in the orbit like an adult.
He will simply lack what is of elementary importance to his life.
"This experiment, which we undertake together, namely the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will lead us to bring a disabled person, a completely unadapted person to the world," says Igor Pestow, head of the Bioethics Commission of the Institute for Medical and Biological Problems.
So far, the birth of children in the universe is just theory.
At some point, however, it becomes reality when the Earth’s inhabitants break up in their spaceships to a distant planet that becomes the home for their all-born offspring.
NKÚ Chief: Control of the Black System Failure by Indebted Politics
The Czech Republic has good control bodies and adequate laws in the context of public contracts, but is not subject to their application.
In a conversation for Aktuálně.cz, this is said by the Vice President of the Supreme Control Office (Nevyšší kaullní úřad, NKÚ), Miloslav Kala.
"A law is never perfect, but it has to be applied properly - and this is not the case with us in my opinion," Kala comments on the current situation.
A similar result appears to also come from joint control by Czech and German auditors.
As a negative example of practice, he led Prime Minister Petr Nečas' position on the so-called "Black System".
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS would not harass entrepreneurs with controls - is the system now banned or allowed?
"A law must have its validity, and if something is prohibited by law, then the chairman of the government cannot simply come, and the Supervisory Authority, whose duty is now to control compliance with the law, is to hinder its activity," Kala states.
At the meeting of the Supervisory Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, you spoke about a joint Czech-German project in which the laws of both countries on public contracts were compared.
What was the point?
This is a parallel examination, which we started about two years ago.
To put it simply, it is a question of the European legislature deciding how to handle public contracts, building up national legislation, and finally there is the actual practical application.
All of this we have compared to each other, and although the examination has not yet been completed, we have been able to find extremely interesting differences. Generally speaking, the laws are perhaps even a bit more "harder and perfect", but the actual application is better in Germany in some parameters.
This confirms that it is not enough to set up new and more precise rules again and again. It is also necessary to deal with the actual application of the law.
How can the project help you? What will happen to you from this project?
Such joint control could help us to stop constantly trying to achieve perfection of laws and to reduce and deter thresholds if this does not seem to have a particularly positive effect.
Economy means buying a thing at a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price) and excluding unlawful enrichment or even criminal acts.
However, the reduction of thresholds for contracts does not guarantee that we also achieve this objective.
Perhaps it is even the case that in this way we only burden the system with excessive "paper crunch", and those who are looking for gaps in the system have it much easier to exploit the system than if the thresholds remained higher.
They talk about the problems in the practical implementation of the Czech Procurement Act.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there a similar authority here as our NKÚ, or does the system work differently?
As far as the authorities are concerned, the German counterpart to the NKÚ of the Bundesbrachungshof, which is similar to ours and also has a college, which is just a little different. Basically, however, both authorities work similarly.
The competences are also to a certain extent comparable, but Germany is a state, i.e. there are also these invoicing offices in the individual Länder - the German system differs from ours.
The BRH can only control federal funds, which corresponds to our state resources.
Public funds managed by the districts and municipalities are under the control of the state accounting offices.
As far as German legislation is concerned, is it simpler than ours?
In general, I would not like to compare this with any specific information. Nevertheless, Germany is often referred to as an example in some respects, but it is certainly not possible to say that Germany is in everything better.
Is this because the examiners are better there?
This is certainly not the case, but as I said, I do not like such comparisons.
It should also be noted that those countries that are exemplary for us also have problems to contend with.
Otherwise they wouldn't have anything of a cooperation with our authority, would they?
As far as Czech legislation is concerned, what was the meaning for your authority of revising the law on the awarding of contracts, do you already feel any effects?
In view of the fact that this novel has only been in force for a short time, it has not yet been effective in our tests.
As our controls are carried out later, we have to expect a certain delay here.
So far, we feel more about the preparation phase of future controls - we have introduced the new control instrument "Detection of risks of uneconomicity" and are examining and analysing this almost 14,000 public contracts - here, of course, the changes will have an effect as the thresholds change, the conditions for certain types of tender have been modified, among other things.
Do you see the adoption of this law rather positively, or will the system be burdened with further bureaucracy?
I believe that this law is certainly a step in the right direction and hope that this assumption is confirmed.
However, the problem may arise that the rules become more stringent and cannot be complied with anymore.
Under the previous rules, the persons subject to an examination are already accountable to the institution (for example, in the case of an operational programme of regional policy, the Regional Council) that any non-compliance with the law on the award of the contract is equivalent to an infringement of budgetary discipline.
But does it make sense to make the law even stricter?
I don't think so.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse the system and not punish those who have committed a form error that does not affect the actual decision-making.
Such a system simply puts bureaucracy under even greater pressure.
Where's the way out here?
First of all, let us say which path is not targeted.
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS would not lighten the entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called "black system" - what exactly does that mean?
Is the black system banned or allowed?
A law must have its validity, and if something is prohibited by law, then the chairman of the government cannot simply come, and the supervisory authority, whose duty is now to control compliance with the law, can be hindered in its work.
He can say, "We change the law and allow things to happen," but he can't say that we're doing this as if nothing were.
The Procurement Act contains relatively strict rules on the formal conduct of certain operations - and that is also right for the protection of public competition.
On the other hand, however, it is also tragic if the tenderer is excluded with the best offer only due to form errors.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied properly - and that is what I believe is missing.
On the streets there are isolated ice sheets, but mainly dry.
On the streets of the Czech Republic there are partly snow and ice smooth plains.
Most of the roads, however, are well-travelable, sometimes increased caution is needed.
KaribaKarlsbad
In the district of Karlsbad, the streets were well accessible this morning, isolated snow and ice smooth plains.
The temperatures fell to -5 to -10 °C, during the day it should get a little warmer.
In the region it is no longer snowing, and in the lower altitudes only a thin snow cover remains.
On the ridges of the Erzgebirge, however, there are about 30 cm of snow.
According to the District Street Guard, there was a limited view of Nebel.
The R6 motorway and the first road class routes in the region are currently fully traversable.
However, attention is needed on, for example, bridges on which the railways are sometimes required and smooth.
All routes of the second and third road classes, including the mountain roads, are also accessible to passengers.
On these roads, however, there remain partly required or exhausted snow residues.
Increased attention is therefore needed in particular in the higher levels.
Districts of Pardubice and Hradec Králové
On some roads East Bohemia there is danger due to ice sheeting, in higher levels and in the mountains there is still an exhausted snow layer on the streets, the street and highway management on their Internet pages.
The road championships warn riders against ice smoothing, which can occur especially in higher locations in the district of Pardubice.
Ice smoothing can be achieved in the districts of Lanškron, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavy and Vysoké Mýto, especially on the second and third road routes.
Roads I/43 and I/34 at Svitavy are chemically treated.
Snow is mainly on the streets in the Giant Mountains and in the mountains Orlické hory.
A vast snow layer lies on the streets of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov.
Today in eastern Bohemia it is mostly sunny or cheerful, and it remains largely unbeatable.
The temperatures are between -3 and +1 °C, it blows a weak wind.
Pilsen County
The streets in the Pilsen district are today well accessible, but local attention is needed, and the route is to adapt to the weather.
This is frosty in the morning, with temperatures between 3 and 9 degrees below freezing point.
Since it has before snowed and the temperatures then fell, it can get ice smooth on the streets.
Local fog is also to be expected, but the vision will improve in the course of the day.
This information is from the district street championships.
The D5 motorway is virtually fully traversable, but increased attention is recommended by the road championships between 80 and 131 kilometers.
The roads of the first road class are mostly dry, but frozen.
However, in the south of the Pilsen and Tachov Circles, ice smooth can come in a little bit.
The roads of the second and third categories of road are damp, and therefore the reference to possible required sections is also valid here.
Drivers should be particularly careful on the less frequent roads in the area of Bohemian Forest.
Olomouc District
With snowmatsch today, riders must count towards the altitudes in the Olomouc district.
After the use of scattering vehicles, Schneematsch remains on the pass Červenohorské sedlo as well as on the road towards Videlský kříž.
Night snow drifts forced the road championships to operate, as reported by the road administration, there were about 3 cm of fresh snow in the Šumperk district.
In the other areas of the district, the roads are mostly unrestricted.
"In Šumperk, snow remains in the highlands.
On the pass Červenohorské sedlo, the drivers have to count towards Jeseník with snowmatsch," said one of Šumperk's employees today to the agency ČTK.
Their colleagues in the Jeseník County also had to get out at night, according to their data, the streets are free and wet to the heights after chemical treatment.
In the Olomouc district, the streets are fully accessible, but in the Šternberk district, the drivers have to drive carefully in forest sections, as the roads are still damp.
Ústí nad Labem District Liberec District
In northern Bohemia, the road champions report several poorly walkable road sections.
In addition to several places with snow or ice smoothing, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice is blocked in the district of Ústí n.K. according to the traffic police.
Temperatures remain below zero even in lower locations, so that snow and ice will stay on the streets. However, no problems are reported from the low plains, especially south-east of the Bohemian Central Mountains, and the roads are usually dry there.
No traffic disruptions have been reported so far.
Ice smoothing is reported in particular from the Štětí perimeter.
According to meteorologists, there were ideal conditions for this at night - rain and melting snow, cloudless sky and frost during the night.
Bad traffic conditions are reported from the main routes and from road I/13 at the border of the districts of Ústí n.L. and Liberec.
The blockage of the road between Telnice and Knínice was required due to branches pressed from the snow load to the road.
Šimon Ornest: At our concerts we want to collect positive energy
What do you think about it taking place in less than a month of the world's downfall?
This is one of those disaster reports that we people so much like to approach.
With our band The Tap Tap, we're rather funny about it and say that we're the only band in the world that can collect enough positive energy to stop or prevent the world's downfall.
In December, you will also realize a unique project with three concerts against the world's downfall.
Can you present the project to our readers?
This is a nationwide benefit event that we have been planning for two years.
To this end, we intend to use the marketing potential of the Maya calendar, whose end is predicted for December 21st at 11:10 a.m.
On the day before that, i.e. on December 20th, three concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava will take place at the same time.
The end of the concerts should be about the time that Kiribati is on the Pacific island, which is in a time zone of 12 hours ahead of us, ending Maya calendar.
Who did this idea come from?
Originally probably from me, then we designed the idea together with our graphic artist Honza Augusta.
Not only do we want to collect enough positive energy to prevent the world's downfall, but we also want to think together with the public about the state in which we once hand over this world to our children.
At the end of the Maya calendar, we have also developed a unique collection of shoes, T-shirts, bags and keychains against the world downhill, with which people can also support us via www.e-tap.cz.
The band The Tap Tap also, together with other performers, recorded the so-called hymn against the world downfall with the title "World downturn falls off".
Already today the hymn on YouTube is very popular. Will it also sound at the benefit concert?
Of course, and at the very end, provided that everything works and the end of the world does not take place...
The hymn is to be sung at the same time by all performers at all three concerts.
In addition, the hymns are transmitted live together in a direct circuit from the Czech television.
The text of the hymn comes from Tomáš Hanák, who also plays the main character of Jesus in the video clip, and Xindl X sings with...
How did you come to cooperation with both?
We also cooperate with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, which is linked to the realization of many benefits events and concerts...
We strive to involve these people intensively in our projects.
It has been shown that most people are interested in a collaboration with us, and have fun with it.
What is the purpose of the proceeds of the concerts against the downfall of the world?
For the establishment of the barrier-free educational centre Studeo, where we have been working together with the association Tap at the Jedlička-Institut for six years.
The students of the Jedlička Institute are regularly cared for by teachers who help them with different leisure activities.
Since the students themselves do not have the means to visit the lecturers, we would like to help them in this way.
As part of the completion of the Jedlička Institute, a separate building is to be created, in which we then move in with this project.
There are several groups and performers at each concert.
What criteria have you chosen for these?
We wanted to put together a program that addresses all generations including children.
In Prague, for example, Chinaski, support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý occur.
You can find out more on the website www.kpks.cz.
Are similar "large events" planned for the future?
In May we perform at the Prague Spring for the first time, and also for this concert we prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year we would like to be at the Czech House in New York, and I would like to associate this with appearances in Washington and Chicago, personally - if we are already in the United States.
Your foreign plans are not very small, so far you have appeared in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
However, The Tap Tap is a group that consists of people with disabilities.
How do you manage these trips logistically and organizationally?
It's not as bad as it seems at first sight.
Five of our members are wheelchair users, i.e. the wheelchairs must be transported in the luggage compartment. Furthermore, of course, we need to carry many instrument suitcases and other luggage with us...
Nevertheless, it has always worked without problems so far, ČSA and British Airways have always been very well prepared for us that I have sometimes wondered myself in part.
Even in Moscow, where we were recently, there were no problems.
Through your travel abroad you have a comparison of what it looks like in the individual countries with accessibility, how to deal with disabled people, etc.
How have you experienced these things so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities where everything works better than with us, we were just witnessing in Russia that in the East everything is still in its beginnings.
Opposite Prague Moscow is absolutely not disabled. There it is still unusual if someone is travelling in the wheelchair alone in the city center.
It is not even natural there to leave a wheelchair driver in the elevator, for example.
Luckily, there too are associations that try to point out the problems of people with disabilities.
And in what way do we have to catch up with the developed countries?
There's a lot of things we're hanging out with...
It should be noted, however, that improving the situation always depends on the efforts of those affected.
In London and Madrid, it is quite common for people with severe disabilities to move independently in the public area, go to the museum, use toilets, etc.
But it is not exactly common that a larger group of disabled people are actively involved in social events there, in which we are a little ahead of the West with the band The Tap!
Respect in the public and accessibility is one thing, but only when important athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers come from our ranks will things really start to change.
So far, these are only isolated cases of particularly willful personalities.
The Tap Tap is currently very popular. But if we go back a few years: What motivated you to create a band in 1998?
At that time I started working as a supervisor at the Jedlička Institute, where I met many young people who were interested in dealing with something intense.
And since I am a musician and I am playing saxophone myself, I have created a music-AG together with a colleague.
Well, and in time, as our moderator, Lá.a. Angelovič, is used to say, something out of control (laughs).
But didn't the band become known in recent years, or am I wrong?
It is true that cooperation with known singers has helped us, and we have also started to actively advertise for us.
We have become aware that if you do something and this is not to be seen outside, your own performance does not exist in a certain sense.
Thanks to the EU funding, we can also provide good teachers, high-quality equipment and so on.
Was it your goal to get it that far with The Tap?
From the beginning, I have felt the potential that you can deal with things differently.
In the show business, one often copies the other.
This is logical in his own way, as everything new is considered with caution and accepted only after a longer period of time.
There are only a few really unique things, and I dare to claim that Tap belongs to them.
The first impression that the viewer has most of the time is, of course, pity; that's only natural...
But this pity is absolutely superfluous because people with disabilities are not lonely and abandoned beings that we should regret.
It is people who can live and develop a full life if they have the means to do so.
I always say that if people with disabilities do something, this is not just a progress for themselves, but for the whole of society.
Was it also helpful for this success that you are a strict boss, as you hear from many people?
If you want to do something good, you cannot compromise in many things and you must also ask for a certain discipline.
This, however, is quite normal in my opinion.
Some come to us with romantic ideas, and then when they find that they have a test twice a week, have to complete preparatory phases and spend a lot of time on concert trips, then the enthusiasm disappears at many quickly.
But that's how it works everywhere, in every band that wants to work seriously and achieve something.
Currently, The Tap has twenty members.
How many of these were there from the beginning, i.e. since 1998?
Only one: Lá
We're an open group, people come and go, you can't stop that.
Whoever has the will and the desire to join in is always welcome with us.
Takes place on the day before the forecasted world downfall, Thursday, December 20, 2012 at 9 p.m.

Entrance costs 400 CZK, children up to 12 years free of charge, tickets are available in advance at Bohemia ticket.
Poland and space.
Last week, at a meeting of the Council of Ministers of the Member States of the European Space Agency, Poland was taken up as the 20th member of this Space Agency. Poland is thus the second member country from the former Eastern bloc (to the Czech Republic, which became ESA member on 12 November 2008.
Poland began close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and participated in several ESA projects in the following years.
Poland's way into space certainly began much earlier.
Even before the Second World War, Polish cosmos enthusiasts were engaged in space travel, but they did not always come up with understanding.
I remember here, for example, the lecture by A. Šternfeld of 6 December 1933 at the Warsaw Observatory, where the author presented thoughts from his pioneering work "Enterment to Cosmonautics".
However, the ideas of the young engineer (b. 1905) left the audience cold, and after years Šternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski had shown interest in his work.
Šternfeld won the Prix Rep-Hirsch, founded by Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch in 1934 for "entry to the cosmonautics".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became an important defender of astronomy and space.
In Polish magazines he published hundreds of articles and wrote several books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski's internationally recognized contribution to the development of space was appreciated, among other things, by the fact that one of the craters was named after him on the face of the moon.
Already in 1925, a rail-drailine was built in Poland, for which a rocket drive was planned.
Unfortunately, the author of the draft and the details of this project remained unknown.
It is not even clear whether the rocket should be used to start or brake the draisin.
The information for this purpose comes exclusively from the contemporary press.
In 1933 the Polish infantry began to deal with rocket-powered shots.
The research carried out by the Institute Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustaw Mokrykkiegi.
From the documents provided, it is clear that research has been conducted until the stage of practical testing.
The research was then interrupted by the invasion of the German Wehrmacht.
In 1937, the professional press of the design of a photoelectric hunting rocket by Ing. Rohoziński showed up, and in the following year the work "Rakieta - torpeda powietzrna i rakitobomba lotnicza" by author Leliwa-Krzywoblocky appeared.
Both projects dealt with the military use of rocket propulsion.
Shortly before the war, all projects for the military use of rocket technology were coordinated by the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Doradczo-Naukovy Committee).
The committee was set up in 1937, but after two years of activity, his work was completed from the beginning of the war.
The Polish Space Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne) published further articles on space following the war in the Polish press.
The first mention of this company is made in 1954 in the November issue of the magazine Problemy, in which four extensive articles of space travel are dedicated.
The article by Prof. M. Subotowicz contains the proposal to set up a space company.
At the time, there were already the first projects on satellite technology, and it was clear that exploration of space would have a future.
As early as 1956, the Polish space company PTA tried to join the International Space Federation, which was founded in 1951, and in fact the PTA became an ordinary member in the autumn of 1956.
In the following year, the first PTA president, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), was deputy chairman of the International Federation of Spaces.
He was in office until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA has played a significant role in the development of the highly successful meteorological rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), the first Polish rocket for scientific research.
The first type, the RM-1, was completed in 1957, the first start took place on October 10, 1958.
The rocket with a maximum flight height of 1800 m was about 80 cm long and did not weigh quite 5 kg.
Later an improved version, the RM-1A, was built, and in 1959 the Błędów desert began flight tests with the two-stage rocket RM-2.
The rocket was 1.4 m long and weighed about 11.5 kg.
Another level of development should already be able to do real scientific work - the RM-34 rocket should reach an altitude of up to 14.5 km and be used for monitoring altitude winds.
However, further development was discontinued in 1962.
Following the first RM rockets, the Meteor-1 missile was developed between 1962 and 1965.
The rocket was designed as a two-stage rocket, its overall length was 510 cm and its initial weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types of rocket were developed (meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), which differ in the size of the transport space for scientific instruments.
The Meteor-1A rocket has a 0.4-litre transport space with a capacity of 0.34 litres, Meteor-1B over 0.34 litres and Meteor-1C over 0.62 litres.
The maximum flight altitude was 37 km for all three types.
In the years 1965 to 1968, the Meteor-2 missile was developed in the Aviation Institute, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.
Meteor-2 had a take-off weight of 380 kg and was able to transport a payload of 10 kg to a height of about 60 km.
After that, the versions Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 were built.
It is also worth mentioning Poland's accession to the COSPAR Committee for Space Research in 1960, which followed the establishment of a national COSPAR Committee two years later.
Poland also participated in space research with Soviet satellites as part of the Interkosmos programme, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became second intercosmonaut to the Czech Vladimir Remek.
The repeal of the Non-Proliferation Act is no solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court lifted the law on non-profit activities.
This decision gave rise to a lively discussion in public.
It is certainly interesting to look at the problem from a broader perspective.
Liberal economic systems in the EU and in the globalised world are based on the principle of unregulated economic competition.
In the final effect, this means that the individual economies are in a permanent conflict.
The reason for this is the principle of free trade and the free, unrestricted movement of private capital, which goes hand in hand with blameless financial speculation.
Due to the great differences in the value of work (wages) price tensions occur.
This term refers to a condition in which the manufacturer tries to survive in economic competition by importing cheap goods by "substituting" competition in order to break down a larger market share and increase its profit.
To a large extent, this means for most companies to move or buy their production abroad cheaply, or to give up their business. The result is high unemployment in countries with comparable high labour costs.
Since private capital has no social responsibility and therefore no responsibility for the unemployment caused by it, it is necessary to increase public expenditure.
This situation is reinforced by the fact that the entrepreneurs are totally unwilling to pay their taxes and thereby replace the social and economic damage caused by them.
This situation is generally known, so that specific statistics are superfluous at this point.
The reckless practice of private capital creates a situation in individual economies in which governments are forced to compete in order to artificially reduce the social level of their own population and thereby attract foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments deliver their own people without regard for the social consequences of private capital.
This is expressed in particular in amendments to applicable laws.
The aim of these measures is to force one's own population to accept the dictates of private capital in particular in the pay-as-you-go sector.
On the one hand, it is through economic coercion in the case of long-term unemployment, on the other hand, by the curtailment of workers' rights.
The result is growing poverty, as well as increasing differences between the poor and the rich.
In Germany, there have been public food tax offices for some years for poor people who are no longer able to feed themselves through their own work.
The number of people affected is already in the millions.
In the course of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, there are regular cases in which workers receive such a low wage that the state has to raise its income to a minimum of existence.
Such a scandal was also discovered in the case of auxiliary workers employed in the German Bundestag.
The austerity measures of virtually all EU countries will undoubtedly run out to the same state where people are forced to emigrate (as it was in the 19th century) under the pressure of a catastrophic drop in their social level, or for hunger pay at the edge of society, hoping that someday private investment capital will flow to the country.
This naturally raises the question of where this capital comes from?
When it comes from another EU country, poverty only migrates from one country to another; or capital remains intact, because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco or Egypt or Africa, employees work for a fraction of European wages at all.
This concerns the whole of Latin America.
Liberal theories and media claim that the state must not participate with capital in its own economy, and that the planned economy leads to an economic disaster.
Private capital strongly insists on its view that the State should not intervene in the economy.
But then one has to wonder whether private capital does not influence politics and therefore the whole state in its own selfish sense or even direct it.
Here is the clear answer: Yes.
The proof of this is the existence of a practically almighty and omnipresent lobby in all states.
The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, mutual advantage, legislation in which virtually everything is hard, but nothing punishable.
In Germany, the situation is such that a government ministry is responsible for the lack of finance for private legal companies closely linked to the industry with the preparation of draft laws.
These draft laws are subsequently passed in the Bundestag.
All violence is no longer based on the people, as the Western constitutions proclaim it, but on strong financial groups that prefer their own interests.
Evidently, the liberal democracies are rapidly entering a situation as they describe Appian in his work on the crisis of the Roman Republic at the time of Caesars and Pompeii': "The state has been in decay for a long time, and the offices have been occupied with violence.
Against lubricating money, by illegal objugation of advantages or with stone and sword.
Corruption grew relentlessly, and the people went to the elections with already bought voices" ... "People with character did not hold office for offices, so that the state had no consulate for eight months as a result of this decline" ... "You really started to talk about the fact that the only medicine in this difficult situation was a sole rule, and that a strong man had to be elected" ... Appian thought of Pompeius, but the strong man was then Caesar, who permanently replaced democracy by the sole rule.
Today’s society, as well as antiquity, is founded on the reckless preference of its own advantage, without paying attention to the interests of society as a whole.
By its very nature, private capital is not able to recognise and enforce the advantage for the entire society.
The result, today as it was then, is an unprecedented decadence of the elites who are not trying to make deeper reforms in the least.
The cause of fascism and communism must therefore be sought in the ruthless liberalisation of economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
From today's state, the downfall of these regimes in favour of liberal democracies can be seen as a certain break in which the next round is already taking place.
Especially catastrophic is the fact that today's elites are facing the potential loss of hundreds of thousands of lives in the future, the humanitarian and social catastrophes of which we are witnesses today, as well as the crimes against humanity, as we know them from the past and recent history, in complete ignorance.
The repeal of the Non-Proliferation Act is not a solution here, at least not a permanent one.
Under the pressure of global and European economic competition, the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways to push down the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The only solution is targeted political-social reforms which increase the state's participation in the economy, increase the influence of citizens on the government and weaken the monopoly of private capital in society in favour of the state.
Israel: Laboratory of Chaos.
"...that nothing is created by violence, or could ever arise," Sting sings in the song Fragile, whose most important verse in the chorus is, "...that we may not forget how fragile we are."
"If my sons didn't want war, there wouldn't be any," says the dying Gutele Schnapper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, in 1849.
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, there was, as always, an innumerable number of reactions.
The one stand behind Israel and argue with his right to self-defense, while they call the Palestinians terrorists; the other, in turn, support the Palestinians, argue with the racism of the Israeli state, with the genocide committed on the Palestinian Arabs, and call the State Israel terrorist.
At this point I do not want to write about who is the culprit and victim in this ever-returning wave of killing; ultimately today's inhabitants of Israel, including the self-government areas, have been introduced into the current political situation and have not experienced the beginning of violence itself.
It is my concern to open to readers the view behind the scenes, the view of whom the 95 years of tension (calculated from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) are primarily useful in the small spots of the Middle East country.
My thoughts are partly based on accessible historical facts, others are derived from them and are based on my own understanding of who or what group of people has a significant influence on the events of modern history.
The history of mankind is primarily a story of the struggle for power.
In every epoch we can make an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is less obvious is whether it was really always those personalities themselves who set their steps autonomously, or whether they were behind their throne someone who directed their actions toward a pre-determined goal.
We must admit that we are living in a time when the wealth of the world is concentrated in the hands of fewer individuals, and that this concentration of money and the resulting power has not arisen within the life span of a generation.
Among these astronomically rich families there is a particular one that could be described as the head of the crow (I don't know if anyone is standing over them, but I don't shut this down) - the Rothschilds.
A lot isn't written about her.
Understandably.
The first press agency (Reuters) was purchased by the Rothschilds already in the 90s of the 19th century in order to prevent the link between their name and highly criminal acts, in the background of which was always the strengthening of their power, the proliferation of their assets or both.
The Rothschilds are involved in almost all the central banks of the world, and against the countries in which they are not involved in the central banks they wage wars or fight against them (before the attack on Afghanistan there were 7 countries, after the attack on Iraq there were 5 countries, after which Ghaddafis fell only four, while Russia in the meantime subjected its central bank to the Russian government).
Whoever tried to oppose this family had to pay with life for it.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew Rothschild's Bank of America's status as central bank, began to issue his own bank notes during the civil war and was murdered in a theater in 1865.
J.F. Kennedy began to issue his own banknotes and wanted to abolish the FED - he was murdered in 1963; member Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after he tried to sue the FED for triggering the world economic crisis in 1929.
In 1859 - 1871, Rothschild’s global guise of power led to the formulation of a plan to defuse three world wars by Albert Pik, a Freemason of 33rd and thus the highest degree of knowledge.
The first war had the aim of eliminating the great monarchist states of Europe, the second war was to break Britain's colonial rule in particular, and the third war was to reduce the world population to about 0.5 - 1 billion people (a number of these would provide for their conveniences and their luxury and would not consume so many resources), create a universal religion (Ecumenism is nothing more than the premise here) and eventually lead to the takeover of absolute power.
The method by which the group of the richest families work with the Rothschilds is the trigger of a crisis and the subsequent offer of a solution (order from chao - order from chaos).
These solutions, however, are wrong and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see the founding of the FED so that crises such as those triggered by them in 1907 do not recur).
After they had succeeded in triggering the First World War by the murder of Ferdinand the Habsburg Successor in Sarajevo, they destroyed the Russian Tsar Empire by the revolution of the Bolsheviks.
The First World War ended with the sudden, militarily and economically unfounded capitulation of Germany (for the destruction of the Russian tsarist empire, the war was no longer necessary), then the dissolution of the Austrian Grand Power was followed.
In order to facilitate the simplification of the Second World War, the bankers through politics had a latent conflict situation created by occupying Germany with gigantic war repairs; they created the condition of impoverished masses, so that they only had to subjugate a sufficiently strong leader to the Germans, who offered the debtors named and simple solutions; another factor was the creation of the multi-ethnic state of Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, which should take on the function of a fifth column and also took on the task of evading the fire of war.
At the end of the 19th century, Rothschild initiated the establishment of the Zionist movement, in which a branch sought the establishment of a Jewish state, as far as possible in the historical territory of Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour Declaration already mentioned created the prerequisite for mass immigration from Jews to Palestine; there were first clashes with the indigenous Arab population.
Terrorist attacks occurred on both sides.
The Second World War broke out, and whether Hitler broke free from the chain at which the international bankers had initially held him, or whether everything was going according to plan, is only difficult to estimate, in any case the suffering of the European Jews in the concentration camps created the prerequisite for the recognition of the Jewish state by the international community.
Israel was founded in 1948, and as the war repairs against Germany were prepared for the ground for the Second World War, the proclamation of the State of Israel represents the creation of the focal point for the Third World War.
If the international bankers succeed in unleashing this war, the Jewish people will become the victims in the front line of the war, this time together with the Arab and Muslim populations of the Middle East, similar to World War II.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of strife and chaos, not only in the country itself, but also internationally (you just think of how sharply the people of Israel divided into supporters and opponents).
Who is the guilty one and who is the victim in the conflict between Palestinians and Israelis, where injustice only triggers injustice in an endless spiral of violence, with the greed of individuals and their pursuit of global power at the beginning?
One has to distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and their leadership here, but the international bankers in Israel, as well as with us, the people, are exclusively choosing their own candidates.
The current Prime Minister of Israel, the Falcone Netanyahu, is a typical example of a fascist attack by international bankers loyally engaged politicians who do all they can to facilitate a war with Iran, which, in view of Iran's membership in the Shanghai Organisation for Cooperation (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), could rapidly expand into a global conflict, and which could lead to a destruction of the world economy due to Iran's control of the only 2 miles wide road of Hormus, which runs over 20% of global oil supplies.
In what light are the words of David Rockefeller from 1994: "The only thing we need is an all-encompassing crisis, and people will welcome the new world order."
In its conception, the new world order is a world of lords and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the human population serves a small group of financial aristocrats.
A world in which every newborn is implanted at birth a chip to subdue this being of total control.
"And it makes for the little ones and the great ones, the rich and the poor, the free and the servants all to give themselves a sign to their right hand or to their foreheads that no one can buy or sell, because he has the sign of paint, namely the name of the animal or the number of his name.
Here is wisdom: he that hath understanding considereth the number of the beast.
For it is the number of a man, and his number is six hundred and sixty-six."
The movie Argo: If it's the worst, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a mob of demonstrative Islamist students occupied the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats as hostages.
For their release, they demanded the delivery of the overthrown Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who had fled to the USA after the revolution, who had preserved the patronage over his regime for decades.
For the American government there was no positive way out of this situation - it could not afford to throw the Shah overboard, as this would have seriously damaged the trust of its allies in other countries.
At the same time, she was unable to enforce the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution resulted in the establishment of a theocratic regime.
It was a heavy blow to the reputation of the united states, and the subsequent fiasco in the violent attempt of the liberation of the hostages only made everything worse.
After 444 days of negotiations by the Algerian Government, the diplomats arrested were finally released.
The fate of the hostages called out at home a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian moods.
The debacle in Iran contributed significantly to Jimmy Carter's defeat against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential elections.
The film Argo by director and actor Ben Affleck describes an episode of this story that gave the US a small victory.
Six ambassadors immediately managed to flee from the occupation of the message.
This ended after many complications in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities, managed to bring the refugees from Iran, helping them with an extravagant story to cover their true identity - they traveled with Canadian passports barred as members of a film staff who allegedly visited film locations in the country for a science fiction film.
Combination of genres
The plan developed by the expert for "Exfiltration", Tony Mendez, also made the collaboration of Hollywood necessary.
To make the tarnung credible, article about this film project appeared in specialist journals, there were press conferences held, and the fictitious production company had a real office.
The details of this operation were kept secret for a long time, and the film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck's film is a special combination of several film genres.
On the one hand, he is a realistic politthriller, but also a so-called "Caper Movie", i.e. the story of a successful housekeeper's piece, such as the film Ocean's Eleven.
This changes the mood levels in the film - on one side the documentary scenes from Tehran (in the title sequence iconic contemporary photographs are shown, and also in the film version of the same situations there are no major differences).
On the other hand, the loose passages from Hollywood, which are ironically and easily overstretched, are coming.
And then there are the scenes from the CIA Central and other institutions - men in suits at the meeting table, on the halls, on the telephone...
Ben Affleck has achieved a remarkable relaunch of his career with this film.
From a smiled actor has become a respectable director, and also as an actor he is no longer the goal of ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film after the Crimea No children's play (Gone Baby Gone, 2007) and the Thriller City without mercy (2010).
At the same time it is Affleck's first film that does not play in the home Boston director's Boston.
The feeling for the atmosphere of the place was one of the characteristics of the previous films of this director from the standard Hollywood.
But Afleck also proves this feeling in Argo, where Tehran is "played" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film play in the streets and show the reconstruction of events that have really taken place - the entrance sequence of the embassies is very impressive in their clarity, and nevertheless conveys the feeling of confusion and unpredictability that occurs when the story moves somewhere.
Affleck has a similar effect with his team also on fictional scenes (the false film staff on a bass player in Tehran).
Too much action in too many places
The director also had to deal with the fact that history does not actually offer many exciting scenes in the cinematic sense.
But with the few he works quite successfully, sometimes helping the reality a little - which then doesn't always seem so elegant (the scenes in which the threatening crisis at the airport in Tehran is turned away from a telephone call in America, or also the persecution hunt on the runway, seem somewhat artificial).
The weakness of Argo is its all too wide spread, which is required by the need to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in their roles as Hollywood employees, but their figures would have earned more space, and therefore they are far from alone in the film.
Affleck’s film thereby loses a bit of traction. It is a film that can be followed with a certain interest and the design and retro style of a thriller from the 70th year.
However, it is difficult to inspire enthusiasm.
However, as a reminder of a piece of history living to this day in a certain way and as proof of how the notions of the almighty and all-knowing intelligence are, it is sufficient.
Guidelines for inflating balloons, for bananas and for the circus
This year, the server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, who every year calls a survey on the most absurd bank charges, decided to organise the competition "The most absurd regulation or idea from the EU workshop".
"This idea was inspired by the recent plan presented by the EU to introduce a 40% women's ratio in the management of large European companies," said Patrik Nacher, who takes care of the organisation of this survey, to the Právo newspaper.
Among the listed absurdities, for example, is the judgment of the European Court of Justice on the uniformisation of insurance rates for men and women.
Until then, women enjoyed an advantage in life insurance because they pose an objective lower risk to insurance companies.
"Further incredible incidents from the EU workshop can be nominated by the end of this year.
The actual vote will take place by the end of February 2013", Nacher announced.
Among the controversial EU regulations are the binding addition of bioethanol to fuels which, as a consequence, are harmful to the natural environment, the prohibition of reliable mercury thermometers only because they contain a relatively small quantity of this dangerous substance, or the directive on the size of chicken cages, because of which eggs were significantly more expensive this year.
Criticism in the past also reaped the actual prohibition of the use of the term "butter spread" or the sale ban for conventional light bulbs.
Bananas must be 14 cm long
The EU apparat often decides under the pressure of this or that commercial and industrial lobby, whose claims are usually represented in Brussels by one or more member countries (for example, the Czech Republic is currently trying to enforce the claims of Czech banks with Veto threats too).
Lobby interests also argued that bananas of the highest class must be at least 14 cm long in the EU and must not have "clamping anomaly".
In doing so, the European Commission defended the argument that it merely harmonises the divergent national standards that would hinder trade.
The EU's standards on fruit and vegetables have already been raised against the resistance of some countries, pointing out that the previous directives would lead to food waste.
A candidate for victory in this survey may be the EU regulation of the past year, which according to balloons must be provided with the indication that children under the age of eight must not blow up the balloon without adult supervision.
The EU called for an American study, which according to balloons is the leading cause of child suffocation.
A similar restriction already applies to children up to 14 years of age in the use of annual market straws.
Curiosis there are also at home
Relatively absurd is also a directive which affects European officials themselves - anyone who has an official function in the EU must not use the name Macedonia because of the sensitivity of the theme for Greece and must instead say FYROM (Former Yugoslavia Republic of Macedonia).
The server Bankovnípoplatky.com, in cooperation with the Liberal Economist Laissez Faire, also nominated the EU regulation on the size of food stocks in the territory of a Member State in addition to the above-mentioned absurdities.
The EU thus established the maximum volume of food stocks that could be found on the day of our accession to the European Union in the Czech Republic.
For example, the Czech Republic exceeded the fixed volume of mushroom canning, for which we were threatened with a high fine.
The survey organizers were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should receive money for not having a sea, or the idea of giving grants for applications for funding.
These ideas, of course, did not come from Brussels, but from Prague.
"We are disadvantaged by the fact that we have no sea.
We will apply for a refund from the EU," said Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) Minister of Agriculture in autumn 2004.
As an argument, he argued that the grain harvest was very high and the state stocks were overcrowded as a result of the so-called intervention purchases.
As the Czech Republic has another way to sea ports, according to Palas, the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
Finally, the European Commission met the Czech Republic so far that it organised a tender for the purchase of cereals from countries which do not have access to the sea.
Funding payments for applications for funding funds offered to the municipalities the Ministry of Regional Development under the direction of Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), in particular should be devoted to setting up funding applications in Brussels.
EU: Bizarre Regulations are the exception
While regulations in the Member States are easily targeted at criticism, some experts believe that the EU's efforts to regulate and thus also to ensure the effectiveness and development of the European Union as a whole deserve recognition.
According to these experts, a more serious problem is the EU funding for projects which have nothing at all in common with the deepening of European integration, but which have been forced into the budget negotiations of individual Member States.
Emotions in this area also highlight the fact that, like other Member States in Brussels, the Czech Republic must fight for the right to use specific terms of traditional products and this struggle does not always win.
Although the Czech Republic could defend the name "Olomoucké tvarůžky" after a six-year struggle with Germany and Austria, the Inländerrum (Tuzemský rum), whose tradition dates back to the 19th century, our producers had to rename themselves to "Tuzemák".
The designation Rum may only be used for products made of sugar cane distillate, not for products made of sugar beet.
In the official list of products registered in the EU, the company of world-famous cheeses of Feta and Gorgonzola, Lübecker Marzipans and Parmaschinken now also shows the Karlsbader Zwieback, carp from Pohořelice and Třeboň, or the Saazer Hopfen.
With an EU mark, the Pardubicer can breast-feed or the Hořicer rolls.
"People want me to save the Republic, but I'm just an amateur," Okamura claims.
Mr Senator, how do you come up with the idea of running for the President's office?
It's not about me being Senator or President.
If everything were going to work in our country without problems, I wouldn't run anywhere.
But I can no longer look at how the Republic has been looted for 20 years, how thieves walk around freely, while people are being taxed and pensioned.
I had no ambition to become a politician.
But if I see something I don't like, then I'm trying to suggest a solution to change this.
And since I am already over 40, and independent and impartial, I have no other way of influencing matters than to run the office of a senator or president.
You did it in the Senate and then you went straight to the castle.
Don't you turn your voters back on this?
I've been telling myself all along that I'm going to take up the fight for the castle after the Senate elections.
Later on, I made this point and said that I would be running for the office of President if I were to be elected Senator.
But my goal is not the function. The function is an instrument with which I can realize my visions.
I need as much influence as possible and a mandate as strong as possible.
The difficulty, however, is not only that we, as a people, are mocking in the pub and in front of the TV, but that we are making up everyone who wants to change something.
In addition, the media that want to rob you of honor and that confuse the freedom of the word with freedom.
For example, it was claimed that I would bribe journalists or that I was a consultant to Jiří Paroubek.
Let's talk about your visions.
You have taken up the fight for the castle with the thesis of the material and criminal liability of politicians as well as with retroactive asset declarations over 20 million crowns.
To do so, you need to change laws.
As President, you have no competence in this regard, and only the Senate as a whole can make legislative proposals.
How are you going to solve this problem?
As a simple citizen, I have worked to ensure that the travel guide remains a free trade, and this can be achieved.
The problem is small-minded politics - if someone comes from the right or from the left with a good proposal, this is deliberately rejected, and that only stops the population.
As an independent partyless person, I have a much greater potential to gain support from all the parties represented in Parliament.
My advantage is that without drawer thinking and party doggs, I can take from every party what is best for our country.
Do you see yourself as a person in politics rather on the right or on the left?
From a Czech point of view, it seems to me that people see me on the left.
But for me, this right-left thinking is completely unimportant.
For me, it's important that we move on.
It's not about whether someone belongs to the left or right camp; I want to connect the people.
I publicly support every good solution, even if it comes from the KSČM or from the ODS, and so will I turn against bad ideas.
You don't like it when someone calls you populists.
But don't you confirm by what you just said?
If you set up a business plan in a company, then you also have an ideal goal and a vision.
And you want to get closer to this.
I think this is a populism, but all the suggestions I have spoken about already work in the world, or they have been discussed by important experts.
But without Parliament's support, you're just left with keywords.
And that will not make you far away in politics in the long term.
Or do you think that if you talk to people for long enough, you will succeed in enforcing, for example, the material and criminal liability?
I have no other option.
Politicians, journalists and the public to convince and try to bring them to our side in order to achieve these goals.
As President, it would be no problem for me to invite the presidents of parliamentarians live on television to anchor the material and criminal liability of politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
And the speakers would then have to say, if necessary, why they would reject this.
A strong personality that points to malice can exert pressure on the political scene.
Take only once the direct election of the President, who was a merit of public pressure.
I'm quite clear that I'm an amateur; I'm neither a genius nor an intellectual.
I'm trying to find allies for my views and visions.
With politics, I have just started and tried to find support for my programme for the majority.
I'm always trying to judge things myself; and if it doesn't work, I'll go back to the private sector in six years.
That sounds a little like Okamura was supposed to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know that I alone can't reach anything; that's why I've talked to several known personalities about whether they don't want to run for the Senate either.
For example, I spoke to Radim Jančura, but he refused because of work overload.
I also supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, who discovered the fraud in the trade with light heating oil.
My candidacy began with the condition that people are deeply dissatisfied, but now I am not sure.
Sixty percent of the voters have not gone to the elections at all, and those who have gone have mostly elected representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate, we're only two independents.
People have chosen such a Senate composition that changes will be very difficult to enforce.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my visions, e.g. for the direct election of the mayors and governors.
Think about setting up your own party?
I have not thought about it yet because I have no time to review the past of any potential party member, nor do I have the money for it.
I don't even have money for the president's campaign yet; in my transparent account there are only 20,000 CZK.
You don't have any money?
You speak of property declarations, how do you look?
I estimate my private assets at about CZK 60 million.
In Prague, I have a land worth 25 million, an apartment for about 10 million, another for 8 million, an art collection worth about 10 million, as well as an Aston Martin for 3.5 million and a Škodu Superb worth about one million. And then I have a few million left in the account.
By the way, Aston Martin was a child's dream - James Bond always liked me, as he was driving in the car, was gallant to women and at the same time fought evil.
You drive an Aston Martin, you have 60 million assets and you don't have any money for your campaign?
You say you want to change the Republic, but you don't want to invest your own money in it.
That's not exactly convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Do you want me to make a debt?
I've already put 2.5 million into the campaign.
The fact that I don't have sponsors shows that my program probably doesn't arouse too much interest.
And I am not obliged to deny the campaign from my own means.
The cost of the campaign is basically covered by my salary as a senator.
But I couldn't live alone from the senator's salary, so I couldn't finance my son's English school, which costs 30,000 a month.
If I just wanted to make money, I wouldn't stand for anything.
So do you continue to work as an entrepreneur to get your results?
Didn't you say you were going to go back to these activities?
But this is not related to the level of the salary.
As promised, I partially went back to my activities.
For example, my alternate will be managing director of the travel agency in spring.
People want to see me as a Samaritan who saves the Republic.
But I have to live on something.
What monthly income were you used to as an entrepreneur?
About 200,000 to 400,000, and that is still the case.
As President, however, I would like to take a firm stand.

The MVRDV architects prove that the true adventures are not just in the head - using the example of Spijkenisse and the recently built Bücherberg - 2 photos
"I find the building funny, it looks futuristic, and at last there's something interesting to see again," says Lisette Verhaig, a passant on the roadside.
And Stefan Spermon, IT technician in a nearby big business, says, "But, it's okay, the house."
But I wonder what we still need a library for today.
All have Internet, iPad and e-books.
No one goes to one of these old-style libraries on a voluntary basis today, right?
Spijkenisse, a town of sleep in Rotterdam, which is hardly in need of a visit, is a remarkable record holder.
The 80,000-resident community has the lowest education rate in the whole of the Netherlands.
In order to counteract this stupid circumstance, a few years ago, it was decided to contribute to general education and to rebuild the seven fictitious bridges depicted on the Eurolights as pretty brushed steel concrete miniatures.
The success of the educational offensive was limited.
And so the city fathers realized that there was only one way to become the master of statistics: a library had to come!
Winy Maas from the Rotterdam architecture office MVRDV, master of the awesome bar diagrams and producer of funny, yes often cynical buildings, took the matter with customary serenity and appeared at the competition hearing anno 2003 with five books under his arm and a grin on his face.
And while the jury was still suspicious of itself and shrouded with the axles, the frightful Maas piled his exquisite contribution of size to a pyramid and finished his actionistically reinforced speech with the words: "Dear Township!"
So he is, my proposal for the Boekberg of Spijkenisse, for the so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the 30 million euros mountain has been broken up.
It is part of a renovation project, including underground garage, supermarket, post office and a few adjacent residential and row houses with a total of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November, the Bücherberg was awarded the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project is nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
This means that the faceless small-town resorts, which to date had no more to offer than a postmodern pedestrian zone and a stateless ugly town hall, behind whose white facades one would tend to suspect a dairy factory, in order to enrich a piece of contemporary architecture.
But above all, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in the history of its existence.
The long way to the book
The first impression: Büchereldorado under Käseglocke.
There is a lift that leads through the middle of the mountain massif, but the true sense of space and reading can be found when climbing the topography.
The glazed interior is bright and clear, the burnt clinker floor and the elegant street lights clearly speak the language of a public city square.
The urban ambience is perfect.
You already look out for parkbank, dog and football playing boys and girls.
And everywhere books, books, books.
"Normally, the bookshelves stand along the façade, and in the middle is a large, dark space, which is usually tireless and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
We put the classic room configuration on the head and pushed the reading area from inside to outside.
The interior of the Bücherberg is used skillfully: in the middle are offices, Internet library, chess club, environmental center and house technology center.
A special pleasure are the black bookshelves, which sometimes are wall paneling, sometimes brothing, sometimes scaffolding.
Optics, haptics and smells are foreign.
Even incarcerated architects and civil engineers shake their heads about the unknown building material.
"We wanted to work with recycling materials here," explains Joop Trouborst, project manager at the municipality of Spijkenisse, on request of the standard.
And so one day we have encountered a suitable agricultural waste product in a French farm.
For many years, a millimetre-thin plastic fleece has been used in greenhouses in the Netherlands and in fields as a root layer.
This is cheap and time-efficient.
The thin textile lasts one, two seasons, after which it is ripe for the barrier trash.
For the library, for the first time in these quantities, the fleece was pressed to four centimeters thick plates.
Under heat and pressure, the so-called agricultural plastic (KLP) becomes a dark, homogeneous, loadable material that smells a bit like new cars and a bit of sports shoes.
After 105 steps you have reached the summit.
At the end of the almost 500-metre-long hike, the Literaturcafé is not only rewarded with a fantastic view of the city, but also with Dutch croquets and cultivated ficus trees.
They provide atmosphere, but above all provide the right humidity in the literature mountains.
Donations for the New Soul
"You wouldn't believe it, but despite the many glass surfaces, this house is a demonstration project in co-ecto ecology," says Trouborst.
Warm and cooled with earth heat.
Although the Bücherberg is under a glass crash, even on sunny days the sun just shines inside.
The broad wooden glue binders, which stand across the glass facade, serve as shading and capture a large part of the sun's radiation.
The room climate is very pleasant.
The rest are doing fully automatic rollos.
Stefan Spermon, the initial skeptic from the IT industry, already ventured to the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was there too.
And also the TCM teacher Cynthia Bogarde, who even describes the Boekenberg as the last "overdue soul".
The reason: For the opening a few weeks ago, every resident was invited to donate a book from his personal inventory.
For the time being, this is to fill the optical gaps in the library - currently 70,000 pieces - which has not yet been fully installed.
The concept has begun.
The shelves are filled up to the top.
"Nothing is worse than a half-empty library," says architect Winy Maas.
"I think, thanks to our invitation, every resident now has a certain relationship with this new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
And if only it is for adornment.
This led MVRDV to succeed in the king's discipline, which is called identity foundation in the Vachjargon.
Spijkenisse wrote the history of literature.
So young and uneducated she may be.
This is at last a starting point for identity.
Szabo: "Germans must play a bigger role"
Germany abstained in the vote on the inclusion of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, expert on US-European relations, Berlin is balancing on a narrow diplomatic level.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany had initially signaled that it would vote against the request for an observer status of the Palestinians in the United Nations.
But then Berlin was evaded.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis did in Gaza.
Now, however, Germany must be careful because of its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I don't think it supports the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - without, however, being too critical of Israel.
During the insurrection in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it was about setting up a flight ban zone.
This was finally enforced by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on important international issues?
Yes, that's right.
That is because it is precisely transforming its foreign policy and away from a policy that was so to speak managed by the United States, towards a German foreign policy.
It is a challenge that Europeans do not have a coherent and unified policy.
The Germans thus find themselves between the fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they are still pressing for their role, but they are on their way to a more "normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy as they have France or Great Britain.
What exactly does a "normal" foreign policy mean from a German point of view?
It shows the willingness to take positions with national interests, which are independent of those of the US or European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, i.e. by exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are to a certain extent different from those of the other major powers and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Did these economic interests influence the attitude of the Middle East conflict and the UN vote?
First, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf States.
Therefore, it must be careful not to confront the public, but also the elite, in the Arab countries.
It certainly plays a role.
But I wouldn't want to attach too much weight to it either, that's not a completely one-sided relationship.
But it certainly plays an important role in German considerations.
Has Germany damaged its relations with the United States by abstaining in important decisions, for example in voting on Palestine?
I believe that there is a great deal of understanding of the German position in Europe and even in the USA.
Therefore, I do not believe that this was such a dramatic break as in the Libyan question.
Perhaps Germany will even show some respect.
It signals that as an international player it must be taken seriously and its interests must be considered.
There are various opinions on the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
The United States, on the other hand, has clearly voted for a veto.
Are there differences of opinion between the United States and many European nations?
Because of American domestic policy, these differences have always existed.
I believe that the Obama government has quite an understanding of the European position in secret.
But due to the political situation here, the government cannot, of course, publicly represent this position.
I believe that the actual differences of opinion are not as big as they always appear.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, then Obama is not so half-witted by Netanyahu's politics.
Is it difficult for Germany to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the United States on the one hand, and the position of the main partners in the EU on the other?
I think that makes it so difficult for the Germans.
It would, of course, be a little easier for the Germans if there were a coherent and uniform European policy, which is not at present the case.
So they can't be part of a wider line and have to push things out of their own position instead.
That's what they're doing with the euro.
I believe that in the future Germany will play a leading role in pushing Europe into a European position.
Of course, this is not easy for Germany, because of the relationship with Israel.
That's always been a sensitive topic.
But I think the Germans are aware that they need to play a more independent role.
Does Germany itself see itself in the role of an important international player - does Germany want to play a leading role at all?
Or does Germany still have a difficult leadership role?
Germany is not yet used to it, it is still unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult for the country to play a greater role.
For example, if we look at the euro crisis, every time Germany assumes a greater role, different anti-German feelings become free.
That doesn't make it easy for the Germans.
This is actually the old problem: you do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
Germany is in a much more difficult position than the USA.
It must be receptive to various neighbors and opinions and that is not easy.
Now the influence of the US in European policy is steadily diminishing, but the EU is not filling this vacuum at the moment, who else is there?
The Germans will simply have to play a bigger role.
Even if they do not like it, it is unpleasant to them and makes them much more unpopular - c'est la vie!

"Markenschutz" in China: When Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani is a world famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren too.
But what is Armani Polo?
A name officially registered in China is hidden behind it, but it has nothing to do with the original companies.
Nevertheless, it enjoys protection for as long as the real namemakers do not complain.
And even then it's not clear whether they're getting right.
"It is becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," says Thomas Pattloch, lawyer at Taylor Wessing law firm, who specializes in protective violations in Fernost.
Every week, a new case lands on my desk.
A few additional letters are already sufficient for the followers to register their trademarks.
Thus, from Gucci simply Lu-Gucci, instead of Prada you have Prada-Kny registered.
German companies are also legally copied in this way, for example the sports product manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens a folder with registrations from the trademark office in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company had the trademark Zegna DF Puma protected, an art name that was also used at the Ermenegilgo Zegna fashion house.
It is known that the Chinese world champions are in copying and in injured intellectual property.
In the big cities there are multi-storey department stores that sell almost exclusively fakes.
However, Pattloch's cases are different: On behalf of his clients, he argues that Chinese companies are officially granted the right to use a name that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call the Bang Mingpai, a passenger stamp.
The word is based on Bang Dakuan.
This means women who fish for rich men.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt
"This is business-damaging, you have to fight it," Pattloch asks.
"The brand is watered down, the single setting disappears, the image damage is enormous."
The financial failures and process costs of the industries concerned go to the millions, especially in the case of expensive presentation products.
According to the market research company CLSA, China is the third largest luxury product market and the fastest growing volume of 15 billion euros per year.
However, erasures of dubioser entries in the trademark register are difficult to reach and go into money.
Up to nine years, the procedure can proceed with uncertain outcome.
Pattloch reports on cases in which the court rejected complaints because after the long duration of the contested name, it had become "market ethics".
If the plaintiff has bad luck, he even has to pay the plagiarist because he violated his brand in China, says Pattloch.
Sometimes the law of the jungle prevails here.
Famous cases also concern graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal dispute with the construction machinery manufacturer Sany, the company that recently took over the German concrete pump builder Putzmeister.
The Chinese may therefore still use an emblem similar to the Mercedes star.
The Volvo buyer Geely originally used a blue-white logo that reminded BMW; the dispute was settled, Geely had to change it.
The fashion manufacturer Lacoste lost in China against imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore, who let the famous crocodile look in the other direction.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
The CTMO brand office in Beijing admits that there had been bottlenecks in 2010 due to insufficient personnel and space equipment.
Last year, however, the "emergency situation in the course of work has returned to normality".
Thus, the existence of unprocessed opposition proceedings would have fallen by 22 percent.
Almost 57,000 such cases were completed, 75 percent more than in the previous year.
Nevertheless, 81,500 petitions are still waiting for completion in the office.
On the other hand, it costs a lot.
As often in China, the figures are impressive.
Last year, CTMO received more than 1.4 million applications for trademark protection, almost one third more than in 2010.
This is a record and indicates that China is following the list of applications worldwide for the tenth consecutive time, the Authority informs.
This also applies to the stock of all valid trademarks, a total of 5.5 million pieces.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan had been charged.
This means that each registration on average costs 1280 yuan or 160 euros.
On the other hand, it costs a lot, as the case of the German family company Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the Group has been fighting a Chinese plagiator.
Although the Germans were able to achieve that its illegal manufacture of imitated motor vehicle parts was outlawed.
However, the imitator continued to secure the Chinese rights on the Freudenberg brand.
It was not possible to protect family names in Germany itself, says Hanno Wenzler, Chairman of the Management Board of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The trademark office CTMO also rejected the opposition of the Munichers.
In the next two instances Freudenberg got right, but the object of the trial continues to fight.
You have to be careful.
Now the matter is pending before the Supreme Court.
Wenzler is confident in bringing the matter to a good conclusion, and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says, "The process is extremely elaborate and costs us a lot of time, money and nerves."
The internal costs could hardly be estimated, the company archive had even had to look through a hundred-year-old files in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg offered the opposite side in vain a "high six-digit euro amount" to settle.
"There you can see how much this is worth to us," says Wenzler.
The dangers in Fernost are even threatening to drift back to Europe.
Well, then, if Imitators secure unprotected marks there.
Thus, a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather.
This business area has long since ceased to exist, but he was still able to withdraw the registration.
"You have to watch out in hell," says Wentzler.
Both he and the lawyer Pattloch advise German companies to be very careful in business with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark rights, but the foreigners should also register in China, as Wentzler says.
Otherwise, it can be much more expensive than registration.
In fact, if Freudenberg was subject to his trademark drama in the last act, then one would probably have to pay the opposite license fees for one's own name, explains Wenzler.
Or we will be forced out of the market in the segment in question.
World Aid Day: Stamping, Singing, Help
In Heidelberg, the choir Imbongi - and in Swaziland are looking forward to it.
The story of a connection that overcomes well over 8733 kilometers.
First there is the stamp: Cowboy boots, basketball shoes, women's pumps and men's slipper are looking for the beat on the parquet floor, finding it quickly.
One-two-three-four.
Then the voices of the singers slowly swell - old, bass, tenor and soprano - pressed, grieved and persecuted.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor, almost lifts it out of his shoes when he brings it together with his greedy gesture.
It is Monday evening, in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the choir Imbongi is trying a new song.
The fifty singers have come from 23 to 69 years old, from the human geneticist to the houseman.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy piece, each choral voice has a different text and this also in a very foreign language: Zulu, spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Self - Helping
Worldwide there are around 34 million HIV-infected people, the estimate of Unaids, the United Nations programme to combat AIDS.
23.5 million of them live in the South of Africa.
Twenty-four thousand AIDS pigs live in Swaziland.
More than 40% of the population are now HIV-positive.
For 180 Aidswaisen in the village of Esicheni, the association Voices for Africa Paten has found in Germany.
70 of them attend a secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros a month you can take on a sponsorship.
It guarantees the child school money, school uniform and a warm daily meal in the Gogo center.
Imbongi means storytellers or even praisers on Zulu.
The Bantu language fluent can speak no one in this room, but sing.
For almost ten years, the choir has been practicing songs in this foreign soft language and occasionally brings them back to where they originally came from: in the South of Africa.
For 8 733 kilometers of air line from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is the village of Esicheni, which depends on the voice power of the German choir.
Forty percent are infected
Some 2,000 people live there, some still in simple clay and straw huts, most of which are children.
More than 300 of them no longer have parents because they are responsible for the HI virus.
Esicheni shows up in the small town, where Swaziland is sick all over: the highest HIV infection rate, the lowest life expectancy worldwide, according to Unicef.
Cuts of male foreskins, which have been shown to reduce the risk of infection by half, are hardly accepted by the population.
More than forty percent of people in Swaziland carry the immune virus in themselves to die with mid-thirty is not rare.
During a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir discovered the village, but above all the imbongis saw many children on the streets, which not only lacked parental care, but simply everything: food, clothing, education.
Without graduation, you have no chance in a poor country.
In the beginning, it was the private commitment of individuals to send a child to school for a few euros a year and make it possible for him to have a warm meal on the day.
A year later, however, the choir founded the association "Voices for Africa", which has been working almost professionally on the Aids Waisen in Esicheni.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most important sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial STIs include syphilis, chlamydia and tripper (Gonorrhea).
Common viral STIs are HIV, Human Papillomaviruses, Herpes Genitalis or Hepatitis.
Filling jars and crates are part of the parasite STI.
Who are the main stakeholders?
Syphilis and Tripper mainly occur in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute assumes that at least four out of five of all syphilis cases reported in Germany are transmitted by sexual contact between men.
In heterosexual adults, chlamydia infections, trichomonads, candidiasis (pills), trippers and human papillomaviruses are common sexually transmitted diseases.
The spread of HIV among heterosexual adults in this country is comparatively small - yet around 20 percent of HIV new infections are found in this group.
Chlamydia infections are significantly more common in adolescents than in other populations.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections affect young people between 15 and 25 years of age.
In addition, human papillamaviruses are common in adolescents.
How has the number of infections developed?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are reported.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections has more than doubled from 1697 diseases in 2001 to 3698 diseases in 2011.
The number of HIV new infections has decreased since 2007.
In 2011, there were about 2,700 cases.
This is about a tenth less than a year earlier.
What symptoms suggest a sexual disease?
Infections can cause genital ulcers, urinary disorders, discharge, abdominal pain, bladders or warts.
However, they often do not cause pain or other symptoms and therefore remain unnoticed.
How can you protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection but do not offer a 100% protection.
In part, pathogens can also be passed on from sexually transmitted diseases by lubrication infections and close body contact.
Therefore, experts recommend regular investigations, especially with frequently changing sex partners.
Early diagnosis, most STIs can be cured and delayed.
Through sponsorships, donations and, not least, the gifts that the choir enlists throughout Germany, some come together.
"In total, we have already sent around 200 000 euros to Esicheni," says Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In the village itself, Zodwa Dlamini, a self-conscious and powerful woman, manages the money from Germany.
She also takes care that the orphans are well accommodated, with one of the grandmothers, for example.
The Gogos, as the old women on Zulu are called, are the support of the village.
Some of them have taken up to 14 orphans, give them a roof over their heads and make sure that the children in their uniforms appear on time every day for school lessons.
Who has no one left, comes to the shelter to Khanyisile, a single woman who is paid by the club just as the two cooks who cook every day for more than 200 hungry children.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" has set up a sewing school, built two chicken houses and organized together with the US Health Organization PSI that many in the village have had an HIV test done.
This is not a matter of course, because, as obviously the disease is throughout the country, it is said to be the most loved one dead.
A king with 14 wives
"Aids is an absolute taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has to do with sexuality."
Strangely in a country where the King officially holds 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for its excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
Among other things, it is also due to this state sanctioned form of life that the HI virus has spread so rapidly over the past decades.
But also the many migrant workers who carry the virus through the country.
There would be free condoms on every corner," says Annette Lennartz, "but they are hardly used.
The culture is another - flesh to flesh."
In order to promote cultural exchange, the Imbongi choir travels through the south of Africa every two, three years together, singing songs full of pain, spirit of struggle, confidence and black self-confidence, many of whom know on the southern tip of the black continent even from times of apartheid.
A bus full of whites singing songs in a black language - so much recognition not only brings mood and joy, but also has some fierce border soldiers shed a few tears.
The journey always leads to Esicheni, where the singers visit their foster children.
Even if you can hardly find the small village on maps, it is more than known in the valley of the Ezulweni River.
"According to Esicheni, there is the light" the people there say.
And if you return the 8733 kilometers air line to Heidelberg, to the stamping singers in the rehearsal room on Bergheimer Straße, you can see it shining there.
Messenger: NASA discovered ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe found evidence that there is ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice cover may have to be up to 20 meters thick.
The US Space Agency NASA has demonstrated the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is closest to the sun, there is also frozen water, as three studies published on Thursday in the "Science" magazine show.
The Messenger probe has found evidence that there is an ice cover permanently in the shadowing region of the planet.
This should be at least 30 centimeters and possibly up to 20 meters thick.
The water probably came from comets or possibly also asteroids that are impacted on the Mercury.
But no one related the discovery of ice to the existence of life on the planet, said the chief scientist of the Messenger Sonde, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on the Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help to clarify how water and other building blocks of life have arrived in other areas of the solar system.
Unnoticed by the citizens of the earth are probes, telescopes and small robots such as Phoenix to explore the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they send pictures to the earth: Small holes in infinite distances.
The picture comes from a camera developed by German researchers from the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, and the dwarf planet Ceres.
According to the new definition of the International Astronomical Union of 2006, Ceres is not a "planet" as Pluto, who craves around the sun behind Neptune.
This picture section of an infrared recording of the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" of uncounted star generations: The oldest stars can be seen as blue points, more difficult to identify are the pink "newborns" in the star circle hall.
This star region - called unromantic W5 by scientists - has discovered the telescope Spitzer in the constellation Cassiopeia, in a distance of 6500 light years.
This dazzling glow of a dying star has captured the Nasa's Spitzer Telescope.
The Donut-shaped ring consists of material that the star dragged out in the dying process.
In the huge trifide fog, 5400 light years away from Earth, new stars are created from gas and dust.
The Nasa's Spitzer Telescope shot this photo of the galactic birthplace.
The plejaden cluster, also called "The Seven Sisters", can be seen with the naked eye at night.
With the telescope, however, the colors are better used.
Like a red Age, the Helix fog looks at the viewer in this infrared photo.
It is located 700 light years away in the Aquarius constellation.
His resemblance to an earthly continent brought this fog in the title North America.
A combination of normal and infrared photo ensures spectacular coloring.
This baby star could only be recorded in its full beauty by the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope.
Saturn and his rings: How these were created is one of the great puzzles of astronomy.
Perhaps they are the remains of a Saturn moon that disappeared without trace some 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the largest and strongest recordings of the Hubble telescope: The Whirlpool Glaxie
Depending on the colour, photographs of spiral galaxies become true works of art.
The photograph published by the European Southern Observatory shows the trifid fog in the constellation Schütze, which is several thousand light-years away.
The name Trifid is derived from the Latin word trifidus (trifidus, triplicate split), because dark dust strips divide the glowing heart of the star's birthplace.
In the constellation of snake carriers, astronomers have photographed the forewords of a cosmic karambolage: 400 million light years away from Earth, the cores of two merging galaxies race to one another and will inevitably collide with one another.
This star birth recorded the Hubble telescope in the Spiral galaxy M83.
To whom there are no technical abbreviations, she may call them "South firewheel" by her nickname.
The photo of the Hubble Space Telescope shows an excerpt from the Iris Nebula in the constellation Kepheus.
The 1400 light-years away fog consists of dust grains that are ten to a hundred times smaller than ordinary house dust.
This image was joined together by optical and x-ray recordings of various telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes, 430 million light years away from Earth.
This group of galaxies, named Arp 273, recorded the space telescope Hubble for the Nasa.
The larger spiral galaxy call scientists UGC 1810.
The brightest group of young stars is in our Milky Way galaxy.
The crib produces new youngsters.
Also, these clouds of stars, connected with the rosette fog, continuously produce new baby stars - 5000 light years away from the earth.
In this brightly radiant galaxy with a small black hole there is no dust yet, but only gas.
Researchers suspect that he was born shortly after the Big Bang, when he was found mainly hydrogen in the universe.
Our insights into all: The most important telescopes
The telescope should have been invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608 - before Galileo Galilei used it one year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of the optical telescopes have become ever bigger - and the insights they provide are ever deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope in Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror, here in the picture, had an average of five meters.
In Arizona, U.S.A., there's the Large Binocular Telescope.
It allows glances into the universe over two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The inside of the Gran Telescopio Canaria on the Canary Island of La Palma is huge - the mirror alone is 10.4 meters in diameter.
The mirror of Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented - to save costs.
Nevertheless, it reaches a diameter of about 11 meters.
Disadvantage of the favorable construction: The telescope is fixed in its height angle - and thus limited in its mobility.
The Hobby Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed at altitude.
Its special feature: the high intensity of the light collection.
In spite of comparatively small mirror diameters, this is enough to reach the world's largest mirror telescopes.
With the help of a radio telescope in Arecibo (Puerto Rico), researchers are listening to the need for extraterrestrial signals.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
In the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI), each computer owner can help by providing computing power.
View of the European Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
This is where the Very Large Telescope is standing - which makes all credit to its name.
With its four mirrors, the telescope can also illuminate the medium infrared spectrum.
The European Extremely Large Telescope is also planned at the Chilean ESO Observatory.
Its main mirror is intended to comprise 42 meters, composed of almost 1000 mirror elements.
However, images can be expected from 2018 at the earliest.
By 2007, the two Keck telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
They offer two mirrors each with an average of ten meters.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna-Kea Observatory, which looks into the sky alongside them with the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF.
Also on the Mauna Kea a new, huge telescope is to be created - with a mirror average of thirty meters.
Here it is to be admired on an illustration.
The most important impressions from space, however, are the space telescope Hubble.
Since April 24, 1990, there have been images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Space Telescope Kepler has been looking for extrasolar planets - mainly for those that are habitable.
On February 2, 2011, the Nasa announced that 1235 planet candidates have been identified since the beginning of the mission.
In the picture the last start preparations at the Kepler Space Telescope are documented.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is shot in space at the earliest in 2018 on board an Ariane5 missile.
The primary mirror of the space infrared telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope: It should look for light from the first stars and galaxies for the big bang.
Scientists assume that there is also the southern pole of Mercury Ice.
However, there is no reliable data for this, as the messenger is far closer to the North Pole around the planet.
For decades radar measurements have indicated that there is ice on Mercury.
Through the Messenger Sonde, which was launched in 2004, the first to crave Mercury, the scientists now have certainty.
Drink butter every day - and age 168
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach a biblical age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A trail search in the country where 97-year-olds are still comparatively young.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach a biblical age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A trail search in the country where 97-year-olds are still comparatively young.
The journey through the Talysch Mountains is called wild-dramantic.
The small bus rumbles over the curved road, past densely wooded hills, raging rivers and simple farmhouses.
Everything is green and juicy, you could think you were in the Black Forest.
But this is the deepest south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
Here the Caucasian population of the Talischen people lives, which is not known much, except that they speak Persian and Asherish perfectly and are very long-lived.
End station is Lerik.
The small town protitses with too steep gridded architecture from Soviet times, which does not even want to fit into the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe hardly come here, too difficult is the drive to Azerbaijan's capital Baku.
For the 323 kilometers you will need eight hours, because the road is only crowded.
The legendary wealth that the country owes to its oil in the Caspian Sea has not yet arrived here in the province.
But Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has the stuff for the tourist attraction.
"Baku became famous in May with the Eurovision-Song-Festival - and next year we have a festival of the oldest people in the world," says Fatulayeva.
She is the director of the Museum of Longevity, probably the only one in the world.
Here the Vita is documented by about eight dozen Talischen from the area, who are older than 100. Fatulayeva shows on a black and white photo.
This is my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
At the age of 136, another child was born
But the controversial star of the museum is the shepherd Şirali Müslümov, who is supposed to have become 168 years old.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And given the oldest documented man, who was 122 years old, Müslümov's age seems extremely doubtful.
"In 1805 he was born here in the region, and in 1973 he died," explains Fatulayeva.
The man was married three times and had 23 children, at the age of 136 he should have been a daughter.
So did Şirali Müslümov account for himself at his age for a few decades?
But also Rembrandt Scholz, senior researcher at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has heard of the high-aged people in Central Asia.
"There are a lot of high-aged people in some areas of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," says Scholz, "and also in Sardinia there are a lot of very old men living."
However, due to the lack of evidence, there was no scientific evidence of age, especially in the absence of a register of persons.
Every day melted butter
However, the fact is that the people of the region around Lerik often reach a biblical age.
There are currently 20 people who are over 100 years of age.
So why do so many high-aged people live here in the south?
The Asherian guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains this with the special genes of the Talischen.
Museum director Fatulayeva, on the other hand, believes that it is in the diet.
But that the high-calorie diet of the talys should be so healthy that the meat, bread and, above all, dairy products love and many of them drink a glass of melted butter every day, doesn't seem plausible from the scientific point of view.
Or is it the original way of life that keeps people young? Rubaba Mirzayeva lives in Cengemiran, a tiny settlement not far from the city of Lerik.
With her 97 years of age, she is still comparatively young for these latitudes.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house, which is typical of the entire Caucasus region.
She sits on the ground with a butter barrel, which she tirelessly rolls over and over.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one of Mirzayeva's sons and one daughter, both of them are grandparents.
Two grandchildren also jump around.
In the kitchen you prepare the guests tea served in the typical arctic Armadu glasses.
Mirzayeva's white teeth stand perfectly in agility and agility, under her towel she hides long, dark-blown pots that her son proudly reveals before us.
I always washed my hair with milk, so they never went out and kept their color.
"I've never used shampoo," says Mirzayeva.
Monthly pension is enough to live
She always ate only what came from her own farm, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
All my life, I haven't bought food in the supermarket once.
Then she tells of her husband who was in the army.
The worst was in the period after World War II.
But everything got better when the "loved father" Heydar Aliyew took over the row.
The propaganda sounds strange from the mouth of an old woman.
But the cult driven around the father figure of the nation, who ruled his country like a dictator, hardly knows boundaries in Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003 and later his son Ilham took over the row.
At least there is no need under Azerbaijan's old people.
230 manat (e.g. the same sum in euro), Mirzayeva receives monthly as a pension, for local conditions an amount of which one can live well.
And perhaps Mirzayevas has a long-standing son: "The elderly enjoy high esteem in our culture."
They live among the big family, are loved, cared for and are happy.
If that's no reason to stay alive as long as possible
The word "human right" is missing in the Constitution
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Rivalating rallyes in Cairo reveal the deep division of the country.
The future Constitution with Sharia as the basis is fiercely controversial.
The Egyptian president did not save with Pathos.
We must make the transition.
"And that he succeeds is in my responsibility, before the people and before God," he said on State television.
His speech was addressed to all the people, but especially to the Christian Copts, the Liberals, enlightened Muslims and seculars.
Because all of them, so far hopelessly intertwined in a controversial opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a God-state at the Nile of graces of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
He, said Mohammed Mursi, almost apologized for temporarily cutting down the competences of the Constitutional Court and extended his competences to "save the revolution".
But what the 61-year-old engineer who has a doctorate from the American University of Southern California really wants to save, the Egyptians are not quite clear about this.
Do you want the Judicatives to be removed?
In fact, the 234 articles, which were fed through by the Islamist-dominated 100-member constitutional assembly, are partly alarming in a nightly, 15-hour parforcerite.
As in previous constitutions, it is stated in the draft that case law is based on the "principles of Islamic law".
But what does "principals" mean?
That was and is the point of interpretation, and it is to be feared that the Islamists will use the swam formulation and the related legal scope for a more rigorous interpretation of the Sharia.
This suggests at least a new article: In all the matters concerning Sharia, Al-Ashar University had to be attracted, the country's most important Islamic institution with great radiation power throughout Sunni Islam.
That does not have to, but it may mean that the clergy oversee the legislation, which de facto would result in the proclamation of the Judicial.
Much in the draft version is an interpretation
Also problematic: civilian military jurisdiction should continue to be maintained.
These courts served during Mubarak's reign to suppress oppositionals.
After the dictator fell, up to 11,000 civilians were in military custody.
The state should also, as it stands in the design, protect "the true nature of the Egyptian family" "and promote their morals and values".
This is legally so unsavory that with the help of this article, state institutions can even control the content of film art and literature.
In plain text, this means nothing but censorship.
By the way, no article expressly states equality between men and women.
For this, another forbids insulting or slandering the Prophet Muhammad and his messengers.
But what is an insult, and how it should be given, remains unclear.
Likewise, dubios encourages the wording that "injury of people" is forbidden.
Does a caricature by the President or a joke come at the expense of a lawyer?
The interpretation, as so much in the draft, which Mursi has signed, and according to his words "very soon" will be presented to the Egyptians for the referendum.
"The revolution has returned"
The opposition has been forming against the Islamic authorities for weeks.
Tens of thousands gathered in unusual retreats on Friday evenings on the Tarir Square in Cairo and praised the Charter to fall before it can enter into force.
"The revolution has returned and we will win," said Hamdin Sabbahi, third-placed president.
The Nobel Peace Prize winner and ex-chief of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed El Baradei stated that the draft Constitution belongs to "the Mullberg of History".
Through short news service Twitter, he accused the followers of Mursis of wanting to lead a "putsch against democracy".
"When he calls out the referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow it," said Jasser Said.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers is not yet desired," the Egyptian media quoted opposition politician Chaled Ali.
And several judges announced that they would not want to monitor the referendum, which would invalidate it.
"The Koran is our constitution"
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood blew itself to the area demonstration, but cautiously not on the Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other Nile before the Cairo University.
Many veiled women and followers of the Salafists took part in this and cried out: "The people demand the application of God's law."
They demanded of Mursi: "Purpose the land!" and mattered: "The Qur'an is our constitution."
A battle for the Highness over the symbolic Tahrir Square, on which everything began, would probably have claimed civil war-like states.
Mursis' followers obviously didn't want to risk that.
The Muslim brothers declared that both the opponents of the draft constitution and the supporters had spoken out loud and clear.
Now is the time to let the people at the ballot box decide in which direction the country should go.
A majority for the design of Islamists is considered safe.
"The Word of Human Rights does not even appear"
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry at this forced constitutional process, which had actually gone by February and was supposed to involve all social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and chairman of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) defended the Muslim brothers when they were in prison under Mubarak or in court.
Not because he would share their view of the world, but because human rights are indivisible to him.
He was beaten, sentenced, detained for that.
"And now the word human rights is not even in the new constitution," he laments in conversation with the "World on Sunday".
Mursi had the lawyer resigned on all three powers in the state.
These measures are gross violations of democratic rules and will lead Egypt into a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the President put her de facto into effect," laments Saeda.
But without civil society organisations, democracy could not work.
Saeda feels left alone, also by the international community, who looks at the ideological direction struggle at the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
It could get revenge.
A demonstrator on the Tarhir warns: "You are giving birth to a monster that you can no longer control."
Rackfish from Norway: Is that the worst fish in the world?
The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy one of the highest living standards - not only in Europe but throughout the world.
Could the country’s secret of success have something to do with the local appetite for quite foul fish?
Take a selection of overripe cheeses.
They are placed in the midst of a pile of dirty, damp sports clothing.
And pay a visit there for a week.
So about that, you have to imagine the wet-causing smell of Rakfis, one of Norway's great delicacies.
I am located in the small town of Fenres, about three hours from Oslo.
There is snow here, spectacular landscapes - and this persistent smell in the air that just doesn't want to disappear.
Rakfis is sprinkled with salt trout, which - depending on how stinking one would like his fish - is fermented in water for up to a year.
If in Norway the darkness comes over the country and the weather gets colder, Norwegians are streaming to a festival here in Cernes, which is, now, really very specialty.
"One eats it raw and then rinses it down with a glass of Aquavit," says Havard Halvarsen, who actually works in the local fire department, but also hosts the festival as a so-called "Rakfiss General".
People eat small fish cubes around us and drink large amounts of alcohol.
"Man people like the Aquavit more than the Rakfisk," says Havard.
The spirit can dispel the smell.
I'm going to cost you some hands.
If you avoid bringing the Rakfis near the nose, it is not bad - for example, like Sushi, who has a quite long bus ride behind him.
Rakfis is the product of a completely different, much poorer Norwegian era than there were no cooling possibilities and fish was drowned in airtight saltwater barrels in the autumn.
In the deepest winter, he was then taken out after long fermentation and, no doubt with the help of alcohol, was consumed.
Even before a generation, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work and mainly migrated to the United States.
Today the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by a thriving labour market, high wages and a comprehensive health care system.
Even from Sweden, the old rival, who was not too long ago far richer than Norway, stream immigrants.
Rakfis is regarded as something important - as an essential, though strictly reputable part of Norwegian history.
He's one of the more expensive dishes you can buy here.
But actually everything is expensive here - a small glass of beer or a sandwich costs proudly 10 euros.
Norway doesn't often make it into the world press, and most people don't seem to interfere.
Here one still hates to call Anders Breivik by name - those racist right-wing extremists who shot 77 men, women and children last year.
Instead, you only refer to the "Event of 22 July".
In Norway, it is difficult to accept that someone in their peaceful country is capable of such brutal murders.
The main responsibility for the present wealth of Norway has been the growth of one of the world's largest oil and gas industries since the early 1970s.
"But oil is not the only reason we're doing so well," says Anna, our waitress, who distributes round tablets with mature raqfisk and embodies the Nordic ideal with her long blond hair and the stinging blue eyes.
We are a – as it is said – cautious people.
Your English is just like that of most people here.
We're not very glamorous, we don't like brawls.
Norway has handled its oil wealth very carefully - a large part of the industry's output is being invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
When in the years leading up to the world economic crisis, all of them spent money that they did not have, Norway held its wallet tightly closed.
"As long as we can go skiing in winter and hike in summer, we are happy," says Anna.
"And, of course, eat Rakfis," she adds with unspoiled laughter.
I stand in the snow and stand for another dish - from Rakfis I have enough.
Such an elk burger is definitely something else.
But in the evening, the stinky fish is back on the menu.
The hotel where I live is one of several venues that organize a Rakfis dinner, where guests can vote for the best – or perhaps the sense of smell most challenging – fish.
There is a live TV-scatter to a fly-dressed showmaster surrounded by plates with Rakfisk.
The spectacle is similar to the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What score do you have up there in the mountains for the best fish, Thor-Jürgen?"
"Here are our points, Haveard."
You clapp and laugh.
A man falls off his chair, possibly overwhelmed by the Aquavit.
But maybe it's the harsh dusk of all the fish.
Mexico’s Enrique Pena Nieto faces a difficult start
While Mexico's future President Enrique Pena Nieto is preparing to take office, Will Grant from the BBC analyses the challenges ahead and the mixed feelings of his people.
Currently, the traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad.
Even on better days this is an ever-congested city, but on Monday a ring of steel was built, which locks off several important traffic routes to the capital and provides chaos on the streets.
The aim, however, was not to disturb commuters on their way to work, but to prevent demonstrators from reaching Parliament.
On Saturday Mexico's new President Enrique Pena Nieto will receive the presidency and take the lead of the nation.
He is faced with a complex task.
Under the distinguished Felipe Calderon government, Mexico has been able to prove itself economically well, but the country is in the grip of a drug war that has cost 60,000 lives over the last six years.
"My government is committed to reducing the violence," Pena Niero told U.S. President Barack Obama at the Oval Office at the beginning of this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this objective.
Before taking an eye on the U.S. president, Pena Nieto served as governor of his home state of Mexico.
In this densely populated, vast part of the country surrounding the capital, opinions on the new head of state are shared.
A direct man
In the remote town of Valle del Bravo, for example, you can remember him.
Residents of the resort attribute to the development of tourism and the construction of the infrastructure.
To reach the city, you can drive on one of the highways that Pena Nieto had built and that represent a great improvement over the bustling, bumpy roads that once existed here.
Posters with their names also hang outside a modern sports center and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
"We expect real and lasting changes from him," said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, who works as congressman for the Pena Nietos party, the PRI.
In particular, as regards security and the economy, we hope for an interesting and real change that our country so urgently needs.
After 81 years of power, the PRI was replaced by Vicente Fox in 2000.
The Congressman Olvera admits that after 12 years, the party places great expectations on Enrique Pena Nieto outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos.
The opposition's accusations, which the new president lacks substance, he rejects.
He was a very direct man, very committed and had big plans for the country.
He's an excellent statesman, but above all he's someone who can listen.
But on the other side of the state not many people share this view of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast to the paved streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
The town is hidden under highway transfers and in many ways is a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the community are of crucial urban nature.
At the beginning of this year, the military was engaged to combat the drug gangs operating in the quarters, and violence against women is a particularly acute problem.
The bodies of dozens of murdered women were left on a spot of fallow land near a large landfill in the last two years alone.
During the reign of Governor Pena Nieto, more than 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico - a statistics that even surpasses the city of Ciudad Juarez, who is notorious for their violence and murder of innocent women.
Critics Pena Nieteos consider that he has not at least dealt adequately with the problem of women's murders during his term of office.
But in the worst case, his government had closed its eyes to the problem.
In a concrete building, typical of the distance down, Irinea Buendia fights with tears as she shows me photos of her deceased daughter Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of the events, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
But her family believes that she was murdered by her partner.
"When I arrived at her home, it seemed as if her body had been washed," remembers Senora Buendia.
There were signs that she was beaten, and the body star had already been used.
As her mother tells her story, a picture of Mariana looks down on us from the wall. It is next to a cross that bears one word: justice.
But this, according to the family, has been denied her so far.
The authorities have treated me as being a nurse, troublemaker, neurgler.
You want to just accept their verdict and keep your mouth shut.
"But this is not possible if there are so many form errors and failures," she says.
If President Pena Nieto receives the presidential bonds on Saturday, he will also take on a great responsibility.
Tens of thousands of Mexican families have suffered from violent crimes over the past six years, and the new President has promised to take special care of this problem during his term of office.
"I hope as President he is as governor," says Olvera, a member of the PRI Congress in Valle del Bravo.
However, the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza are most afraid of it.
The prosecutor's office claims: Bradley Manning has not complained about abuse
The prosecutor's office contradicts Bradley Manning's allegations that he was being assaulted in prison.
The hearing deals with Manning's time in the military prison in Quantico, Virginia
The defense seeks to reject the prosecution on grounds of harsh terms and conditions of detention
The release of the U.S. Army is accused of using thousands of confidential documents
The prosecutors on Friday tried to find out that the army-free Bradley Manning - accused of the largest disclosure of confidential information in US history - failed to complain about the abuse he allegedly suffered in military custody.
In a cross-examination of Manning during a preliminary hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Maj. Ashden Fein stated that documents on weekly visits by prison officials during Manning's nine-month detention in Quantico, Virginia had no complaints about his treatment.
One day before the cross-examination, which was held as a result of an application from the defense to reject the charge - Manning had already been adequately punished by the hard detention period - Manning had stated that he had considered the suicide in prison.
The intelligence analyst of the U.S. Army, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents during his service in Iraq.
The material was then published by WikiLeaks on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed Manning as a source of information.
In the Friday hearing, Fein went through the forms with Manning, who had filled out officials after their meeting with Manning during his detention in Quantico Military Prison, where he had been detained under increased conditions from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officials asked Manning questions and wrote his answers.
When Fein asked him about the forms on Friday, Manning admitted that he had assessed the treatment through his guards as "excellent" and the treatment by setting up overall as "very professional".
The forms, according to Fine, did not contain complaints about abuse, although officials had asked Manning directly about his treatment.
Manning replied that he expressed his concerns orally and the officials had discussed them with him and indicated that they had not been recorded.
"They wrote up "no problems" (after discussing the concerns) and that didn't necessarily mean I didn't say anything at all," Manning said.
The judge, Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he did not complain about his treatment when he met in January 2011 with a committee to examine the suicidal idea he had mentioned on a form a few months earlier.
Manning replied that his intention during this meeting was to reduce his observation status to "prevention of injuries".
The military said it had assigned him this restrictive status - one step under the threat of suicide - to his and the protection of others.
"I wanted to convince employees that I was doing well, and get rid of the observation status to prevent injuries (...) in order to achieve a higher quality of life from my point of view," said Manning.
Manning announced his arrest and relocation to Kuwait on Thursday, where he was detained for nearly two months before being transferred to the Quantico Marine Base Prison in Virginia in July 2010.
He said in Kuwait he considered suicide and had become unconscious once because of the heat.
Not to know what happened to him or to the outside world was burdensome.
"My world shrunk on Camp Arafjon, on this cage together," Manning said on Thursday.
I thought I was gonna die in that cage.
When he was moved to Quantico, Manning spent most of his days in a small cell - at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours - and without society.
He was only allowed a mattress, a blanket, flip flops, clothes and his glasses.
Manning said he was trying to stay in motion, because on the day it was forbidden to sleep or to lie down.
Instead, he had to sleep with light that penetrated from the outside into his cell.
When he turned around at night and could no longer watch his face, he was woken up to be turned back.
In January 2011, Manning's lawyer formally filed an objection to Manning's treatment.
In April 2011, Manning was transferred to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas military prison.
On Friday the judge Manning also asked about an accusation he had made in his statement on Thursday - so he slept in his cell one night naked and had to stand naked in front of guards and other prisoners in a morning count.
Manning had said that during this count, he had never had the opportunity to cover himself with his blanket.
When asked about Friday, Manning said that he had closed out of an order of his guard that he should have dropped the ceiling with which he could have covered himself. However, he admitted that no one had asked him to do so.
On Thursday, Manning had said that he had been forced to sleep naked during the previous night. He had previously tried to show an official that he was no danger to himself.
Manning had told the official that he could have used the covenant of his underwear or his flip-flops to hurt himself, but this was not done.
That night, Manning said, his underpants, flip-flops and glasses had been removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that the judge will at least take into account his prison experiences and drastically reduce his prison sentence, he should be convicted in his trial before the military court, which is due for the beginning of next year.
The defense has indicated that Manning will be guilty of lower charges, while other charges that are considered too extreme should be challenged.
The continuation of the hearing is scheduled for this weekend, and the prosecution is expected to justify the conditions of detention.
The Pentagon remains in its position to maintain Manning in accordance with the provisions applicable to all prisoners under the highest security provisions in Quantico.
The charges against Manning include favoring the enemy, unlawful publication of confidential information on the Internet, the transmission of national defence information and theft of public property or documents.
If he is found guilty in all charges, he is threatened with life imprisonment.
My Mexican-American identity crisis.
Many people were forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to accuse the immigrants - they call them hard times into memory, he says.
Navarret believes that Mexican Americans are trapped between two worlds
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had just crossed the hall and had arrived at the passport control when Councillessness spread within me.
Signs referred to two queues: one for "Mexicanos" ("Mexicans"), another for "Extranjeros" ("Ausländer").
I stood there for a few seconds, uncertain to which I should go.
I grew up in Central California and was called "Mexicans" all my life.
An ethnic abbreviation - just as my friends in Boston call themselves "Iren" or my friends in New York "Italian."
Later, I decided to go for "Mexican-American."
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's home there was no need for short cuts or dashes.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, at least good enough to claim myself in this language at both ends of an interview.
But I don't have the vocabulary of a native speaker, and I'm not going to get out of my American accent either.
So I took my American passport and put myself in line for extranjeros.
I was thinking about the moment this week when future Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House to meet President Obama.
On the agenda were all the topics expected when the heads of these two countries met: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto was also very interested in talking about the growth of the Mexican economy. She is a reason why Mexicans today, with the same high probability, remain in Mexico instead of emigrating to the United States.
He wants to join the United States and Canada and create a North American trading bloc, modelled on the European Union.
And Pena Nieto vowed to continue Mexico's war against the drug cartel, even if he did not mention any details in this regard.
Mexico's relationship with the United States is complicated and full of resentment.
Most Americans probably never wasted a single thought that the United States invaded Mexico in 1848 and forced the leadership of the country under caution to leave them more than half their territory.
But for Mexicans who think in centuries and not minutes, memories of this event are not to be overlooked.
So, as soon as a U.S. government official practices only the mildest criticism of Mexico, complaints are heard - in the Mexican press and among the elites of the country - about how Americans are pushing the sovereignty of their neighboring country.
And the children of Montezumas go to the path of war.
Yet, Mexico’s greatest challenge is in fact in relation to the more than 35 million Mexican Americans who live in the United States.
Want to talk about resentments?
There's more than enough.
Mexico has winners and losers. People for whom the country offers opportunities and others for whom it does not.
The only reason so many people live of Mexican origin in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that at a point in our family tree a person – perhaps a parent or a grandparents – was not given a chance in Mexico and emigrated to the north.
And in most cases this person corresponded to a profile - dark skin, uneducated, from a poor village, etc.
We are the descendants of these people, and our faithfulness is theirs.
Not Mexico.
And even though we may now live in the American dream, have attended good schools and received good jobs, we must never lose sight of the fact that it is the American dream we live - not the Mexican one.
Our identity may sometimes be blurred, but as far as our loyalty is concerned, this is not the case.
This clearly applies to the United States.
In addition, we are aware that many members of the Mexican leadership do not like us.
This is based on reciprocity.
They see us as a memorial of a humiliating defeat and look down on us because we are not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough to be our bands to Mexico ever strong enough.
In your opinion, our existence is a symbol of failure.
If our families hadn't failed in Mexico, they wouldn't have gone.
And then we wouldn't see ourselves caught behind the silk curtain now - with a pleasant life in the United States, but somehow lost.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and moved legally to the United States as a child, reminds me that there are tensions between Mexicans and Mexican Americans, because Mexicans have a clearer idea of who they are - and Mexican Americans take this to heart.
While she is an American citizen, she sees herself as part of two countries.
But many Mexican Americans I know have the feeling of belonging neither to one country nor to the other.
We love the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
One enjoys the best of both worlds, but is not rooted in any of them.
In Mexico, we're seen as an American.
And in the United States, we're seen as Mexican.
As I should learn during my journey, there is something that makes this relationship even more complicated: some Mexican leaders and parts of educational citizenship want to resume their connections to Diaspora.
They want to use Mexican Americans as provisional "ambassadors" for Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We should tell our American colleagues how great a visit to this country is and exert pressure on the political leadership to intensify their ties with Mexico.
Well.
This won't happen.
Too many hurt feelings.
And given the unfair distribution of income, unbridled corruption and drug abuse, many of us are not so sure whether it is really a great country.
I'm afraid you have to go through this alone, Amigos.
That's fair.
If at least a few Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States for dealing with Mexico a hundred and a half centuries ago, they must also accept that some Mexican Americans have a grudge for it, as their family members have not been treated for as long as before.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're more Mexican than I thought.
Old fights, New Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could prove to be an unexpected pillar of peace
Can there ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The latest bloody events seem to choke such a hope in the germ.
Amidst the usual indebtedness, countless buildings were laid in rubble and ashes, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis were killed - and for the first time, rockets from Gaza were struck near the Israeli metropolis Tel Aviv and the Holy City of Jerusalem.
But although Israelis and Palestinians seem to be trapped in their historical conflict, the Middle East is changing around them.
The Arab Spring has created a new, uncertain situation, and whether they want it or not - Palestinians and Israelis have become part of this turmoil.
Perhaps this will only lead to more bloodshed.
However, there are reasons to believe that the deadly plague situation could finally find its end.
A war that is not lost or won
At first glance, in view of the current situation, optimism seems to be anything but appropriate.
Even if the ceasefire agreed on 21 November is continuing, the weekly fighting has strengthened the prisoners on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement, which has controlled the Gaza Strip since 2007, will claim to have pushed back the Israelis, although his grouping had to suffer great losses itself.
Although several Hamas leaders are killed and the 1.7 million inhabitants of the Gaza Strip are infested in one of the most destructive and densely populated corners of the planet, Israel has not yet succeeded in destroying Hamas.
In fact, Hamas in the West Bank is added, controlled by the rival, moderate Palestinian group Fatah.
And the Hamas leaders could conclude that they have time on their side.
As Islamists have gained influence in the Arab world, Hamas has been able to draw powerful and rich friends on its side.
Turkey, a reinvigorating regional power once considered to be Israel's closest Muslim ally, has taken hold of the Hamas Party - just like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf States.
Jubilant Hamas followers believe that Israel is an Islamist half-mouth - from Lebanon in the north, where the militant Hezbollah has power, over Syria, where rebels of an increasingly Islamist influence could stand before Bashar Assad's overthrow, to Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.
And in particular the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under President Muhammad Mursi in Egypt - the most populous and most important Arab country by far - on the southern flank of Israel has changed the balance of the region sustainably.
Hosni Mubarak, the laizist despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had little time left for Hamas.
In contrast, the brotherhood with Hamas is weakened and its leaders depend more on popular views.
In future diplomatic negotiations, Hamas could prove to be an actor who cannot himself be forced out of the hands of Israel and the United States.
The Israeli hardliners, on the other hand, have an opposite conclusion.
Militaryly, Hamas is no longer a danger.
The Israeli missile defense system, "Iron Dome", has proved itself and many of the Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
At least for a while Israel will be able to sleep more quietly.
In diplomatic terms, the United States maintains its position unshakable, and many European countries have made Hamas responsible for the recent escalations of violence.
Israel has experienced good progress in recent years, particularly under Prime Minister Bonyamine Netanyahu, who has largely ignored the peace process.
Although rockets from the Gaza Strip have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, the country has remained relatively free of suicide bombers - not least thanks to the barrier facilities that have entered the West Bank and thus entered the main part of any Palestinian state. These protect the Jewish settlements, which have been declared illegal by international law, but are constantly being expanded.
Netanyahu stands well there. His Likud party has joined Avigdor Lieberman on 22 January in the run-up to the elections with an even more fighting group.
Why also hide these insidious Palestinians and leave them a state of their own?
If they actually had control of the West Bank, would they not fire rockets just like their fellow fighters in the Gaza Strip?
No, it is better to keep them in check behind the wall and punish them, they should dare to lift their heads.
Perhaps the hardliners will be able to get through, but the Arab Spring could make a straight line through the bill.
Even if the Islamists who are now in power in Egypt and in other countries have little left for Israel, they will first concentrate on the difficulties in their own country.
Israel's military seat is larger than that of its four Arab neighbours.
A war with the local superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments to restore their economy.
The fact that Pragmatic President Mursi met with Barack Obama in order to achieve a ceasefire could be a promising sign - and perhaps symbolise the beginning of a new era.
Israelis should also think more in the long term.
While the rest of the Arab world is taking dire steps towards democratisation, Palestinians are still deprived of their right to self-determination - a powder barrel that will undoubtedly one day explode into the Israeli-occupied territories, just as this week a bus exploded in Tel Aviv.
The oppression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state, and with the growth of the Arab population, this situation will only worsen.
Bloody missions to repress Hamas in the Gaza Strip will increasingly demand their diplomatic tribute over the years.
Both sides need an outside approach
The correct answer is that which is represented by the more reasonable representatives of both sides, the majority of the rest of the world and by this newspaper: two states in which Israel departs for security purposes.
The hope - small for the near future - is that the armistice outside gives more influence to the enforcement of this solution.
Egypt, together with Turkey and Qatar, must now stop the arms deliveries in the Gaza Strip and is better positioned than ever before to convince Hamas of the idea of a Jewish state on the basis of the 1967 borders, complemented by territorial exchange and a common Jerusalem.
Outside Arab nations should also move Hamas and Fatah to an agreement.
This would be done more for the creation of a Palestinian State than with the forthcoming request for UN observer status.
Obama must also contribute to moving Israel to negotiations.
During his first term of office, he failed to imagine his own peace plan.
Far away in the White House, it seems as if he was also disavowing participation.
But this is a regrettable, short-sighted perspective.
The United States has a major interest in a stable Middle East.
And there is a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Australian laws on uniform cigarette packaging enter into force
Health warnings and affected body parts on neutral green packages that are equal for all tobacco brands
The first laws for uniform cigarette and tobacco packaging in the world have entered into force in Australia, replacing brand logos and colours with neutral olive-green lids printed with drastic pictures, showing sick body parts and children affected by cigarette smoke.
Apart from the different health warnings and pictures, the only difference between the packages in the brand names printed in identical, small prints is from next Saturday.
Australia thus introduces the most stringent regulations for tobacco packaging worldwide.
The Australian Federal Government wants to remove young people from smoking by eliminating the glamorous picture of tobacco consumption.
The government of studies, which have shown that people who have not started smoking at 26 years of age, are no longer likely to start after that, with 99% probability.
"You can already see in children of young age that they understand the message that tobacco companies try to apply with their brand image," says Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek. She quotes studies that have shown, for example, that children associate the crown of a logo with the idea of a princess.
Although Australia has one of the lowest rates of smoking in the world and the changes will only have a minor impact on the profits of multinational corporations, other countries are already considering similar steps.
The tobacco lobby fought hard against the laws.
Thus it was said that the laws would favour the black market trade, leading to cheaper and easier access to cigarettes.
"The laws will lead to serious, unintended consequences," says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Chinese and Indonesian counterfeiters will offer far greater quantities of these products on the streets of Australia.
Others, on the other hand, say that the laws have stimulated their business.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, notes that the demand for cigarette napkins and silicone caps to cover the unbearable packaging has increased enormously since British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco companies failed to comply with the laws at the Supreme Australian Court two months ago.
Zico sold up to 6,000 units to wholesale stores and waited for new stocks.
For us, this is a good business.
According to experts, the hook in the popularity of social media lies in exactly the population group to which the plan refers.
A number of Australian laws have banished tobacco companies from TV advertising, forbidding them to appear as sports sponsors and force most traders to stop interpreting cigarettes in shops. Now tobacco advertising is switched to the Internet.
The Australian government has banned Internet advertising by local companies and sites, but has no influence on international sites.
"Whoever markets tobacco and has only a small area left to apply for its products does not come around the Internet," says Becky Freeman, researcher at Sydney University of Health.
On social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, Freeman has seen an increase in experience reports about brands written by "all normal people".
You have to ask yourself: is this just a private person who finds such great pleasure in Marlboro cigarettes that she even recorded a video for it - or does it have a marketing agency to do with it?
British American Tobacco Australia says that instead of marketing, the industry concentrates on dealing with the new laws.
It has even gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new regimes - those countries complain about unfair trade restrictions at the World Trade Organisation, although none of the countries is engaged in major trade with Australia.
A WTO decision is expected for mid-2013.
According to Plibersek, the government has had talks with other countries that consider similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to provide photographic warnings in 2001.
These have now been extended to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
More stringent laws are being considered in the UK, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many Australian smokers show up defiant.
The pictures don't affect me.
I just ignore them.
"You just take a tip and put the box away," says Victor El Hage when buying a cigarette box, on which a photo is printed with a mouth tumor.
Frankly, there's only one reason I would stop, and that's my little girl.
James Yu, operator of the tobacco trade "King of the Pack" in downtown Sydney, says that the uniform packaging has made filling his shelves difficult.
"I used to take an hour to order a delivery, now I need four," Yu says.
"The government should have banned cigarettes completely - then we would have said okay, that's it, we're closing up," he apparently added.
In a constantly electrified world it's nice to be bored too
This Thanksgiving I unexpectedly spent five hours at the airport when our plane fell out due to mechanical problems and we had to wait for another flight.
So I had enough time to think about boredom.
I don't want to lie.
Waiting for a flight at the airport for half a day is quite annoying - even if books, magazines and iPhones (and of course tax-free shopping) are available.
But more and more academics and child development experts lead boredom as something positive.
When it comes to them, it is okay for us - and our children - to be occasionally bored.
This forces the brain to lose itself in interesting thoughts, which may promote creativity.
And because most of us are almost constantly staring at one screen or another today, we no longer benefit from the benefits of boredom.
So should we welcome the boredom with open arms?
Yes.
And no.
I'll come back to that.
Like many people, I have always assumed that boredom is a relatively up-to-date phenomenon that has developed with increasing leisure time.
But Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011) doesn't think so.
"In fact, boredom has a very long history," he says.
Pompeii's walls adorn a Latin graffiti over boredom, dating back to the first century.
And then there's the question of how we actually define boredom.
According to John D. Eastwood, an associate professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada, the problem is that boredom has been defined and discussed in many ways.
After a long reading of research literature and the presentation of the idea before a focus group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues concluded that boredom can be defined as the experience of "wanting to do a satisfying job but not being able to do it".
Boringly different from apathy, as a result, the person is not busy, but wants to be.
On the other hand, there is no urge to do anything.
The key experience of boredom, he says, consists in a "disruption of the attention process, paired with bad moods and the feeling that time is only passing slowly".
Boredom can almost listen to it as depression.
But Professor Eastwood believes that although these two states may be related, bored persons see the problem in their environment or in the world, while depressed people see the problem in themselves.
Sometimes we think we're boring, even if we just have trouble concentrating.
In her study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention" - to German for example: "The immature mind: The definition of boredom under the aspect of attention, which appeared in September in the journal "Perspectives on Psychological Science", Professor Eastwood and his colleagues point to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a band on which a person reads a magazine article.
Some groups heard a loud television program from the neighbouring room that had nothing to do with the contents. Others heard it on low volume, so it was hardly noticeable, while the third group did not hear these sounds at all.
The people who heard the hardly audible television said they felt more bored than the other two groups - they had problems concentrating, couldn’t find a reason for this and wrote about their difficulties of boredom.
When you try to focus on a difficult or strenuous task, the disturbance of attention can lead to boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, Associated Professor of Neurosciences at Guelph University in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, if one is engaged in a monotonous activity - "as is the search for defective products on a factory conveyor belt, music can distract and help not to feel bored."
In fact, he says, we now know that insiders and crutches, often interpreted as signs of boredom, can even fight them by staying more attentive physically.
"Studies have shown that children who are allowed to stumble learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to sit still," says Professor Fenske.
We all get bored at some point - my late flight, a dreamy speaker, a particularly tiring movie.
But some people are bored more easily than others.
To measure these differences, researchers in the 1980s developed a "scala for boredom".
On the scale you will find statements like "Many things I have to do, repeat themselves and are monotonous" and "I have so many interests that I don't have enough time for everything".
With the help of such scales, researchers have found that boys become more boring than girls, says Stephen Vodanovich, Professor of Psychology at the University of Westflorida - especially as regards the need for more and a greater variety of external stimuli.
But in general, teenagers are a rather tense bunch.
In 1991, Reed Larson, professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted almost 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day with a Pager.
He found that 32% of the adults in school and when doing homework were bored, whereas 23% reported being bored when they were not in school.
But only 3% of parents said they were feeling bored.
Professor Larson says today, 21 years later, he doesn't know if the percentage of boredom has increased or decreased.
However, he is sure that "youth is considered particularly boring", mainly because children and teenagers have no major influence on their everyday life.
So back to my question of origin: Is boredom healthy?
Sometimes not, because in extreme cases it causes people to take extreme physical risks and fall into gambling or drugs to alleviate them - that has shown studies.
On the other hand, many philosophers and authors examine the relationship between boredom and creativity. This opinion is Professor Vodanovich, who has been investigating the subject for more than two decades.
"With boredom, the brain wants to tell you that you should do something different," said Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at the University of New York.
But the brain doesn't always know what to do the best.
If you are bored and you use this energy to play guitar and cook, you will be happy.
However, television can bring happiness in the short term, but it is a long-term phenomenon.
Thus, those who reach their bored child an iPad can reduce it from boredom. However, it has not learned to entertain or control themselves, says Professor Fenske.
And he adds: "Self-control transfers from one situation to another".
The child learns not only to entertain but also to gain more self - control in other areas.
I don't think we should celebrate boredom.
Nor should we see them too critical.
Instead, our aim should be to feel comfortable away from constant activity and technology.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"It sounds like we have to be bored more often. But boredom is the painful, relentless desire to do something meaningful," he says.
He believes that in truth people are only looking for a way to turn off and relax.
"In an environment in which we are constantly overstimulated, it is difficult to get busy when the noise is muted once."
In Colorado there is no clear guideline for the new marijuana law
The 19-year-old community college student and football player Anthony Orozco stands in South-East Colorado for a trial that will soon be legal in this state: the possession of a few fewer marijuana cracks and a pipe with which he smoked them.
Orozco said he and some friends were on a September day by car in Lamar near the border with Kansas when they were stopped.
After the police officer found marijuana in the car, Orozco was preloaded for the possession of drugs and drug equipment - cavalier poems, each with a penalty of U.S. dollars - and was given a date of trial.
"We will be treated like criminals," says Orozco.
But is he also one?
In the uncertain weeks following the state's decision to legalize small quantities of marijuana for personal use, the answer to hundreds of smaller drug offenders depends less on the law than on the location.
Hundreds of violations of order that revolve around marijuana are already being dropped here and in the state of Washington, which approved similar measures.
Police authorities no longer pursue adults over 21 years of age for possession to a small extent. This is permitted by law as soon as the new laws come into force in the next few weeks.
But prosecutors in the more conservative districts of Colorado have announced that they will continue to pursue existing marijuana law and still quote people in court.
At the same time, several cities, ranging from the suburbs of Denver to the Western Mountains, agree to prevent new, state licensed marijuana stores from opening up in their communities.
"This situation develops so quickly that I don't know what's next," says Daniel J. Oates, Chief of Police in Aurora, east of Denver.
And regulators in Washington, too, are in a state of disrepute.
They are waiting for guidance to establish a licensing system for the production, manufacture, distribution and sale of the drug - and have a deadline to 1 December 2013.
In Washington, it is believed that Colorado is in any case ahead of most states in terms of marijuana regulation. There, the drug was first legalized for medical purposes and then for personal use.
"Colorado has a more regulated market. The state is therefore well suited for orientation," says Brian E. Smith, spokesman of the Washington State’s Committee on Spirits.
But Smith also admits that no place or system can do more than serve in the sense of a rough guide.
"We have no real precedent to follow," he adds.
The Washington Act, called I-502, will enter into force on 6 December, thus also forming the end point of a grey zone in which the state licensing system does not yet exist, but the property is legalized.
And unpleasant practical issues need to be clarified at this time - for example, how to agree the state specification of "appropriate access" to licensed marijuana with the ban of cannabis shops around 300 meters around schools, parks, playgrounds and childcare facilities.
"Nowhere will it be harder to find a location for a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in Seattle," says Ben Livingston, spokesman for the "Center for Legal Cannabis", a recently formed research group.
On November 21st, Chief Oates sent an e-mail to his staff in Aurora saying that the prosecutor would no longer prosecute smaller marijuana officers in persons over 21 years old, and that the police would "immediately" seek no criminal charges for these crimes.
Chief Oates added that the police would continue to enforce urban regulations governing producers of medical marijuana and continue to pursue drug dealers.
In Weld County in northern Colorado, District Attorney Ken Buck represents a stronger view.
After the vote, he stated that his authority would continue to pursue cases of marijuana possession, mainly in order to move consumers to abduction.
At present, 119 people have to be tried for possession of about 50 grams or less of marijuana, although many have been charged with other crimes.
"Our authority has a duty to prosecute crimes involving crime at the time of the crime," Buck stated in a statement.
The reactions are even in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the county, no longer show adults the possession of smaller quantities.
District Attorney Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, but he also decided not to drop all outstanding ownership procedures.
"I don't think I'm wasting my time enforcing the right until it changes," he says.
Although 55% of the voters in Colorado supported the measure, it was clear from the beginning that it would not be easy to reconcile the personal consumption of marijuana with the complexity of government and legal systems.
And the contradictory reactions throughout the state promoted a profound interplay among local officials with regard to the great green experiment to day.
In the case of district attorneys, this is a "cultural barrier," says Sean McAllister, an attorney from Denver, who is representing the defendants of marijuana law before the courts and is acting on the spot as a spokesman for the national organisation for reforming marijuana laws.
"They have spent such a large part of their lives persecuting people for criminal purposes that they still cannot accept the legalization," he believes.
As the first states to treat smaller quantities of marijuana like alcohol, Colorado and Washington are acting as national sample cases for the legalization of drugs.
While interlocutors and government officials are preparing for legal sales for an age, they are also anxiously waiting for instructions from the federal government, which wants to continue to treat marijuana sales and cultivation as a criminal offence at federal level.
Speakers of the Legalisation Movement hope that the Ministry of Justice will yield.
Despite several eye-catching arrests of consumers and salesmen of medical marijuana, the Federal Government has largely allowed the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
Kevin A. Sabet, former drug policy consultant of the Obama government, believes that although criminals are probably not going to enter doors to confiscate smaller quantities of drugs, they are probably going to be strangled to tolerate the legal, state-regulated marijuana business under the new legislation.
Several cities in Colorado do not wait for the federal authorities to act.
Even before the election day, some local authorities approved moratoria for new marijuana businesses, although they could only open in about a year.
Last week Montrose, a city in the West, decided to ban six months, which is likely to be adopted next week.
"We don't want to get into a position where we license someone and then face a big problem at federal level," says Bob Nicholson, a member of the City Council.
Our community has voted against this amendment of the law.
We judge for what the community has chosen and not for what the state has chosen.
Many questions are still open.
Petronella Wyatt: I was bullied from Oxford because I'm Tory
Not only university students today will be attacked for their views
It has always been my greatest dream to have a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother had attended the university that I once held for the world’s greatest stamp of knowledge, for a modern Greek symposium that promoted the great pillars of civilization – free thinking and tolerance.
But within two weeks of my entry into Worscester College at the end of the eighties - there I had planned to study history - I had repacked my suitcase and thus brought the first scandal of my life.
My father broke into tears.
My friends were confused.
In the Evening Standard it was said that I had gone because I had a problem having sex with fellows in the adjacent room.
The author A N Wilson told me that I had left the university because I was forced to drink from damaged cups.
But the truth was less amusing.
I ran away.
Yes, run, because I was under systematic bullying and threats.
Not because of my rather unusual name, or because I came from a private school.
I had only been harassed for one reason - a reason that seemed so narrow and cruel in this supposed cradle of enlightenment: My now deceased father Woodrow Wyatt was an important consultant to Margaret Thatcher and I support the Conservative Party.
Why do I mention this right now?
Well, current reports suggest that a new generation of students of moderate rights suffer similar persecution.
The organized and rising hatred of Tory students in Oxford has now developed such dimensions that a group of them last week demanded the same level of protection for gays, disabled people and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Junior Common Room (JCR) of the Corpus Christi College indicate that they are often "actively isolated, personally attacked and declared undesirable due to their political views".
They call for a place in their college's equal opportunities committee to ensure that their opinions can be expressed freely.
Her situation worsened by a recently broadcast documentary about political students on BBC Two, "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right", which represented Tories as eccentric and Neonazis.
Among other things, this was shown by the graduate Joe Cooke, former president of the conservative Student Association of Oxford University, who rode in a Rolls-Royce and protruded with silver-coloured suit and silver-occupied walking stock.
At other universities conservative students say that they are considered to be "sunbooks for the introduction of higher tuition fees".
The 20-year-old Luke Black, Vice President of the Conservative Student Association of Nottingham University, stated in a Sunday newspaper: "There is a growing left tendency at universities.
People think we're like the Bullingdon Club without even getting to know us."
Samuel Roberts, 21 and a history student in Corpus Christi, who initiated the quest for greater protection, is of the opinion that such a climate is "discompassionate". The 19-year-old Stephanie Cherill, president of Oxford's conservative student association, said that she had observed a growing rejection of students of moderate rights at JCR members.
"This poses a danger to intellectual discourse and the well-being of members," she says.
In my first weeks in Oxford, I belonged to such a minority.
As an incredibly shy 18-year-old I had arrived in September 1986.
The hatred of the Conservative Party had reached its climax.
In the previous year, the university had voted to give Margaret Thatcher - a former student - no honorary title due to cuts in higher education.
The atmosphere would even have made Stalinists startled.
In the first days of the first semester week, when new students met and the tutors, I had a taste of the future events.
I had the experience that the Tutors not only tolerated Tory students' ridicule, but even took part in it with joy.
Political issues such as the miner strike, the privatisation and the rejection of the government of sanctions against the apartheid regime of South Africa found their way into the wooded areas of the tutorial.
At my first of these events, I was supposed to translate French texts from the 18th century into English. I had not been drawn to what was to come.
"Miss Wyatt," said the Tutor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "translate the first paragraph."
I stumbled on it.
Pitt was a little man with a face like a cake dough, and pretty ugly.
"Does thatcher followers refuse to learn French, or are they just stupid?" he asked me.
The other students looked.
There were tears in my eyes.
"I suggest that they take a few French hours in your spare time - so if you're not too busy with your social activities," Pitt murmured.
I returned to my room with my hanging head.
That night I was sitting at college alone at dinner, when someone just tipped me on my shoulder.
It was an English student from the second year called James, who presented himself as a member of the Conservative Student Association.
"I know who you are," he said kindly.
Unfortunately, it's the way it is.
Anyone who is suspected of being Tory will be distracted.
It's bad enough for me, but they know your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, which is why it's gonna be worse for you.
Most Tory first semesters pretend to be members of the Labour Party.
Later, in a local pub, I tried to adjust.
I insisted that I didn't agree with Mrs. Thatcher on all points.
This trick should prove unsuccessful.
A beginner in philosophy, politics and business who ironically visited Eton College, which is a conservative, said to me, "You are the daughter of a fascist pig."
You're dirty.
Other students shared his opinion.
I was perverse and dirty.
"How do Tories have sex?" asked me one.
They're hitting each other, aren't they?
I felt like homosexuals must have felt before the more liberal legislation of the United States.
Would I ever manage to live a normal life at Oxford University?
Would I be able to meet like-minded people only after dark?
Should I turn to the Labour Party and suppress my natural inclinations?
The three years ahead of me extended before my spiritual eye to a purgatory of agony and isolation.
The only Tutor who was openly recognized as Tory was Norman Stone, Professor of Contemporary History, who was based in my college.
He was hated not only to be a conservative but also because he had advised Thatcher about foreign policy and written speeches for them.
He was only rare.
He hated the place, found him provincial and petty and rejected him for his Marxist-determinist history perspective.
In 1997 he took a professorship at the University of Bilkent in Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he told me.
I began to commute between Oxford and the house of my parents and found refuge with open friends and family members in the city.
My father told me that I hate Oxford, and why I did it.
He seemed disbeliefless.
During his time in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said pettyly.
They would never do such a thing, not in my city of dreaming towers.
Even my communist friends were always mannering perfectly.
His humid eyes were dripping.
Give the whole thing a chance.
I'm sure you're just being necked.
It would break my heart if you left.
Exhausted by my frequent travels to London, my emotional resistance became weaker.
One of my male friends, also Tory's followers, had given in to the pressure and refused his beliefs.
During a tutorial the following week, in which another historian had seriously claimed that I was "an enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
Although I was secretly torn in shame, I admitted that my parents had subjected me to a "brain wash" and called her "old fool".
The relief lasted only a short time.
It was my father who hit the last nail in the coffin of my Oxford career.
At that time he wrote two columns a week in the Murdoch press.
My door was locked.
I was hiding in my room, and after five minutes, my bunnies gave up.
When they left, I packed a suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never returned.
I'd like you to call me a wailing wreath.
But no 18-year-old should ever have to suffer from such intimidation and malice in an educational establishment.
And even more tragic is that it was Oxford - a university that not only produced 14 Tory prime ministers, but still hidden behind an undeserved call of equal rights and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance of fame"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino - Couture Master", which was opened this week in London, ABC speaks to Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous customers of the Italian fashion maker.
Somerset House, the former residence of Isabel I of England, is the only place in the British capital that is worthy of hosting an exhibition about Valentino Garavani.
This has been recognized by the designer at the opening of "Valentino - Master of the Couture", a magnificent retrospective for which more than 130 clothes of the Haute Couture have been put together, created by his "Maison" over the last 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says with his distinctive Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story whose only protagonist is "il signore" Garavani, but who could not have been written without his distinguished clientele.
Valentino has always felt fascination with the nobility and distant world of the nobility.
In the first hall of this exhibition, which is to be seen until March 3, there are a variety of private letters and photos with the signature of the most exquisite aristocracy, beginning with the Princess Salimah Aga Khan, the Princess Marie-Chantal from Greece and Margarita from England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino shows these personal memories as trophies of his social ascent from modest fashionmakers in the city of Voghera in northern Italy to the idol of the international jetset.
Being in love with the nobility does not have to be detrimental.
"At least they don't put their chickens on your magnificent carpet, as some beautiful celebrities do from pop music," says Baronin Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 60s and 70s, the two lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular, generous and elegant host.
"We were all happy when we were invited to his house in Gstaad," explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, closely friends with forgotten beauty such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred the elegance of fame.
And yet he's a star.
Valeria Mazza, in a dress of Valentino
Even the Argentine model Valeria Mazza does not forget the charisma of the fashionmaker.
Many years ago we went to his home for dinner after a fashion show at the Piazza di Spagna in Rome.
We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
Every detail of his apartment, decoration, food and music recognized and felt his influence.
"All invited persons felt important and loved," recalls the "top model", which started their career in the 1995 Haute Couture week in Paris.
"He never comes out of fashion because his designs are artworks," she concludes.
Fashion show of origin
The life of Garavani is not a history of oblivion, rather of mutual love.
He likes people with good education and the highest titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries in Somerset House has been transformed into a glorious and 60-metre-long walkway, which proposes a roll exchange: the user takes the place of the model and walks along the walkway to admire a dreamy "audienz" that wears masterpieces of Valentino, such as the dress that Jackie Kennedy chose for her wedding with Aristóteles Onassis, the costumes that Monica Vitti wore in "La Notte", or a coat of wool and leather that belonged to Emperor Farah Diba.
In this audience from fashion dolls, such names as those of Sibilla de Luxemburgo, Gloria of Thurn and Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sofía of Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the Fashionmaker, 2006
Many of these customers say that the first Valentino is like the first love, "inescapable".
I can still remember perfectly.
It was a pants, a shirt, a vest type "gillette" and a jacket from the fall/winter collection 1971-1972.
"It was a gift from him," says Naty Abascal, one of the designer's museums.
"I prefer him to everyone else because of his great love for women and because he emphasizes our beauty," adds the former Duchess of Feria.
I like the colors he uses very much; they have a lot of light and underline the face.
The proportions are perfect.
Even the princess and opinion leader at the fashion Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg can't forget the first time she wore a Valentino.
When I was a teenager in Italy, I dreamed of finally having the age and opportunity to wear one of his evening clothes...
At the end of the 1990s it was finally added.
I bought my first Valentino dress for a party at my Veters' Castle, the Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress with flying skirt and a draped upper part with a décolleté that honors his name.
"It was a real dream," says the widow of Rodrigo d'Arenberg.
"Valentino does not depend on fashion, its obsession is timeless," explains this Italian aristocracy who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
The Princess D'Arenberg keeps her evening dresses of the fashionmaker "with absolute care", "because a dress is not only a dress, but also the memories associated with it".
The "king" of fashion
The great final of the exhibition in Somerset House is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress for her wedding with Pablo de Grecia in 1995.
Four months of work and 25 "Ragazze" (as the fashionmaker called his close-ups) were necessary to make this ivory silk dress with pearls, twelve different embroiderys and a four and a half-meter long tail.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the chief authority of the trade press, this dress was a milestone in the Haute Couture at the end of the 20th century, "the return to the customers of the supreme society".
For years with the "savoury-être" of the elite, Valentino is now her best copy.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest award in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, awarded with the Legion of Honor, Garavani cumulates as many honours as any of its customers' husbands.
"I always noticed his refinement, his calmness, his well-kept and perfect exterior," admits D'Arenberg.
I saw him last time a month ago at a gala dinner at the Museum de Orsay.
He sat at the table of the Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a very good friend of mine.
"He was unblemished; time leaves no trace of him."
And this is what a princess says...
The most difficult occupation in the world: the human work animals of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the bearers of the Indonesian volcano risk their lives and health when carrying 70 kilos of sulphur across the steep, rocky paths.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and others work literally in hell.
This is the case with Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn their lives by getting sulfur from the Kawah Ijen volcano in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
To do this, he has to climb down to the bottom of his crater every day, where the sulfurous gas that emerges from the earth is fortified in contact with the air.
After breaking out large sulfurstones, which can weigh up to 70 kilos in total, he transports them in two bamboo baskets on his shoulders over the waste paths of stone.
It is only 250 meters to the top of the volcano, which rises to a height of 2386 meters, but the exhausted carriers need more than 40 minutes to climb in the turtle's pace, keeping the balance and carefully setting their steps in order to avoid slipping and falling.
They know that every step can cost their lives, as happened to a French tourist who crashed on the steep slopes of the Kawah Ijen years ago.
The miners of Kawah Ijen earn 5 Eurocent for every kilo of sulphur they mine.
Upstairs, they pave the way between the tourists who photograph them like circus coffees and run with the tiresome, heavy baskets three kilometers to the scale, which a mining company has positioned a little further down at an altitude of 1850 meters
The company is PT Candi Nagrimbi, who since 1960 has exploited the incidents in the volcano and (never better said) his workers, to whom they pay 662 Indonesian rupees (5 Eurocent) for each kilo of sulphur.
It then sells them to the petrochemical industry for 10,000 rupees (83 Eurocent) each, because this mineral is widely used in everyday life and is used for the production of matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even for the bleaching of sugar.
"Since we usually carry 70 kg, we get about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) for every way," Anto tells us, who normally makes three routes a day.
He needs three hours for each route, after which he is completely done, but at the end of the day he has 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros).
What looks like a miserable wage for such a seemingly inhuman effort, but is the triple of what he would earn with field work.
"The daily wage of mine workers here, where 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) are paid each day at the coffee harvest and the average monthly income is two million rupees (167 euros) is very high," explains the carrier, who previously worked as a mason on the tourist island of Bali.
There he earned 75,000 rupees (6,2 euros) on the day, and the work was not as hard, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village nearby, for a reason as important as the sulfur in Indonesia: "I married a girl from Bali where they are Hindus, and I brought her to Java to convert them to Islam".
Anto has asthma, breathing with difficulty, often coughs and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases.
The 27-year-old Anto has been putting his life on the Kawah Ijen for three years, whose sulfur has already left him the first tracks, although he covers his face with a mask and special glasses.
Anto has asthma, breathing with difficulty, frequently coughs and his eyes are irritated from the volcano because of the toxic gases.
This is the price he must pay to achieve his dream.
"I'm going to work here for two more years because I'm going to open a store or learn Spanish or French," he promises in a more than acceptable English language.
This sympathetic and intelligent, but punishable young man could work as a tourist guide, waitress or at the reception of a hotel, but instead he does the work of a carrier.
He shares a dirty wooden hut with other wearers and stands up every morning at two o'clock, because the sulfur also pours out at night, where his characteristic yellow color in the dark glows bluishly.
challenging the shadows, he rises in the light of a small headlight on his helmet, which he bought from his own money, into the crater.
On the crater floor about 400 carriers load the basket with sulfur on their shoulders.
Despite their large profits, the mining company has not mechanized the sulphur reduction to save costs, and does not provide any equipment to the carriers who work on their own account and are paid by weight.
They also receive no part of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) surcharge per camera, which the guards of this nature park, together with the entrance fee of 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros), demand from tourists who come to photograph the volcano and the human carrying.
"This work is for animals and not for humans" protests Madrusin, a solid, 42-year-old carrier who has worked for three decades since leaving school at Kawah Ijen.
He is able to carry up to 110 kg and assures that he continues, "as long as it goes," because he needs the money for raising his three children between the ages of 10 and 18.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano was my whole life.
Even if the sulfur burns the throat and the eyes snap when the wind turns suddenly and the miners stick into the thick columns rising from the crater, the men are so hard that no one complains about severe diseases ... of course except the usual breathing problems, osteoarthritis, pain in the knees and bladders on the shoulders that have been shaped by the weight of the basket.
With the basket on its back, it is only able to carry 50 kg with its 53 years of age.
Every day he and his companions break 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which are transported from three trucks over a goat's path between the bush to the camp in Tamansari in 18 kilometers away.
"I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano was my whole life," explains Unainik, opening his mouth wide in which some teeth are missing.
Of his five children, the elder, with his 30 years of age, also works as a sulfur carrier.
Time passes, but impoverishment lasts generation upon generation in one of the toughest occupations in the world: those who work as human vices at Kawah Ijen.
Singapore needs babies to save the economy
The Singaporens blame them for not having children, for their careers, for the stress and costs of real estate and child education.
"The population of Singapore must grow."
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife: We fulfill our civic duty and we create lives!
It seems incredible that the verses are part of an advertisement for minzbons, but still – or that is why – they became a viral video on YouTube in Singapore at the beginning of this year.
The sets are part of a rapper song, the local sayings such as "sleep will be a "bao" (lay) in the oven to make fun of the low birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising company BBH, who shot the video, hopes that the commercial will reach in a funny way to draw attention to the problem.
Her creative director Douglas Hamilton says that he wanted to use the power of music to bring people to fulfill their "national duty".
This is only for the Internet, so we had to make it funny and funny.
This is the biggest problem in this country.
When we were planting, we were the worst in the world, so we noticed that it was a topic that we had to take care of.
We knew that the government had tried a lot, such as the marketing of perfume with pheromones or the organization of speed dating evenings (fast flirts).
Possibly that many of these ideas were creative, but they did not necessarily lead to success.
So we thought: Why don't we do something as creative as possible to tackle this problem, such as composing a rap?
1.2 Children
Who does not take this subject easily is the government of Singapore.
Every year, it spends $1,300 on policy measures to encourage citizens to have more children.
A package of government grants up to $15,000 per child for couples and parents, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But everything has not been successful so far.
Singapore is a rich, highly technological city state in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its rulers and its strict social controls.
According to its national population authority, the birth rate is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time that this rate was above 2 - which is also known as the replacement rate - was in 1976.
So why don't the Singaporeans have any more kids?
Tan Wei Ming, Director of Marriage and Family Policy of the National Population Authority, says that this is due to "better education" and "greater career opportunities".
"This has enabled people to have significantly more options in terms of life goals and priorities except to marry and to form a family," she explains.
These changes in social conditions have contributed to a higher number of single and delayed marriages and births, the result of which is the reduction of the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, immigration policies aimed at a drastic increase in immigration in order to counteract the decline in the population led to resentment in the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites where the barely clogged Xenophobia blossoms against many new immigrants, especially against the Chinese, who are criticized for keeping the wages low and not integrating themselves.
The rise in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why the government party in Singapore has achieved its worst election result since independence last year.
Since the elections, an attempt has been made to correct the problem with higher contributions and charges for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the falling birth rate has the well-known impact on the economic growth of a nation, tax revenue, health costs and immigration policy, the example of Singapore also shows unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to reach that not so many small apartments are being built.
It has already had an impact on the housing market.
The urban development authority has started to control the number of small apartments known as "shoe boxes" and may be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have a living area of 46 square meters and show a great sales success.
However, there is concern that they can promote the lifestyle of the single person and that they discourage the construction companies from building large homes for families.
But Lim Yew Soon, Director General of Property Company EL Developers, says that his "shoe boxes" can be sold much faster than larger housing units.
They are so popular, and the units are sold out by day and even weeks faster than the larger housing units.
This leads to that they are much better for our Cash Flow.
He admits, however, that the new standards provide clearer guidance to developers who had previously been placed in the way of obstacles when they wanted to build too many small housing units within a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city.
Even if these new rules could pave the way for an increase in the national birth rate, talks with the Singaporeans who work in the financial district should be noted that they will not have a major impact.
"People are stressed out, homes and education are expensive too, so it's being pushed out by many," says a young manager.
The children can have others.
"It is important for me to have my own money and time," says another, about twenty years old man.
Men and women lead their careers, stress and the cost of ownership and education as reasons why they cannot have children.
That is why the Singaporeans have the last word when it comes to having children - the government can still do so much.
Offline Private offline is online private
Privacy
According to the dictionary, this is the private property or "the area of private life where protection is claimed from any kind of interference".
What's private for someone under 16 years old?
How is this definition applied to its everyday life and social networks?
Does he understand the dangers he faces when he announces on the Internet situations that he would not share in real life?
El Periódico interviewed five young people between the ages of 10 and 15 who are often on the network.
In four of the cases, they associated the term with "something very own" on a personal level and "on the password and the user" when they applied it to the social networks.
"I wouldn't disclose my deepest secrets in a post," says the 10 year old Jorge trying to explain the meaning of "private" in websites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has accounts for two years.
"These are very confidential secrets, my mother may know them, but not the whole world," he confirms.
On FB I upload beautiful pictures or pictures of games.
I'm also spending my time with acquaintances.
"I wouldn't share a photo that isn't mine, or someone that makes the fool head," he says.
The boy is aware that it is wrong to publish obscene photos, from naked ones, of crimes, or to write insulting or violent comments.
Jorge assures him to know 35 friends he has in FB and nine followers in Twitter.
Most are relatives.
This includes the mother who has the password for one of the accounts.
I signed up to Twitter to express myself and write interesting Tweets.
"I don't know if anyone will answer me, I'll just let her up," he adds.
"The social networks are entertaining, I can talk quickly to relatives in the distance or to friends".
Asked him that he would never accept an invitation from an unknown.
Even if someone told him that he was a stranger, he would ignore it.
The case of the 14-year-old José is different.
The teenager has user accounts in Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask. In Ask he admits not to know 20 of the people he has attached to his friend list.
"That doesn't scare me because we have something bad, for example music," he says.
According to the boy, no one has given him any clues or asked him for his address or telephone number.
"If anyone bothers me or asks me to do it, I simply remove it from my user account" he admits.
José joined Ask after reading a recommendation in Twitter.
The boy's experience is not unknown, which is known today as cyberbullying.
The acquaintance of a friend was blackmailed in a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He never knew who it was," he assures.
According to José, the victim has not closed the user account.
"He only made it private."
After that, he explains a number of steps to safely configure a user account.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yeah, I'd do that if he was unsympathetic to me or I wanted to wipe him out one.
"But I know this is cyberbullying," he explains.
Key Issues
Marielos Porras, teacher of English with university degree in education and learning, believes that to orient the children and young people, it must be understood that it is the purpose of social networks to inform.
"The Internet was created as a means of searching for information; but with the appearance of these pages the rules of the game have changed," she says.
Porras explains that the academic Marc Prensky, holder of a master's title in pedagogy at Yale University and author of the work "Digital Natives and Immigrants", formed these terms for explaining the phenomenon.
The digital natives are the children and young people who have grown up with this technology.
"We are the digital immigrants who are supposed to teach them where we are still learning ourselves," he says.
He explains that this is a complex issue, "because we ask them to have a defined criterion on what may be spread, published or said, and this at an age where maturity is not sufficient for it."
"They should also be elective when it is most important to them to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," he adds.
According to the expert, the most effective way to teach children and young people is what privacy is to ask them questions that make them think.
"To tell him they shouldn't do it, doesn't work," he says.
Porras then mentions some possibilities: there are things you wouldn’t tell a stranger. Then why do you do it on the Internet?
Or: Would you like to have a photo of yourself published like that of a friend?
Do you know what the others are publishing about you?
Did you ask the other people permission before when you labeled photos of celebrations?
And another question: Do everyone have to know what you're doing at any moment?
Another point is to give them to understand that they have to act online as they do offline.
It's the same rules.
"Someone outside the Internet deals with respect, morality and other principles, and the same must apply to social networks," he explains.
Monitoring
Estuardo Guardia, university professor, elementary school teacher and educator, commented that it is essential that parents read the guidelines of social networks carefully.
If they understand all sections, they have solid foundations to talk to their children about the importance of opening one user account on the Internet.
"For example, age, or what you may share or publish," he explains.
According to Guardia, the children must be reminded of the lesson "Don't talk to strangers".
Completion of the Unasur Summit without publication of the Lima Declaration
The 6th Summit of the Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru without publication of the Lima Declaration, which was announced before and should theoretically be signed by the seven governments present.
Efe repeatedly attempted to gain access to the signed document at the VIth Ordinary Meeting of the Heads of State and Government of the Unasur. Sources at the State and Presidential Office initially announced that they would hand it over after the term, however, after stating that it would be published at some time on the Peruvian government's website.
On questions relating to the text, they stated that the content was presented to the press by the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala.
The access of journalists to information about the summit was limited at any time.
During the day only the image of the Presidential Meeting without sound was transmitted with the message "private session, limited audio".
The few information circulated among the journalists was received by the press spokesmen of some of the unasoured governments present at the meeting, but not by the Peruvian press spokesperson.
The only document that was published during the day was the list of the participating presidents, which caused discomfort to the hundreds of journalists of various national and international media who demanded more information.
After that, the Presidential Office of Peru sent the media an e-mail with the "Declaration" of the summit, but this was the explanation of Humala and not the official document at the end of the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the Third Summit of South America - Arab States (ASPA), and even on this occasion, despite a strong call by the press, the so-called Lima Declaration, which had been announced earlier, was also not published.
On the official website of the ASPA you can be sure that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities stressed that the information systems for journalists were available, but to a large extent they restricted access to information.
The summit also ended with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to adopt a judgment of the Court of Justice of the Hague which provides for a border conflict between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the regional meeting and confirmed that they would accept the IGH's decision, which begins on Monday in The Hague, in the process of launching Lima against Santiago to listen to the plädoyers of both sides.
"We will follow and execute the ruling on the differences we are currently presenting to this international court," said Humala together with his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile was, is and remains a country that adheres to international laws, seeks peaceful solutions to disputes, concludes agreements and submits to international courts," Piñera added, and greeted Humala with a handshake in front of the flags of both countries.
The confirmation by both Presidents that they would submit to the IGH took place after Colombia had filed an action against the Bogota Agreement following a decision on the maritime borders with Nicaragua, which considered it a serious mistake, in which it agreed to submit to the judgments of this International Court.
At the summit the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner were present.
Paraguay, which has been excluded from the Unasur since 2011 since the resignation of its President Fernando Lugo, did not take part in the meeting.
The host President Ollanta Humala opened the discussions in the morning and concluded the summit shortly after noon in Lima.
The head of state leaves the closing document, which stated that 16 decisions were taken and the lines of action for 31 projects between the South American countries were set at an investment amount of a total of 17 billion dollars.
Regarding the decisions taken, he said that the countries of Unasur "will take significant steps towards the goal of a South American citizenship, to which we extend the decisions on residence rights."
He said that action would be taken to improve "co-operation in the fight against urban uncertainty and organised, cross-border crime, as well as measures to improve access to medicines and the Internet at low prices in all regions of South America and to act jointly and efficiently in the event of natural disasters".
With the crisis in Europe, "economic consolidation (in Latin America) should not accept triumphant trains, but should serve to expand our production performance and show our peoples a better future," added Humala.
"We have decided to give priority to a number of 31 emblematic projects aimed at improving regional links in South America and especially in rural and border regions...and thus bringing together our countries and opening up new economic forms," said the Peruvian President in a read-out statement.
Among these projects would also be five Peruvian, which were located on the squares of its territory from the coast to Brazil, and two of which would provide a better connection with Ecuador, although it did not provide any further details.
The concluding document also referred to the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve for its resumption in the Union of South American Nations", which is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to continue to be an integrated region for prosperity and peace and with good neighbourly relations was another aspect highlighted at the summit.
In this sense, the president of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before the start of his participation in the regional meeting that he expected on Saturday in Mexico a meeting with his counterpart of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, to respectfully treat the maritime conflict following a judgment of the IGH challenged by Bogotá.
"Maybe I will meet with President Daniel Ortega tomorrow (Saturday)," said Santos.
"We will review all these ways - they are not exclusive, and the agreement with Nicaragua also makes dialogue with Nicaragua necessary," he stressed.
"I hope to be able to tell the President Ortega that we will treat this matter as civilized and respectfully as possible," added Santos.
Santos and Ortega would meet in Mexico on Saturday, where they intend to be present at the office of the new president of this country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
As part of the summit, the Minister for Defence of the Block also met in advance to adopt the 2013 Action Plan, which aims to strengthen dialogue and consensus on the region's defence.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are members of UNASUR, even if the latter country is currently excluded.
Peru has the presidency at the time of the regional block.
"South America must learn when it integrates its citizens," says Rafael Correa
The president of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, today confirmed that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal, where "South America can actually learn something from Europe."
Correa, who attended the 6th Summit of the Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which took place in Lima, stated to the state television in Peru that Europeans "had killed themselves in World War II and other conflicts" and "now are practically a fatherland."
In this sense, he defended the project to create a South American citizenship that drives the member states of the Unasur.
"The free movement of citizens and workers must be achieved in all South American countries, as is already the case in the Andean Community; however, there are still reactionary sectors which seek a return to the past," he warned.
The President of Ecuador also supported the redesign of the Organisation of American States (OEA) with the aim of reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon States and taking into account those who signed the Convention on Human Rights of San José.
Those who teach never commit themselves to anything, and in return we always sign everything to the South Americans.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Human Rights Commission is based in Washington and is funded by the United States," he explained as an illustration of the political asylum that Ecuador granted to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Correa assured that he did not regret this decision because he had not betrayed his principles, but had followed his "deep democratic values and views on human rights".
He added that at the time, "reasoned assumptions had been made that Assange would be delivered to a third country and that his proceedings would not be complied with."
He also criticized the Swedish judiciary that had asked him to interrogate him on his territory for an alleged sexual offence, while "Swedish case law allows this by means of a videoconferencing that could have been carried out on the Ecuador Embassy in London."
Correa explained that there was a risk that the health and mental condition of Assange would be impaired.
"Since he is in our message, I have not spoken to him, but the ambassador has informed me that he has a slight problem with the lungs, but not a serious one," said Ecuador's head of state.
However, there is a danger that he will take physical and mental damage because he has been caught in a narrow space and cannot perform physical exercises outdoors.
"That would affect everyone's health," he added.
Correa stated that the solution for the asylum granted by Assange since June in the Ecuador Embassy in London was the granting of a free letter with which he could travel to Ecuador, and that this was in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities. He stressed that there had been talks with London to find a solution for the imprisoned founder of WikiLeaks.
We are not dealing with human rights, we are not using this word in this case, but there have been constant discussions.
"The solution to this problem lies in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the judicial authorities of Europe , because the lawyer of Assange, Baltazar Garzón, leads a number of proceedings on various European bodies," he said.
And "If Britain grants this free letter tomorrow, I think it's done."
And if Sweden interrogated Mr Assange at the Ecuador Embassy in London or about Skype, how it allowed Swedish case law and was done in other cases, then the problem would have been solved.
Correa took advantage of the opportunity to confirm himself as a defender of freedom of the press and said that what he does not tolerate is "the mediocrity, the evil intent and the lies that undermine the free expression of opinion."
"The biggest enemies of freedom of the press are not evil and perverted politicians, but bad journalists who seek and extortion profit," he said.
In this sense, he congratulated himself that Ecuador was no longer dominated by such journalists "and neither by the bankers nor by the hegemonic and petty-bourgeois countries," and took the lead in saying that he would "deepen the revolution in order to continue the path in this right direction."
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto against Paraguay in the unasour at least until its next elections, arguing that the organism "must remain hard and must not allow opportunism and no State empire as legally disguised", because "the legitimacy of democracy in Paraguay has been destroyed."
The President of Ecuador also considers that the wish of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, now and after the judgment of the International Court of Justice of the Hague, which favored Nicaragua's maritime sovereignty, to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime borders between both countries, is "absolutely justified."
This judgment is currently not implemented.
This is a problem between a South American and a Central American state.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome in the pursuit of a common path.
They must be treated in full so that they can be overcome and looked forward.
He also relied on a good conclusion to the dispute over the maritime borders between Peru and Chile before the same Court of Justice and said that "it is right for Latin America to call on international bodies if both countries undertake to accept the judgment even if it is very difficult to do so."
With regard to the possibility that he is a candidate for the next presidential elections in Ecuador in order to succeed in his third mandate, he indicated that he sees this possibility "with much optimism and joy, although sometimes it is very difficult."
Correa assured that if he allowed the elections in February 2013, he would withdraw from political life.
Power has never interested me personally, but under such unjust circumstances as in Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
"My political movement had the belief that I was the one who guaranteed this probable victory, so I have to live up to this responsibility," he said.
If I were to win, it would be my last term as president, then I would withdraw from public life.
This also applies if we lose.
"That's decided," he said.
Correa also addressed the health problems of the president of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, in Cuba.
I just spoke to Vice President of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro, who told me that he had gone there for a planned routine treatment and that he would be expected to return to Cuba after the election campaign.
"It does not in any case mean a relapse in the state of health of President Chávez," he commented.
The Ecuadorian Head of State took part today in Lima at the 6th Summit of the Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), which ended with the call for higher regional integration in order to ensure sustainable progress, equality and security.
Cause of AIDS Death Is Too Late to Recognize Today
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed by the results: HIV positive.
"It was as if a bomb hit," he says about the moment he received the diagnosis that the doctor tried to "weaken" without recognizable success.
He hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness alone and began to inform himself about it, and this with such commitment that he just celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients in the HIV unit of the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), in which he came after several fights in 1994.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, which was difficult to imagine in the early 1990s when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigmata.
At that time, the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying goodbye, "because it led to a dead end."
AIDS was synonymous with death at that time.
Today it is possible to survive this syndrome with quality of life.
However, many people still come to the clinic who know nothing about their illness and who have already done harm to the virus and have exhausted their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the onset of AIDS in the world, i.e. after the first cases reported, "the great success today means that the survival of a patient who is receiving treatment in good time and the survival of the general population is exactly the same," explained the director of the HCG HIV Unit, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, who said that this information had been supported by a prestigious scientific publication in April of this year.
The expert on infectious diseases and HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that since 2008, the scientists concluded that AIDS was not a death sentence, but that the years of survival and quality of life depended on the degree of impairment of the immune system of the individuals at the start of the treatment, and that the greater chances would have non-drug-dependent ones: up to 30 years with a count of 200 CD4 and 50 years with a count of 500 CD4.
Simply put, the above statements mean that those who receive HIV positive at the age of 25 "can easily age 75 as long as they are under control," said this specialist.
In order to properly organize this progress, it must be recalled that today the life expectancy of the Mexicans is an average of 76 years.
Even if mortality has decreased significantly in recent years (in Mexico, the number of people dying of AIDS has decreased from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (ONUSIDA Annual Report), it is nevertheless true that since the onset of AIDS, 60 percent of patients recorded in the national database have died.
In 2011, 255 people died alone in Jalisco, and by the month of May of this year there are 187 deaths; however, it is assured that there has been universal access to antiretroviral medicines since 2005.
So why do people still die on it?
- I don't think the problem is access to treatment.
This is my opinion, and so is our hospital.
At least in the past 12 years, we have not had any drug supply problems. The problem is that people come in advanced conditions because they do not know their condition of infection, i.e. in very late stages of the disease.
He makes a striking statement: "nine out of ten patients come to us if they already have an accompanying infection. In order to influence global mortality, more early diagnostics are required, which is why all those in whom this is necessary must be offered massive detection tests."
This proposal was approved by the experts and officials of the Consejo Estate de Prevención del Sida en Jalisco (Coesida) (State Committee on AIDS in Jalisco) and also by the patients such as Fabrizio who had his test carried out in a private laboratory, for the sole reason that it had made a friend of him who, despite his young age, was already in the AIDS phase and even had the Kaposi Sarkom (a cancerous tumor), which is one of the usual complications.
Everything is different if you know you have AIDS.
Some think they're going to die, and don't want to hear anything.
"If I have to die, I'd rather burst three times," they say in my case.
The change was to improve, I eat well, play sports and take the drugs.
Today his parents only know that he had cancer.
I live a normal life, like everyone else.
"I work, do a lot, have an active but responsible sex life, I pay attention to my health and the other person," says Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimate details with MILENIO JALISCO in order to animated with his testimony those who are afraid today in the context of the worldwide AIDS day.
They should take the test if they belong to the risk group. The earlier they know if they are HIV positive, the better, and if they already know the diagnosis, they should learn how to live responsibly like all people.
His message is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
Major gaps exist between health programmes and the simple citizen, explains Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara, who has accepted the HIV case.
And the most important thing is prevention.
In the places designated for this "the distribution of condoms was actually increased; in the past they were delivered individually, now they give us packages with a hundred pieces, which is already good, but there are still people who do not have access to a condom," he said.
Young people are at risk for new infections.
"What do you need this for?" is a common joke by social workers, guidance staff in schools, pharmacies employees and in the health care system that young people do not want to be exposed to, insured the correspondent.
It proposed to reorientate this inefficient distribution; condoms should not only be located behind the shop table, but in public toilets of facilities frequently visited by young people.
Promiscuity should not be promoted.
The beer and motel should not be paid to them, as the Governor Emilio González answered the question of whether to be distributed preservatives under his administration.
"Sexuality does not look like that; it is best to bring the condoms closer to those who already engage in sexual activity," he pointed it out.
Key data of Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The state is situated nationally in the fourth place of new and cumulated AIDS cases, and in the 13th place of HIV.
92% of infections occur via sexual intercourse, 6% via blood and 2% perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people live with HIV because there are 4 or 5 people registered for each case that do not know.
After the United States Court of Appeal confirmed a judgment which did not recognise the restructuring of Vitro Group’s liabilities achieved through a trade bankruptcy in Mexico, an incurable precedent for each national company with branches in the neighbouring country has been created.
It could therefore be said that the procedures for the survival of the companies that allow the Mexican laws are not valid in the country of the stars and stripes, contrary to international agreements.
In practice, the recognition of the judgment given by Judge Harlin Hale at the Bancarrotas Court for the northern district of Texas on 15 June leads to the fact that Mexican companies are without help exposed to the confiscation of their property beyond the Bravo River.
However, the decision opens the door and door to the largest glass manufacturer in Mexico to appeal to the United States Supreme Court for three inconsistencies.
While the judge points out that creditors must be subject to the bankruptcy law of the United States, the appeal court of the Fifth Circuit, based in New Orleans, first states that the main proceedings are the commercial bankruptcy dealt with in Mexico.
The first point would mean that international cooperation in insolvency proceedings of companies with a cross-border profile is not known.
In fact, for this purpose, the United Nations Model Law for the Unification of International Trade Law was created, using the American Law Institute as a simple one.
Second, the judgment provides that, without the votes of the companies, after recognition of the liabilities in the bankruptcy stock held by Vitro’s subsidiaries with their parent company, the required majority for the restructuring of the liabilities would not have been reached.
However, this possibility is recognised by Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro is not the first case in which this scheme has been approved.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose liabilities were confirmed by the Instituto Federal de Concursos Mercantiles (Bundesinstitut für Handelskonkurse).
It is also correct that, after the votes of the branches were withdrawn, the creditors of Vitro, the creditors who complained to the United States courts against Vitro, i.e. the Geier-Fonds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have reached a majority.
The vote would take place at 45% and at 37%.
This is not taken into account by the appeal court.
On the other hand, there is Vitro blame for his difficult situation as of 2008 in the context of the major economic crisis in the United States, which gave the country blows.
For this reason, the González Sada family brings an objection before the same appeal court in order for the vote to take place in plenary, i.e. by all judges, because only three voted against.
If this is not allowed, the Cerciorare appeal, which requires the review of the proceedings by a higher instance, shall be filed in this case by the Supreme Court of the United States.
The most serious case in this case is that the court left aside a document sent by the Government of Mexico under the Figura amicus curiae (Friend of the Court), which describes Vitro's proceedings under the law on commercial bankruptcy, and points out that it had adhered strictly to the agreements signed by both countries in order to comply with Chapter 15 of the bankruptcy law of the United States.
It should also be noted that the country has submitted to the principles of the Commission of the United Nations for international trade, i.e. the established rules on cross-border indebtedness which guarantee equality between debtors and creditors.
Two-band carambola: a blow for vitro and for the country.
General balance sheet
After the ads by the Mexican air transport trade unions against the former owner Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, who is accused of fraud, did not move forward for several months, the Asociación Sindical de Pilotos Aviadores (the Federation of Pilots) has finally made progress.
The request made by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau has now filed a criminal proceeding against the National Banking and Securities Commission, which is accused of obstructing the judiciary.
Thereafter, the supervisory authority has systematically refused to inform the Governing Board of the Republic of a transaction carried out by the entrepreneur in order to withdraw from the trustee account F/589 of Bank IXE under the name of Mexicoana de Aviación 198 million pesos.
These funds were used for the acquisition of shares of the Administeradora Profesional de Hoteles (the professional hotel administration).
As you know, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the hotel chain Posadas.
Dragon Mart is surrounded
At a weekend meeting at a forum of the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, academics, entrepreneurs and general members of civil society have decided to create a broad front to resist the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancún.
As you know, we are talking about a huge sales and sales center in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean with products from across the country, complemented by a residential area for employees of 150 companies.
In advance, the Canacintra (the National Chamber of Manufacturing Industry) has reached the goal of uniting the governors in the South East to resist the monumental institution that partly destroyed protected areas and represented the mother of all threats to industry.
ACTA is dead
Because the government of a Senate request to explain under which conditions and circumstances the Mexican ambassador in Japan signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement known under the English abbreviation ACTA has not complied, the matter has already been archived according to the Mexican Institute of Intellectual Property.
As you know, these measures were taken even though the Senate had ignored the possibility because it considered them to be a violation of the freedom of expression in the social networks.
Homex long term
In an effort to pay long-term liabilities without affecting the short-term liabilities, the construction company Homex will place over 500 million pesos certificates on the market.
The issue is the first of four same issues that promise an interest payment every 28 days.
Founding of Competival
Formed from NYCE, e-Quality and Coret, leading information technology companies, a group of companies was founded called Competival, whose goal is the service market of the software clusters in Central and South America.
This investment is over 1.5 billion dollars.
Héctor "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
The world trowel of the basketball, Héctor "Hetin" Reyes, has been connected to basket sports for more than 60 years and has traveled the whole world.
Few in Puerto Rico have as large a spiritual collection of the history of the country's basketball as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
Before being tied to the wheelchair by a stroke in 2008, Rexes was part of this sport for six years, whether as players of lower classes, players of the first national league, proxy and head of the BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or President of the Basketball Association.
"For my life I set up a lot of hats in basketball, even several at the same time when I was president of the BSN, head of the national team and president of the Federation in the 1990s," Reyes remembered when visiting Primera Hora at his home in Bayamón, where he lived with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes does not exaggerate with this statement.
The walls of his house are almost all decorated with photos and memories of his long career and testify to them.
Bayamón in the heart
The most emotional memories are those who remember at his time at the Vaqueros from the mid-50s as a player until 1982, where he celebrated his 15th anniversary as co-manager or managing director of the club.
"These were my best years that I enjoyed most, because since 1967 I was allowed to be part of eight of the Vaqueros Championships as managing director, co-manager or trainer.
There were many fulfilling years, including the five consecutive championships from 1971 to 1975.
And then I passed with a championship 1981, the year of the debut of Jerome Mincy at BSN.
From then on, "Cuco" took over Ortiz, who was a very good administrator," says Reyes.
I remember that Gene Bartow, who worked here as a coach and was employed at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said: "I have a very strong and 2 m big player.
Do you want him?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players that Puerto Rico ever had.
Bartow then recommended the freelance specialist Raymond Gousse, who had become a citizen and was one of our best throwers.
I remember how he said that if Mincy had enabled a championship for Bayamon, Gausse would take care of another one.
The Vaqueros Championship with Gausse was granted to him, but already out of a distance because he was already at the top of the Federation in 1988.
At that time he intended to enjoy his executions and those of Mincy in the national team.
I remember when we won for the first time at the previous Olympic tournament in Mexico against the USA.
Then came the 1990 World Championship, where we occupied the fourth place, which should have been bronze, if not this Canadian referee who had let us repeat the last move for the second time, Reyes said.
Was this group of the 1990 World Cup the best national team you've ever seen?
She is among the best, as well as those who won the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite is the team of the 1991 pan-American games in Cuba, where we won gold and offered the team of the USA a battle, as at the time, when they won against us at the bronze World Championship.
At that team not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and Piculin (Ortiz), but also the young players (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not be there for a knee injury in 1990.
A team that maybe wasn't the best in terms of personalities, but with whom we won a gold medal and which brought us great joy was that of the 1995 pre-olympic tournament in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitin as a substitute for the locked players because of the incidents on the Pan American games in Mar del Plata, we won the gold medal against any forecast.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
That was no doubt Piculin Ortiz.
His figures at the level of the international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated this level as Piculin.
And this, without taking into account his career in the different leagues in which he played.
Who was the best coach in Puerto Rico?
This is a difficult question.
We had a number of good coaches like Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
I like Leo Arill's work.
What do you think is the best thing you've achieved in the Federation?
I was part of the most successful era of the national team from 1988 to 1995, which included the BSN at the beginning of the 1990s up to 17 teams in one season.
What else are you doing?
There are things I would have introduced, such as the regionalisation of the lower categories.
That the boys in Ponce, for example, only play in their territory and first meet in the national playoffs on teams from other corners of the island.
Today the children make unnecessary many trips and games.
At least I see the result of the required trainings and courses for trainers, table officers and arbitrators.
I'm proud of that.
What are you doing today?
I like to hear music, watch videos of music of my time in YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and occasionally go to a basketball game.
And of course I enjoy the company of my wife Isabel, who was always with me.
Larry Hagman is dead
Larry Hagman was born on September 21, 1931 in Forth Worth (Texas) and became famous worldwide with his role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R." in the television series "Dallas", where he played a scrupulous, hideous and manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the J.R. Ewing oil magnate in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of the greed of the 80s, is dead.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who came back this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas", died on Friday afternoon due to cancer complications according to a family press release to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., producer of "Dallas".
"Larry was back in his beloved birthplace Dallas, where he once again played the iconic role that most liked him," said the family.
The family of Larry and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for the celebrations of the harvest Thanksgiving.
Linda Gray, who played the role of his wife in the original and follow-up series, was with Hagman when he died in the Dallas hospital, said her publicist Jeffrey Lane.
He made everyone who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, funny, loving and talented, and I will miss him very much.
"He was an original person and lived life fully," Gray explained in a communication.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992, and he admitted that he drank a lot over the years.
In 1995, a malignant tumour was detected in his liver, and he underwent transplantation.
In the years before "Dallas" Hagman became known on television as a nice guy in the years 1965 to 1970 with the Sitcom "Beautiful Jeannie" of the NBC television station.
There he played the astronaut Tony Nelson, whose life is put on his head when he met an attractive "jinn" (played by Barbara Eden), who will live with him at home.
He was also an actor of two comedies who were broadcast only for a short time, such as The Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His cinematographic works included well-rated roles in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his masterful interpretation of the enchantingly despicable J.R. who made Hagman a superstar.
The dramatic series of the CBS television chain over the Ewing-Clan and other figures in its surroundings was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The advertisement "Who shot at J.R.?", which was supposed to create expectation for an episode full of emotions, where the figure of Hagmann was almost killed, led to an international speculation, and millions of dollars were wagered in bet houses.
The series thus reached a audience record in that time.
When the answer became known in a chapter in November 1990, it was seen by an average of 41 million viewers who turned the "Dallas" into the second most-seen entertainment program since the end of "MASH" in 1983, which had 50 million viewers.
It was Kristin who had shot J.R.'s sister-in-law (interpreted by Mary Crosby).
J.R. had swayed her and threatened to represent her as a prostitute if she did not leave the city. But others also had reason to want to see him dead.
Hagman interpreted the role of Ewing as a corrupt, irresistible man with a charismatic smile: a retarded businessman and unfaithful husband who sought to have his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray) identified.
"I know what to do on J.R.'s gravestone," Hagman said in 1988.
It should be called "Here lies the honorable citizen J.R. Ewing".
This is the only business he didn't win.
Victoria Principal, co-star of the original series, remembered Hagman on Friday as a "noble personality on and outside the screen".
He is unforgettable and irreplaceable for millions of worshipers in the world and remains in our hearts, who have been lucky enough to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast with great success in the TV channel TNT a few months ago.
The recording of five chapters for the second season was completed, and a sixth chapter was just rotated, informed the station.
There was no immediate explanation by Warner or TNT about how the loss of Hagmann would be treated in the series.
Born in Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who played classic works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a youth when she got Larry during her marriage with lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck on the theatre stage in New York at the beginning of the 1950s, then served in the Air Forces in England from 1952 to 1956.
He met young designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in Malibu, California, where many celebrities live.
In 2001 he named his memoirs "Hello Darlin: Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
"I didn't write anything that I thought could hurt anyone or harm him in any way," said the Associated Press at the time.
After liver transplantation, he took up liver donation and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist elderly patients.
"I advise them, give them courage, I will meet with them when their operations begin and afterwards," he said in 1996.
I want to give them some consolation, such as "no fear, it's a little uncomfortable the first time, but you'll be fine".
He also opposed smoking and participated in several campaigns.
Beginning of the course that studies the "end of the world"
Every week, students examine apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, virus and germs, and global warming.
Every semester, when the professor of religion decided to take a course on the end of the world, he knew that he had an irresistible fishing hook: the end of the "long backward count" of the Maya calendar on December 21, of which many people believed it meant the end of the world.
But Charmé had no idea what he would expect in the following two months: the destructive Hurricane Sandy, some of whom have called "deudarmaggedon", as well as a growing conflict involving Israel, the place of which Christian theorists believe that the Apocalypse begins.
"I have not noticed that this will be the most apocalyptic semester that ever existed," said Charmé to the students at Rutgers-Camden University (New Jersey).
If someone were to analyze what happened in the world today as if we were thirty days away, this would be a really good period.
And he reminds us that the bad is good for those with apocalyptic mentality.
And he is not the only professor who offers courses on the "End of the World" this semester, which should actually be the last in history.
In Temple, Professor Barry Vacker gives the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World."
Every week, students examine apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, virus and germs, and global warming.
"We analyse why these ideas spread over time," he said, as well as how hypothetical scenarios are offered that lead to a certain human behavior.
For example, when nuclear material comes to the hands of terrorists, war could break out.
This month, the students analyzed films with apocalyptic content and investigated how they could be compared to real life.
"I have tried to inform the students about what is possible, probably, credible and impossible," said Vacker.
On the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, the professor of Latin American history Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an associate professor of art history and anthropology, have formed a team to offer a course with the simple title "The End of the World".
"We do not take up 2012 so that we always keep the option of being able to stop the course again, in case the world does not fall," said Restall.
Despite the "preliminary downfall", the students must study, create projects and participate in final exams.
In Penn State the final exam is conducted on the eve of the Apocalypse, which is why the students have no other chance than "to continue to work until night where the world supposedly ends," said Restall.
The courses were very popular.
"In two hours there were no more places," said Restall about his course for students with a high average who filled up with 35 students.
For weeks before the beginning of the semester, we received e-mails from students who asked if there were any free places.
The students, on the other hand, ensure that the course is one of the most interesting ones.
"It is fascinating to see what people are doing to comfort themselves," said Briggid Robinson, a 23-year-old student in Rutgers-Camden for religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey.
The apocalyptic sect or religious mentality is really just a matter of consolation or lack.
Twenty-five-year-old student Will Wekesa for psychology and nursing explains that he has seen all apocalyptic films.
"I never heard anything from a school where this is taught," he said.
I enjoy it.
But none of the students surveyed - and less than one professor - stated that they believed in the last date of December 21.
"Our first project dealt with the prophecy of the Maya, and in certain ways we discredit them," said Julie Zegelen, a student in Temple last year, aged 21 and from West Chester.
Mayas never predicted the end of the world; it's just a key point in the calendar, said Restall.
He notes, however, that in Western society there is an apocalyptic fear that dates back centuries when people responded to changes in their environment with the prediction of the end of the world.
The Internet has increased these speculations.
"Somewhere else people don't think so," he says.
This is the case mainly in the English speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at the University of La Salle, who teaches in the Philippines this year, quickly answers the question whether he would know a course there on the "End of the World".
"The Philippines do not participate in the end of the world," he wrote as an indication of an exception to a higher institution.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall pointed out that over the years many days were spoken by the last court, and said that if on 21 December nothing happened, "people immediately think of a new date" or philosophically that the 21st December was the beginning of a seven-year period after which the end of the world would come.
Students and professors take this date easily.
Several said they wanted to go to parties about "the end of the world".
"Maybe I'll call some friends so we can laugh together," said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old student for communication.
